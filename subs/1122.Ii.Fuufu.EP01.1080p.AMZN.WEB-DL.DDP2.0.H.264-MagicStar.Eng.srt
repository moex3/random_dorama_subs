THE CONSTITUTION OF JAPAN
ARTICLE 24

2
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:17,685
MARRIAGE SHALL BE BASED ONLY ON
THE MUTUAL CONSENT OF BOTH SEXES

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:21,105
AND IT SHALL BE MAINTAINED
THROUGH MUTUAL COOPERATION

4
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,150
WITH THE EQUAL RIGHTS
OF HUSBAND AND WIFE AS A BASIS.

5
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,123
Here.

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,458
Thank you.

7
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,586
Can I clean this up?

8
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,254
Please.

9
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,091
Sorry.

10
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,845
Did you take a bath, Ichiko?

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,972
Yes. Two days ago.

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,599
Wait, do I smell?

13
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,392
No, you're still good.

14
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,566
What do you want to do on the 22nd?

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,859
The 22nd?

16
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,695
-Why?
-It's our anniversary.

17
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,740
Our seventh year of marriage.

18
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:17,953
Where should we go?

19
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,790
Barbecue? Sushi? Italian?

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,083
I think I can take that day off.

21
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,712
But anyway,

22
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:31,509
this site I'm making for women is
all about marriage.

23
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,011
Your leg. That's improper.

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,179
Yes.

25
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,226
The survey of married couples is
a disaster.

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,104
For the question of
"What kind of existence is your husband?",

27
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,857
"Less than a pet" was
actually quite decent.

28
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:51,237
Some answered with "carbon dioxide,"
"ATM," and even "moth."

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,863
Really?

30
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,784
And it's common to not even talk
to their spouse for three days.

31
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,580
Isn't it a living hell to live
with so much dissatisfaction and scorn?

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,209
It's a contract they entered
of their own free will…

33
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,628
UNHAPPY COUPLES DON'T CELEBRATE
WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES

34
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,964
…so, why would they want
to stay married like that?

35
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,385
As a third party, you can't really know
what their relationship is like.

36
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,140
Otoyan.

37
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,684
-Yeah?
-That.

38
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,353
What's the round thing
in this week's arrangement?

39
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,438
Kumquat.

40
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,148
That thing for bug bites?

41
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,025
I like it. It's cute.

42
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,612
It seems kumquats have nothing to do
with the kinkan for bug bites.

43
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,822
What?

44
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,325
They say it means "gratitude"
in the flower language.

45
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,744
I see.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,038
Thanks.

47
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,755
It's weird to say it myself,

48
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,757
but we…

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,845
probably have a pretty happy marriage.

50
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,643
Okay. Give me one.

51
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,186
Here you go.

52
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,235
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

53
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,009
1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

54
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,012
MIDORI OSTEOPATHY

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,016
To summarize the concept you want,

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,685
the website for Midori Osteopathy

57
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,272
should focus on a warm
and friendly design.

58
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,649
Yes, exactly.

59
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,693
I really want to say

60
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,989
that you should catch the message
your own body is sending you.

61
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,326
Especially to the younger generation.

62
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,663
The bodies of women like you
who are too busy working are

63
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,456
crying in pain due to the stress.

64
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,249
You feel it, right?

65
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,334
Yeah…

66
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,004
Your face is so pale,
your eyes are dull and have no spark.

67
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,006
Really?

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,800
Excuse me for a moment.

69
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,767
Your pulse is weak.

70
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:28,852
And your fingers are cold.

71
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,064
It's covered by makeup,
but aren't your dark circles permanent?

72
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,608
You're stagnating.

73
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,153
With your job, you're always looking
at the computer, right?

74
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,739
And you're all hunched over.

75
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,200
The blood flow to your pelvis is sluggish,

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,661
so your womb
and lower body will be chilled.

77
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,289
It'll also affect your mental state.
It really isn't good.

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,500
Are you eating breakfast properly?

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,669
Yes, kind of.

80
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,257
You're probably only eating cold food
straight out of the fridge.

81
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,428
The squid ink dish is really good.

82
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,471
Yeah, it is.

83
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,557
-I like it.
-'Cause the dashi is different.

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,975
-Here's your order.
-Still--

85
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,852
Thank you.

86
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,479
Aren't you drinking too fast, Keikei?

87
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,482
Listen. My house is almost done.

88
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,528
Nice! The special custom-order home
in the middle of Tokyo everyone wants.

89
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,572
If it was only for the two of us.

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,407
You'll be living with your mother-in-law?

91
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,621
Yeah. Now every time I see her,
she'll say, "You can have kids anytime

92
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,582
now that our house has more space."

93
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,084
As if that will happen!
We aren't having sex at all.

94
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,837
The egg and sperm can't even meet.

95
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,507
Is she saying a stork is going
to deliver a baby

96
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,135
or one will come out of a peach
like Momotaro?

97
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,678
A no-sex conception?

98
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,472
"No-sex conception"?

99
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,724
What? Am I Saint Mary?

100
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,687
She gives me silk stomach warmers,
telling me to keep my uterus warm.

101
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,523
If she wants to see
her grandkids so badly,

102
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,569
then she should be giving
her son Cialis or Viagra.

103
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,154
So, medication is required?

104
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,323
Yes. He is ED.

105
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,992
-Oh, my God.
-Yes, yes.

106
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,369
And you, Ichiko? Still doing it?

107
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,954
No.

108
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,206
-Really?
-Yeah.

109
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,249
What about you, Tama?

110
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,004
It's been three months since I gave birth,
so we're waiting for the vulva to heal.

111
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,756
Get well soon.

112
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,760
-But can I ask a question?
-Go ahead.

113
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,680
What about your sex drive?
How do you deal with it?

114
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,015
All of a sudden?

115
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,308
I want to know.

116
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,228
-Can I go first?
-Of course.

117
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,480
As you all know,

118
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,191
-I have Okamura-chan and…
-We know.

119
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,986
Okamura-chan and, I guess, my dog.

120
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,446
Dog?

121
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,406
I get Okamura-chan, but…

122
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,784
Affection and lust are very similar.

123
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,371
I can fulfill my need for sex
if I shower my love onto something.

124
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,666
I have a baby, so I can understand.

125
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,042
-Right?
-Yeah.

126
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,461
But sex is sex.

127
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,797
I don't want to stop having sex
after getting married.

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,340
That's true.

129
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,801
And you, Ichiko?

130
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,054
Well, my sex drive

131
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,808
has always been a calm sea.

132
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,017
Calm sea?

133
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,979
What's a calm sea?

134
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,025
Like a quiet and peaceful water surface.

135
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:28,240
With barely a breeze. Sometimes a small
stimulation creates a ripple effect,

136
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,868
but it gets quietly absorbed
back into the water.

137
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,037
Ichiko's sex drive is very poetic.

138
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,164
Hee-hee.

139
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:40,460
But what about Otoya?
Is he okay with your calm sea?

140
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,757
Yeah. So far.

141
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,302
-What was that?
-You hesitated.

142
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,430
-I thought I hit a nerve.
-Sorry, sorry. It didn't mean anything.

143
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,764
You scared me.

144
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,936
But don't men have a lot of solutions?
Like going to brothels?

145
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,023
-Yeah.
-It's harder for women.

146
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:05,319
My coworker told me
about a secret beauty salon.

147
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,613
What do you mean? What's that?

148
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,574
It's a salon Miss A,
a friend of my coworker, goes to.

149
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,368
It's a little expensive,
but it has rave reviews.

150
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,581
There's a special massage that is
a secret option for members.

151
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,835
She said it's actually
a brothel for women.

152
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,545
No way!

153
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,757
No way. Isn't that just an urban legend?

154
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,802
But Miss A actually went and said
it was so good she fell in love with it.

155
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,889
So, how far do they go in that brothel?

156
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,474
Right? Don't you want to know?

157
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,435
It's categorized as a massage,
so the general rule is

158
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,897
they won't go all the way. But I hear
there are people who beg for it.

159
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,315
No way. They beg?

160
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,026
They're very selective
of the male therapists,

161
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,486
so they have avid fans.

162
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,321
Seriously?

163
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,822
What's the name of the place?

164
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,743
I think it was Eden?

165
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,203
Eden.

166
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,664
-Like paradise.
-Paradise?

167
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,251
-Or was it Flower Garden? Benzaiten?
-Hey!

168
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,337
It can't be Benzaiten.
What's with your memory?

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,800
But are you okay with it?
With your husband going to a brothel?

170
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,760
What do you married ladies say?

171
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,222
I think it's like a pseudo-romance.

172
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,308
If it gives him some relief and joy,

173
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,020
it could actually
make our marriage better.

174
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,940
-It adds some spice.
-Yeah, like spicing up the relationship.

175
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,609
It's much better than an affair
with real feelings.

176
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,069
Right.

177
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,612
Better than what Atsushi did.

178
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,863
You had to say it.

179
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,532
Atsushi Godai?

180
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,950
-Yeah.
-What happened with him?

181
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,910
You don't know? It was a while ago.

182
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't. What did he do?

183
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,329
He had an affair.

184
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:44,459
Did he? Well, he seems really popular.

185
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,129
But it's not exactly surprising, is it?

186
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,214
Was being sexless the cause?

187
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,301
I don't know that much.

188
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,844
Right. Anyway, we wouldn't know.

189
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,471
-Not like you can ask.
-Why did I even ask?

190
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,682
I see.

191
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,976
-That could be the reason.
-Right?

192
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,922
Since when was it a calm sea?

193
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,426
A year ago?

194
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,845
No, two years?

195
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,600
The last time I had sex was…

196
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,627
Good morning.

197
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,920
Morning.

198
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,714
Did you drink a lot?

199
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,300
Just a normal amount.

200
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,679
I can't drink as much anymore.
Since I'm getting old.

201
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,768
-Apparently…
-Yeah?

202
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,230
…I'm sluggish and stagnating.

203
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,566
And my eyes are dull.

204
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,610
Who said that?

205
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,947
My client. She's an osteopathic therapist.

206
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,449
Isn't she mean?

207
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,535
Very mean.

208
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,662
Here, drink some water.

209
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,913
Thanks.

210
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,960
So, Otoyan,

211
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,507
want to go to a hot spring
for our anniversary? And stay the night?

212
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,759
Wow, great idea.

213
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,347
I'll be late today,
so make sure to lock the door.

214
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,141
-It's Flower Day?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,518
Got it.

216
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:11,064
And if you feel like it, eat the simmered
lotus root in the fridge. Or it'll go bad.

217
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,232
Okay.

218
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,900
I'm off.

219
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,527
Have a good day.

220
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,618
That quilting…

221
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,121
He wore his favorite one.

222
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,301
MISS RUKI
BY FUMIKO TAKANO

223
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,682
Thursdays are Otoyan's Flower Days.

224
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,228
And today, the third Thursday
of the month,

225
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,314
is when he spends
the night with his lover.

226
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,393
Someone in our family is in love.

227
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,903
You scared me.

228
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,030
Good morning.

229
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,115
Good morning.

230
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,158
Do you want breakfast, Ichiko?

231
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,452
I'll eat later.

232
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,707
The salmon…

233
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,630
A person in love is
always blissfully shining.

234
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,387
This rice has a perfect texture.

235
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,973
I'm really good at making rice.

236
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,683
Or is it because it's the first crop?

237
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,643
The rice cooker did the actual cooking.

238
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,855
He's in a really good mood.

239
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,823
I grilled a salmon for you.

240
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,742
And so considerate.

241
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,289
Like he's truly alive.

242
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,875
Is this what they mean by "glowing"?

243
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,711
Do you have plans tonight?

244
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,049
I plan to work leisurely.
And there's one meeting.

245
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,307
Want to eat out? Let's go to that
Japanese place you were interested in.

246
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,060
Good idea. I'll make the reservation.
What time?

247
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,895
I'll see how things go and let you know.

248
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,271
Okay.

249
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:43,860
So, it gives relief and joy,
and could make our marriage

250
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,487
better?

251
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,991
This is so good. It makes me happy.

252
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,043
This place looks nice, right?

253
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,961
Yeah.

254
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,254
Pardon.

255
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,591
Here you are. This is the sashimi.

256
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,387
This is sea bream, tuna
and bigfin reef squid.

257
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

258
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,475
-Bigfin reef squid.
-Sea bream.

259
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,490
-Delicious.
-Yeah.

260
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,574
Delicious.

261
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,956
For the 22nd,

262
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,001
I found a nice place in Hakone.

263
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,920
This one.

264
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,882
It's an auberge,
and the hot spring looks really nice.

265
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,551
REVIEWS

266
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,302
The reviews are really good. See?

267
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,722
So I made a reservation.

268
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,559
-Ichiko.
-Yeah?

269
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,523
Can we go the week after instead?

270
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,817
What? Why?

271
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,697
Well…

272
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,493
You have a date?

273
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,872
Yeah.

274
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,957
Why? It's not a Thursday.

275
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,878
She had a conflict.

276
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,338
What conflict?

277
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,676
With her family and stuff.

278
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,428
What? Family?

279
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,513
Don't go, "What?"

280
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,725
No. It is a "What?" kind of situation.

281
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,895
She has a family matter?
Of course I'll go, "What?"

282
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,441
Then what am I?
I am your family, you know.

283
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,237
Is our family less important than hers?

284
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,239
That's not it.

285
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,159
Sorry, that was rude of me.

286
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,956
Hey, Otoyan,
aren't you getting sloppy these days?

287
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,293
It's like you're on top of the world.

288
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,588
You realize you're giving off vibes
of pure bliss?

289
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,340
What?

290
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,718
You have this longing look
whenever you look at your phone.

291
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,387
Really?

292
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,181
Yeah.

293
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,350
Didn't you promise

294
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,770
not to bring your extracurricular romance
into our home?

295
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,397
You're not breaking the rules, are you?

296
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,567
You're right.

297
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,237
Sorry, Ichiko. I'll be more careful.

298
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,410
Let me make it clear.
I'm not being jealous.

299
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,079
Yeah.

300
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,122
I know.

301
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,709
And I'm not being resentful.
This isn't about emotions, but the rules.

302
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,877
I understand.

303
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,589
Sorry. I'll make sure to fix the 22nd.

304
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,217
Yeah.

305
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:57,929
Okay.

306
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,515
Then this talk is over.

307
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
Yeah.

308
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,685
Okay.

309
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,158
This one is really good.

310
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,746
Wow.

311
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,004
Hot spring.

312
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,466
ELECASA NO YU

313
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,844
Auberge.

314
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,404
This isn't jealousy.

315
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,656
It isn't,

316
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:04,203
but an itchy, dark feeling is causing
ripples in my calm sea.

317
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,914
I'm certain of it.

318
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,285
Found it.

319
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,371
SHORT INTENSIVE 7-DAY DIET

320
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,957
We'll be doing cardio for ten minutes.

321
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,501
Let's warm up your body. Count!

322
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,419
Work it. Go. Go.

323
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,421
Now spin.

324
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,339
Come on.

325
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,132
Spin. Spin.

326
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:03,179
Focus from the top of your head to
the bottom of your feet in this warm up.

327
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,099
Here we go. Now raise your arms.

328
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,684
Tap to the left.

329
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,145
You're a butterfly now. Tap your toes.
Let's count.

330
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,855
Work it. Go.

331
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,565
Tap. Tap!

332
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,733
One more time.

333
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,196
-Wow. This is amazing.
-Wow.

334
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,699
What a beautiful auberge.

335
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,283
-It is.
-Right?

336
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,287
This is amazing.

337
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,289
-Beautiful, right?
-It's gorgeous, right?

338
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,749
I'm getting excited.

339
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,567
Otoyan.

340
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,110
What?

341
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,487
Thank you.

342
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,740
For what?

343
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,242
For this trip

344
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,495
and everything
in our seven years of marriage.

345
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,500
We both did our part.

346
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,545
To many more years to come.

347
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,258
To many more years.

348
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,291
That was a good bath.

349
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,423
Welcome back.

350
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,176
I'm back.

351
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,412
Wow, Otoyan.

352
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,540
Your skin is so smooth.

353
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,043
'Cause

354
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,712
I went in the hot spring.

355
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,220
And you smell really good.

356
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,932
Really?

357
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,396
What's wrong?

358
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,482
You're so stiff.

359
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,194
Ichiko.

360
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,447
Let's relax.

361
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,369
Ichiko!

362
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,082
Ouch.

363
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,126
Sorry.

364
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,044
My husband hurt me.

365
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,422
Sorry, Ichiko. Are you okay?

366
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,967
Not only did you refuse to have sex,
I also hit my head. This hurts.

367
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,760
Ichiko.

368
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,847
I'll post it on my socials
and ask everyone to repost it.

369
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,141
Ichiko. Put on your robe.

370
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,143
He said I'm ugly.

371
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,352
No, I didn't.

372
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:43,191
Then why did you reject me
with all your might? We're married.

373
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,110
Ichiko.

374
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,408
You know I have someone I like, right?

375
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:53,910
Yeah.

376
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,746
I know. So, what?

377
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,541
Wait, so I'm not the one Otoyan likes?

378
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,501
I like Ichiko too.

379
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,588
Then you can have sex with me.

380
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,256
It's not like you'll lose anything.

381
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,512
I will.

382
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:16,933
You will?

383
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,813
Ichiko.

384
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,651
Do you remember
when we stopped having sex?

385
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,029
I remember. Generally.

386
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,282
Even what you said to me?

387
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,785
What?

388
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,670
Otoyan.

389
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,091
Sorry.

390
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,929
I've been so tired lately.

391
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,056
So I don't really…

392
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,308
I see.

393
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,727
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,397
It's okay.

395
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,612
That's not how it went.

396
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,905
What?

397
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,032
That's not what I said?

398
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,909
It's not.

399
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,161
It was like this.

400
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,421
Otoyan.

401
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,926
Actually,

402
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,304
I can't bring myself

403
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,056
to do it these days.

404
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,437
You mean you're feeling sick?

405
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,356
No. My body is fine,

406
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,777
but I can't get in the mood
for things like sex.

407
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,572
Can't get in the mood?

408
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,657
What?

409
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,576
Is that the truth?

410
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,663
Otoyan, the two of us

411
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,041
get along really well,

412
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,918
and have no problem communicating,

413
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,005
so do we really need it? Sex?

414
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,923
Since we're a family.

415
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:17,762
I want to do it.

416
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,889
Even if we're family.

417
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,604
I see.

418
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,652
Then how about going to a brothel?

419
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,823
Can't you satisfy your urges
outside the house?

420
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,950
I'm really sorry about that.

421
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,081
Plus it's not like you're not popular
with the ladies.

422
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,341
Wasn't I horrible?

423
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,676
That's what I'm saying.

424
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,722
You didn't make it worse

425
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,808
with distorted or false memories?

426
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,059
Definitely not.

427
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,978
I remember it very clearly.

428
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,531
It should've been just sex.

429
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:24,161
But our relationship became
more complicated

430
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:28,541
as I ignored it just because
I found it annoying.

431
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,961
Otoyan.

432
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,257
Yeah?

433
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,557
Hug me.

434
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,444
Sure.

435
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,919
Is this the boomerang effect?

436
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:32,271
Okay, then please change
the color of the top page

437
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,400
and make the covers on the new release
page stand out more.

438
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,776
Understood.

439
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,820
I'll e-mail you later
about the schedule and fee.

440
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,030
Sure. Thanks.

441
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,281
Thank you so much!

442
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,782
Thank you.

443
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,369
We're getting positive feedback
about the site you made.

444
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,246
Really? That's good to know.

445
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,583
You gave a boring horticulture magazine
site a pop of personality.

446
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,085
It's easier to read it now.

447
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,253
Really?

448
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,005
Well, it's the same for me.

449
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,133
I didn't have a lot of projects
this month. You saved me.

450
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,303
Really? I thought you were busy.

451
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,638
No.

452
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,098
I'm barely getting by.

453
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,523
Ichiko, is everything okay?

454
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,693
You seem a little down.

455
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,697
-You can tell?
-Yeah.

456
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,993
Keikei.

457
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,330
Can you hear me out?

458
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,498
So it's serious.

459
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,250
Go ahead.

460
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,169
Actually…

461
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,423
Permission to have extramarital romance?

462
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,092
Yeah.

463
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,721
In other words, Otoya is
having an authorized affair?

464
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:52,142
I guess you can say it like that.

465
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,602
I never knew.

466
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,021
I never told anyone.
I thought you'd be repulsed.

467
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,440
I'm not repulsed by it.

468
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,693
But

469
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,529
I thought it was a reasonable solution.

470
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,906
Be a family at home
and enjoy love outside.

471
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,784
Don't say it like bean throwing
for Setsubun.

472
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,452
When did it start?

473
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,330
About a year ago, I think.

474
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,040
A year.

475
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,586
About the time when that outside love is
gushing out dopamine.

476
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,380
Yeah, it looks like he's
in a state of bliss.

477
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,923
Looks like?

478
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,426
Is his lover someone you know?

479
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,510
No.

480
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,306
You know…

481
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,520
the night I rejected
Otoyan's advances for sex,

482
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,941
it felt like I heard his heart breaking.

483
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,739
I'm back.

484
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,240
Welcome back.

485
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,247
I felt guilty when I saw
Otoyan looking a little sad.

486
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,294
And it was right when I started
freelancing and had so much work.

487
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:05,424
But in the end, I found it
too annoying to deal with.

488
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,810
When sex sunk to the bottom
of the ocean of our marriage,

489
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:22,107
right when peaceful days returned

490
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,942
like we never had any issues…

491
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,236
Ichiko.

492
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,031
I'll be late today, so go to bed first.

493
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,324
Okay.

494
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,534
I'm off.

495
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,827
Have a good day.

496
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,333
…Otoyan started taking

497
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,794
ikebana classes after work.

498
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,264
He was becoming happier day by day.

499
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,979
So when I finally confirmed it,

500
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,484
he had already stopped looking at me.

501
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,200
Hey, Otoyan.

502
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,871
Do you have

503
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,665
someone you like?

504
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,635
Yeah.

505
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:34,930
Is it mutual?

506
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,439
Maybe.

507
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,152
Sorry.

508
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,655
I was shocked.

509
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:56,493
But I thought I had no right
to be shocked.

510
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:57,995
It's okay.

511
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,290
It's not something
you should apologize for.

512
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,084
I was the one who said

513
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,171
you're quite popular, and that
you should find someone outside.

514
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,133
You don't need to apologize or hide it.

515
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,721
Don't you hate lying?

516
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,223
Yeah.

517
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,561
Instead,

518
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,354
let's set some rules.

519
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,523
Rules?

520
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,275
Yeah.

521
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,152
What's good?

522
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,031
You don't have to lie or hide it,

523
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,159
but don't let it show at home.

524
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,703
And I won't pry either.

525
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,080
Yeah.

526
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,125
What else?

527
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,257
This was the result.

528
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,095
The result of me not making
an effort to meet Otoyan's desires.

529
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,431
So I decided.

530
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:03,519
I won't ignore his feelings this time.

531
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,859
And are you okay with that?

532
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,739
I thought I was.

533
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,576
But lately, I've been feeling uneasy.

534
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,495
Of course you would.

535
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,164
You're human.
You'll have feelings about it.

536
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,585
I thought the trust and respect
we have for each other

537
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:32,965
was more important than
a temporary moment of lust.

538
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,134
Maybe I was naive.

539
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:40,848
You can't underestimate the passion,
assumptions and emotional highs of love.

540
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,935
Even if it is all
an illusion created by the mind.

541
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,523
People have self-destructed, gone crazy,
and died due to those illusions.

542
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,484
No, I don't want that.

543
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,576
-We took a small trip for our anniversary.
-Yeah.

544
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,828
Spent a night at a hot spring.

545
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,912
Okay.

546
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,584
That night, he rejected me.

547
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,711
Why?

548
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,172
He said, "You know I have
someone I like, right?"

549
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,883
What? Is that how it'll be?

550
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:21,054
So you two won't be having sex
as long as he's having an affair?

551
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,808
I think that's how it'll be. Right?

552
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,644
But we get along really well.

553
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,438
Aren't things getting complicated?

554
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,567
Then what about your calm sea?

555
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,153
Are you feeling any waves?

556
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:43,368
Then it's not a calm sea anymore.

557
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,829
But

558
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,665
if we'll be sexless for my entire life,

559
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,001
then that's kind of lonely.

560
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,842
But doesn't that permission to have
an extramarital romance

561
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,594
also apply to you?

562
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,931
What? Yeah.

563
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,392
It was a joke. A joke.

564
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,279
This is definitely going to be tasty.

565
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,364
Yeah.

566
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,951
Shrimp, perilla leaves and lotus root?

567
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,203
Yeah. And this one is

568
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,540
pork, cilantro and bamboo shoots.

569
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,257
-That's a good sound.
-That's a good sound.

570
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,974
I'm going to try this one.

571
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,317
Isn't the bamboo good?

572
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,695
-It gives it a good texture.
-Yeah.

573
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,238
-This one's a hit.
-Yeah.

574
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,740
-But…
-Ichiko is a genius.

575
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,951
I am, aren't I? I can't pick
which one's better.

576
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,036
This one's good too.

577
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,579
-The shrimp is yummy too.
-Really.

578
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,059
Your phone is ringing.

579
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,979
Yeah. It's okay.

580
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,819
Do you want the last shrimp dumpling?

581
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,364
No. It's fine. I'm full.

582
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,136
Thanks for the meal.

583
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,262
You're welcome.

584
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,001
Hello, Mitsuki?

585
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,049
Yeah.

586
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,383
I was eating dinner.

587
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,721
It was dumplings. And you?

588
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:06,404
But doesn't that permission to have
an extramarital romance

589
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,406
also apply to you?

590
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,291
It's true that it also applies to me.

591
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,335
But

592
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,464
if both the husband and wife did it,

593
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,051
what would be the point of us

594
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,719
staying married?

595
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,495
Welcome.

596
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,376
-Atsushi.
-It's been a while.

597
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,211
Long time no see. Sorry to ask you out.

598
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,548
No worries. I'll always
accept your invitation.

599
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,967
Where should I sit? There?

600
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,100
Oh, right, Ichiko.

601
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,480
A special exhibit starting
this month at my museum.

602
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,445
He's a young artist
making things like these.

603
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,530
So pretty.

604
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,365
I thought you'd like it.

605
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,075
Why don't you come see it?

606
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,744
Sure. I will.

607
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,288
Can I order?

608
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,372
Of course.

609
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,333
Do you have any bar snacks?

610
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,417
Yes.

611
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,711
We have dry fruits…

612
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,421
Dry fruits.

613
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,590
-…and mixed nuts.
-Mixed nuts sound good.

614
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,845
Atsushi and I were in the same
art club in college.

615
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,807
We've known each other for a long time,
and know each other's preferences.

616
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,312
I'm not attracted to him,
but he is kind of hot.

617
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,316
We probably both like each other
in a broad sense of the word.

618
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,194
His looks and our relationship

619
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,321
make him qualified.

620
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,490
So, what's going on?

621
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,244
Since you called me out of the blue.

622
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,079
Oh, right.

623
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,707
So,

624
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,710
I'll be direct and ask.

625
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,383
Have you ever had an affair?

626
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,970
-Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

627
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,224
I heard about it.

628
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,273
My husband is having one.

629
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,233
-Really?
-Yeah.

630
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,777
And I needed a friend

631
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,738
to talk about it with.

632
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,659
If you say it that way,

633
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,997
I'm a friend who had an affair
that ended last year.

634
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,918
So you're Mr. Done With My Affair.

635
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,461
Yes.

636
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,172
-Here's your order.
-Thanks.

637
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,301
-Actually…
-Yeah?

638
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,928
…she was my classmate from high school.

639
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,096
From Shizuoka.

640
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,099
We met again due to work,

641
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,476
and kept bumping into each other.

642
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,146
One time,

643
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,399
we were both reading
the same book on the train.

644
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,359
I was so surprised.

645
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,195
That is surprising.

646
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,576
We had the same hobbies,

647
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,287
and I had so much fun just talking to her.

648
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:48,126
They believe their own past loves
are special and unique.

649
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,088
I wondered if my fated love
wasn't my wife,

650
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:55,425
but this woman instead.

651
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:59,679
These cheating men really spew
a whole load of bullshit

652
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,056
in a sad and romantic manner.

653
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,894
Since she wanted to get married
and have kids…

654
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,980
I thought Otoyan was different,

655
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,399
but maybe I was wrong?

656
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,567
…shouldn't

657
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:17,739
waste any more of her life.

658
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,493
A sleazebag of a friend.

659
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:25,205
Which makes him perfect.

660
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,582
Hey, Atsushi.

661
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,666
Yeah?

662
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,046
Want to go to a hotel after this?

663
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,679
Me?

664
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:42,931
Yeah.

665
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,899
What's wrong?

666
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,986
Are you okay? I didn't think
you'd be in so much pain.

667
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,446
No, that's not it.

668
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,242
I'm ready to go.

669
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,829
To be honest,

670
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:12,001
I thought, "Wow. For real? Lucky, yay."

671
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,461
"Yay?"

672
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,671
However…

673
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:16,381
However.

674
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,096
…it's dangerous for me right now.

675
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,016
What? How creepy.

676
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,185
I'm not bluffing.

677
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,854
That affair I was talking about,

678
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,524
it ended when my wife found out.

679
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,735
What? You made it sound

680
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,904
like you ended things neatly.

681
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,823
I skipped over some details.

682
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,034
After that, she's been spying on me.

683
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,873
She knows everywhere
I've been to in a single day

684
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,750
in real time.

685
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:54,294
What?

686
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,171
-Right? Isn't it scary?
-Yeah.

687
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,922
Isn't that dangerous?

688
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,926
She probably put

689
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,804
one of those professional GPS trackers

690
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:08,183
used by private detectives on me.

691
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:13,980
Don't get creeped out.

692
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:18,026
Doesn't that mean she might be
listening to our conversation?

693
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,404
She's not. It's just my location, so far.

694
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,325
And she's okay with me seeing my friends.

695
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,662
Since my work puts me in situations
where I'm alone with women a lot.

696
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,372
But

697
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:36,836
if I went to a hotel with a friend,
then we'll be sex friends. Right?

698
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,005
Then I'd get beaten up.

699
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,673
Beaten?

700
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,300
Up.

701
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:47,013
My wife has a fifth degree black belt
in aikido. In high school,

702
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:51,684
she twisted the arm
of a molester so badly,

703
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,353
he cried.

704
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,439
That's a heroic tale.

705
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,536
Atsushi.

706
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,789
You really like your wife.

707
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,749
Me? You think so?

708
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,670
You do. You know it too, don't you?

709
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,046
I wonder.

710
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,966
I'm not so sure about myself.

711
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,135
I'm currently

712
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,639
rebuilding our marriage.

713
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,017
So I'm sorry.

714
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,196
And one more thing.

715
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,993
I'd really regret it if you and I did

716
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,788
something like that

717
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,586
and it destroyed our current relationship.

718
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:05,842
Don't--

719
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,387
Don't say that while holding my hand.

720
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:11,723
Oops.

721
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,391
Oops.

722
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:19,772
I want to believe sex wouldn't
change anything

723
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,109
since we're both adults.

724
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,947
But something definitely changes
once you do it.

725
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,826
You're right.

726
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,538
That's true.

727
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,011
Why did you choose me anyway?

728
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,060
It was the result of my comprehensive
evaluation and assessment.

729
00:48:58,478 --> 00:48:59,562
Was I the first?

730
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,606
Does that have a special meaning?

731
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,233
No, it felt like it.

732
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,111
I see.

733
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,198
So it was calculated.

734
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,202
But that still makes me happy.

735
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,832
This is my treat.

736
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,168
-In fact, let me treat you.
-Why?

737
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,173
But if it's on you,
then I'm going to order more.

738
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,508
Go ahead.

739
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,636
Do you have other foods?

740
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,931
I'm home.

741
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,779
I'm home.

742
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,990
Welcome back.

743
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,410
Didn't you say you'd be out late?

744
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,372
That's what I thought,
but I came home before midnight.

745
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,166
And you? Did you just get home?

746
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,334
Yeah.

747
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,589
That's a pretty flower.

748
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,049
What's it called?

749
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,510
Anthurium.

750
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,098
It means a "heart in agony due to love"
in the flower language.

751
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,954
OTOYA AIHARA
WHAT TIME WILL YOU BE HOME?

752
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,457
STILL, I'LL MAKE
THE LAST TRAIN HOME

753
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,376
OKAY.
DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH

754
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,588
DIDN'T I SAY YOU WERE SPEWING
AN AURA OF PURE BLISS?

755
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,842
AND I DIDN'T EVEN ASK ABOUT
THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER.

756
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,645
In my 35th year of life,
I fully understand.

757
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,649
Anger and sadness shouldn't be thrown
at your partner.

758
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,946
In moments like this, I need to
quietly ask myself:

759
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:21,704
Ichiko, what do you want to do?

760
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:46,020
You scared me.

761
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,981
Don't look at me like I'm a weirdo.

762
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,943
Sorry. I was zoning out.

763
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,363
You should also go to bed now too.

764
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,866
I…

765
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,285
Your period is done, right?

766
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,914
I still have dishes to wash

767
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,791
and Hiro's things to prepare for tomorrow.

768
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,168
You can do that in the morning.

769
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,555
Hiro's been crying a lot at night.

770
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,474
I'll look after him, so go sleep first.

771
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:25,852
Mama!

772
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,105
Mama!

773
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,440
Hiro.

774
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,735
-Mama's here.
-Mama!

775
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,488
-Come here.
-Mama.

776
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,162
It's okay, Hiro.

777
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,211
You don't need to stop crying.

778
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,472
Mama!

779
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,642
Mama!
