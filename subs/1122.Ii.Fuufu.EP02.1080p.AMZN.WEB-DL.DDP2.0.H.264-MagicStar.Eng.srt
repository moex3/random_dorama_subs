1
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,148
That night at the hotel

2
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,067
we went to for our wedding anniversary…

3
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,239
when I was hugging Ichiko as she slept,

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,116
I kept thinking about…

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,662
Butcher.

6
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,627
When winter came around,

7
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,422
Butcher would crawl
into my bed every night.

8
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,885
And I would fall asleep
hugging that large body.

9
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,972
I definitely felt love and affection

10
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,558
in her warmth,

11
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,728
but that love and affection

12
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,440
are far removed from any feelings
of desire or arousal.

13
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,446
Her warmth calmly soothed away my desire.

14
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,995
Sorry I made you wait, Otoya.

15
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:19,997
Hey.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,208
-Excuse me, I'd like a beer.
-Sure.

17
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,211
Looks like you're okay, Tohko.

18
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,588
What? I guess so.

19
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,632
Mom was worried about you.

20
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,550
It was hard right after things ended.

21
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,386
We'd been together
since I was 20, after all.

22
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,598
That's half your life.

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,850
Here's your beer.

24
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:40,976
Thank you.

25
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,856
Even so, we were pretty horrible
to each other towards the end.

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,483
I was so relieved when we divorced.

27
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,280
Then here's to
making it through in one piece.

28
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,032
Thanks.

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,450
Bottoms up.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,874
Delicious.

31
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,794
Excuse me, can you take my order?

32
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:11,257
Let's see. One marinated octopus,
the boiled squid in ink,

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,968
and one simmered tripe, please.

34
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,179
And the two of you? No change?

35
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,181
Yeah, that's right.

36
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,268
-Is Ichiko doing well?
-Yes. She told me to say hi for her.

37
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,936
She said she'll go to the memorial.

38
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,396
Okay.

39
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,147
Oh, right.

40
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,234
Take a look at this.

41
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,946
This was when I sent her
that watermelon in the summer.

42
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,448
Wow, look at Ichiko's carving.

43
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,576
She loved watermelons,
so she was so happy.

44
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,621
But doesn't Ichiko look like a mess?

45
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,541
She probably thought this was
the best photo of the watermelon.

46
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,959
Plus she spent all night on it.

47
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,213
I really like this part of her.

48
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,965
Yeah.

49
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,842
Me too.

50
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,468
Look at you bragging.

51
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,266
The two of you really look like
you're happily married.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,649
Thank you for waiting.

53
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,068
Thank you. It looks good.

54
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,323
It's a call from Ichiko's mom.

55
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,074
Why is she calling you?

56
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,452
There are some things.
I'm going to answer it.

57
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,790
Hello? Yes.

58
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,626
Thanks for the food.

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
Okay, all right.

60
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,759
What?

61
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,928
Are you okay?

62
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,473
All right.

63
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,520
Okay, I'll call Ichiko right away.

64
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,569
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

65
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,524
1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

66
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:40,698
I feel it. This cold and dry air.

67
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,119
It's a nice place.
It's quaint and nostalgic.

68
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,081
How long has it been
since you've been back?

69
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,419
A year and a half, I think?

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,757
I hope she didn't hurt herself too badly.

71
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,468
It's so inconvenient to be in a cast.

72
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,643
Thanks for coming with me, Otoyan.

73
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,629
We've arrived.

74
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,381
Time to go, huh?

75
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,982
How are you feeling, Mom?

76
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,818
Here and there and everywhere,

77
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,154
it's all bad.

78
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,075
I keep bumping this cast into things,

79
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,368
and it's so tight and painful.

80
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,538
The wind is too strong and my back hurts,

81
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:15,417
so I can't even walk to the hospital.

82
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,627
What about a taxi?

83
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,214
That's such a waste of money.

84
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,717
I'm fine like this. It's okay.

85
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,138
Mother,

86
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:33,060
we made lunch. Would you like some?

87
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,153
Wow, how pretty.

88
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,738
It's a rice sandwich.

89
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,908
Ichiko made it because
it's easy to eat with one hand.

90
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,952
Well.

91
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,705
Then I'll have one.

92
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,583
Here.

93
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,427
You truly are kind, Otoya.

94
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,222
The complete opposite of him.

95
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,853
You're hardworking, not intimidating,

96
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,606
and so polite.

97
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,191
You truly are.

98
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,277
You even do housework.

99
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,947
Ichiko, you really caught yourself
a good husband.

100
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,867
Don't say I caught him.

101
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,119
That man

102
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:37,166
truly thought of his wife as a servant.

103
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,335
He would get drunk when stressed

104
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,962
and get violent.

105
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,590
Even that hole.

106
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,050
He made it when he threw the kettle.

107
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,387
I dodged it so I didn't get hurt,

108
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,098
but I could have been badly burned.

109
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,895
Why don't you patch that hole?
Actually, why not replace the whole thing?

110
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,231
I can still use it. It would be a waste.

111
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,859
-I'll pay for it.
-I said it's fine.

112
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:09,865
Don't you hate living with and seeing
the marks of his abuse every single day?

113
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,995
Here we go again.

114
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,541
The way you talk and look at me.

115
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,920
It's just like him.

116
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,963
How scary.

117
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,760
I can't help it. I'm his child.

118
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,765
I know he's an abusive scumbag,

119
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,851
but half of my genes are his.

120
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,520
But that isn't my fault.

121
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,566
You're lucky.
You're not related to him by blood.

122
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,401
And he's already dead.

123
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,198
Wasn't it your choice to live with it
instead of trying to make things better?

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,451
Ichiko.

125
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,872
I didn't catch the kind Otoya.

126
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,834
I choose this life
and work hard to maintain it.

127
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,544
-You understand?
-Ichiko.

128
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,216
She's always been like this.

129
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,052
Treating me badly.

130
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,722
Strong-willed,

131
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,141
always criticizing me,

132
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,478
and blaming me. Just like her father.

133
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,314
It must be hard for you, Otoya.

134
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,529
Why don't I get you a cup of tea?

135
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,447
I bought some mooncakes.

136
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,783
Ichiko said you like them.

137
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,622
Making tea for me. How nice of you.

138
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,336
Ichiko taught me
how to do all the housework.

139
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,589
Like how to fold laundry,

140
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,341
and wrap dumplings.

141
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,928
And how to make tea.

142
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,810
Ichiko is a smart, honest,
and cheerful woman.

143
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,438
So living together with her is fun.

144
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,651
I'm happy to be married to her.

145
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,089
-Here.
-Thanks.

146
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,062
Otoyan.

147
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,775
Thank you.

148
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,695
No need.

149
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,286
You know…

150
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,710
I haven't talked about it much,

151
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,089
but can I tell you about my childhood?

152
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,718
Sure.

153
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,901
When I…

154
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,197
was a kid,

155
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,950
I had pediatric eczema.

156
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,704
When it was really bad,

157
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,165
my underwear, blankets, and stuff

158
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,044
would be all covered in
dead skin and body fluids.

159
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,591
She would

160
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,303
make me wash everything

161
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,888
by myself.

162
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,186
And yell at me if I started scratching.

163
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,359
She barely ever held my hand.

164
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,160
At night,

165
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,707
my dad, drunk, would sometimes hit her.

166
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,294
I was so scared

167
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,882
I couldn't even sleep. The next day…

168
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,260
Mom would tell me…

169
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,977
I was cruel and heartless
for not coming to her rescue.

170
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,273
All the time.

171
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,618
I hate this house.

172
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:11,124
It pulls me back to
the weak and hurt kid I used to be.

173
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,844
My mom never treated me nicely…

174
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,976
so I can't bring myself to be kind
to her just because she's weaker

175
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,730
now that I've grown up.

176
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,783
You did your best, Ichiko.

177
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,912
You're amazing.

178
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,584
I…

179
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,631
can never be her caregiver.

180
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,094
Even now, I just want to smack her.

181
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,099
You don't have to.

182
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,603
I don't?

183
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,401
If it ever comes to that,

184
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,863
let's think of a way
that makes things easy for you.

185
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,576
Plus you've got me.

186
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,164
Thank you.

187
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,885
I hate my mom.

188
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,896
But I feel sorry for her.

189
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,654
You have a kind heart.

190
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,075
I know you do.

191
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,167
I…

192
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,756
hate this house I was born in

193
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,136
and the mother who gave birth to me…

194
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:36,227
but I'm really happy you are
the family I chose to have.

195
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,776
I think your child would be very happy.

196
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,501
But we're…

197
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,713
in a special situation right now.

198
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,549
Right?

199
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,343
Yeah.

200
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,679
We are.

201
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,602
All right.

202
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,106
Why don't we all go for lunch?
My treat today.

203
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,273
Really?

204
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,109
-Thank you.
-Thanks for treating us.

205
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,111
I'll have to pass.

206
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,406
-I brought lunch.
-From your wife?

207
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,740
No, I made it myself.

208
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,575
What? Why?

209
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,993
It's fun.

210
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,078
I see.

211
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,497
-You don't cook?
-Nope, never.

212
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,084
You're the type to take
paternity leave, aren't you?

213
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,129
Men also have the right
to take leave, you know.

214
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,800
I didn't mean it that way.

215
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,231
MITSUKI KASHIWAGI
SWEET DREAMS

216
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,525
GOOD NIGHT

217
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,652
YOU TOO, OTOYA
GOOD NIGHT

218
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,781
AN ELEPHANT IN THE SKY

219
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,200
IT REALLY IS AN ELEPHANT!

220
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,329
LUNCH BREAK?

221
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,261
YEAH, I MADE MY OWN LUNCH TODAY

222
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,680
WOW
AMAZING!

223
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:33,988
I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU MADE!

224
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:38,576
MORNING SUN NURSERY
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

225
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,662
THEN I'LL MAKE US
A LUNCH BOX NEXT TIME

226
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,248
SO LET'S GO EAT IT SOMEWHERE

227
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,047
Mama!

228
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,257
Hiro.

229
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,092
Hiro.

230
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,012
Go home.

231
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,098
Let's change our shoes.

232
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,434
Can you sit here?

233
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,980
Okay. Thank you for today.

234
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,150
He put on his jacket all by himself today.

235
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,652
He did?

236
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,404
Be sure to give him lots of compliments.

237
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,989
-Of course.
-Go home.

238
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,365
Mrs. Kashiwagi,

239
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,534
-his water bottle.
-Oh, sorry.

240
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,618
Thank you.

241
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,703
Hiro.

242
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,789
-Goodbye.
-Hiro, say, "bye-bye."

243
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,210
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

244
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,379
Let's go.

245
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,353
Here I go.

246
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,901
Hiro, should we play on the slide?

247
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,820
-Okay.
-Hiro.

248
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,572
I'm throwing it.

249
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,407
-Hiro.
-Stop!

250
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,533
Stop it!

251
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,578
Hiro, you can't. Give it back. Hiro.

252
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,829
Momo.

253
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,665
I'm so sorry.

254
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,295
-Hiro, you need to say sorry.
-He surprised you, huh?

255
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,839
Say you're sorry, Hiro.

256
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,468
Hiro.

257
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,305
I wanna go home.

258
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,973
Sure, let's go home.

259
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,391
Come on.

260
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,062
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

261
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,438
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

262
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,190
-Bye-bye.
-Are you okay?

263
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,150
Should we go there to play?

264
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,736
-Let's play over there.
-Okay.

265
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,992
HIRO

266
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,211
MOTHER-IN-LAW

267
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,715
It's really yummy.

268
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,436
Say, "ah."

269
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,314
-Just one bite.
-No!

270
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,486
Hiro. Here, "ah."

271
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,447
Hey.

272
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,703
Hiro.

273
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,499
-Play after you eat.
-We are not home right now.

274
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,670
Please leave your message after the beep.

275
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,882
Hello, Mitsuki?

276
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,137
It's Yoko. Did you get my text?

277
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,557
The guru will be speaking
in Tokyo next week.

278
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,018
I had them reserve seats in the front row,

279
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,229
so please take Hiro with you.

280
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,482
She was kind enough
to waive the entrance fee

281
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,027
for this lecture. She is so…

282
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,384
Hello?

283
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,635
Hi.

284
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,262
Can you talk?

285
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,556
Yeah, I have time.

286
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,476
Sorry for calling you.

287
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,563
I wanted to hear your voice.

288
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,025
Mitsuki,

289
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,235
how are you doing?

290
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,738
Yeah.

291
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,574
I'm fine.

292
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,955
Hey,

293
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,999
do you want to go out somewhere tomorrow?

294
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,458
With Hiro.

295
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,252
What do you think?

296
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,089
But Hiro might make a scene.

297
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,718
Let's go somewhere
where it's okay if he does.

298
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,054
The forecast says
there is a 0% chance of rain tomorrow.

299
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,143
Sure.

300
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,866
Otoya.

301
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,705
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

302
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,292
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

303
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,377
Hiro, this man is Otoya.

304
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,004
Can you say, "Hi"?

305
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,050
Wait, Hiro!

306
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,721
Hiro.

307
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,307
Oh, here.

308
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,772
Are you playing?

309
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,944
You're good at this, Mitsuki.

310
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,738
Here it comes, Hiro!

311
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,789
Ta-da.

312
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,958
Wow.

313
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,001
Look, Hiro.

314
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,087
It's your favorite. Hamburg steak.

315
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,839
Now,

316
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,384
-thanks for the food.
-Thanks for the food.

317
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,305
Which one do you want to eat?

318
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,432
The Hamburg steak?

319
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,351
Okay.

320
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,562
-Open wide.
-Will he eat it?

321
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,819
-It's yummy.
-Yummy?

322
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,577
I made it a little too big.

323
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,664
Looks like it's okay.

324
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,044
You should eat too, Mitsuki.

325
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,462
I will.

326
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,508
Then I'll have the sandwich.

327
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,219
Me too.

328
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,520
-It's good.
-Thank goodness.

329
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,790
I think Hiro really enjoyed himself today.

330
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,084
That's good.

331
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,547
And you?

332
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,052
Was it a good break for you?

333
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,598
A very good break.

334
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,650
He's already four,

335
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,364
but they said he has a development delay
of over a year in various areas.

336
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,786
That's why I put him in
specialized education early.

337
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:47,208
My husband thinks childcare
is entirely my responsibility,

338
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,169
and my mother-in-law

339
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,506
believes something made him this way.

340
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,216
She keeps nagging me

341
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,011
to take him to this fortune teller
she's obsessed with

342
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,679
instead of the special classes.

343
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,230
I know I have no choice

344
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,275
but to do all the research,
consider all the options,

345
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,531
and make the decisions myself. However…

346
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,662
sometimes I just feel like giving up.

347
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,963
Sorry. I didn't mean to complain.

348
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,777
The response was
more positive than last time.

349
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,405
Yes. I hope things continue like this.

350
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,282
It's our job to make sure it does.

351
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,450
Yes, sir.

352
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,162
Are you going back to the office?

353
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,748
What's wrong?

354
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,584
Mr. Kashiwagi?

355
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,295
See you again, Hiro. Bye-bye.

356
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,963
Hiro, say "Bye-bye."

357
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,094
Is it someone you know?

358
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,762
Yeah.

359
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,157
Welcome back.

360
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,450
I'm home.

361
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,100
Shiro,

362
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:15,689
there's a dinner after the ikebana class
next week. Is it okay if I go?

363
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,692
I'll take Hiro to my mother's.

364
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,528
Sure.

365
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,446
Thank you.

366
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,705
Mitsuki.

367
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,042
What did you do today?

368
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,546
Today?

369
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,717
The weather was nice,
so I took Hiro to the park.

370
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:48,305
So it was you. I thought I saw someone
that looked like you when I was out.

371
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,561
You did? You could have said hi.

372
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,397
No, you were across the road.

373
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,399
Near the entrance?

374
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,152
Yeah. Looked like you had a lot of fun.

375
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,496
Who was that guy you were with?

376
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,462
We ran into someone from the flower class.

377
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,841
I think he lives around there.

378
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,511
I see. The flower class.

379
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,016
Why don't you invite them over?
Everyone from the class.

380
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,684
I'd like to meet them.

381
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,769
I can't do that.

382
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,355
Why?

383
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,650
The preparations and cleanup
would be too much for me.

384
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,611
What if you get it catered?

385
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,363
I know someone
who runs a catering company.

386
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,907
I hear the food
both looks and tastes good.

387
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,826
Thank you.

388
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,873
But I think everyone would feel awkward
coming to my house and meeting you.

389
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,167
It's more comfortable
to split the bill at a diner.

390
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,840
Besides, you tend to judge
my friends pretty harshly.

391
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,176
Judge?

392
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,927
You say things like,

393
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,347
"that girl is a bit ugly,
but she has a nice smile,"

394
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:16,310
or "the way he eats and holds
his chopsticks is a mess."

395
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:21,774
Isn't the first one a compliment
and the second one simply the truth?

396
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,361
I never asked you to do that.

397
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,115
Anyway, I won't be inviting them over.

398
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:31,784
All right.

399
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,834
But, Shiro,

400
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,254
I want to talk about your mother.

401
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,757
What about her?

402
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,887
She said she wants that guru
to have a reading with Hiro.

403
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,264
I've told her no many times.

404
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:58,519
Now she says
Hiro doesn't need to go for a reading,

405
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:02,189
but we should go to
that guru's talk and give our greetings.

406
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,611
I understand she's worried about him.

407
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,697
And?

408
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,450
I want you to tell her.

409
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,036
We will not have
anything to do with that guru.

410
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,706
Wasn't that what we decided on
from the beginning?

411
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,834
That's right.

412
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,674
But this is about Hiro, isn't it?

413
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,052
Aren't you in charge of raising him?

414
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,936
Did I say something wrong?

415
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:47,151
But aren't you his father?

416
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,779
I am. That's why I work to make money.

417
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,157
That is my role.

418
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,704
I'm very grateful to you.

419
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,081
You're doing something I can't.

420
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,251
That's why I left the special classes
and support up to you.

421
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,296
I'll spare no expense

422
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,964
if it's for Hiro.

423
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:14,219
And you can just let my mother
say whatever she wants.

424
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,971
She doesn't know any better.

425
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:21,101
Make two or three templates
and use them to respond to her.

426
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,937
Since you're a good mother.

427
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,698
Mama!

428
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,117
Mama!

429
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,912
Look, he's calling for you. Go to him.

430
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,456
Mama!

431
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,874
You go.

432
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,376
It's impossible for me.

433
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,212
You already know that.

434
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,632
Mama!

435
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,135
Mama!

436
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:20,285
ATELIER IKKA

437
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,370
Everyone.

438
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:26,583
The calla lily has
beautiful and dignified lines,

439
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,087
so it can be used in place
of branches like that.

440
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:35,634
Let's arrange it so it can stand
comfortable and free in its space.

441
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,094
-Yes.
-Yes.

442
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,807
That looks great.

443
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,956
Sorry I made you wait.

444
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,127
Wow, this is gorgeous.

445
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,880
Like it came out of a magazine.

446
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,590
What an exaggeration.

447
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,051
You're so busy,
it must have been hard to make this.

448
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,347
I was happy you made
lunch for me that day.

449
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,975
Besides, I'm a housewife.

450
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,394
Housewives have lots to do.

451
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,647
Like chores for all three of you,

452
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,315
and taking care of Hiro.

453
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,192
Thanks for the food.

454
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,788
Delicious.

455
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,881
Otoya, you're a really nice person.

456
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,436
Otoya,

457
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:56,900
we should probably be more careful
when we go out in public.

458
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,278
Did something happen?

459
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,405
Yeah.

460
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,783
My husband said he saw us together

461
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,036
that day we went to the park.

462
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,005
Isn't that bad?

463
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,465
No.

464
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,053
It was when we were saying bye
outside the park,

465
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:29,224
so I told him I ran into someone
from the ikebana class.

466
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:34,187
I just thought we were getting
too careless lately.

467
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,194
You're right.

468
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,326
Don't worry.

469
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,287
He doesn't know about us.

470
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,836
He doesn't

471
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,297
and I want to keep it that way.

472
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:05,218
Nor do I want to end things with you.
So I'm saying we should be more careful.

473
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,056
I understand.

474
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,484
Wouldn't it be difficult for you too?

475
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,194
If your wife knew about us?

476
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,249
What's wrong?

477
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,260
Actually, Mitsuki,

478
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,222
my wife,

479
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,768
she already knows what we're doing.

480
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,147
What?

481
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,526
She knows?

482
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,654
Since when?

483
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,698
Since the beginning.

484
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,377
What do you mean?

485
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,923
We're

486
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,634
what you call sexless.

487
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,470
It started with my wife saying no,

488
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,515
but when we talked about it,

489
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,852
she said she won't get involved
in my love life or me having sex.

490
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,106
In other words,

491
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,443
it's an authorized affair.

492
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,954
Is your wife okay with this?

493
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,082
I think so.

494
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,837
It hasn't been a problem so far.

495
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,303
I know

496
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,348
it's a very unique situation.

497
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:28,236
But you have a good relationship
with your wife, right?

498
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,031
Even without sex.

499
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,408
Yeah.

500
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,077
I think we do.

501
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:42,709
Oh, but you're the only one
I'm attracted to.

502
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,294
I'm telling the truth.

503
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,969
So you're saying,

504
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,058
for me, you need attraction,

505
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,771
but you like your wife as a person?

506
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,108
What?

507
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:10,862
That our relationship

508
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,948
needs things like

509
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,742
sex and lust.

510
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,163
But there are feelings of love and trust

511
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,332
that go beyond head-over-heels love

512
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,794
between you and your wife?

513
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,925
Of course there is.

514
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,762
You're husband and wife. A family.

515
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,514
That's not how it is.

516
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,684
Am I

517
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,603
some sort of cushioning

518
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,648
that helps you keep
the balance in your marriage?

519
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,985
So I'm bubble wrap?

520
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,820
I said that's not it.

521
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,071
Then what?

522
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,287
I…

523
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,456
I really cherished

524
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,377
our relationship because
I thought it was our secret.

525
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,009
But to be rolled around
in the palm of your hand…

526
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,054
It's not even funny.

527
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,015
Mitsuki.

528
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,145
Don't take me for a fool.

529
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:49,627
Mama.

530
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,172
I'm here.

531
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,591
Look, Hiro. Mama's here.

532
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,261
Mama!

533
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,597
Hiro.

534
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,891
Hello, dear.

535
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,559
He cried the entire time?

536
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,104
Yeah, more than usual today.

537
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,608
Go home. Go home.

538
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,611
-I'm so sorry, Mom.
-Don't worry about it.

539
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,905
Shiro's always so busy.

540
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,158
And you need a break too, sometimes.

541
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,285
-Thanks.
-Oh, wait here.

542
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,538
-Okay.
-Go home.

543
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,457
-Shall I carry you?
-Go home.

544
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,541
We're going home.

545
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,752
Here, take these side dishes.

546
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,046
I made you plenty
of simmered dishes and more.

547
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,881
But you have tenosynovitis.

548
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,718
It's all right. This is the only time
I can take care of you.

549
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,178
-Here, take it.
-Thanks.

550
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,763
Mama's here. Time to go home.

551
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,725
Can you put your shoes on?

552
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,102
You can do it.

553
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,229
-No.
-Right, okay.

554
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,949
I cooked for the man
I'm having an affair with.

555
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,994
And bring home food
from my mother who watched my son.

556
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,705
I'm the worst.

557
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,468
OTOYA - MITSUKI,
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR TODAY.

558
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:24,097
I WAS INSENSITIVE.

559
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,765
I'M REFLECTING ON MYSELF.

560
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,488
YOUR FOOD WAS REALLY GOOD,
I WAS HAPPY YOU MADE IT FOR ME.

561
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,865
I LOVE YOU

562
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,158
GET HOME SAFELY.

563
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:03,052
I LOVE YOU TOO

564
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:11,895
I can't stop.

565
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,689
Even if I become the worst person ever.

566
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,149
I just can't.

567
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,783
Why did the authorized affair

568
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,952
we both agreed on

569
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,329
start to feel wrong?

570
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:34,834
These are my own feelings. My own body.

571
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,003
But I have no idea why.

572
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,720
SALON
FLOWER GARDEN

573
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,819
It's just a counseling session.

574
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:25,426
Cherry blossom tea is also served
during occasions for celebration.

575
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,514
To say,
"I hope the future blossoms for you."

576
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,517
Yes.

577
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,811
I mean, I see.

578
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,484
Ms. Aihara, you requested
the Body Extra course.

579
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:43,945
Yes.

580
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,659
I believe

581
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:56,040
sexual services are no different from
going to the gym or aesthetician

582
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,876
to care for and please your body and mind.

583
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,920
It is an important self-care routine.

584
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:06,259
That is why, instead of guilt, I want you
to be curious and look forward to it

585
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:10,305
like you would when you go out
to eat a delicious meal.

586
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,224
Of course we thoroughly take
all precautions

587
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:17,186
to ensure our clients' trust and safety
in order for you to feel that way.

588
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,736
Our salon's men are excellent
at what they do.

589
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,529
I handpicked them myself.

590
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,949
But it's best to meet them yourself.

591
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,371
Oh, Rei.

592
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,415
Yes?

593
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,460
What great timing. Can you come down?

594
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,511
He's our most popular therapist.

595
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,681
Why don't you have a talk with him
before deciding on a reservation?

596
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,266
What?

597
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,159
Nice to meet you.

598
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,912
Hello.

599
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,164
Please, have a seat.

600
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,416
Thanks.

601
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,585
I don't like younger guys.

602
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,963
Not at all. Really.

603
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,091
But…

604
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,386
Is it your first time using our services?

605
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,470
Yes.

606
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,641
-I see.
-This boy is absolutely shining.

607
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,353
You don't need to be polite with me.

608
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,772
Sure.

609
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:49,070
My name is Rei. Like a ray of light.

610
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,157
I'm Ichiko Aihara.

611
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,659
Ichiko.

612
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,953
Nice to meet you.

613
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,205
Nice to meet you.

614
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,918
The power of a cute,
younger man's smile is no joke.

615
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:09,090
I used to make fun of those old men
who get all excited by younger women.

616
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,468
I am so sorry.
I completely understand why now.

617
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,472
Earlier,

618
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,559
when I saw you from up there,

619
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,979
and saw what a beautiful lady you are,

620
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,022
I got super excited.

621
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,276
I know. I know.

622
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,279
I know it's only sales talk.

623
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,740
No, that's not…

624
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,035
I know, but

625
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,290
it's totally working.
It's so good to hear.

626
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,258
If you choose me…

627
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,558
I will do my very best…

628
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,145
to please you with all my heart.

629
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,485
I made a reservation
for the third Thursday of next month

630
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,819
with Rei.

631
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:12,987
Great. Thank you.

632
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,532
I didn't even hesitate. Not one second.

633
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,830
-I got some on you.
-No, it's fine.

634
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,353
Otoyan.

635
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,564
Should we buy a gift at the station

636
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,108
for your grandma's
memorial service tomorrow?

637
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,693
Sure.

638
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,904
I think that's good.

639
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,912
Hey, Ichiko.

640
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:08,960
You should wash your fancy bras by hand.
The lace will get damaged.

641
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:12,797
You know your stuff.

642
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,718
I was in charge of laundry at home.

643
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,985
AIHARA FAMILY
THIRD MEMORIAL SERVICE

644
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,988
Here you go.

645
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,073
Would you like a refill?

646
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,533
-Here, Uncle.
-Thanks.

647
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,537
You had it rough, Tohko.
I heard you got a divorce?

648
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,830
Hey, that's enough.

649
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,039
That's right.

650
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,503
Be honest, you're having
a hard time, aren't you?

651
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:56,591
I have my work,
so I'm actually enjoying myself.

652
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,886
Besides, the average life span
is increasing.

653
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,013
I might find someone else later.

654
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,265
Find someone else?

655
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,517
-You're already 40.
-I'm 39.

656
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:13,357
Well, even if you get remarried,
at that age, kids are out of the question.

657
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,903
If you don't have kids soon, Otoya,

658
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,780
it will be the end of the Aihara family.

659
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,325
Children are society's treasure.

660
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,661
The bond between husband and wife.

661
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,330
You know,

662
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:33,336
you'll have it hard if you don't have
children to rely on when you get old.

663
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,464
So, Ichiko, you should feed

664
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,759
Otoya plenty of food that helps
him keep his vigor.

665
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,260
-Uncle.
-What?

666
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:44,305
We're doing just fine without a "bond."

667
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:48,726
We won't do something as irresponsible as
having kids so they can be our caregivers.

668
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,146
-Irresponsible? You--
-Isn't it fine?

669
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,317
I think it's good enough

670
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,819
that they are happy in their marriage.

671
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:04,367
Besides, the family line
will end when it ends.

672
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,286
The lives of the living are more important

673
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,414
than those who are gone
or have yet to be born.

674
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,752
I learned that after I lost my husband.

675
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,546
Is that so?

676
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,465
Yeah.

677
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,094
Here.

678
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,313
-Have another drink, Dad.
-Thanks.

679
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:38,067
Ichiko. Thank you for making time
in your busy schedule to come.

680
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,735
Thank you for inviting me.

681
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:41,946
I'm happy to see you again
after such a long time.

682
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,782
Sorry about my uncle.

683
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,575
It's perfectly fine.

684
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,245
Mother had a good comeback.

685
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,205
He's really a busybody.

686
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,124
Otoyan's father passed away

687
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,626
early in life.

688
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,796
Despite that,

689
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:03,134
or is it because of that,

690
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:07,138
there is a strong bond of trust
between the three of them.

691
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,140
Moreover, they are quite free-spirited.

692
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,725
Let's go drinking again, Ichiko.

693
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,727
Without the annoying nagger this time.

694
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,770
In that case, absolutely.

695
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,857
I think that was my salvation.

696
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,400
Take care.

697
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,609
Bye.

698
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,114
Wait, Otoya.

699
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,490
This.

700
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,535
-These are extra. Take them.
-We already have one.

701
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,619
Just take it.

702
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,997
But there are moments

703
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:37,001
when I get jealous of the things
my husband has

704
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,296
that I don't.

705
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,716
A close family.

706
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,302
A close relationship with his mom.

707
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,681
Okay. But Mom should take one too.

708
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,443
Home sweet home.

709
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,569
It's good to be home.

710
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,362
Good to be home.

711
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:09,950
I'm really sorry about my uncle.

712
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,786
He's really conservative.

713
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,454
It's okay.

714
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,874
And it's true I'm 35,

715
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,752
so there will always be people
giving me advice like that.

716
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,090
Maybe I should have been more direct.

717
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,175
And tell him he was being rude.

718
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,260
You said enough.

719
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:31,097
Your mother and sister even came
to my defense.

720
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,641
Thanks.

721
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,941
Hey, Otoya.

722
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,567
Yeah?

723
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,947
Do you ever think about having kids?

724
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,452
I don't know.

725
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,872
I haven't given it much thought.

726
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,458
Right?

727
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,503
It's still a vague idea for me too.

728
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,757
Well, I shouldn't be saying
"still" at my age.

729
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,594
Yeah.

730
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,520
Anyway, me too.

731
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,147
Yeah?

732
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,527
I could have my own "thing" too.

733
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,802
Why have I never thought

734
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,891
that Ichiko could also have an affair?

735
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:04,273
I keep thinking about that lacy bra
I saw for the first time.

736
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,526
It's not like I'm disparaging her.

737
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,988
Nor am I being conceited.

738
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:15,201
I just never thought about it.

739
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:20,080
I took our trust for granted.

740
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,298
Is it because I'm an idiot in love?

741
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,052
Probably yes.

742
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,972
If Ichiko exercises her right
to have an authorized affair,

743
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:39,934
she would fall in love with another man,

744
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,519
and if she has sex with him…

745
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,942
No, if she already slept with him…

746
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,741
Today is the third Thursday of the month.

747
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,871
The one night out of the month
my husband sleeps with his lover.

748
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,125
And today

749
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:09,213
marks the very first time
I'm visiting a brothel.

750
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:01,909
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

751
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,994
