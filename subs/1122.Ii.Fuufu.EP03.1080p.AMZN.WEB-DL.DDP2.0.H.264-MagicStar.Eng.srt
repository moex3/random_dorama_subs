1
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,304
Why have I never thought

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,309
that Ichiko could also have an affair?

3
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,151
Today is the third Thursday of the month.

4
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,486
The one night out of the month

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,239
my husband sleeps with his lover.

6
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,285
And today

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,998
marks the very first time
I'm visiting a brothel.

8
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,133
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,171
1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

10
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,724
Congratulations.

11
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,850
Thank you very much.

12
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,436
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. It's so nice to meet you.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,813
Nice to meet you too.

14
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,981
I saw it.

15
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,943
You made a wonderful website
for that store in Uehara.

16
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,364
-You showed her?
-Sorry, it was so good that I had to.

17
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,283
-How embarrassing.
-I thought it was so cute.

18
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,828
Thank you. It was a struggle to finish it.

19
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,913
-Really?
-The store is really nice too.

20
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,581
You should visit it. It's really cute.

21
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,416
Are you Ichiko Yamane?

22
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:06,961
Otoya Aihara?

23
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,589
-Did you know each other?
-Yeah.

24
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,425
Wait, you two are acquainted? From work?

25
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,262
Yeah, she made my company's website.

26
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,848
And I was in the same club
as Taro in college.

27
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,058
So, you were in the same club.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,103
Otoya, you actually have a job, huh?

29
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,355
What did you think I'd do?

30
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,899
Let me ask you, what did you think
I'd think you would do?

31
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,776
Of course I have a job.

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,320
Hey, Otoya. It's been a long time.

33
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,948
Yeah, it has.

34
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,493
This is Ichiko Yamane, a web designer.

35
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,370
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

36
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,747
I'm Aiko Mizuno.
I'm an editor for Koensha.

37
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,292
I went to college with Otoya.

38
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,045
Actually, Otoya, what do you do?

39
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,505
I work for a stationery brand.

40
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,049
What's it called?

41
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,718
White Bambi.

42
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,261
Never heard of it.

43
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,014
Didn't you want to work in media or TV?

44
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,850
I probably said something like that.

45
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,394
Not "probably," you did.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,855
You haven't changed a bit.

47
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,733
You've always been forgetful
and wishy-washy.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,610
On top of that--

49
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:17,281
Otoya, there's someone over there
who wants to say hi to you.

50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,782
Shall we go?

51
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,159
Sorry, Aiko.

52
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,827
Sure.

53
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:38,135
This is a beautiful place,
but they have a small drinks menu.

54
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,845
What?

55
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,976
So, where is that person
who wanted to talk to me?

56
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,438
That was a lie.

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,568
-What?
-Sorry, I just couldn't stand it, so…

58
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:59,865
I was getting annoyed and angry
just watching you two.

59
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:06,288
Well, she is my ex.

60
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,874
I see.

61
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,626
I'm sorry you saw something ugly.

62
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,712
No, it's not a big deal.

63
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,007
You shouldn't listen to that
without saying a word.

64
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,717
That might be true.

65
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,346
It was a messy break up,

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,643
so I thought she might still be mad at me.

67
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,269
And that made you happy?

68
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,148
Oh, no. That's never going to happen.

69
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:38,779
-Anyway, you're too nice of a person.
-No, I'm just indecisive.

70
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,864
And I'm also

71
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,618
forgetful and wishy-washy.

72
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,745
I guess she cut you deeply.

73
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,215
Ichiko, want to get out of here
and have a drink with me?

74
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,342
It's on me.

75
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,930
Yeah.

76
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,325
This is…

77
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,007
Are you familiar with this area?

78
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,760
Not really.

79
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,929
Is there a place you know?

80
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,139
Kind of.

81
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,307
"Kind of."

82
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,687
How about this one?
I've been meaning to try it.

83
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,856
Let's go in.

84
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,107
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

85
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,692
Okay.

86
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,626
-To a good night.
-To a good night.

87
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,127
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

88
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,551
-It's good.
-Yeah.

89
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,428
Have you been together for long?

90
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,721
-What?
-What?

91
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,598
Your relationship.

92
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,309
-No.
-We're not dating.

93
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,895
-My apologies.
-No, it's okay.

94
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,313
Since you look good together.

95
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,024
Thank you.

96
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,109
Thank you.

97
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,610
This is embarrassing.

98
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,070
-Yeah, it is.
-Yeah.

99
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,782
That day, I was a little excited.

100
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:51,370
Otoya, a man I met through work,

101
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,080
asked me out for drinks.

102
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,042
-I was kind of attracted to him.
-Why did you get into your line of work?

103
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,585
-My job?
-Yeah.

104
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,970
But I think it's fun.

105
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,973
So, I probably like what I do.

106
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,391
That's great.

107
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,601
-You think so?
-Yes.

108
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,273
Ichiko was so pretty and cheerful.

109
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,110
To me, she was sparkling beautifully
in that dark bar.

110
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,120
And now,

111
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,540
here I am.

112
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,835
And now,

113
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,046
here this is.

114
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,013
-Just how did we get here?
-Just how did we get here?

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,530
Ouch.

116
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,616
Oh, no. Ouch.

117
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,869
Ouch.

118
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,708
Crap. Ouch--

119
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,753
Shit. This is bad.

120
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,339
Shit. Shit. Shit.

121
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,924
Ouch. Shit.

122
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,065
Coming.

123
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,905
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

124
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,784
-Sorry to make you wait.
-No.

125
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,502
Wow, this is amazing.

126
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,505
It's so big. There's even a canopy.

127
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,176
Ichiko, thank you for getting
such a beautiful hotel room.

128
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,053
You're welcome.

129
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,056
Shall we sit first?

130
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
Yeah.

131
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,289
This is for you, Ichiko.

132
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,666
It's from a Kyoto candy maker.

133
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,045
It's so cute.

134
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,047
Thank you.

135
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,642
Here.

136
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
Is it good?

137
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,989
Yeah.

138
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,621
I'll answer any questions you have.
So go ahead and ask.

139
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,373
Since it's your first time.

140
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,129
Rei,

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,758
what do you do?

142
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,012
I go to college during the day.

143
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,056
So you're a student.

144
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,852
Don't worry, I'm definitely over 20.

145
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,646
Yeah.

146
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,607
Oh, right.

147
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,277
I've been practicing my massage skills.

148
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,363
Want to give it a try?

149
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,114
Sure.

150
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,160
Come over here.

151
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,933
That feels good.

152
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,024
Your neck and back are stiff.

153
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,738
Do you strain your eyes at work?

154
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,699
I use a computer.

155
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,244
I knew it.

156
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,923
Shall we go to the bed?

157
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah.

158
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,436
Hold on to me.

159
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,772
Here we go.

160
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,334
Can I kiss you?

161
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,463
Yeah.

162
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,437
You taste sweet.

163
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,698
It's okay. It's just a text.

164
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,283
Okay.

165
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,470
Sorry. I'll put it on silent mode.

166
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,972
Okay.

167
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,030
Everything okay?

168
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,533
Yeah.

169
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,706
My…

170
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,422
My husband threw out his back.

171
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,465
Okay.

172
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,135
Is he okay?

173
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,556
Looks like he's resting at home,

174
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,183
but he sounds like he's in pain.

175
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,771
I see.

176
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,525
That's worrisome.

177
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,868
Ichiko, what do you want to do?

178
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,334
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,211
I'm just worried about him.

180
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,131
Of course.

181
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,093
I'll leave the money here.

182
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:30,430
-No need. Since I didn't do anything.
-No, I can't.

183
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:37,020
Anyway, it's too bad,
but there's no helping it.

184
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,361
Hey.

185
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,489
Yeah?

186
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,078
Kiss me again.

187
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,457
Sure.

188
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,194
Ichiko.

189
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,030
I don't need the fee for today,

190
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,700
so I hope you'll book me again.

191
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,203
Okay.

192
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,248
Thank you.

193
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,332
Yeah.

194
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,090
I'm home.

195
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,266
Otoyan.

196
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,233
Otoyan?

197
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,658
Otoyan.

198
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,120
Are you okay?

199
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,914
Ichiko.

200
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,500
How is your back?

201
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:28,006
It really hurts. So much that I went numb.

202
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,549
And the hospital?

203
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,344
I went. They gave me pain meds
and pain relief patches.

204
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,722
Did you eat?

205
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,474
Nope.

206
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,225
Want a banana?

207
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,769
Yes.

208
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,395
Wait a second.

209
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,356
Ichiko.

210
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,777
Thank you for coming back.

211
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,070
Sorry, I know you're busy.

212
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,240
It's okay.

213
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,875
Hey, Ichiko.

214
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:05,794
Yeah?

215
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,797
Never mind.

216
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,134
-That's cold.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

217
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,928
Okay, wait. What is it?

218
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,141
I was thinking that

219
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,812
it's so reassuring to have
someone who knows me well

220
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,482
be there for me
when I'm in pain or feeling bad.

221
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,776
I'm really grateful.

222
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,402
We're married.

223
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,780
That means we're a team.

224
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,990
-Can you put your feet down?
-Yeah.

225
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,952
Okay, feet down. Oh, yeah. Here?

226
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,037
One, two, three.

227
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,707
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

228
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,792
You good?

229
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,382
-Hands up.
-Okay.

230
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,303
Okay.

231
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,474
Is this what happens when you get old?

232
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,312
I'll take really good care of you.

233
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,440
Then I'll be counting on you
when it happens to me.

234
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,817
Yeah.

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,443
-Okay.
-All right.

236
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,158
-You okay? I'll take that.
-Yeah.

237
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,999
You can do it. Yeah, you can do it.

238
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,542
Okay.

239
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,297
You did it.

240
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,007
Yeah. Thanks.

241
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,091
No problem.

242
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,818
You okay?

243
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,338
I know this is not love.

244
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,135
But you know what, Otoyan?

245
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,389
I can kind of understand

246
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:28,937
what you must be feeling
falling in love with someone else.

247
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,690
But this is

248
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,152
my own little secret.

249
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,325
You went to a brothel?

250
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,369
Hey, you're too loud.

251
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,580
Sorry. I'm sorry.

252
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,332
I'm so, so sorry.

253
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,627
What do you think about me going to one?

254
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,965
It's good. A great idea.

255
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,175
Wait, how was it?

256
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,636
What kind of man was it?

257
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
Well,

258
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,600
he was gorgeous.

259
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,602
-Seriously?
-Like a work of art.

260
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,312
Art?

261
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,607
So it wasn't an urban myth.

262
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,028
But he was urban-myth-level hot.

263
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,365
And?

264
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,368
How was it? In bed?

265
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,328
Actually,

266
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,124
Otoyan threw out his back
right at that moment.

267
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,668
I left right away.

268
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,794
What?

269
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:39,424
Wait, so, do you have regrets or not?

270
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,511
Both, I think.

271
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,099
I wasn't so sure about it
and felt kind of guilty.

272
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,102
-Guilty? Because of Otoya?
-Yeah.

273
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,397
Why? He's doing whatever he wants,

274
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,150
so wouldn't it be considered fair
by the Aihara rules

275
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,485
for you to exercise
your right to have an affair?

276
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,739
It technically is,

277
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,534
but I don't want Otoyan to find out.

278
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,244
-About going to a brothel?
-Yeah.

279
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,666
I think a person's sexuality is
something completely personal and private,

280
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,795
even if they have a family or a lover.

281
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:23,634
So it's too embarrassing if he knows
all the little details.

282
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,013
Otoyan probably feels the same way,

283
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,975
so whether we're having an affair or not,

284
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,062
our sex lives are our own private lives.

285
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,356
So I thought we could keep things separate

286
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,777
if we gave each other permission
to have affairs, but now…

287
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:47,200
Then it's impossible for you
to be open about your affair?

288
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,868
You'll stop?

289
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,120
Well,

290
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:56,084
I'm testing it out.

291
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,211
Then you'll continue it?

292
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,841
Because I might find the answer

293
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:07,136
to a stable and long-lasting marriage
through all this confusion.

294
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,559
Marriage is hard.

295
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,312
Yeah, it is.

296
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,067
Confusion, huh? Isn't it too chaotic?

297
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,569
It might be a little too chaotic.

298
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
Welcome.

299
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,257
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

300
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,012
-It's so cold today.
-Yeah.

301
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,724
How's your back?

302
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,476
Much better.

303
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,104
But it's still hard to sit
for a long time.

304
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,605
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

305
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,483
Then let's go home early today.

306
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,285
Welcome.

307
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,705
I'd like a lemon tea.

308
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,956
It will be right out.

309
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,668
What was the flower for today?

310
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,505
Dendrobium orchid and golden willow.

311
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,177
The teacher looked sad
that you missed the class.

312
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,804
You think you can go next week?

313
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,348
Yeah. I think I'll be better by next week.

314
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,475
Actually,

315
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,561
sorry about today.

316
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,271
For what?

317
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,401
Since we can't go to a hotel.

318
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,947
It's fine. It's not important.

319
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,951
I mean, it's important,

320
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,039
but were you worried about that?

321
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,000
A little.

322
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,963
Then let's take it slow next time.

323
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,307
I'm fine if we can't do it for a while.

324
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,855
But it was a little hard

325
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:27,193
not being able to help you
when you're hurt.

326
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,112
Thank you for waiting.
Here is your lemon tea.

327
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,739
Thank you.

328
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:43,209
It's natural since we both have
our own families.

329
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,256
This is the first time I regret

330
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,301
that this is an affair
and that we're not married.

331
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,707
Otoya.

332
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,210
Yes?

333
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,090
Is it okay if I ask you
an absurd question?

334
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,219
An absurd…

335
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,932
Go ahead.

336
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,857
Is it impossible for me, my son,

337
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,110
and you…

338
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,450
For the three of us to live together?

339
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,456
Mitsuki.

340
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,268
I don't

341
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,732
want to pry into your family life, but…

342
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,071
did something happen with your husband?

343
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,284
No.

344
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,121
Nothing happened.

345
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,376
Sorry for surprising you with that.

346
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,798
It's not like anything special happened.

347
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,303
I've been stressed out lately.

348
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,056
About Hiro, and…

349
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,395
You can't talk with your husband about it?

350
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,398
Yeah.

351
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,651
He's busy

352
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,945
and doesn't seem to have the time.

353
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,740
I see.

354
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,961
I was thinking about going back to work.

355
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,337
Part time.

356
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,506
-Really?
-Yeah.

357
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,635
Hiro seems to like his class,

358
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,637
and things have settled down,

359
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,849
so I was thinking about
changing my environment a bit.

360
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,601
Yeah. I think it's a good idea.

361
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,565
You used to live abroad,
and didn't you used to be a translator?

362
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,900
But it's really hard, you know.

363
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,820
I'm not a professional
and haven't worked for five years.

364
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,406
Your experience will be a benefit.

365
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,533
I'm sure you'll find a good job.

366
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah.

367
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,744
Thanks.

368
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,290
I'll help you in any way I can.
Just let me know.

369
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,374
Okay.

370
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,628
Then, first is

371
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,047
your back.

372
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,049
It needs to get better.

373
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,137
You're right.

374
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,358
It must have taken a lot of courage
for her to ask,

375
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,528
but I couldn't give her an answer.

376
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,409
Being with Mitsuki

377
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,331
would mean divorcing Ichiko
and starting a new life.

378
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,835
A new family from zero with Mitsuki,
and Hiro as a stepson.

379
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,883
I don't have enough determination
to do that.

380
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,011
Sorry.

381
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,645
Was it only lust and attraction?

382
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,689
No, it's more than that.

383
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,656
I also like her for who she is.

384
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,283
I do, but

385
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:30,663
that kind of responsibility is
too heavy for me.

386
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,543
Wait.

387
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,753
What?

388
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,547
Hold on.

389
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,092
Doesn't that make me

390
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,553
a piece of shit?

391
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,787
Otoya couldn't give me an answer.

392
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,709
No, he was put off by my question.

393
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,320
My husband is six years older than me.

394
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,322
We worked at the same company.

395
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,910
That was the plan,
but they said it couldn't be done.

396
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,288
He's good at his job,

397
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,874
but he was quiet and unfriendly.

398
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,169
Some of the women had a crush on him,

399
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,838
but a lot of them also said

400
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,174
his attitude was too cold.

401
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,805
We met when…

402
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,450
Miss Sasazuka?

403
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,631
A stalker?

404
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,551
Yeah. He is someone I know.

405
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,554
It's not rare for stalkers to be
a friend or someone you know.

406
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,559
Should I take you home?

407
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,312
-What?
-It looks like he's still out there.

408
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,064
Let's leave through the back exit.

409
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,529
As long as you don't find me bothersome.

410
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,074
You're not a bother, but…

411
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,503
I'll answer it.

412
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,681
Hello? I'm Shiro Kashiwagi.
I work with Mitsuki.

413
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,309
If you do this one more time,

414
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:43,772
I'll report you to the company,
the police and our security company.

415
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,234
What?

416
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,156
He hung up.

417
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,326
Let's go.

418
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,580
Thank you.

419
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:30,402
Worried about me,
he would take me home when he had time.

420
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,489
Hello.

421
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,366
Have things gotten better?

422
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,952
Yes. Thanks to you.

423
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,081
He hasn't called me at all lately.

424
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,375
That's good to hear.

425
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,460
Yes.

426
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,463
So I'm fine going home by myself.

427
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,842
Thank you for walking with me
even though you're so busy.

428
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:54,927
It's fine.

429
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,428
I'm glad it helped.

430
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,014
Tell me if anything happens.

431
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,058
-I will.
-Good night.

432
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:05,854
But…

433
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:13,320
Can you go home with me today?

434
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,072
What? Is he--

435
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,698
No, that's not it.

436
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,035
Well…

437
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:25,791
Would you like to have
a cup of tea at my place?

438
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,086
What?

439
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,436
Come in. It's a little small.

440
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,482
Thanks for inviting me.

441
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,559
-Here.
-Thank you.

442
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:28,896
Thanks for the tea.

443
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,614
Have some of these too.

444
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:53,962
What is this?

445
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,132
Mochi and red bean cookie.

446
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,970
There's mochi and red bean in this?

447
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,934
This is pretty good.

448
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,119
1938?

449
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,456
What? That old?

450
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,541
Wow.

451
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,585
Seven years before the war ended.

452
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,795
Yeah.

453
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,131
Can I have one more?

454
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,341
Sure, go ahead.

455
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,909
Be sure to lock up.

456
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,244
Yes.

457
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,287
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

458
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,415
Thanks for having me.

459
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,928
He really left after a cup of tea.

460
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:40,736
The first time he touched me
was a long while

461
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,030
from that day.

462
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,916
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

463
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,588
Wasn't it cold?
You didn't have dinner, right?

464
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,672
Yeah.

465
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,059
Mitsuki, can you get me a bottle opener?

466
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,394
Sorry.

467
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:06,571
-Here.
-Thanks.

468
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,732
Mitsuki.

469
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,317
What is it?

470
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,070
The company announced my transfer today.

471
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,369
I'll be transferred to Singapore
in May for at least three years.

472
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,124
I'll be counting on you to arrange
for Hiro's classes there,

473
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,169
our house and other things.

474
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,760
Mitsuki, you've got a scary expression.

475
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,222
Sorry.

476
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,641
I was surprised.

477
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,146
Didn't I tell you there was a possibility
I could get transferred?

478
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,107
You did.

479
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,277
But isn't this too sudden?

480
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:28,987
Really?

481
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,617
Even so, it has already been decided.

482
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,906
-Hey.
-Yeah?

483
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,040
Can't you go alone?

484
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,253
Why?

485
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,006
Shouldn't my family support me
at times like this?

486
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,634
You're right.

487
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:37,389
But this is an important time for Hiro.

488
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:43,561
Changing his environment right now
will be too much for him.

489
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,273
He finally got used to his class.

490
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,194
But…

491
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,949
is this really about Hiro?

492
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,451
What?

493
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:03,206
It's a good place to live,
with a great education system.

494
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:08,503
You can find facilities, schools,
and teachers that meet Hiro's needs.

495
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,132
Over there, we can hire a maid
to do the housework,

496
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,343
so things would be much easier for you.

497
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,311
Isn't it you who doesn't want to leave?

498
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,898
Using Hiro as an excuse.

499
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,533
I'm not going alone.

500
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,411
You already know that, don't you?

501
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,001
I've never restricted what you can do
or complained about it.

502
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,171
Because I trust you.

503
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,178
Be someone who can
proudly call herself a mother.

504
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,186
My husband knew…

505
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,359
that I was having an affair.

506
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:21,034
With no job and an affair,
if I get a divorce,

507
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:25,288
I could lose custody of Hiro.

508
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,086
This is an act of compassion
from my husband.

509
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:37,967
My infidelity will go unquestioned
if we end things now.

510
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,805
If I don't end things…

511
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,114
Otoyan.

512
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:04,577
So, what do you want to do
for your birthday? Any food you want?

513
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,079
Oh, yeah.

514
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,790
What's good? Sushi?

515
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,459
Sushi is good. At Kitamori?

516
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:15,046
Good idea. But can we get reservations?

517
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,091
It's still a month away,
so it should be okay. I'll call them.

518
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,093
Thanks.

519
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,055
How's your back? Is it better?

520
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,517
It hurts a little when I get up from bed.

521
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,205
MITSUKI KASHIWAGI
GOOD MORNING.

522
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,082
CAN I SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON?

523
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,334
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU

524
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,846
My husband is getting transferred.

525
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:11,352
I think we're moving to Singapore in May.

526
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,067
Really?

527
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,445
Yeah.

528
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:25,700
I wanted to tell you in person.

529
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,411
And…

530
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,540
I'm sorry. I know you're busy.

531
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,542
It's okay.

532
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,297
But…

533
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:41,466
I see.

534
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,136
Yeah.

535
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,648
Wouldn't it be hard for you?

536
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,693
With Hiro and everything?

537
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,238
Yeah.

538
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,324
It will.

539
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,050
Hey, Otoya.

540
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,594
Yeah?

541
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:32,350
Can we stay together a little longer?

542
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,396
Of course.

543
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,192
That's good.

544
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,404
Thanks for coming out today.

545
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,971
It's so sad and lonely.

546
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:16,144
I'm sad to hear she's leaving Japan,
but it's sadder and lonelier

547
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,565
to think I wasn't very shocked

548
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,153
about not being able to see her anymore.

549
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:33,953
A part of me was even
relieved when she told me.

550
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,963
YAY! I GOT RESERVATIONS
FOR KITAMORI NEXT MONTH.

551
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,423
I'M SO EXCITED!

552
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,358
YES! THANK YOU!

553
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:33,680
It wasn't pretty today either.

554
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,265
Not at all.

555
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,517
For real?

556
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,436
-I think your arrangements are pretty.
-No way.

557
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,605
Your arrangements are always so beautiful.

558
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,232
When March came,

559
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,444
the days started to smell like spring.

560
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:54,909
I'd have tea with Mitsuki
for an hour after the ikebana class.

561
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,204
That's how we continued our relationship.

562
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:06,337
We were both cautious
and ignored the major issue.

563
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,384
It was like we were really good friends.

564
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:28,192
Otoya, I will quit
the ikebana class after next week.

565
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,279
What?

566
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,285
Oh, right. Yeah.

567
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:46,669
I want to be together
with you one last time.

568
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,008
Sure.

569
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,718
Me too.

570
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:58,639
Then let's go
to our usual place next week.

571
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:01,476
Yeah.

572
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,020
I'm looking forward to it.

573
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,330
I'm home. Sorry for coming back late.

574
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,916
Welcome back.

575
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:32,965
Hey, Ichiko.

576
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:34,592
What?

577
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,553
It's about next Thursday.

578
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:42,225
Your birthday? I'm so excited about it.

579
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,143
Oh, yeah, I'm paying for dinner.

580
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,064
About that.

581
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:51,275
It's okay. I'm getting my tax refund.

582
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,027
No, it's not that.

583
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:57,824
I'm sorry.

584
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,617
Why?

585
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,911
You even made reservations, but I'm sorry.

586
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,790
I have a client dinner
that I can't reschedule.

587
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,336
I see.

588
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:16,759
It sucks, but there's nothing we can do
about it since it's work.

589
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,845
I'm really sorry.

590
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:23,182
To make up for it, let's make new plans
and you pick the place.

591
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,226
I'll make the reservations and pay for it.

592
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,771
Think about where you want to go.

593
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,523
I will.

594
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,237
Then I'll go take a bath first.

595
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,620
ENTER PASSCODE

596
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,924
EXCITED FOR NEXT WEEK

597
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,467
ME TOO. I'LL CHECK IN FIRST

598
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,302
IT'S CROWDED TODAY
SO TAKE YOUR TIME

599
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,513
SHOULD WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

600
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,267
Right now,

601
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,813
I probably look like a wife who discovered
her husband is cheating.

602
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,466
-Ichiko. I'm going to bed first.
-Yeah?

603
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,093
Okay. Good night.

604
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,096
Be sure to take a shower.

605
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,681
I will, I will.

606
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,683
-Then, good night.
-Good night.

607
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:41,696
We're both adults, but we promised
to celebrate our birthdays

608
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,741
as a day to show
our appreciation for each other.

609
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,786
We made sure to do it every year.

610
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,622
At least until now…

611
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,252
How could you, Otoyan?

612
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,884
CONTACT US - RESERVATIONS

613
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,317
YOUR MESSAGE:
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST

614
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,862
CAN I MAKE A RESERVATION
WITH REI

615
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,363
FOR NEXT THURSDAY, MARCH 21?

616
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,787
I ANSWERED "NO"
TO GOING ALL THE WAY

617
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:32,997
IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE,

618
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,375
BUT I'D LIKE TO CHANGE IT
TO "YES."

619
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,095
SUBMIT YOUR MESSAGE

620
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,681
YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.

621
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,040
Ichiko.

622
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,126
I'll be late today,
so go to bed without me.

623
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:23,631
I have a meeting, so I might be late too.

624
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,132
Okay.

625
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,814
Otoyan.

626
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,820
Happy birthday. Have a good day.

627
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,741
Thank you. I will.

628
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,749
Our marriage isn't moral or proper.

629
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,378
It's warped and full of contradictions.

630
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:07,383
And it might stay like this for a while.

631
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,354
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

632
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,118
But isn't that okay?

633
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:41,167
Since we both
want to stay in this marriage.

634
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,847
Thank you for everything you've taught me.

635
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,140
Mitsuki.

636
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,935
Keep arranging flowers, even on your own.

637
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,438
I will. Thank you.

638
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,732
Take care.

639
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,941
I will.

640
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,029
Thank you.

641
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,740
-We'll miss you.
-We'll miss you.

642
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,783
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

643
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,829
-It's going to be lonely without her.
-Yeah.

644
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,123
I'm going to miss you.

645
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,374
Really.

646
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:31,967
Ichiko definitely knows
that I'm seeing her tonight.

647
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,644
Ichiko, does it make you sad?

648
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,188
Are you fed up with me?

649
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,360
Sorry I'm late.

650
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:57,493
Either way, Ichiko,
this will be the last time.

651
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,873
It's been a while, Ichiko.

652
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:05,167
Yeah, it has.

653
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,128
You look pretty today too.

654
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:11,548
Thank you.

655
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,607
Ichiko.

656
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,405
I need to ask to avoid any future issues.

657
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,826
I can go all the way today, right?

658
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:42,913
Yes.

659
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,999
Please.

660
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,418
Okay.

661
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,513
As expected,
Rei is really good with women.

662
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,974
I'm not as nervous as I was last time.

663
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,478
Okay. I've decided.

664
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:10,065
I'm going to really enjoy myself.

665
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:15,904
I won't even think about Otoyan today.

666
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:24,246
This is a present for you.

667
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,581
What?

668
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,541
Thank you.

669
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,878
-Can I open it?
-Of course.

670
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,981
Scissors and a kenzan flower holder set.

671
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,483
Thank you.

672
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:12,711
Otoya.

673
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:17,007
Thank you for everything.

674
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,472
This is our last night together.

675
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:29,395
Yeah.

676
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:03,804
Otoya.

677
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,474
Let's have sex.

678
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,245
Mitsuki.

679
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,333
Let's stop…

680
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,253
doing this.

681
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,593
What?

682
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,220
I'd…

683
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,099
be happy if I could be friends with you.

684
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,564
By friends, you mean…

685
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:01,737
As friends, well…

686
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,910
we listen to each other
when we're having problems

687
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:10,621
and support each other.

688
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,167
No, I mean…

689
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:19,838
Mitsuki.

690
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:25,010
Things have been a little weird
between me and my wife.

691
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,096
It's not only because of our affair.

692
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,140
But I think that's a big part of it.

693
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,020
So I want to fix my relationship with her.

694
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,196
So, both you and I,

695
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,908
let's start putting
our own families first.

696
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,703
And face what is really going on
in our families.

697
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:56,458
I hope we can be friends who can talk
with each other

698
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,755
about our problems.

699
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,511
What do you think?

700
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,145
Mitsuki?

701
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:21,942
Does it feel good?

702
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:25,445
What?

703
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:33,954
Does it feel good making a pledge…

704
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,833
to rebuild your marriage?

705
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,336
Feeling relieved?

706
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,591
That's not what I mean.

707
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,226
Sorry.

708
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:04,026
Did I say something weird?

709
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,042
Mitsuki?

710
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,190
NEXT EPISODE

711
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:47,152
Even after we break up, I don't want
you to have sex with anyone else.

712
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,989
When Otoyan was stabbed in the genitals,

713
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,784
I was having crazy hot sex

714
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,536
with a gigolo from the brothel.

715
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,414
Fuck, it hurts.

716
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,916
A HUSBAND WHOSE LOVE
ENDED WITH PAIN

717
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,001
I'm really happy I did it.

718
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:04,169
A WIFE WHOSE HEART
AND BODY WAS SOOTHED

719
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:08,006
I think you simply hate it, right?
That your husband has a lover.

720
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,841
AFTER THE AUTHORIZED AFFAIR

721
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:12,678
We have to change, both you and I.

722
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,597
Will it still function properly?

723
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,850
COMES THE CONSTANT LIES

724
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,936
I finally realized I hated the idea

725
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,899
of you having a relationship
with someone else.

726
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,442
AND UNSPOKEN TRUTHS.

727
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,115
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

728
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,201
