1
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,804
So,

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,473
both you and I,

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,810
let's start putting
our own families first.

4
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,357
Does it feel good?

5
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,695
What?

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,160
Does it feel good

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:36,704
making a pledge…

8
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,374
to rebuild your marriage?

9
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,086
Ichiko.

10
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,759
I need to ask to avoid any future issues.

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,263
I can go all the way today, right?

12
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,184
Yes.

13
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,561
Please.

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:02,772
Okay.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,906
Mitsuki?

16
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,831
Mitsuki, why?

17
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,711
I…

18
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,262
I guess I'm the kind of person
who would do this.

19
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,568
Otoya, I…

20
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,575
I really loved

21
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,746
and hated you so much.

22
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,629
Even after we break up,

23
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:35,007
I don't want you to have sex
with anyone else.

24
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,245
I'm so sorry, Otoya. It hurts, right?

25
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,505
Yeah. A lot.

26
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,078
It feels good, right?

27
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,330
Yeah.

28
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,707
It feels good.

29
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,073
The bleeding isn't stopping.

30
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,119
It will. It will stop. I think it will.

31
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,290
Why don't I get an ambulance?

32
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,418
You can't.

33
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,130
It will be bad for both of us
if this becomes a big deal.

34
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,556
Mitsuki.

35
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,226
Go home.

36
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,354
-But--
-I'll be fine.

37
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,780
Mitsuki.

38
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,617
Take care of yourself.

39
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,913
Otoya.

40
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,251
Just go.

41
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,839
Go. I'll be okay.

42
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,022
Okay.

43
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,569
Fuck, it hurts.

44
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,660
I can't die.

45
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,707
I won't die, Ichiko.

46
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,004
Thanks for booking me.

47
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,590
No, thank you.

48
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,135
I'm really happy I did.

49
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,137
Thank you.

50
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,805
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

51
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:08,739
It's hard for me to come when I'm nervous,

52
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,365
but I orgasmed right away.

53
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,451
I knew it. You're really good.

54
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,039
It's not just sex.

55
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,917
I haven't touched anyone,

56
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,127
or shared loving kisses,

57
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,339
or hugged someone in a really long time.

58
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:31,595
I felt it, not just with my body,
but also deep in my soul.

59
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,142
It was phenomenal.

60
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,065
Ichiko.

61
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,025
Sorry.

62
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,164
Here. Tissue.

63
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,874
-Thanks.
-Sure.

64
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,963
Want some water?

65
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,631
Yeah.

66
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:10,968
Here.

67
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,655
Is your marriage,

68
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,575
what you'd call, sexless?

69
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,869
Yeah.

70
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,623
You can call it that.

71
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,835
It's been about two years, I guess.

72
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,338
I see.

73
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,177
It was originally
because I didn't want to do it.

74
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,765
So my husband found a lover,

75
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,060
and I accepted it.

76
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,316
Since I had absolutely no sex drive

77
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,485
and aside from sex,
our relationship was really good.

78
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,366
I thought that things would
be okay like this,

79
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,661
so I did nothing to change it.

80
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,832
And now here I am, doing this.

81
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,591
I didn't do this to get back at my husband

82
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,888
but I think a part of me wanted revenge.

83
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,395
But when I actually did it,
it was better than expected.

84
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,024
And made me realize sex really is amazing.

85
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,112
Our relationship is messy and weird,
right? Even though we're married.

86
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,829
I have never been married,
so it's not for me to say.

87
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,834
But listening to what you just said…

88
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,507
I think you simply hate it, right?

89
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,593
That your husband has a lover.

90
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,773
Why don't you tell him?

91
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,490
But…

92
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,412
it's too late now.

93
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,123
It's never too late.

94
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,417
He's your husband.

95
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,463
Here. Blow your nose.

96
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,465
Thank you.

97
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,890
But…

98
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,228
I don't know what to do.

99
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,399
He turned me down

100
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,110
when I tried to sleep with him before.

101
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,696
He did?

102
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,781
Yeah.

103
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,118
I see.

104
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,544
But

105
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,841
sex isn't only about penetration.

1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

108
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,310
Hello, I'm from the front desk.

109
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,145
Yeah.

110
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,148
I'm opening the door.

111
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,525
Okay.

112
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,903
Pardon me. I'm coming in.

113
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,619
I'm really sorry.

114
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,871
I wanted your help.

115
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,582
I see. Okay.

116
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,963
Please use this.

117
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,382
Sorry I made a mess.

118
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,591
Don't mind it.

119
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,177
Please lie down.

120
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,474
You'll be fine. You're in good hands.

121
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,827
Are you okay?
I have a taxi waiting at the back door.

122
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,871
Thank you.

123
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,959
I'm really sorry about this.

124
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,253
You don't need to apologize.

125
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:43,842
I've seen worse
at the previous hotel I worked for.

126
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,304
Worse than this?

127
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,430
Yes.

128
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,015
Besides,

129
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,476
sir, you are still alive.

130
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,440
Yeah.

131
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,069
URGENT CARE CENTER

132
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,821
Wow.

133
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
This has got to hurt.

134
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,326
Yes, it hurts.

135
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,413
How did this happen?

136
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,754
I tripped and…

137
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,343
the kenzan happened to be right there.

138
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,803
Kenzan?

139
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,849
It's used in ikebana.

140
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,356
Then it will be bad if it gets infected

141
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,067
by the bacteria in the plants.

142
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,195
I think it will be okay.

143
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,157
-Really?
-It was a brand new kenzan.

144
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,408
Was it?

145
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:01,461
Then I'll give you antibiotics
and painkillers.

146
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,296
Okay.

147
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,468
Rest here
while the medicine takes its effect.

148
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,512
Okay.

149
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,223
Wow. This has really got to hurt.

150
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,894
Doctor.

151
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,604
Yes?

152
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,274
Can I…

153
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,653
Will it still function properly?

154
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,238
Function?

155
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,448
Oh, erection?

156
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,991
Yeah.

157
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,661
Physically, there is no problem.

158
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,706
Physically…

159
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,792
Well,

160
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,086
that type of thing is, you know…

161
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,967
If you experience issues,
the cause will be psychological.

162
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,513
Weren't you scared?

163
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:25,336
OTOYA AIHARA - I GOT TREATED
AT THE HOSPITAL AND I'M OKAY

164
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,007
Then contact me if you need anything.

165
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,842
Even if it's just to talk.

166
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,802
Sure.

167
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,975
This.

168
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,352
It's like my business card.

169
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,356
Okay.

170
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,233
Thanks.

171
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,363
So, may fortune favor you.

172
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,869
Good luck.

173
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,371
Bye.

174
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,456
Bye.

175
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,473
REI - TO ICHIKO,
THANKS FOR TODAY

176
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,809
BOOK ME AGAIN, OKAY?

177
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,285
What should I do with my sorrow?

178
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,166
Who will be the one to save me?

179
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:51,256
I'm Romeo and you're my Juliet

180
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,595
This is a freaking pain in my ass

181
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,393
I wanna hold you in my arms

182
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,523
I wanna watch you as you sleep

183
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,778
I wanna eat the meals you make

184
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,489
Whether I'm sent east or west

185
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,743
It's all a freaking pain in my ass

186
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,853
I'm home.

187
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,704
I'm back.

188
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,733
I'm home.

189
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,861
Welcome back.

190
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,370
Hey, Otoyan.

191
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,711
Can we talk right now?

192
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,881
Now might not be a good time.

193
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,510
Sorry. My back is hurting again.

194
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,345
Really? Are you okay?

195
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,931
Yeah. I took some medicine.

196
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,975
I'll just sleep it off.

197
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,644
Okay.

198
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
Otoyan, happy birthday.

199
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,536
Good night.

200
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,830
Thanks. Good night.

201
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,996
Is Hiro asleep?

202
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,416
Yeah.

203
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,544
He fell asleep on the way home
from my mom's.

204
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,254
He's sleeping soundly.

205
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,887
How was your day, Mitsuki?

206
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,520
Wasn't it your last flower class?

207
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,733
Yeah.

208
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,987
Today was the last class.

209
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,496
But the ikebana class…

210
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,334
isn't what you're really asking about,
is it?

211
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,425
Shiro.

212
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,096
You knew I was having an affair. Right?

213
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,439
Why don't you sit here?

214
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,127
I knew.

215
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,088
That is why I asked if it was over.

216
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,052
I ended it.

217
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:51,931
But

218
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,976
I stabbed him.

219
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,106
What did you just say?

220
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,901
I stabbed him.

221
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,949
Oh, but it was with a kenzan flower base.

222
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,748
What are you saying?

223
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,461
I'm wondering that myself.

224
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,758
What is the point of making up such a lie?

225
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,107
No?

226
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,777
You really stabbed him?

227
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:50,698
Is he okay?

228
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,704
He told me he went to the hospital
and is okay.

229
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,831
-So you can relax.
-No.

230
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,374
That is not important.

231
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,878
Why did you do it?

232
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,096
I…

233
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,645
I didn't think you were that stupid.

234
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,317
Really?

235
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,656
You've been taking me for an idiot
this entire time.

236
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,241
Are you saying it's my fault?

237
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,367
No.

238
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,372
I'm responsible for the stupid things
I've done.

239
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,291
And it won't create any problems for you.

240
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,004
Isn't that what you wanted?

241
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,227
Go ahead. You can hit me.

242
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,108
I won't hit you.

243
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,697
Because I love you.

244
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,958
Even if you're the type to stab
the man she loves…

245
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,379
I will not hit the woman I love.

246
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,139
Ouch. Ouch.

247
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,193
Are the pain meds working?

248
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,748
Good morning.

249
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,041
Good morning.

250
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,419
You're up early today.

251
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,504
Yeah.

252
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,548
I had a rush job so I got up early.

253
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,926
Want some coffee?

254
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,803
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,812
Is your back okay?

256
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,522
Can you go to work?

257
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,273
Yeah.

258
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,035
Anyway, Otoyan.

259
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,414
Did you notice anything?

260
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,374
Like what?

261
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,588
This. It's your birthday present.

262
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,383
I left it on the table for you yesterday.

263
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,511
Sorry. I didn't see it.

264
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,263
Open it.

265
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,741
Mount Fuji sake cups.

266
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,827
So cute. Thank you.

267
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,873
I bought sake too.

268
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,418
See?

269
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,504
Want to drink it together tonight?

270
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:19,925
I'm only working until the afternoon
so I'll make something to go with it.

271
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,010
What would you like?

272
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,721
Sorry, Ichiko.

273
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,182
Since I'm still not feeling good,

274
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,017
I'll take a rain check.

275
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,143
What?

276
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,854
That sake looks like it will be good.

277
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,898
You can drink it yourself.

278
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,234
I'll go get ready for work.

279
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,778
That's not what I meant, Otoyan.

280
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,990
I bought it
because I wanted to drink it with you.

281
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,287
Oh, of course.

282
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:50,915
I'm sorry.

283
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,755
Thank you.

284
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,549
Let's drink it when I get better.

285
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,637
Okay.

286
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,088
This is Otoya. How are you?

287
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:43,092
I'm not feeling well,
so I won't attend the meeting.

288
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,303
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

289
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,098
I'll look at the meeting notes tomorrow.

290
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,309
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

291
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,811
Bye.

VIEW THE STARRY SKY
IN A 18M DIAMETER PLANETARIUM

299
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,112
TOKYO SPACE &amp; SCIENCE MUSEUM

300
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,906
Here, in a city like Tokyo,

301
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:53,829
the building and street lights are
so bright and strong

302
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,831
that it's become harder to see the stars.

303
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:02,630
But what if we turn off
all the city and factory lights

304
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,008
that brighten the skies?

305
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,844
What will the night sky look like?

306
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,730
A beautiful starry sky is constantly
shining above our heads like this.

307
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,028
Now if you look around the sky,

308
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,199
you can already see
the spring constellations

309
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,201
rising up in the eastern sky.

310
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:36,163
That bright star is Vega,
a first magnitude star.

311
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,875
It looks so good!

312
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,043
Right?

313
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,505
This one is done.

314
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,590
-Here.
-Thanks.

315
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,680
Hot.

316
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,476
Food grilled on an open flame is so tasty.

317
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,898
But don't you think
we bought too much food?

318
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,359
It should be okay.

319
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,403
-It will be okay?
-Yeah.

320
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:12,991
Rain?

321
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,326
-Yeah.
-It's raining.

322
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,162
-It's raining hard. What's going on?
-Oh, no.

323
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,664
-Evacuate. Evacuate.
-Wait, what?

324
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,833
-Evacuate. Our stuff.
-Our things.

325
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:21,917
Hold on.

326
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,087
What should we do?

327
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,047
Crap.

328
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,257
Sorry.

329
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,633
Wow.

330
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,844
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my…

331
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,972
-A sudden heavy shower?
-It's really raining.

332
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,391
Hey, isn't it leaking?

333
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,184
Well, it's a mesh tent.

334
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,561
Are all tents like this?

335
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,730
No, there is a covering for it.

336
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,190
-Then let's use it.
-I left it at home.

337
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,275
Why?

338
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,652
I thought it would make it hot.
And it's bulky.

339
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,405
-You idiot.
-But I have a raincoat.

340
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,323
-A raincoat?
-Yeah, raincoat. Hold on.

341
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,033
-Raincoat, raincoat.
-Raincoat.

342
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,493
-Here. The raincoat.
-Thanks.

343
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,829
We should go take cover somewhere.

344
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,456
-Right, take cover.
-Let's go.

345
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,082
-Where to?
-This way.

346
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,834
-How about there?
-Okay.

347
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,294
-That way.
-The meat.

348
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,545
-Oh, the meat.
-Well…

349
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,338
-But the meat.
-The poor meat.

350
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,900
You know.

351
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,861
Since we're beginners at this,

352
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,990
we should have gone somewhere easy,
like a place with a cottage.

353
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,327
I suggested some places like that,

354
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,081
but you said no since there will be
college students there partying.

355
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,292
What? I did?

356
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,213
You did. That's why I looked
for a quiet spot and came here.

357
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:50,964
Oh, okay.

358
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,049
Yeah.

359
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,981
Otoyan.

360
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,610
-Come here. Come on.
-What?

361
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,820
What is it?

362
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,030
That. Look.

363
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,162
Beautiful.

364
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,706
Yeah, it's beautiful.

365
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,254
Is that the Milky Way?

366
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:37,052
This trip was a total mess,
but it was still fun.

367
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,643
I really loved Ichiko's candidness,

368
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:48,480
her strength, the way she lives
life at her own pace,

369
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:52,150
and how she finds fun in everything.

370
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,069
Even back then.

371
00:35:55,904 --> 00:36:00,409
To the west, you can see a pale band
of light that looks like a cloud.

372
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,619
It is the Milky Way.

373
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,289
But thinking about it now,

374
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,793
when she said it was fun on that day,

375
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,671
it was her way of being kind
and telling me

376
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,507
it was okay that I screwed up.

377
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:20,512
The shape of the Milky Way we see
is from our perspective inside the…

378
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:24,933
I can easily think of a few times
she acted as if she was enjoying herself

379
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,435
so I wouldn't be hurt.

380
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,609
Ichiko has always been really good to me.

381
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,938
I'm back, Ichiko.

382
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,901
I wasn't feeling good so I left early.

383
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,695
But somehow,

384
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,533
I started feeling better on my way home
and could do some shopping.

385
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,535
I got a couple of things.

386
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,496
Look.

387
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,123
Dried mullet roe.

388
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,920
And simmered whale with ginger.

389
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,131
So, Ichiko.

390
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:42,135
Let's drink that sake
you got me for my birthday.

391
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,267
What's wrong?

392
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,438
What about you, Otoyan? What's wrong?

393
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,608
What do you mean?

394
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,945
Did you get hurt?

395
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,906
Hurt?

396
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:10,706
I found a bloody gauze
in the bathroom trash can.

397
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,169
Oh, right.

398
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,340
Yesterday, I tripped and cut myself
coming home.

399
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,466
Where?

400
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,053
On my leg. Around here.

401
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,221
Show me.

402
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,182
You don't have to look at it.
It's not a big deal, really.

403
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,351
Otoyan.

404
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,730
You left this paper bag
on the balcony, didn't you?

405
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,571
It was filled with bloody clothes.

406
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,410
You didn't have a client dinner yesterday.

407
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,120
You went to see her, right?

408
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,498
Sorry. I looked at your phone.

409
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,965
What happened?

410
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,386
No more lies.

411
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,306
Otoyan.

412
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,851
I want you to tell me the truth.

413
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,369
Like you said…

414
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,791
I saw her yesterday.

415
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,339
I'm sorry I lied.

416
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,426
You probably won't believe me,

417
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,721
but I was going to end things with her.

418
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,100
And then…

419
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,062
yesterday,

420
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,065
I met her at the hotel.

421
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,692
And…

422
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,116
She stabbed me with a kenzan.

423
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,536
Where?

424
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,290
My genitals.

425
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,401
Sorry, Otoyan.

426
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,907
I'm so sorry.

427
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,509
Why are you apologizing?

428
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,263
Don't do that.

429
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,392
You shouldn't be apologizing
like one of those wives

430
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,603
with a cheating husband in a drama.

431
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,812
I'm the one that's wrong.

432
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,272
No.

433
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,527
It's a problem between us,

434
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:34,159
but I'm the only one who ignored it
and made you deal with it alone.

435
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,872
So you ended up getting hurt.

436
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,966
I was the one…

437
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:56,014
who told you to have an affair.

438
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,480
But I couldn't take back my words

439
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,024
because I thought

440
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,402
it was ugly to be jealous.

441
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,497
I couldn't accept my feelings

442
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,251
and was too proud and stubborn,
so I didn't say anything.

443
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,712
But that made me even more confused.

444
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,510
I tried to tell myself
that everything was okay, but…

445
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,771
I finally realized

446
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:51,778
I hated the idea
of you having a relationship

447
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,030
with someone else.

448
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,619
So I thought I had to tell you how I felt.

449
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,713
Really. It's so hard to be honest
and tell you about my feelings.

450
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,388
Don't cry, Ichiko.

451
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,479
When you're in pain, I'm in pain.

452
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,714
Ichiko.

453
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,218
Thank you for telling me the truth.

454
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,972
I'm really happy right now.

455
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
I…

456
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,729
I had given up.

457
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:12,067
Actually, I stopped thinking about
ever sleeping with you again.

458
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:18,031
I apologize for what I did in the past.

459
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:21,034
No, I didn't mean to bring that up again.

460
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,619
But now,

461
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,287
I…

462
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,167
really want to

463
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,379
make love to you.

464
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,632
What?

465
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,225
That makes me so incredibly happy.

466
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,235
Right now…

467
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,781
I'm injured, but…

468
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,159
Ichiko.

469
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,205
Let's start doing it again
when I get better.

470
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,292
Yeah.

471
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,721
Welcome back.

472
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,350
Didn't I tell you to go to bed first
since I'll be late?

473
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,644
Yeah.

474
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,230
But I couldn't sleep anyway.

475
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,578
Shiro.

476
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,788
I want to talk.

477
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:32,916
About?

478
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,168
Yesterday's conversation.

479
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,088
Didn't you break up?

480
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,257
I'll forget about it.
Don't bring it up again.

481
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,762
I broke up with him,

482
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,723
but not with you.

483
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,522
I'm tired. Let's talk next time.

484
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,817
Thirty minutes is fine, so please.

485
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,447
If we run away
instead of talking about it now,

486
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,159
we'll never fix our marriage,
even if I ended my affair.

487
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:23,925
Mitsuki,

488
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,678
what do you want from me?

489
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:34,936
You said you still love me, right?

490
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,480
Even after what I did?

491
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:47,740
But you're only seeing
the part of me that you want to see.

492
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:57,375
Then did he see the whole you,
love you, and accept you?

493
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,755
Is that why you lied to your family
and snuck around with him?

494
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,174
Had sex with him?

495
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,766
I admit I was weak,
and what I did was wrong.

496
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,230
But I want to talk about our future.

497
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,246
Stop it.

498
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,123
Stop.

499
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,916
No. Stop.

500
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,210
I said stop!

501
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,422
Shut up.

502
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,183
Ouch.

503
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,105
You've gotten pretty violent.

504
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,941
What about your violence?

505
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,986
Even if we're married,
forcing sex is rape.

506
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,530
Now you're acting like a feminist?

507
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,869
Did you learn about human rights
during your affair?

508
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:24,420
I really hate how you protect your
own feelings by always looking down

509
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,547
on other people.

510
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:32,845
I'm going to bed.

511
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,891
Shiro.

512
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:42,522
I want you…

513
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,235
to see me as a human being.

514
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,451
We have to change,

515
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,496
both you and I.

516
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,670
If we don't,

517
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,214
then I can't be with you.

518
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,121
Ouch.

519
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,874
Watching Otoyan as he slept peacefully,

520
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,754
I kept thinking
about what I did yesterday.

521
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,972
When Otoyan was stabbed in the genitals,

522
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,893
I was having crazy hot sex

523
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,562
with a gigolo from the brothel.

524
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,090
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

525
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:40,176
