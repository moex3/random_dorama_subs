1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,720
Mama.

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,680
Yanyan.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,850
Mama. Yanyan.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,685
Hiro. Say bye to Papa.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,604
Mama. Yanyan.

6
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,565
Mama.

7
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,734
-Mitsuki.
-Yes?

8
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,695
You don't have to stay up and wait for me.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,947
I mean it.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,323
Mama.

11
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,117
-Okay.
-Yanyan.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,286
Mama.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,371
Bye.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,665
-Have a good day.
-Mama.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,460
Yanyan.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,044
Mama.

17
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,924
Okay, let's watch Yanyan.

18
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,676
-Yanyan.
-Yeah.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,969
-Yanyan.
-Yanyan.

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,764
Let's Yanyan together.

21
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,931
LET'S YANYAN TOGETHER

22
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,433
Yanyan.

23
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,145
Yanyan.

24
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,106
Yanyan.

25
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,484
Yanyan.

26
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,527
Yanyan.

27
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,368
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,978
1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

29
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,106
Ichiko,

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,859
you finally had
your first brothel experience.

31
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,653
Congratulations.

32
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,947
Is it something to congratulate?

33
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,366
So, how was it?

34
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,119
Well…

35
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,916
Absolutely

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,001
mind blowing.

37
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,087
Okay, wait.

38
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,340
Give me the details. Which part?
What did he do?

39
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,843
He was just

40
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,427
so good at it.

41
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,971
So skilled.

42
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,558
He paid close attention to my reactions.

43
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,519
Even though we aren't lovers or friends,

44
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,438
it was like we were completely in sync.

45
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,317
It made me realize how important
it is to have a good technique.

46
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,070
When you need something done,
turn to a pro. Really.

47
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,031
Oh, wow.

48
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,703
But if it was that good,
wouldn't you get addicted?

49
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,332
No, I think I'll be okay

50
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,001
since it costs money.

51
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,380
Actually, it got me excited

52
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,884
and now I want to have sex with Otoyan.

53
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,344
You can escape the sexless phase.

54
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,096
We don't know yet.

55
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,518
But now, instead of aggressively pushing
for it like I did before,

56
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,981
I think I can try again with a more gentle
and considerate approach this time.

57
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,321
Is it really a good thing that
a young pro got you excited?

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,282
He was incredibly good, right?

59
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,533
Yeah.

60
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:23,662
So can sex with your husband satisfy you?

61
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,374
Wouldn't you compare the two of them?

62
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,215
Sorry. It's not like I know anything
about Otoya's technique.

63
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,093
It's just a general observation.

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,181
So…

65
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,808
As a general observation,

66
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:50,147
it's like the difference between enjoying
a professional chef's cooking

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,316
and something home-cooked.

68
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:58,447
They each give you a different
kind of joy, nourishment, and comfort.

69
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,326
So they are different,
but each one is good on its own. I think.

70
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,247
Talking about sex like this
makes it kind of bland.

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,292
Well, anyway,

72
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:14,922
I pray that you and your husband
become the first couple

73
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,132
to get out of the sexless phase.

74
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,929
To score a score, huh?

75
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,849
No dad jokes, please.

76
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,685
Okay.

77
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,855
What?

78
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,610
Mama!

79
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,820
Hiro.

80
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,160
Thank you for today.

81
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,913
Let's change your shoes.

82
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,166
Mrs. Kashiwagi.

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,587
Hiro changed all of his clothes by himself
for the first time today.

84
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,006
-Really?
-Yes.

85
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,967
That's great, Hiro.

86
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,305
He's slowly learning to do more things.

87
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,891
Right, Hiro.

88
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,904
Hiro.

89
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,453
You're amazing. Doing your best every day.

90
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,544
Mama will do her best too.

91
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,798
I'll do my best to be someone really cool.

92
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,677
So give me a hug.

93
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,184
Thank you, Hiro.

94
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,519
Mama.

95
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,690
I love you.

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,750
Hey, Otoyan.

97
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,630
Can you set the table
with our seats next to each other?

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,839
Why?

99
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,093
I just feel like eating next to you.

100
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,275
Have some, have some.

101
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,819
Thank you, thank you.

102
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,656
-Pour for me?
-Sure.

103
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,991
-Have some, have some.
-Thank you, thank you.

104
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,119
Okay.

105
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,289
-Now, cheers.
-Cheers.

106
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,631
So good.

107
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,844
These cups you bought are really cute.

108
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,512
Thank you.

109
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,732
-Is it good? The turnip and salmon.
-Yeah.

110
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,573
-Yummy.
-Yeah.

111
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,331
Sitting like this is like that movie,
The Family Game.

112
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,835
-Yeah. It feels different.
-Yeah.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,219
What?

114
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,934
I was thinking about how I like your face.

115
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,019
What? Really?

116
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,062
-Yeah.
-Which part?

117
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,274
You have really good features,

118
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,820
but sometimes you are not that attractive.

119
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,240
What does that mean?

120
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,742
No, for real.

121
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,171
Ichiko.

122
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,255
Yeah?

123
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,844
I think I'm all healed.

124
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,804
Healed?

125
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,641
Yeah. My crotch.

126
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,272
Okay.

127
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,403
So,

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,242
how about tonight?

129
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,205
Okay.

130
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,053
Our relationship is going well.

131
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,473
It might not be a happy marriage.

132
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,268
We had our hurdles

133
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,228
and got hurt.

134
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,356
Well, only Otoyan got hurt.

135
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:31,280
But even when our hearts and bodies
were with other people,

136
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:36,576
neither of us ever thought about
leaving this marriage.

137
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,829
-Can I eat the meat?
-Go ahead.

138
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,163
The egg is so good.

139
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,749
We can make up as many times as we need.

140
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,921
That's how we can make
our marriage work for us.

141
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,840
What?

142
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,611
Sorry, Ichiko.

143
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,281
No.

144
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,950
You don't need to be sorry.

145
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,304
You've been through a lot.

146
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,389
It happens.

147
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,685
Yeah.

148
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,520
Thank you.

149
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,859
Ichiko.

150
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,614
Let me pleasure you.

151
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,408
Okay.

152
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,971
Otoyan gave it his all,

153
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,016
and he did it with love.

154
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,812
He did it for me,

155
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,897
but…

156
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,529
it was like, "What?

157
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,074
Was that it?"

158
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,830
No, no. I'm not comparing him to a pro.

159
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,748
And it's not Otoyan's fault.

160
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,835
Right. Love. We love each other.

161
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,089
STAG ENERGY

162
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,765
However…

163
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,187
No way.

164
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,523
Why?

165
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,026
It won't.

166
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:52,522
Was sex something this serious and grave?

167
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,859
Hey, Otoyan.

168
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,201
Wouldn't it be good to take it easy
instead of forcing yourself?

169
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,330
Yeah.

170
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,707
You're right.

171
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,588
Even after we break up,

172
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,050
I don't want you to have sex
with anyone else.

173
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,677
This is bad.

174
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,472
If I don't forget about what she said,

175
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,140
I will…

176
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,855
It's okay.

177
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,483
We both want it

178
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,069
so we'll be able to do it eventually.

179
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,866
Then contact me if you need anything.

180
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,868
Even if it's just to talk.

181
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,124
When you need something done,

182
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,210
turn to a pro, right?

183
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,799
So, how are things now?

184
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,260
Is your husband still refusing you?

185
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,721
No. We got past that.

186
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:11,184
Now we're in the
let's-rekindle-the-flame-and-do-it phase.

187
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,019
Oh, nice.

188
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,855
Well,

189
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,984
I think we're doing good most of the time.

190
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,735
But

191
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,781
we have not--

192
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,534
My husband's isn't at all…

193
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,372
Is that what's going on?

194
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,210
He's getting more and more depressed,

195
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,462
and I'm trying to act as if it's okay,

196
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,715
but it's not okay at all.

197
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,263
Rei, have you ever been asked
for advice about that at your job?

198
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,683
Yeah, sometimes.

199
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,062
But it's difficult.

200
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,941
It's not like I can give answers
like an expert.

201
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,988
But it seems to happen the most
with very serious guys.

202
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,451
Serious? I guess he is.

203
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,911
My husband is a very serious man.

204
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,458
If it's a psychological problem,

205
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,168
there's always counseling.

206
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,505
Go to a hospital? I wonder if he would.

207
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:28,261
Even if he keeps trying,
it will only make him feel more pressured.

208
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,680
That's true.

209
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,017
Having said that,

210
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,856
you'll end up drifting apart if you stop
having a physical relationship.

211
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,112
So,

212
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,117
instead of doing it for sex, are you
both able to touch and hug each other?

213
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,369
Naturally?

214
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,621
Yes, but

215
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,999
I guess it's a bit unnatural.

216
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,043
I see.

217
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,715
Okay, then…

218
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,636
Okay, bye.

219
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,845
Bye.

220
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:11,930
Thanks.

221
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,310
See you.

222
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,623
Hello? This is Ichiko Aihara.

223
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,376
Yes.

224
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,837
The competition from the other day?

225
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,174
Really?

226
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,218
Yes.

227
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,011
Thank you. Yes.

228
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,513
I can do it.

229
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,390
Yes.

230
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,559
Thank you.

231
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,477
Goodbye.

232
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,525
Yes.

233
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,450
MOM

234
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,871
Hello, Mom?

235
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,209
-Did you hear? The unofficial notice.
-What?

236
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,630
It was so blatant. Some of the younger
ones will be sent to useless positions.

237
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,299
Really? Like who?

238
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,092
Otoya Aihara.

239
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,222
Isn't it good for him?
There's no overtime in that department.

240
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,974
He looks like he likes not having work.

241
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,268
That's true.

242
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,280
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

243
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,573
Hi.

244
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,955
Did he hear us?

245
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,542
I don't know.

246
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,710
Shit.

247
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,796
-You think he heard us?
-He must have.

248
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,547
SALES PROMOTION
AND PLANNING DEPT - FILE ROOM

249
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,049
What's up, Ichiko?

250
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,802
Sorry to call you at work.

251
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,094
Can you talk?

252
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,972
Yeah, I was about to go to lunch.

253
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,098
Thanks.

254
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,810
My mom called me.

255
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:26,815
It looks like they found
a polyp or a hernia in her medical exams.

256
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,358
Is she okay?

257
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,322
She said she's having
minor surgery tomorrow

258
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,491
and is suddenly feeling nervous about it.

259
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,953
She didn't say it,

260
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,288
but it looks like
she wants me to be there.

261
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,043
But I have an important meeting tomorrow
for a new project.

262
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,712
I'll go. Tomorrow is my day off anyway.

263
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,798
Are you sure?

264
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,634
I'm so sorry about this.
That would be a big help.

265
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,928
It's okay.

266
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,347
Then thank you.

267
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,307
No problem.

268
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:24,873
Mother.

269
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,500
You did great.

270
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,380
The polyp was safely removed.

271
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,924
How are you feeling?

272
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,845
That anesthetic.

273
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,472
It made me so relaxed.

274
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,435
I fell right asleep counting to three.

275
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,273
It would be nice to die like that.

276
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,361
If you're thirsty, here. Drink this.

277
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,071
How kind of you.

278
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,625
Thank you.

279
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,506
That is very convenient.

280
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,550
The store was selling it too.

281
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:25,600
Ichiko would never be this thoughtful.

282
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,397
She probably would give me the bottle
without the straw.

283
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,399
Then I'd spill it.

284
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,863
And she'd get mad and throw me a tissue.

285
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,367
That's how she is.

286
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,833
A girl like that

287
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,837
makes me worry about her being a mother.

288
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,594
She's so inconsiderate
and does everything her way.

289
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:14,107
Don't mothers have to put
their child's happiness first?

290
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,527
That's right.

291
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,322
But I suppose

292
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,536
it will be hard for her to have children.

293
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,456
She's already quite old.

294
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,380
And giving birth when you're older is…

295
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,511
Otoya.

296
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,473
You like children, right?

297
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,144
So…

298
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,397
I feel so bad and sorry for you.

299
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,649
No, it's fine.

300
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,735
I'm okay.

301
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,663
NEW WAYS OF CONNECTING
PEOPLE AND THE SEA

302
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,724
I'm home.

303
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,985
You surprised me.

304
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,987
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

305
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,614
So you were working here.

306
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,742
Yeah. The tea table is here.

307
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,036
And I can concentrate
when I hide away like this.

308
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,248
Right. Thank you for looking after my mom.

309
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,833
You really helped me out.

310
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,211
Sure. It's good that
it wasn't anything serious.

311
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,255
She always makes a big deal of things.

312
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:07,178
I'll buy you anything you want for dinner.
I'm getting a lot of money from this job.

313
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,013
Okay…

314
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,687
Sorry, I'll take this work call.

315
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,439
Okay. Good night.

316
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:19,816
Good night.

317
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,319
Hello, this is Ichiko Aihara.

318
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,947
Sure.

319
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,533
Oh, yes.

320
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,494
Yes.

321
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,974
Welcome.

322
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,519
-For one?
-Yes, I'm alone.

323
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,444
I'll have a gimlet.

324
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,529
Sure.

325
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,282
-Thanks.
-No problem.

326
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,908
You already drank quite a bit, huh?

327
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,493
Oh, shut up.

328
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,846
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

329
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,498
Thank you.

330
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,666
It was nothing.

331
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,967
I'm gonna turn it off.

332
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,139
Sorry.

333
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,142
You picked it up for me, but…

334
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,310
It's all right.

335
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,901
I had a big fight with my fiancé.

336
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,279
So I don't want to talk to him right now.

337
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:32,657
I see.

338
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,330
You're married, right?

339
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,123
Yes.

340
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,503
Sorry about being drunk.

341
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:51,717
But aren't there times like this
even when you're married?

342
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,512
When you don't want to see
your wife's face.

343
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:57,974
Yes, sometimes.

344
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,726
I knew it.

345
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,857
Hold on.

346
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,485
Don't tell me.

347
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,320
Today? You too?

348
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,330
I see.

349
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,258
Your hands…

350
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,387
are so big and beautiful.

351
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,145
Wanna leave

352
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,857
and go somewhere else with me?

353
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:55,906
Somewhere else?

354
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,492
Yeah.

355
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,119
Somewhere else.

356
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,999
I can, but

357
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,296
I'll be thinking about my wife
the entire time.

358
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,424
If that's okay with you, then sure.

359
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,348
What's with this guy?

360
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,433
He's so mean.

361
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,231
I'm done. The bill please.

362
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,609
Sure. Thank you.

363
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,328
Thank you.

378
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,571
I'm back.

379
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,037
-How pretty.
-It is.

380
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,999
It's so pretty, right?

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,376
That's right.

382
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:21,714
One of the flowers we'll be using today is
the Chinese peony.

383
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,175
Everyone, be sure
to arrange it in your own style.

384
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,343
-Yes.
-Yes.

385
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:27,845
In the flower language,

386
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,140
the red Chinese peony means
"honest" and "faithful."

387
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:37,229
A white Chinese peony
means a "happy marriage."

388
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,690
-Oh, wow.
-That's nice.

389
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,400
Now let's have some fun.

390
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,901
-Yes.
-Okay.

391
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,614
-Isn't it an impressive flower?
-Amazing.

392
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,450
The gerbera daisy is also very large.

393
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,910
This one is also a new variety.

394
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,844
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

395
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,277
What is that, Otoyan?

396
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,490
What? Oh, this?

397
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,451
This is a Chinese peony.

398
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,370
A white peony means--

399
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,537
Not that.

400
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,791
Don't tell me you're still going
to that flower class.

401
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,335
Why didn't you quit?

402
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,255
Listen, Ichiko.

403
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,676
Mitsuki already left the class.
She's moving with her family.

404
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,053
It's not about whether she's there or not.

405
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:56,350
Why are you still going to the class where
you both met, like you still miss her?

406
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,310
What exactly do you want to do?

407
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:01,980
Ikebana.

408
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,654
Besides, it would look weird
if I quit right after she left.

409
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,074
In the first place, I started going
because I wanted to learn ikebana.

410
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,284
I have no reason to quit.

411
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,250
Don't put that in our home.

412
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,549
I'm going back to work.

413
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,300
-Ichiko.
-What?

414
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,097
I didn't get a chance
to say this the other day,

415
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,809
but you should be nicer to your mom.

416
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,728
At least give her a call.

417
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,149
Sure, she likes to exaggerate,

418
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,485
but she is sick and scared.

419
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,031
Okay.

420
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,136
You bastard.

421
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,305
You dumb bastard.

422
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:01,517
MOM

423
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,268
A message should be okay.

424
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,690
PLEASE ANSWER THE PHONE.
I CALLED OTOYA.

425
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,443
OKAY. WE WILL ARRIVE SOON

426
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,528
REI - HELLO, ICHIKO.

427
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,112
IT'S REI
FROM SALON FLOWER GARDEN

428
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,991
Rei.

429
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,961
WERE THERE ANY CHANGES
TO YOUR SEXLESS PROBLEM?

430
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,590
I FOUND SOME NEW INFORMATION
TO TELL YOU NEXT TIME WE MEET

431
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,054
He could have sent it in the message.
But he wrote "next time we meet."

432
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,682
Oh, Rei.

433
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,931
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

434
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,267
That smells nice.

435
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,738
Here.

436
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,947
Thanks.

437
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,372
Hey, Ichiko.

438
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,920
I think I'll quit the ikebana class.

439
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,131
I realized I was being insensitive,

440
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,133
not thinking about your feelings.

441
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,302
What? Why?

442
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:02,930
What?

443
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,975
I thought about it too.

444
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:12,856
I got emotional and blew up at you
without listening to what you had to say.

445
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,692
And so I think I wasn't thinking clearly.

446
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,028
Sorry.

447
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:20,948
No.

448
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,327
Otoyan, you should keep going.

449
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,123
Since you like it so much,
it will be a shame if you quit.

450
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,963
Don't we need relief and joy in our lives?

451
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,843
And that is okay?

452
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,179
It's perfectly okay.

453
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,403
Thank you for your waiting.
Here is your tea.

454
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,654
Thank you.

455
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,744
I thought this was a good idea
when I heard about it.

456
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,165
Let's call her Miss B. Her marriage had
been sexless for over a year.

457
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,419
She hasn't gone to a concert in a while,
but when she went,

458
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,296
she was turned on
by the sexy, mature singer.

459
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,342
She got home
still feeling hot and bothered,

460
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,638
immediately pounced
on her sleeping husband and scored.

461
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,976
Scored a score.

462
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:32,769
Now she says

463
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,940
every time they have a dry spell,
she goes to that artist's concert

464
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,276
to get herself in the mood.

465
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,403
I see.

466
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,073
Is that artist Okamura-chan?

467
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,452
No, I didn't ask.

468
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,999
Oh, and there are couples who are
dry like a rock garden

469
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,252
where both agree it's okay if
that is not a part of their relationship.

470
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:06,344
But don't the women in those couples
go to you for treatment?

471
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,431
Yeah, they do.

472
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,271
So I guess there are some people
who believe they don't need their partners

473
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,775
to satisfy their desires
or give them sexual fulfillment

474
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,110
because people like you exist.

475
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,032
Should I say thank you?

476
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,247
Me making another appointment with you
is an entirely different matter.

477
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:35,957
Of course.

478
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,172
Actually, Ichiko.

479
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,673
Yeah?

480
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,303
I'm going to quit the salon
at the end of this month.

481
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,388
Oh, really?

482
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,185
I was only doing it until I saved
enough money for graduate school.

483
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,691
I wanted to tell you in person.

484
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,073
You did tell me when we first met.

485
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,034
You've really got it together.

486
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,412
Good luck with your studies.

487
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,462
Ichiko. Don't make that face.

488
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,299
Can I sit next to you?

489
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,106
Look at me.

490
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,913
Welcome.

491
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,084
Ordering take out?

492
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,169
-Yes.
-Okay.

493
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,880
One Ethiopian and one Guatemalan, please.

494
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:05,964
Okay.

495
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,551
Are these the right ones?

496
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,677
Yes.

497
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,054
That will be 3,500 yen.

498
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,062
-That is the exact change.
-Yes.

499
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,273
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

500
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,026
-Our apologies.
-I'm sorry.

501
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,569
That surprised me. Is it okay?

502
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,487
Yeah, everything is okay.

503
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:49,341
Thank you.

504
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,426
Ichiko?

505
00:41:56,139 --> 00:42:00,560
Was that your husband?
The person looking this way?

506
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,021
Yeah.

507
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,731
Oh, okay.

508
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,485
Did I do something bad?

509
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,362
Since I'm sitting close to you.

510
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,991
We were holding hands too.

511
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,161
Friends do that too, don't they?

512
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,998
Friends don't normally hold hands, right?

513
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,792
Really?

514
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,169
Yeah.

515
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,551
But

516
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,929
I think it will be okay.

517
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,725
My husband doesn't care about this stuff.

518
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,603
He's not the jealous type.

519
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,565
Plus we have an open relationship.

520
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,278
Okay.

521
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,738
Yeah.

522
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,880
Otoyan?

523
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,179
What are you doing?

524
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,433
Well…

525
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,561
Sorry for going through your phone.

526
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,146
Don't do it anymore.

527
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,024
I was curious since

528
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:34,946
you were acting lovey-dovey at the café,
not caring about what other people think.

529
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,743
That was a friend.

530
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,787
Friend?

531
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,959
Is that why you were flirting
at a place I also shop at?

532
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,219
"Hello, Ichiko.

533
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,889
It's Rei from Salon Flower Garden.

534
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,975
Were there any changes
to your sexless problem?"

535
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,735
You were talking about me

536
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,195
with that friend.

537
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,033
Those messages came

538
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,702
from that man you were with today, right?

539
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,665
-That's right.
-Who is he?

540
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,835
Tell me, what exactly are you doing?

541
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,132
He is…

542
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,304
a fortune-teller.

543
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:48,353
He's famous for reading tarot cards
despite how he looks.

544
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,191
He's young but really skilled and has
proven results. So my friend introduced--

545
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,736
So you'd say, "I'm really happy
I slept with you, Rei. Thank you,"

546
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,198
to a tarot-reading psychic.

547
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,164
Why…

548
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,250
Why?

549
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,335
What?

550
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:18,883
Ichiko.

551
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,221
I don't need obvious lies like that.

552
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,394
What is the Flower Garden?

553
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,397
Where did you meet him?

554
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,571
-At the salon.
-What kind of salon?

555
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,410
Beauty salon.

556
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,706
There are men in that beauty salon?

557
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,796
It's considered a beauty salon.

558
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,218
To put it simply…

559
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,433
it's a brothel.

560
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,481
A brothel?

561
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,361
Ichiko.

562
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:26,659
You bought a man with money. I see.

563
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:29,287
It's payment for services received.

564
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:35,877
Just so you know,
I only slept with him once.

565
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,381
Your affair lasted over a year.
You had sex with Mitsuki multiple times--

566
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,509
Now wait a minute, Ichiko.

567
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,094
The number isn't the problem, okay?

568
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,307
My affair was something
we discussed and decided together.

569
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,809
And you were happy with that
since you didn't want to have sex.

570
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,645
And I never hid it from you.

571
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:59,734
I fell in love
and slept with someone I like.

572
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:02,946
What about you?

573
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,407
You bought a younger man with money.

574
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,202
It's completely different.

575
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,579
That's prostitution.

576
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,135
Do you like him, Ichiko?

577
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:28,972
It's not about that.

578
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,350
So you're okay with having sex
with a man you don't even like.

579
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,192
I needed to.

580
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,365
I wasn't okay with it.

581
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,078
Not one bit.

582
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,750
I was so scared and kept hesitating.

583
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,004
But it was something I really needed.

584
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,343
I used up my time, courage, and money
to go there.

585
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,306
I took on all the risks
and responsibilities. I was serious.

586
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,309
But that's what saved me.

587
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,271
And this is my problem.

588
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,816
You don't have any right
to get mad at me for it.

589
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,206
Do…

590
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:41,836
Do you really…

591
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,423
think so?

592
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,650
Hey, wait.

593
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,570
Hey, Otoyan. Where are you going?

594
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,238
Don't touch me.

595
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,457
That wasn't jealousy.

596
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,126
That was definitely

597
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,879
a look of disdain.

598
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:47,360
The strength he used to push me away

599
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:49,612
made me realize

600
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,616
Otoyan is a man.

601
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,878
TEST RESULTS
PREGNANT - NOT PREGNANT

602
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:58,598
NEXT EPISODE

603
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:02,018
We need some time apart
to calmly think about things.

604
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,519
THEY HAVE SEPARATED!

605
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,855
Is it really bad? Mud-fight bad?

606
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,318
It's nice that you could talk
to her like a friend.

607
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,236
But I guess she really became your friend.

608
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,155
Are you lonely now with Otoya gone?

609
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,157
Yeah.

610
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:20,870
Just living together with a partner
you get along with is priceless.

611
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,455
I want to have the baby.

612
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:25,124
Do you know who the father is?

613
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,418
It made me want to see you.

614
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:28,377
A NEW LOVE?

615
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,548
We might have been stuck circling
the same spot in the past

616
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,051
and will do that even in the future, but…

617
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,887
We were serious, weren't we?

618
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,264
We never broke up.

619
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,892
THE HAPPINESS THEY CHOSE IS…

620
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,648
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

621
