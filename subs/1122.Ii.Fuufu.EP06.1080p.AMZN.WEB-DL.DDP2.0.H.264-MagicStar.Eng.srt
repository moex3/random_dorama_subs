1
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,904
I realized it once again
after Otoyan left.

2
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,074
He was the one

3
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,620
who always cleaned up after me.

4
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:47,423
ONE WEEK AGO

5
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,553
What are you doing?

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,680
Did I wake you?

7
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,016
Sorry. Good morning.

8
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,894
Forget about "good morning."

9
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,104
Where did you go yesterday?

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,149
The business hotel
in front of the station.

11
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,571
Ichiko, I'm planning on staying
at a weekly hotel for two or three weeks.

12
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,573
Why?

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,410
What for? To get back at me?

14
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,498
That's not why.

15
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,709
We need some time

16
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:25,544
apart.

17
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:27,963
To calmly think about things.

18
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:30,925
About ourselves

19
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,885
and our marriage.

20
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,111
-Tohko.
-Yeah?

21
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,157
I'm sorry this is last minute,
but let me stay at your place tonight.

22
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,286
The weekly hotel near my office
will have a room available tomorrow.

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,038
Sure, but--

24
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,082
what happened?

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,501
Well,

26
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,671
just the usual stuff
between a husband and wife.

27
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,426
You don't need to tell me.

28
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,388
But is it really bad?

29
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,223
Mud-fight bad?

30
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,187
Don't tell me you might get a divorce.

31
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,648
No.

32
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,149
We're not getting a divorce.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,361
Actually,

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,865
I'm trying to prevent us from getting one.

35
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,456
You know, I like Ichiko,

36
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,711
but sometimes marriages come to an end
no matter what you do.

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
Hey.

38
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,970
Why did you get a divorce?

39
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,598
The two of you always looked happy.

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,934
I never told you?

41
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,019
Yeah.

42
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,648
Let's see.

43
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,943
I think it started

44
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,114
when I got promoted and started
making more money than him.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,451
It ruined the balance we had.

46
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,331
I was always on edge
due to the extra work and pressure.

47
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,293
So he started getting annoyed about that.

48
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,379
We started fighting more.

49
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,133
But you know, once we got past all that,

50
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,302
we had already stopped
talking to each other.

51
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,679
Towards the end,

52
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,766
we didn't even know
what each other was doing

53
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,601
or how we spent the day.

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,814
You had been together
since you were 20, right?

55
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,358
Yeah.

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,948
He was always better than me at studying,
had a better job and made more money.

57
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,659
And both of us got used to that.

58
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,328
But I think as we got older,

59
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,001
neither of us could accept the changes
in the balance of our relationship.

60
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,712
Especially him.

61
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,842
He didn't seem like that to me.

62
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,597
He was friendly
and didn't act like a macho guy at all.

63
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:29,687
Feminine men have deep-rooted issues
with their pride as men.

64
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,399
Well, he has his reasons,

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,194
but I don't care to learn about them now.

66
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,281
Hey, Otoya.

67
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,243
Don't you have any friends?

68
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,496
Someone you can tell everything to.

69
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,165
I guess not.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,045
But I could tell Ichiko everything.

71
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,632
But aren't there things
you can't talk to her about?

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,928
Yeah, you're right.

73
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,600
It's nice that you could talk to her
like a friend.

74
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,020
But I guess she really became your friend.

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
What?

76
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,982
Nothing.

77
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,869
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

78
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,906
I'm back.

79
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,114
I'm back.

80
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,908
Welcome back.

81
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,751
Are you okay? You don't look good.

82
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,129
Yeah.

83
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,631
I feel much better after sleeping.

84
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,466
Thanks.

85
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,143
Why don't I sleep with Hiro today?

86
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,687
What?

87
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,441
Thank you.

88
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,444
Call me if you need me.

89
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,033
If you can't go to the wedding tomorrow,

90
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,369
I can go alone.

91
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,916
I think I'll be fine tomorrow.

92
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,965
Did you take medicine?

93
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,010
No.

94
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,981
Mitsuki.

95
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,323
Are you pregnant?

96
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,869
This is just like when you had Hiro.

97
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,807
I went to the hospital today
to get tested.

98
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,313
They said I'm five weeks.

99
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,572
Do you know

100
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,616
who the father is?

101
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,743
Yeah.

102
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,205
The baby is ours.

103
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,749
How can you be so sure?

104
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,836
He and I…

105
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,297
We stopped a long time ago.

106
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,216
Sleeping together.

107
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,355
I don't expect you to believe me

108
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,442
after what I did.

109
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,529
But it's the truth.

110
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,166
What do you plan to do?

111
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,682
I want to have the baby.

112
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,746
After the baby is born…

113
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:27,002
I will have to raise it
not knowing if it is really my child?

114
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,049
I'm planning…

115
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,094
I won't earn as much as you,

116
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,432
but I plan to start working again.
I've been job searching.

117
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,975
No.

118
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,187
Wouldn't it be impossible for you
while you're pregnant,

119
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,813
and even after giving birth?

120
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,232
That is what happened when you had Hiro.

121
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,987
Are you saying that

122
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,701
because you think your job
is more important than your family

123
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,787
or taking care of our home?

124
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,288
Don't change the subject.

125
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,664
I'm not changing the subject.

126
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,837
You just throw everything about Hiro
and your mom onto me.

127
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,507
Ignoring anything that is a hassle.

128
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,259
What hassle? Aren't we a family?

129
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,642
Aren't we a family?

130
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,483
Aren't we a family?

131
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,946
I can't believe you can even ask me that.

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,410
We are a family.

133
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,454
Me taking on all of Hiro's care,

134
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,791
keeping a relationship with a mom
who urges me to join a weird religion,

135
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,875
is all for family.

136
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,838
You choose to ignore it,

137
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,215
but every day is filled with
annoying hassles.

138
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,059
Why are you looking away? Tell me.

139
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,606
Is this family just mine alone?

140
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,280
It's your family too.

141
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,294
Mitsuki, you…

142
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,884
How can you think about
having another child

143
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,721
when you already have so much to handle?

144
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,020
When it's the child
of someone useless like me.

145
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,579
Giving birth to Hiro,

146
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,998
raising him…

147
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:19,424
There are an endless number of things
to worry about and suffer through.

148
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,387
Even so…

149
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,684
the happiness and joy I feel
outweighs them all.

150
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,275
When I found out I was pregnant again,

151
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,111
I was scared

152
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,739
and anxious.

153
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,286
But it still gave me hope.

154
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,711
Besides…

155
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,133
I don't think it's the child of someone
who is useless.

156
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,306
I want this baby

157
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,517
because it's your child.

158
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,785
I need some air.

159
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,036
Hey.

160
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,746
Running away without a word again?

161
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,630
Mama.

162
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,215
Mama. Mama.

163
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,426
Mama.

164
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,803
Mama. Mama.

165
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,014
Mama.

166
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,265
Good morning, Hiro.

167
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,767
Mama.

168
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,958
Good morning.

169
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,669
Good morning.

170
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,297
This…

171
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,552
You said you felt better after drinking
seltzer when you were pregnant with Hiro.

172
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,639
You remembered.

173
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,641
Thank you.

174
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,768
Yeah.

175
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,907
Let's go get changed with Mama.

176
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,159
Then after that, I'll give you a banana.

177
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,828
-Banana.
-Yeah.

178
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:47,006
Thank you all for making time
to come celebrate with us today.

179
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:55,473
Everyone, I just married

180
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,350
my Madonna, Yui.

181
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,229
As you already know,

182
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,274
we are now a stepfamily.

183
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,860
It was a long and difficult road…

184
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,153
Come here, Hiro.

185
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,738
-I'll do it.
-No.

186
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,114
Hiro.

187
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,950
No. No.

188
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,954
I am grateful to build a happy new life
with the best partner in the world, Yui,

189
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,748
and the coolest son in the world, Daigo.

190
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,834
Hiro.

191
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,546
I am also grateful to our family,
friends, and colleagues…

192
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,173
No!

193
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,300
-Stop right now.
-No.

194
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,968
Go back right now.

195
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,183
-Stop making a fuss.
-No!

196
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,267
Be quiet!

197
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,602
Shiro.

198
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,854
No. No.

199
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,148
I'll take him home.

200
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,777
Hiro, let's go home.

201
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,944
Go home.

202
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,738
Mama.

203
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,825
We're going home. Home.

204
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,039
Please give us your blessings.
Thank you so much.

205
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,342
No. No.

206
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,260
We're going home now.

207
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,137
No.

208
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,431
No!

209
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,016
-No.
-Hiro.

210
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,393
-You don't want to go home?
-No.

211
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,021
-Hiro.
-No.

212
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,690
-No.
-Home.

213
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,527
No. No.

214
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,945
Mitsuki.

215
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,739
Shiro.

216
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,659
I'll go with you.

217
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,494
No. No.

218
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,163
No.

219
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,248
Hiro.

220
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,792
We're going home.

221
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,126
Let's go.

222
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,922
No.

223
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,716
No. No.

224
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,094
No.

225
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,097
No.

226
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,482
Later that night,

227
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,488
we had a fight,
and my husband left the house.

228
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,325
So it wasn't okay.

229
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,662
Sorry. It was because of me.

230
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,916
No, it's not because of what you did.

231
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,128
It's a problem between me and him.

232
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,179
Ichiko, are you feeling depressed?

233
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,599
Yeah.

234
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,643
I guess I'm a little sad.

235
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,481
You even invited me out.
Sorry for my mood.

236
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,150
I know you're busy.

237
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,110
It's okay.

238
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,486
I was worried about you.

239
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,619
I come here sometimes.

240
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,704
And it's close to my university.

241
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,290
Okay.

242
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,961
Oh, so you weren't curious?

243
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,255
No.

244
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,844
It feels like I'm trespassing
when I hear about your life.

245
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,638
So it feels kind of wrong.

246
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,683
It is like the more I know
about your personal life,

247
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,188
the more real and human you become.

248
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,773
What does that even mean?

249
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,317
So I'm not a real human?

250
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:40,323
But is it okay for you
to meet your clients outside of the salon?

251
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,116
Yeah, it's okay.

252
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,870
You aren't a client anymore.

253
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:50,291
And besides, I already quit the salon.

254
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,460
-Right.
-Yeah.

255
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,270
-It's huge.
-Right?

256
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,689
And it was angry.

257
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,607
-Angry?
-Yeah, it was.

258
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,775
They were fighting?

259
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,700
It was horrible of me to say
you weren't a real human, wasn't it?

260
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,201
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,495
Not at all. Don't worry about it.

262
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,623
But,

263
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,335
it's what happens when money is involved.

264
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,548
You only demand what you want
from the other person

265
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,593
and skip the time and effort it takes
to know the other person.

266
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,141
The time and effort it takes
to know the other person?

267
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,642
Yeah.

268
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:56,941
Like knowing what the other person
will never compromise on

269
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,110
or what is important to them.

270
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,905
Doesn't the process
of getting to know a person

271
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,201
involve learning those things about
each other and choosing what to share?

272
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:13,458
But doing that takes
a ton of time and energy.

273
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,003
So I skipped all that

274
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,215
to enjoy myself and have sex.

275
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,178
And used money as compensation
for your services.

276
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,599
That is why I didn't really want to
know about you.

277
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,313
What?

278
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,898
It's nothing.

279
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:43,446
Most of my clients wanted to
get involved in my private life.

280
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,239
So this is new to me.

281
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,535
Plus,

282
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,455
I was thinking you're very honest.

283
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,124
Am I?

284
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,754
But I don't mean honest in a good way.

285
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,715
I know.

286
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,429
You're saying my honesty is
shallow and selfish, right?

287
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,142
I was basically saying,
it was nice and comfortable for me

288
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,978
because I was paying you,

289
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,773
so don't tell me about your life
since it's annoying.

290
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,819
Sounds pretty harsh when put into words.

291
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,161
So, Ichiko…

292
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,246
Yeah?

293
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,126
Were you looking to build a relationship
with your husband

294
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,169
that requires the time and effort needed?

295
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,465
Well, that was the plan.

296
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,595
But what really happened was this mess.

297
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,104
You know, Rei.

298
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:06,654
I have never regretted sleeping with you,
no matter what I've said.

299
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,159
I'm really grateful to you.

300
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,452
I'm glad I booked your services.

301
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,121
Thank you.

302
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,874
I see.

303
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,959
Then I'm glad.

304
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,139
Ichiko.

305
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,725
Do you have plans after this?

306
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,437
Want to have dinner with me?

307
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,316
Thanks.

308
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,069
But I'm going home. I have work to do.

309
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,157
Okay.

310
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,493
I guess there's no helping it.

311
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:42,291
I know I have no right to feel hurt.

312
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,888
ICHIKO AIHARA -
HOW ARE YOU DOING, OTOYAN?

313
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,978
HOW ARE YOU DOING, OTOYAN?

314
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:24,959
I'M GOOD. HOW ABOUT YOU?

315
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:43,728
YEAH, I'M FINE. DO YOU HAVE TIME
TO TALK TOMORROW AFTERNOON?

316
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:49,984
Why exactly

317
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,195
am I feeling so hurt?

318
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,371
SORRY, ICHIKO

319
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,498
I NEED MORE TIME
BEFORE I CAN TALK.

320
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,334
CAN YOU WAIT A LITTLE LONGER?

321
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,627
What does he mean by "a little longer"?

322
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,964
Until when?

323
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,967
But isn't he--

324
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,888
…too naive? We're both hitting middle age.

325
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,892
Is he named after some sort of princess?

326
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,644
I thought about it.

327
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,938
If I had to decide which is worse

328
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,524
between a husband having an affair
with someone of the same age

329
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,320
and with his wife's permission, or a wife
paying for sex with a hot 20-year old,

330
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,531
I'd say the wife paying for sex is worse.

331
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,076
It feels much more disgusting.

332
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,453
Hey. Wait, Keikei.

333
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,039
Didn't you say it was a great idea?

334
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,667
And that I also have the right
to sleep with other people?

335
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,835
No, no.

336
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,088
The disgusting one isn't you.

337
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,673
It's disgust
for the lopsided power balance.

338
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,884
The unfairness of it.

339
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,806
I gave you my support that time
because I knew your situation.

340
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,644
Yeah, but you still told me to do it.

341
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,937
But from what you said,

342
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,275
does that mean Otoya would be okay
if you had sex with that kid

343
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,735
because you fell in love with him?

344
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,865
Well, no.
I think he would really hate that.

345
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,411
Actually, even before thinking
about Otoyan's reactions,

346
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,747
I probably would never fall in love
with a younger guy.

347
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,542
Why? You were so excited about him.

348
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,628
I was excited because it was a fantasy.

349
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,505
When I imagine dating him,

350
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,425
all I can think about is
the responsibilities instead of the fun.

351
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,138
I guess I was looking for a safe way
to have fun within certain limits,

352
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,849
using money as the means.

353
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,643
Wow, I am a horrible old lady.

354
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,274
Just living together with a partner
you get along with is priceless.

355
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,234
It's extremely priceless.

356
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,904
I feel it keenly now that Otoyan left.

357
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:04,285
Like how you would be grateful
for good health after getting sick.

358
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,328
Yeah, Otoya seems like a perfect partner.

359
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,413
Yeah.

360
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,709
We always had similar beliefs
and preferences,

361
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,379
and we started to think alike
the longer we were together,

362
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,883
as if we embodied
"I am you and you are me."

363
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,676
You're turning into each other?

364
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:26,307
But I think the other person needs
to be different from you

365
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,479
for you to feel attraction or lust.

366
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,106
I think the eroticism is
in being curious about the unknown,

367
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,943
wanting to know more about him
and wanting to get closer.

368
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,404
I think I get it.

369
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,451
I think my sexual desire for Otoyan
started to disappear

370
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,662
when I began to think
it was so comfortable

371
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,706
that we started turning into each other,

372
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,711
even though we are two different
and separate individuals.

373
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,255
Disappear, huh?

374
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,217
And also your--

375
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,676
-calm sea.
-Calm sea. Right.

376
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,568
Are you lonely now with Otoya gone?

377
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,740
Yeah.

378
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,541
Okay.

379
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,584
Here.

380
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,973
Your ketone bodies have increased.

381
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,809
Are you eating properly?

382
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,271
Well, sometimes.

383
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,776
It might be best for you
to get hospitalized.

384
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,780
I can't. I would like to avoid that.

385
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,660
Then I'll give you an IV.
You'll need to stay for a while, though.

386
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,247
-Please.
-All right. I'll get it prepared.

387
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,254
SHIRO, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I'M
GETTING AN IV AT THE HOSPITAL.

388
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,423
CAN YOU PICK UP HIRO?
I'LL LET THE SCHOOL KNOW.

389
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,647
OKAY
BE SURE TO REST WELL

390
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,777
THANKS

391
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:43,253
HERE'S HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIM

392
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,297
Let's Yanyan together.

393
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,507
LET'S YANYAN TOGETHER

394
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,301
Yanyan. Yanyan.

395
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,096
Yanyan.

396
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,557
Yanyan.

397
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,810
Yanyan.

398
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,728
Yanyan.

399
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,356
Play the Yanyan video for him,

400
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,774
give him a banana,

401
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,276
and when he's in a good mood,

402
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,862
slip behind him and take off his clothes.

403
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:09,947
Yanyan.

404
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,825
Yanyan.

405
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,909
Hiro.

406
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,080
-It's a banana. Hiro.
-Yanyan.

407
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,290
Yanyan.

408
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,001
Yanyan.

409
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,421
-Yanyan.
-Hiro, here's your banana.

410
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,173
Yanyan. Yanyan.

411
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,967
Yanyan.

412
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,429
Yanyan. Yanyan.

413
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,389
"Slip behind him
and take off his clothes…"

414
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,308
That's impossible.

415
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,231
Giving him a bath is hard.
But if he manages to take one,

416
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,818
he'll panic if his face gets wet

417
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,028
so wipe his face frequently with a towel.

418
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,240
If you count while you wash off his hair,

419
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,368
he'll stay somewhat calm.

420
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,585
I'm going to count to five slowly.
It will be over in five.

421
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,254
Okay. Here we go.

422
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,797
One.

423
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,924
Two.

424
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,927
Hey. Stop that!

425
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,236
Mama.

426
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,030
Mama.

427
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,157
-Hiro. Time to sleep.
-Mama.

428
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,535
He'll cry and roll around,

429
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,162
but he'll eventually fall asleep.

430
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,708
He's not sleeping at all.

431
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,251
Mama.

432
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,087
Mama.

433
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:58,722
Hiro.

434
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:00,974
Hiro.

435
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,729
Look, it's Yanyan. Yanyan.

436
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,357
-Yanyan?
-Yeah, Yanyan.

437
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,402
Hiro, show Papa which one is Yanyan.

438
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,030
-Yanyan.
-This is Yanyan.

439
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,698
LOST YANYAN

440
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,991
Want to read it?

441
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,076
Yeah.

442
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,166
"Yanyan is lost in space."

443
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,751
Yanyan.

444
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,044
This is Yanyan?

445
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:37,052
"Space is a much bigger star
than the Earth.

446
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,557
One day, Yanyan--"

447
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,724
Yanyan.

448
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,352
-Is this Yanyan?
-Yeah.

449
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,980
Is he an alien? Is Yanyan an alien?

450
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,149
You don't know, huh?

451
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,902
"One day, Yanyan met Yurayura

452
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:58,282
who fell from space.

453
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,453
I am also searching for space.

454
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,539
Can I join you?

455
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,293
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

456
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,464
Hello?"

457
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,591
Yanyan.

458
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,176
This is Yanyan? He's cute.

459
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,497
Welcome back.

460
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,541
Thanks.

461
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,793
Is Hiro sleeping?

462
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,546
He just fell asleep.

463
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,215
Thank you.

464
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,470
How are you feeling?

465
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,139
Yeah.

466
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,268
Much better after getting the IV.

467
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,526
You're tired, right?

468
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,028
Yeah.

469
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,031
He panicked because I wasn't Mama.

470
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,367
Of course.

471
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,495
So you couldn't bathe him?

472
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,205
I did.

473
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,957
But he cried.

474
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:33,710
Really?

475
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,545
Somehow,

476
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,840
I managed to do it
by following your instructions.

477
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,928
Okay.

478
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:03,949
Are you okay?

479
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,871
Mitsuki?

480
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,425
It's been three days…

481
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,095
since he took a bath.

482
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,808
I couldn't give him a bath at all.

483
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,602
You can't help it.

484
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,855
You have bad morning sickness.

485
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,024
No.

486
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,070
It's not only the bath.

487
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,743
I couldn't stop him
from eating snacks instead of meals.

488
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,080
And I kept playing videos
for him to watch.

489
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,880
At night, he kept being fussy
and refused to sleep.

490
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,342
So it gave me such a headache
that I couldn't take it.

491
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,892
Yesterday…

492
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,147
I hit…

493
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,859
Hiro.

494
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,492
It wasn't the first time, either.

495
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,498
You didn't know, did you?

496
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,425
Hiro's having such a hard time,

497
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:51,598
but I can't even take care of myself
when I'm feeling like this.

498
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,354
But still…

499
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,775
why did I say I want to have this baby?

500
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,030
When I'm already like this?

501
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,997
I wonder if I really am an idiot.

502
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,528
Mitsuki.

503
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:55,412
Thank you for looking after him
by yourself all this time.

504
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,548
Sorry.

505
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,887
I thought I needed to be honest with you.

506
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,187
As Hiro started getting older…

507
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,610
we started to see
that his development wasn't normal.

508
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,907
But I didn't want to accept that.

509
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,537
So I think I turned a blind eye
and ignored the situation.

510
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,127
I stubbornly believed
my son wasn't like that.

511
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,676
But it could also be because…

512
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,933
I was more concerned
about how I looked to other people…

513
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,770
than about Hiro's life.

514
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,654
It was my fault you had an affair.

515
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,034
Since I kept saying
you were in charge of the home…

516
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,455
like it was a normal thing.

517
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,296
Didn't you say that, Mitsuki?

518
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,427
That we both have to change.

519
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,935
It's only a little bit, but I think…

520
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,606
I finally understand
what your words meant.

521
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,031
You're probably thinking,
"What the hell is he saying now?"

522
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:01,788
Shiro.

523
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,254
To be honest, I'm still not confident.

524
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,467
But if you'll forgive me,

525
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,470
if it's not too late…

526
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,308
I want to accept them.

527
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,228
Everything about Hiro

528
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,107
and the baby you're having.

529
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,782
Will you forgive me?

530
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

531
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,216
Thank you.

532
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,693
-It gets stuck here.
-That's right.

533
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,988
It opens up completely when you pull
the bottom out like this.

534
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,073
You're right.

535
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,875
Hello, Mother? What's the matter?

536
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,212
I'm so sorry, Otoya.

537
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,673
I tried calling Ichiko,
but she wouldn't answer.

538
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,886
She might be in a meeting.
Why did you call?

539
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:45,266
My kettle isn't working,
and my phone is acting weird.

540
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,851
Everything keeps disappearing.

541
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,397
You might need a new kettle.

542
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,651
Do you know what company
you got your smartphone from?

543
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,362
What company?

544
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,155
I have no idea.

545
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,409
Okay, I'll ask Ichiko.

546
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,702
Don't worry, I'll get it all fixed.

547
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,372
First, I'll send you a new kettle.

548
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,291
I'll ask the store about your phone
and call you back.

549
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,919
Thank you.

550
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,339
I'm so sorry to bother you
when you're so busy.

551
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:19,175
It's not a problem. I'll call you later.

552
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,803
Yes, thank you.

553
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,304
Bye.

554
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,976
So it's like a drawstring purse.

555
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,436
The handle is very nice.

556
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,785
YOUR MOTHER CALLED
SAYING HER KETTLE BROKE

557
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,078
SO I SENT HER THIS ONE

558
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,663
THANK YOU!
IT'S SO FANCY!

559
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,707
Ichiko hasn't messaged me

560
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,751
since this last one four days ago.

561
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,846
Thank you for waiting.
Here is your highball.

562
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,097
Thank you.

563
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,730
Don't tell me--

564
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,524
she's been having sex
with that good-looking guy?

565
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,486
She's too busy having sex?

566
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,290
But,

567
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,543
can I even say anything about her sex life

568
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,005
after getting mad
and leaving the house like that?

569
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,551
No. But I'm still her husband.

570
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,638
Wait, can't I just call her?

571
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,848
Come on. I can do it.

572
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,994
Hello?

573
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,039
Hello? Ichiko?

574
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,376
Sor--

575
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,342
Hello? Ichiko?

576
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,010
What?

577
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,477
Is she--

578
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,313
really going at it right now?

579
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,410
What?

580
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,870
SORRY, I HAVE A COLD

581
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,915
BY COLD, I MEAN WHOOPING COUGH
SO I CAN'T TALK

582
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,181
I'M COMING HOME FOR A BIT

583
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,403
Excuse me. The check, please.

584
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:26,487
Okay.

585
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,658
I'm home.

586
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,548
Ichiko, you need to sleep.

587
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,766
I know you have work, but still.

588
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,284
I'M SORRY I MADE A MESS!!

589
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,328
It's okay. It's milder than I imagined.

590
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,791
Ichiko, want some noodle soup?

591
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,543
Thank you.

592
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,213
I bought cough drops.

593
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,682
Okay.

594
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,289
Are you okay?

595
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,434
Ichiko.

596
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,979
You can keep eating,
but can I say something?

597
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,904
I'm sorry we can't have a discussion.

598
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,282
But first,

599
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:37,160
I apologize for leaving like that.

600
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:43,166
I know I don't have
any right to blame you.

601
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:49,338
But I couldn't accept what you did,
got emotional and ran away.

602
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,971
I thought about it when I was alone.

603
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,223
Didn't we get married

604
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:03,102
because we want to live happily
with each other as partners,

605
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,188
despite everything else?

606
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,152
I think what we both need to focus on

607
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:17,325
is how we can be happy together.

608
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,626
Right.

609
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,214
This is something we should
discuss properly.

610
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:32,965
Sorry.

611
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,305
I am worried…

612
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,392
about my ED.

613
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,899
I know in my head…

614
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,529
that our relationship is not
just about the sex.

615
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,281
I know it,

616
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,830
but a part of me felt like
I was a failure.

617
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,337
And

618
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,091
we have one more thing
we need to talk about.

619
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,720
Whether or not we will have kids.

620
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:26,894
I know sex isn't the only way
to have children,

621
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,438
but those other methods are
probably really tough.

622
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:31,983
Besides,

623
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:37,446
I felt like we've never even talked about
whether we want to have kids or not.

624
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,702
I want you to be honest

625
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,332
and tell me how you really feel
about having kids and my ED.

626
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,878
I will be honest with you too.

627
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,673
What do you think?

628
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,890
Ichiko?

629
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:12,982
Are you okay?

630
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:43,888
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

631
00:53:56,651 --> 00:54:00,237
I WANT TO HAVE THIS TALK TOO.

632
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:17,630
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.

633
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,041
You'll catch my cold.

634
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,295
I don't mind if I do.

635
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:21,902
Okay.

636
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,246
What?

637
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,748
You're going back?

638
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,541
Yeah.

639
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,545
I left my clothes and suitcase there.

640
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,842
And it feels like if I stay, we might
eventually go back to the way things were.

641
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,219
So I'm going back.

642
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,223
Get well soon, Ichiko.

643
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,225
Okay.

644
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,907
Isn't it okay if things eventually went
back to the way things were?

645
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,202
Is that a bad thing? Otoyan.

646
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,766
Mama!

647
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,226
Hiro.

648
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:19,186
We're back.

649
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,896
Welcome back.

650
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,773
Is it okay for you to be up?

651
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,109
Yeah. I'm feeling much better today.

652
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,450
Hiro. Let's wash our hands first.

653
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,453
Come on. Let's wash our hands.

654
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,122
Come on. Okay, okay.

655
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,917
You can play after you wash your hands.

656
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,337
After you wash your hands.

657
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,203
-Thank you.
-Sure.

658
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,376
Here.

659
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:26,003
Thank you.

660
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,434
You got some color back in your face.

661
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,022
I think I'm almost back to normal.

662
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:50,236
I think I can take Hiro to school and
pick him up if I keep feeling like this.

663
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,073
That's good. But don't force yourself.

664
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,992
Let me know if you need help.

665
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,119
Sure. Thanks.

666
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,343
What's wrong?

667
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:17,888
Well…

668
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,519
There's something I want to talk about.

669
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,603
What is it?

670
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,611
Well…

671
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,782
There's someone I want to say goodbye to

672
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,953
before we move abroad.

673
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,011
Who?

674
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,142
The man…

675
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,397
I stabbed with a kenzan flower base.

676
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,526
Is that okay?

677
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,457
I don't understand.

678
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:32,254
Why do you feel the need to?

679
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,842
And why are you asking me?

680
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,766
I know it's selfish and egotistical of me.

681
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,352
I know.

682
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,940
But I want to apologize in person
for stabbing him.

683
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,072
I want to end things cleanly

684
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:02,117
before starting over again.

685
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:12,211
I asked you because
there's nothing for me to hide anymore.

686
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,507
Of course

687
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,718
I could have met him without telling you.

688
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,888
I could have, but…

689
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,402
Haven't you already decided to do it?

690
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,115
This is you informing me,

691
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,367
not asking for a discussion.

692
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:51,917
And you're telling me this
because you already know I can't say no.

693
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,518
You can go see him.

694
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:13,605
If that will make you feel better.

695
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,068
Of course I'm not happy about it.

696
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,321
But I'm also not angry about it.

697
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,495
I trust you, Mitsuki.

698
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,623
No.

699
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,752
I want to trust you.

700
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,685
LEARN ABOUT THE SEA WITH SEAFLOS

701
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,411
Hello?

702
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,331
Hello? Ichiko?

703
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:17,002
You never answer the phone.

704
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,172
Sorry, I've been busy.

705
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,842
Can you tell Otoya
the thing was delivered?

706
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,761
The thing?

707
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:30,432
That thing. The kettle. I got it.

708
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,392
And the rice crackers.

709
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,479
I called him, but it didn't go through.

710
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,773
Okay.

711
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:42,027
But Mom, you called Otoya at this time?

712
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,737
Yeah.

713
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:48,742
You shouldn't. He'll be working
or on his way home.

714
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,579
But I want to say my thanks.

715
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,957
You can just send a message.

716
01:03:55,457 --> 01:04:00,337
I've told you so many times that we can't
always pick up since we're both working.

717
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,224
Okay.

718
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,019
I'll tell him you said thanks
when he comes home.

719
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:18,981
Thank you.

720
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:21,733
Sure.

721
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,694
Bye.

722
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,862
Bye.

723
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:36,665
No. He's not coming home.
He left the house.

724
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,501
As if I can say that.

725
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,408
Hello?

726
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,286
Hello, Ichiko?

727
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:17,039
Sorry for calling you so suddenly.

728
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,373
Were you working?

729
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,834
No, it's okay.

730
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,462
What about you? Are you outside?

731
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,173
Yeah.

732
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:29,301
I'm going home after having a barbecue
with people from school.

733
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:32,679
You sure like to party.

734
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,640
Did you have fun?

735
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,266
Yeah.

736
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:40,729
The sunset on the river beach was
so beautiful.

737
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,606
And

738
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:47,653
it made me want to see you.

739
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:24,189
Hello?

740
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,313
Otoya.

741
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,483
Thank you for meeting me today.

742
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,485
No problem.

743
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:16,324
It's selfish of me,
but I wanted to apologize in person.

744
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:24,666
I'm very sorry for doing
and saying such horrible things

745
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:27,919
to you.

746
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,173
It's okay.

747
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,760
I'm sorry too.

748
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,058
Was your injury okay after I left?

749
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,229
Physically, it healed pretty fast.

750
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,065
But it's still bothering me
psychologically.

751
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:56,740
The words you said before you left
had a bigger effect on me than I expected.

752
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:05,123
It might not be much help
for me to say this.

753
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,710
But that's not what I want now.

754
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:14,090
I am really sorry

755
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:19,554
for creating problems in your life.

756
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:27,813
I want to take back what I said
and I hope you'll recover.

757
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,360
Your heart and your body

758
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,030
is obviously your own.

759
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,034
Thank you.

760
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:46,373
But you didn't create any problems.

761
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:52,420
If there are issues in my marriage,

762
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:56,299
that is a problem between me and her.

763
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:58,426
Yeah.

764
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:05,725
What?

765
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:07,769
It's nothing.

766
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:13,900
You are still the same.

767
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:16,361
What part?

768
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,031
Your marriage is the center of your world.

769
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,409
You think so?

770
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,245
Yeah, it always was.

771
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,084
It was why you started
and ended our affair.

772
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:40,594
I think you really cherished
and trusted your wife.

773
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,848
That is why you had an affair with me.

774
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:51,730
I couldn't forgive that…

775
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,650
even though I'm just a third party.

776
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,701
I need to apologize to you too.

777
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:09,247
I thought I could be of help to you.

778
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,375
But that was probably
my own misunderstanding.

779
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:19,633
I got carried away
without truly understanding your pain.

780
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:25,430
Saying things like I can help you
and don't stress yourself out.

781
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:31,019
I was probably the one
who created problems in your life.

782
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:36,775
I'm sorry for doing that.

783
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,195
No.

784
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:04,052
Otoya, I'm also trying to
rebuild my family with my husband.

785
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,390
I did something stupid.

786
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:14,562
But I don't think I would have made it
this far if we never did what we did.

787
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,862
You really saved me back then.

788
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:25,573
I'm grateful for that.

789
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,453
I'm sorry.

790
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,541
I paid you back with pain.

791
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:38,670
Pain…

792
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:44,926
You're probably right.

793
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,646
Otoya,

794
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,232
you know,

795
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,402
I'm pregnant.

796
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,239
What?

797
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:09,367
But don't worry. It's my husband's.

798
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,954
We haven't slept together
for a while, right?

799
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,082
So relax.

800
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,294
I see.

801
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:28,678
Mitsuki.

802
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:36,352
I might not have the right
to say this to you, but…

803
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,272
Be happy.

804
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,608
Otoya.

805
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:46,863
Yeah.

806
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,365
You too.

807
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,118
Of course.

808
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,385
Then, I'll go now.

809
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,554
Okay.

810
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:24,776
Bye.

811
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:27,570
Bye.

812
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:57,559
OTOYA AIHARA

813
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:01,896
Who is it?

814
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,901
Why don't you pick up?

815
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,446
Sorry, I'm going to take this.

816
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:20,707
Hello?

817
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,167
Hello, Ichiko?

818
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,670
Sorry, were you working?

819
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:27,714
No.

820
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,300
It's okay. Did something happen?

821
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,679
No, I just wanted to talk to you.

822
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:39,934
Is it okay if I come back home
for a bit today?

823
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,687
Sorry it's so sudden.

824
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,938
It's okay.

825
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,399
It's your home too.

826
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,735
You can come back without asking.

827
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:51,446
Thank you.

828
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,114
Yeah.

829
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,286
I'll see you later then.

830
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,871
-Bye.
-Bye.

831
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,347
Thanks for waiting.

832
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,184
Your husband?

833
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,268
What?

834
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:24,354
Yeah.

835
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,315
He said he's coming home today.

836
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,654
For forever?

837
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,532
I don't know. It might be just for today.

838
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,080
And you're okay with that.

839
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:48,294
It's like you're being pushed
around by him.

840
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:51,965
Well,

841
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:54,509
it was also my fault.

842
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,265
Your fault for having sex
with me at the brothel?

843
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:06,562
Ichiko.

844
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:10,316
You said you did it for yourself,

845
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,111
of your own free will
and you have no regrets.

846
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:16,614
So isn't changing your mind
like this so cringe?

847
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,576
But you know,

848
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,454
marriage isn't so simple.

849
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:26,124
Isn't so simple, huh?

850
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:27,750
Like,

851
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,504
"You won't understand
because you're not married"?

852
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,300
I think there are things that even I get.

853
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:53,776
Sorry.

854
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,197
I'm the one who is acting cringe.

855
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,621
Ichiko.

856
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,583
Let's go somewhere.

857
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,419
Somewhere?

858
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,339
Bubble tea?

859
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,841
Not that.

860
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,469
You know what I mean.

861
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,308
Sorry.

862
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,187
It's because
I'm seeing you like this, right?

863
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:37,320
I really can't right now.

864
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,537
I have to go home.

865
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,129
Okay.

866
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:57,924
I'm sorry.

867
01:17:58,591 --> 01:17:59,592
See you.

868
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,469
Ichiko.

869
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:06,974
Will you get back together
with your husband?

870
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,019
I don't know.

871
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,357
But I'm going to try.

872
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,568
I want to try.

873
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:33,918
Ichiko.

874
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:40,049
Am I not an option for you?

875
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:48,558
I want to know more about you.

876
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:51,018
And want you to know more about me.

877
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:55,857
This is the first time

878
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,234
I've felt this way.

879
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,612
So I'm super confused.

880
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:05,700
But

881
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:08,744
I think

882
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:13,583
I really like you after all.

883
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:19,547
Thank you,

884
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,632
Rei.

885
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:30,600
I'm really happy that someone like you
would like me like that.

886
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:36,272
But I'm sorry.

887
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,361
The one I want to spend my life with is

888
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:44,864
my husband.

889
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:55,750
Okay.

890
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:03,049
Thank you for being straight with me.

891
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,597
Ichiko.

892
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,433
Good luck.

893
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:15,811
Thank you.

894
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,231
You too.

895
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,191
Yeah.

896
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:22,652
Take care of yourself.

897
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,324
Yeah.

898
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,120
Bye.

899
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:34,205
Bye.

900
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,030
I'm home.

901
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,285
Welcome back.

902
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,749
You cleaned.
You did your best, didn't you?

903
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:19,875
Kind of.

904
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:24,547
I'll help you cook.

905
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,923
No, it's okay.

906
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:28,301
I'm not a guest, you know.

907
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:30,595
That's right.

908
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,607
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

909
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,423
-It's delicious.
-Yeah. Delicious.

910
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:16,807
And you? What have you been eating?

911
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:21,228
Anything I can make on one electric stove.

912
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:25,441
But I don't think I ate enough vegetables.
I kept getting mouth sores.

913
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:26,984
Yeah, me too.

914
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,905
It's been too long
since I've made more than three dishes.

915
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,408
Thank you, Ichiko.

916
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:36,452
Yeah.

917
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,709
Ichiko.

918
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,296
Can we talk?

919
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:49,674
Yeah.

920
01:22:58,349 --> 01:22:59,350
What?

921
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:06,565
Ichiko.

922
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,737
I want to move back…

923
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:19,662
and live together with you again.

924
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:28,212
Honestly, I'm still worried about the sex.

925
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,925
And it feels like I'm being selfish
for wanting to live together.

926
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:38,097
But that's what I really want.

927
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,355
Of course I will respect your wishes.

928
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,735
What do you think?

929
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:53,154
What do you want?

930
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,367
Give me a second.

931
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,245
I'm gathering my thoughts.

932
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,791
Eat, Otoyan.
It will make it easier for me to talk.

933
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:23,976
I also want you to come back home.

934
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,608
I was thinking about

935
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,236
what makes a marriage

936
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,447
the entire time we were apart.

937
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,453
But I still haven't found an answer.

938
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:52,254
We might have been stuck
circling the same spot in the past

939
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:55,132
and will do that even in the future.

940
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,551
But…

941
01:24:58,928 --> 01:24:59,929
But?

942
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,267
We were serious, weren't we?

943
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:08,145
And

944
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:10,981
we never broke up.

945
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:19,281
About our sex life,

946
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,119
I still don't have a solution for it.

947
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:30,292
And coincidentally you have an issue now.

948
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:36,173
But it first started
with my lack of a sex drive.

949
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:42,596
So…

950
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:49,436
I think the things we've
been through recently

951
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,816
were necessary for us in our relationship.

952
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,037
Otoyan.

953
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,168
I have a suggestion.

954
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:18,007
What is it?

955
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,014
Want to try having a baby?

956
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,603
What?

957
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,984
We'll probably need fertility treatments.

958
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,990
And it will be hard,
so I don't know if it will work out.

959
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:47,912
But no matter what happens,

960
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:53,500
I think it will help us move forward.

961
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:01,800
Ichiko.

962
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:07,389
I had thought about it too.

963
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,728
I want to try.

964
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,233
You sure?

965
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:21,695
Yeah.

966
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:30,120
Okay.

967
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,292
Yeah.

968
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:40,214
Let's eat.

969
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:43,842
Yeah.

970
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:47,596
Yeah.

971
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,264
Let's eat.

972
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,106
And six months later…

973
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,152
we got a divorce.

974
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,678
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

975
