1
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,678
It's over here.

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,640
We got married seven years ago.

FAMILY REGISTRY WINDOW

00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,144
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,063
-Ichiko.
-Me?

6
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,356
Yeah.

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:30,948
We're submitting this.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,199
I'll take a look.

MARRIAGE REGISTRATION
NOV 22, 2017

10
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,913
OTOYA AIHARA - ICHIKO YAMANE

11
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:41,333
That went pretty fast,
registering our marriage.

12
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,961
Right? We were done in about 20 seconds.

13
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,463
Yeah.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,009
-Ichiko.
-Yeah?

15
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,387
You don't want me to call you
"The Mrs.," right?

16
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,222
-What to call me?
-Yeah.

17
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,225
I don't want to say "spouse" or "bride."

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,353
So it has to be "wife," doesn't it?

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,939
Wife?

20
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,775
Please take care of me, Wife.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,277
Please take care of me, Husband.

22
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,237
Wife.

23
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,781
Husband.

24
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,407
Hey, Wife.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,743
What is it, Husband?

26
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:20,039
Do you really not need
a ring or honeymoon?

27
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,958
For now, yeah.

28
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,295
I'll probably end up losing the ring.

29
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,424
And I want to go on a trip
when I feel more like taking a honeymoon.

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,510
Okay.

31
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,055
This isn't in exchange,

32
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:41,101
but I want to buy a condo I like.

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,563
It doesn't need to be a brand new place,

34
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,024
but it should be in a convenient location,

35
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,904
with a lot of nature
and can be renovated any way I like.

36
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,614
Is there such a place?

37
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,449
Sure there is.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,079
So we should start looking for
a condo you like?

39
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,163
Yeah.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,634
What about you? Any preferences?

41
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,305
Not really.

42
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:19,974
No way.

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,517
Nothing you want or hope for?

44
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,439
I want a kitchen that is easy to use.

45
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,485
But it's the contents, not the package.

46
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,487
The soft content, not the hard details.

47
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,699
It's not about the building
but who I'm living with.

48
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,161
Husband.

49
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,499
What?

50
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,835
-Husband.
-What, Wife?

51
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,880
Husband!

52
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,381
What?

53
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,427
What are you saying, Husband?

54
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,350
BASED ON THE MANGA
"1122" BY PEKO WATANABE

55
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,625
1122: FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE

56
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,836
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

57
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,756
Maybe "cheers" wasn't the right thing.

58
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,466
It's fine.

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,970
Today is the one-month anniversary
of my divorce.

60
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,640
-Yay.
-Yay.

61
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,141
-Yay.
-Yay.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,309
-Yay.
-Yay.

63
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,895
But to think it was Ichiko and Otoya.

64
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,939
I was so shocked.

65
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,233
Can I ask why?

66
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,945
Was it related to us
tempting you to go to the brothel?

67
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,404
Tempting is a little--

68
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,614
Not at all.

69
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,866
Then why?

70
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,287
I didn't fall in love with someone else,

71
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:08,290
nor did I start to hate Otoyan.

72
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,087
I still love him, even now.

73
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,839
It sounds like I'm glossing it over.

74
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,094
But

75
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,390
I got tired of my marriage.

76
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:32,731
So you'll be starting
fertility treatment too.

77
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:33,816
Yeah.

78
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,111
Therefore, I wanted to talk to you

79
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,030
as someone
who had a successful experience.

80
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,115
SIX MONTHS AGO

81
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,119
You know she hasn't given birth yet.
So you plan to get a lot of treatment?

82
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,162
If need be, yes.

83
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,875
Which clinic did you go to?

84
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,588
We tried a lot of different places
and finally found Arakawa Clinic.

85
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,049
So you did it there.

86
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:04,221
I heard it was like a factory. Was it?

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,143
Yeah, it felt like we were
on a conveyor belt.

88
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,395
For real? But it's a good clinic.

89
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,357
How long did it take and how much was it?

90
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,026
If you're comfortable telling me.

91
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,529
Including the breaks we took,
it was about two years.

92
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,366
The cost was about 2.5 million yen.

93
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,536
Wow. That's a lot.

94
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,374
Well, it took a lot of time and money.

95
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,377
But it took a lot more psychologically,

96
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,463
especially for my wife.

97
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,176
I'll be fine psychologically.

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,805
I've been doing my research
and reading tons of blogs.

99
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,224
I'm prepared for all of it.

100
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,312
Right, you are. Unlike my wife.

101
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,484
Does your husband also want it
as much as you?

102
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,948
What?

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,867
Don't "what" me.

104
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,913
So my husband,

105
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,957
he probably does.

106
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,751
-Probably?
-Yeah.

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,005
Isn't fertility treatment
more of a burden on women?

108
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,883
But my husband understands that very well.

109
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,844
If I'm okay, he'll be okay too.

110
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,723
I see. Then that's good.

111
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,188
It's very difficult for a husband and wife
to always be on the same page.

112
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,733
I hope both of you
won't stress yourselves out.

113
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,045
Mrs. Aihara,
I have your ovarian age test results.

114
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,675
Forty-two years old.

115
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,303
Your chances are low even with the
right timing and artificial insemination.

116
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,431
We want to do IVF.

117
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,312
A higher ovarian age
indicates lower ovarian functions.

118
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,148
Understood.

119
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,650
Then before we begin, let me warn you.

120
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,945
Please prioritize your treatment
above everything else.

121
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,615
Often, we'll tell you to come in
the very next day

122
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,784
because the treatments
are based on your cycle.

123
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,998
I can't treat you if you miss
an appointment due to work.

124
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,041
I understand.

125
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,253
Then we'll do a pelvic examination on you.

126
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,631
And for you, we need to analyze
your sperm, so go to the collection room.

127
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,757
Okay.

128
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,259
-Thank you.
-Sure.

129
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,594
We'll be in your care.

130
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,763
I can't get pregnant,

131
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,475
no matter how much sperm
I'm injected with,

132
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,186
if I'm not ovulating regularly.

133
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,320
I heard the rumors.

134
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,739
But it really took five and a half hours.

135
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,450
There were a lot of people.

136
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,954
You could have gone home first.

137
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,873
This is something we're doing together.

138
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,375
And I can't be with you
at every appointment.

139
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,132
I hope it will go well.

140
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,009
Yeah.

141
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,429
Let's not get our hopes up too high.

142
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,389
Okay.

143
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,686
I'm kind of tired.

144
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,605
Want to grab dinner somewhere?

145
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,398
Great idea.

146
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,484
What do you want to eat?

147
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,737
Something that will give me energy.

148
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,614
-Give you energy?
-Meat?

149
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,574
-Meat.
-How about it?

150
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,951
-Okay.
-Okay?

151
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,121
Sorry, this test didn't show
high levels of HCG.

152
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,626
So even a Grade 5AA blastocyst won't work.

153
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,422
Look, the grade is only for the embryo's
appearance. Most of them are not viable.

154
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,134
Feel free to go to another clinic
if you don't like it.

155
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,553
I didn't mean to criticize you.

156
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,682
It's a misconception that a high grade
will result in a pregnancy.

157
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,893
It will only make things harder for you
if you keep thinking like that.

158
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,853
Okay.

159
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,576
SATO ART CLINIC DAIKANYAMA

160
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,995
A VERY GOOD DOCTOR

161
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,372
ARAKAWA LADIES CLINIC

162
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,041
I WAS ABLE TO GET PREGNANT AT 43

163
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,626
ARAKAWA LADIES CLINIC

164
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,503
SO HAPPY I SWITCHED
TO THIS CLINIC

165
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,923
Should we change clinics?

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,552
Here you go. Herbal tea.

167
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,262
Thanks.

168
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,602
Changing clinics?

169
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,315
Yeah, the way he got mad
at you wasn't good.

170
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,775
Sorry I couldn't go with you.

171
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,195
It was just for the results anyway.

172
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,948
He was rude.

173
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,827
But three negatives in a row is…

174
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,749
Ichiko.

175
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,545
Why don't you pause the treatment for now?

176
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,548
Pause? Why?

177
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,301
We have enough money for another round.

178
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,763
Plus we don't know how much longer
I can still be treated.

179
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,474
We don't have the time to pause it.

180
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,101
We need to move on to our next step.

181
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,944
But this clinic has really good reviews.

182
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,287
Mrs. Aihara, your ovarian follicles
have no eggs for this cycle.

183
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,417
Take the pill and let's start again.

184
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,294
Yes.

185
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,520
So you're pausing treatments this cycle.

186
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,982
Yeah. That's why
I can do some work this month.

187
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,071
Ichiko.

188
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,534
You've been sleeping in the tatami room,

189
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,453
but wouldn't it be better
if you slept on the bed?

190
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,291
I'll sleep out here
if you prefer to sleep alone.

191
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,170
You don't need to go out of your way.

192
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,923
I'm not going out of my way.

193
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,219
Even dinner. This is really good
but it's so expensive.

194
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,055
You don't need to buy so much.

195
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,599
The treatment is expensive enough.

196
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,771
You're right.

197
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,150
It--

198
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,319
I did buy a little too much.

199
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,573
I'll take the leftovers for lunch.
Eat whatever you like.

200
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,412
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,832
You were just trying to help.

202
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,251
Sorry.

203
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,794
Thank you.

204
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,634
Ichiko.

205
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,719
Yeah?

206
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,475
Tell me if there is
something I can do for you.

207
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,147
Okay.

208
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,025
Thanks.

209
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,409
You know, Ichiko.

210
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,494
Yeah?

211
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:11,208
I think we should have another talk.

212
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:13,919
About?

213
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,631
Our future.

214
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,428
Our marriage and having kids.

215
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,766
Sorry, Otoyan.

216
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,602
I have a deadline today.

217
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,020
So I need to finish that.

218
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,773
How about tomorrow?

219
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,278
Okay.

220
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,197
Tomorrow is good.

221
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,742
Then let's talk tomorrow.

222
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,494
Yeah.

223
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,498
Then I'll take a bath and go to bed.

224
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,292
Don't work too hard, Ichiko.

225
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,835
Got it.

226
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,196
I'm back.

227
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,495
Welcome back.

228
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,581
Did you eat?

229
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,333
-Yeah, I ate.
-Okay.

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,087
Want to have a drink while we talk? Sake?

231
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,923
No. Let's stay sober.

232
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,926
Okay.

233
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,053
Then I'll make tea.

234
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,137
Okay.

235
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,816
Thanks.

236
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,900
Sure.

237
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,463
Well…

238
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,053
it's about what you said last time.

239
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,849
I couldn't stop thinking about

240
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:01,020
what you said
about moving on to the next step.

241
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,610
Is there no next step…

242
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,365
for us if we don't have a baby?

243
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,749
I'll be happy if we can have one.

244
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,126
But

245
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,297
even if we can't,
I'll still be happy to be your husband.

246
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,889
I'm not against
continuing the fertility treatment.

247
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,601
But you seem…

248
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,521
to put too much faith into it.

249
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,654
Otoyan.

250
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,282
What?

251
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,997
Yesterday…

252
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:08,838
you said to tell you
if there is anything you can do, right?

253
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,757
Yeah.

254
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,635
I did. Is there something
I can do for you?

255
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,641
So I…

256
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,064
I thought about it this entire time.

257
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:29,984
Since yesterday.

258
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,742
But…

259
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,038
I couldn't think of anything.

260
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,252
What?

261
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,172
You're already doing enough.

262
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,218
It doesn't have to be about the treatment.
Anything is fine.

263
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,803
I know.

264
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:00,974
Thank you.

265
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,023
But I…

266
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,946
can't think of anything I want

267
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,907
to say to you…

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,997
or anything I want you to do for me.

269
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,674
I think I am putting too much faith
in the treatment.

270
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,221
Because I can no longer see a future

271
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,516
with just the two of us.

272
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,652
You mean being with me?

273
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,116
Is that why we need to have a baby?

274
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,079
Yeah.

275
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,085
That is why…

276
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,217
this marriage is too hard for me.

277
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,730
Since when?

278
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,777
I don't know exactly.

279
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,322
But I thought

280
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,869
if we had a baby and became parents…

281
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,417
I could escape the pain of this marriage

282
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,922
and keep going as a family.

283
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,132
That's what I thought.

284
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:06,933
But it's not right to hang on to
that kind of possibility, right?

285
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,527
Is it because I had an affair
with your permission?

286
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,990
That is why you don't trust me?

287
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,157
No.

288
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,620
That might have been the trigger.

289
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,581
But it's not the reason why.

290
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,753
It's also not because
we stopped having sex.

291
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,341
And I didn't fall in love
with someone else.

292
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,426
Then what?

293
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,686
Sorry. Keep talking.

294
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,278
You didn't do anything wrong.

295
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,074
I'm the problem.

296
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,626
This marriage…

297
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,006
has become…

298
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,135
too heavy a burden for me.

299
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,475
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

300
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,614
Ichiko.

301
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,536
Ichiko.

302
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,124
Do you want…

303
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,254
to leave me?

304
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:10,973
Yes.

305
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,020
This is not a decision…

306
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,274
you made quickly,

307
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,487
on a whim, right?

308
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,242
Right.

309
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,298
I understand.

310
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,345
I understand, but…

311
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,311
Give me some time.

312
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:05,153
I understand how serious you are
about this.

313
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,757
I said it.

314
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,889
I really said it.

315
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,253
Otoyan gave me his answer two days later.

316
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,178
That weekend,

317
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,348
on a beautiful, clear autumn day,

318
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,017
a morning in the seventh year
of our marriage.

319
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,278
Here you go.

320
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,696
Divorce papers, correct?

321
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,115
We submitted our divorce papers

322
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,660
and put an end

323
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,788
to our married life.

324
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,498
DIVORCE REGISTRATION
OCTOBER 12, 2024

325
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,041
That is what happened.

326
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,131
Say something.

327
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,718
Well…

328
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,428
I can talk shit about him

329
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:58,224
and congratulate you
if he was a horrible husband.

330
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,434
But I somehow can't with Otoya.

331
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,644
-Yeah.
-Right?

332
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,399
He made a really good Chinese tea for me
when I was hungover at Ichiko's place.

333
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,401
-That's a good husband experience.
-Yeah.

334
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,987
Otoyan is really good
at taking care of people.

335
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,285
Hey, Yuri. Tell her how good
it is to be single.

336
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,581
You can give it your all in love and work.

337
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,583
That was like you copied it
from an old show.

338
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,169
-You told me to say good things.
-Anyway--

339
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,715
Thank you. But aside from work,

340
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,217
I have no interest in love right now.

341
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,054
I'll focus on enjoying being alone first.

342
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,390
Now the married ladies
should say words of support.

343
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,058
-Now. Come on.
-What?

344
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,353
Well…

345
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,772
Is there anything?

346
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,403
Isn't now a good time to sell your home?
You're in a nice neighborhood.

347
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,905
-That?
-Property distribution is important.

348
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:55,906
Yeah.

349
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,952
-That's right.
-Well, marriage is one form of love.

350
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,457
And you can break up
if it becomes too difficult.

351
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,959
Ichiko can't tell a lie anyway.

352
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,838
Yeah, but now that I'm single,

353
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,925
I feel that
I am finally seeing my true self

354
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,055
since I've been relying on Otoyan so much.

355
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,309
Your true self is important.

356
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,186
Congratulations for finding
your true self.

357
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,937
You can give it your all in love and work.

358
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,022
Hey.

359
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,983
-Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

360
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,527
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

361
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,737
Thank you.

362
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,915
We might have congratulated you, but we're
all very worried about you, you know?

363
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,502
I know.

364
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,675
You tend to not show it to your friends
when you're having a hard time.

365
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,094
Really?

366
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,305
I think I talked about it a lot.

367
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,770
I think you've only shown Otoya

368
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:12,817
what you're really feeling and thinking
all these years.

369
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,489
You think so?

370
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,740
Yeah, I do.

371
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,421
It's because Otoyan was like another me.

372
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,136
Now I have to…

373
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:48,144
slowly learn to open myself up
to other people.

374
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,985
You think I can do it?

375
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,696
Of course.

376
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,622
You'll be one of them.

377
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,501
Okay.

378
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,140
Hug.

379
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,560
Hug?

380
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,188
-Hug.
-Squeeze.

381
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,691
You did your best.

382
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,373
Hello? Otoyan?

383
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,252
Ichiko, it's me.

384
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:41,090
I'm too busy this week
so I can't pick up the rest of my things.

385
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,676
Can you send them to me?
I'll pay on delivery.

386
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,262
Okay.

387
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,097
Got it.

388
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,142
And…

389
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,312
What?

390
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,982
Ichiko.

391
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,612
Did you tell your mother we got divorced?

392
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,491
Not yet.

393
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,121
I was thinking about telling her soon.

394
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,166
I won't say anything to her.

395
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:21,880
But I'm worried because
she hasn't responded to my message.

396
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,508
She usually responds right away.

397
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,596
Okay.

398
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,639
I got it.

399
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,017
I'll contact her.

400
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:35,978
Okay.

401
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,230
Then, good night.

402
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,150
Good night.

403
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,216
Slowly but surely,

404
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,639
I am becoming alone…

405
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,518
as traces of Otoyan get erased.

406
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,543
JR EAST

407
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,311
I'm home.

408
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,034
Mom?

409
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,180
Mom.

410
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,479
Are you dead?

411
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,195
The expression my mom had
in her final moments alone

412
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:59,199
was the complete opposite
of the word "peaceful."

413
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,287
It was one where I can easily imagine
how painful it was.

414
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:12,045
I swore to never forget it.

415
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:14,965
Because I felt…

416
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,510
my own end

417
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,180
would also look like that.

418
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:28,270
WHITE BAMBI

419
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,416
Hello? Ichiko?

420
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,002
Hello, Otoyan?

421
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,546
Sorry for calling you at work.

422
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,133
It's okay.

423
00:36:58,967 --> 00:36:59,968
What's up?

424
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,680
My mother passed away.

425
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,728
What?

426
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,565
I found her at home yesterday.

427
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:24,660
So, she didn't respond
to my message because…

428
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,371
Yeah.

429
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,498
I asked the hospital to examine her,

430
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,459
and they said she died two days ago.

431
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,337
Probably from a heart attack.

432
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,050
I see.

433
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,350
Ichiko, are you all right?

434
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,228
I'm okay.

435
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,108
I wanted to let you know
since you had taken care of her.

436
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,778
Thank you.

437
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,825
Ichiko.

438
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,077
Where are you now?

439
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,746
Now?

440
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,418
At her house.

441
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,337
Alone?

442
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,590
Yeah.

443
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,342
Alone.

444
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,723
Can you handle everything on your own?

445
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,228
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll keep things simple.

446
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:39,443
I can do it if I talk to the funeral home
and do some research online.

447
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,363
Yeah, I also need mourning clothes.

448
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,491
I'll just buy them around here.

449
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,410
Ichiko.

450
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,498
I'll come to you.

451
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:56,960
What?

452
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,130
But,

453
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:05,385
Otoyan, don't you have work tomorrow?

454
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,807
That is what paid leave is for.

455
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,232
So wait for me.

456
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,278
Bye.

457
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,032
Okay.

458
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,826
Bye.

459
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,540
Otoyan.

460
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,916
Hi, Ichiko.

461
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,752
I got you a snack.

462
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,464
Thanks.

463
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,646
You'll be the chief mourner, right?

464
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,607
Yeah.

465
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,987
Then I'll make the arrangements
with the funeral home as your husband.

466
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:33,033
You can check the important details later.

467
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,452
So you should just rest.

468
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,455
You haven't slept for two days, right?

469
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,583
-But--
-It's okay.

470
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,380
There will be a lot of things
only family members can do and decide on.

471
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,844
It was like that when my dad died.

472
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,598
So let me do what I can.

473
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:01,645
Okay.

474
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:23,458
Then the wake
and funeral will be on this date.

475
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,626
Yes.

476
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:29,172
Do you have any questions or concerns?

477
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,011
We still don't know
how many people will come.

478
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,930
What should I do about
how much food to order?

479
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,808
You don't need to decide that right now.

480
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,936
You can inform us once you know.

481
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,604
Great.

482
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,903
And how should we order
the flowers for the altar?

483
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:57,659
For example, if a relative wants to give
a flower arrangement,

484
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,160
is there a specific florist…

485
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,268
-Right?
-Yes, I was so surprised to hear.

486
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,686
She was so healthy.

487
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,606
We'll be going now.

488
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,399
Okay. Take care.

489
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,944
Thank you for coming.

490
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,657
You came even though we're divorced.

491
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:24,537
Nothing has changed for us.

492
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,919
Hey, if it's not a problem,

493
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,005
you should stay with her today, Otoya.

494
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,633
If Ichiko is okay with it.

495
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,805
What do you say, Ichiko?

496
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,517
Yeah.

497
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,645
Then, please…

498
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,733
Ichiko.

499
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,027
Be sure to rest well.

500
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,322
You can make Otoya do all the work.

501
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,991
Thank you.

502
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:05,412
I really appreciate it.

503
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,105
It's the house making noises.

504
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,066
It's really loud.

505
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,115
I wonder if Mom is angry…

506
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,787
since I was a bad daughter.

507
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,169
Of course she has a grudge against me.

508
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,340
That's not true.

509
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:05,597
You were always thinking
about your mother.

510
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,978
Otoyan.

511
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:14,689
Yeah?

512
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,320
Can I come over to your side?

513
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,571
You know…

514
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,912
I didn't shed a single tear

515
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,500
when my mom died.

516
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,801
That was cold-hearted, even for me.

517
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,395
I can't say I understand.

518
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:41,025
Crying isn't the only way
to express your sadness.

519
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:48,283
I think everyone shows
their sadness at different times

520
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,492
and in different ways.

521
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,414
How sad a person is

522
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,210
can't be measured by how they show it
or by what they do.

523
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:08,761
Ichiko.

524
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:16,185
Did you see the box
on top of the toaster in the kitchen?

525
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:21,816
What?

526
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,613
The box for the kettle I bought…

527
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,867
for your mom was stacked on top.

528
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,829
It was unopened.

529
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,128
That time,

530
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,132
I knew…

531
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,012
what your mom wanted…

532
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,391
wasn't a fancy kettle.

533
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,270
I kind of knew it.

534
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,150
But I didn't have the time.

535
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,406
So I did something
that made her feel lonely.

536
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,664
I made it hard for her to say anything…

537
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,126
by sending her that kettle.

538
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:36,683
I really liked your mom, you know.

539
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,562
She wasn't good at expressing herself.

540
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,108
But she was honest and strong.

541
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:55,910
I'm not hurting as much as you.

542
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,623
But I think I can share your grief.

543
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:09,924
Yeah.

544
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,531
Mom, I'm so sorry.

545
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,544
Then,

546
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,465
thank you for everything, Otoyan.

547
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,509
Yeah.

548
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,346
Take good care of yourself, Ichiko.

549
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,224
Okay.

550
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,686
Bye.

551
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,523
Yeah.

552
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,025
Bye.

553
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,459
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

554
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,044
Are you okay?

555
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:29,837
Yeah.

556
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,186
I need to be the one to turn around…

557
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,234
because my ex-husband

558
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,946
is too kind.

559
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,022
I'm home.

560
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:29,999
Some time after that,

561
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,835
I called Otoyan and we decided

562
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,506
to sell our home.

563
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,096
I continued living here

564
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:46,849
alone,

565
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,477
until we found a buyer.

566
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,487
Coming.

567
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,864
THREE MONTHS LATER

568
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,498
-Hello.
-Hi.

569
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,917
-Thank you.
-Nice to meet you.

570
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,835
-Nice to meet you.
-We'll take a look around.

571
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,007
-Thank you.
-Of course.

572
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,510
-Thanks for letting us come.
-Please come in.

573
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:25,346
Three months later,

574
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,849
someone wanted to buy the condo.

575
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,853
So I called Otoyan
so we can meet them together.

576
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,774
Pardon the intrusion.

577
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,235
Thank you for having us.

578
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,200
It has good sunlight.

579
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:50,246
The windows face southeast
so you get sun for most of the day.

580
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:54,917
It's rare for such a good home
to be available in this neighborhood.

581
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,544
-That's true.
-Yes.

582
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:01,173
Looking at it in person, it looks
much newer than it actually is.

583
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,134
We did a lot of renovations.

584
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,802
-Really?
-I see.

585
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,433
Look, aren't the tiles
in the kitchen cute?

586
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,517
Yeah.

587
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,652
Now that I'm seeing them up close,
they aren't smooth and have some texture.

588
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,612
That's right.

589
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,740
I shopped around to find them.

590
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,907
They're really cute.

591
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,077
Is it hard to keep a tiled kitchen clean?

592
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,956
It's really easy.
You can just wipe it off.

593
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,125
Tomato sauce won't stain it
even if it splatters.

594
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,209
That's nice.

595
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:41,797
The grout is black too.
You could see the stains if it was white.

596
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,508
That's what they said
when I bought the tiles.

597
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,136
They told us black is better
if we cook often.

598
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,988
I have a question.

599
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,907
What is it?

600
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,493
Why do you want to sell this place?

601
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,749
I was wondering if there were
any cons of living here.

602
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,419
I want to ask just in case.

603
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,255
-Right?
-Yeah. You're right.

604
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:29,428
I don't have any complaints about it.

605
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:35,226
But it's not the hard details,
but the soft contents.

606
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:40,147
It's not about the building,
but who you'll be living with.

607
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:51,367
Why don't we take a look
at the tatami room?

608
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,537
-Sure.
-This way, please.

609
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,166
Ichiko.

610
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,890
Ichiko, are you okay?

611
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,229
I'm sorry.

612
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,067
I can't

613
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,820
sell this place after all.

614
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:29,780
What?

615
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,575
I'm sorry.

616
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,003
I'm really sorry.
You even came all the way here.

617
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:46,046
I apologize.

618
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,464
Oh, no. Well…

619
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,525
Here.

620
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,319
Thanks.

621
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,578
Are you out of sugar?

622
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,706
No, I still have some.

623
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:23,375
I bought some a few days ago.

624
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,631
Really? I didn't see it.

625
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,841
Really?

626
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,261
I just used it though.

627
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,556
Right.

628
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,899
How come it fell?

629
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,944
I was busy with work right until--

630
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,862
-Ouch!
-Ouch.

631
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,573
That hurts, Ichiko.

632
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:56,325
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

633
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,078
I was working right until they came.

634
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:01,705
So I cleaned in a hurry.
Are you okay, Otoyan?

635
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:02,873
Yeah.

636
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,875
So I put it there…

637
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,340
-Sugar…
-Yeah?

638
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,176
…won't grow mold
if you put it in an air-tight container.

639
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,553
I'll put it in the old container.

640
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,724
So there was a reason for that.

641
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,979
I thought you put it in a bottle
because it looked nice.

642
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:39,410
You really have it together, don't you?

643
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,870
You think so?

644
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,583
I'll take my tea with sugar today too.

645
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,460
Okay.

646
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,054
Crying makes you tired, right?

647
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,603
Here.

648
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,023
Thanks.

649
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,484
Are you tired too?

650
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,280
Yeah,

651
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,116
because I was nervous.

652
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,830
I kept thinking about how sad I'd feel

653
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:30,461
if the people viewing our place
said they would buy it,

654
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,089
even though we both decided to sell it.

655
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,176
But when it actually happened,

656
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:42,389
I thought about emphasizing how hard it is
to open and close the window screens.

657
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,102
Like how much the sun burns
the tatami mats.

658
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:50,439
Yeah. And that the closet door creaks.

659
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:53,442
Sometimes the kitchen drawers won't close.

660
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:56,487
The bathroom door mysteriously opens
by itself in the winter.

661
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,155
And when it rains,

662
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,866
-the living room doorknob gets stuck.
-The living room doorknob gets stuck.

663
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,374
But

664
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,211
I didn't think
they would like this place so quickly

665
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,838
since it's a pretty old building.

666
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:16,882
Yeah.

667
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,094
I got used to looking
at the kitchen tiles,

668
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,763
but they are very cute.

669
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:36,902
Now, the hard details are a mess,
and the soft contents have separated.

670
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:40,739
Yeah.

671
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,662
But…

672
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,252
is it okay if I want to start over?

673
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,298
What?

674
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,722
Sorry for being selfish.

675
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,935
I…

676
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:17,359
thought we couldn't be together
if we weren't married or didn't have kids.

677
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,285
But I…

678
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:33,167
don't want to give up on our relationship.

679
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,422
Those are…

680
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,009
my true feelings.

681
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,185
Ichiko.

682
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,191
To tell you the truth…

683
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,321
when I saw you crying…

684
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,659
and saying you didn't want to sell…

685
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,414
I was so incredibly happy.

686
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,628
I'm really happy…

687
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,298
the home we built together…

688
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:28,430
won't be gone anymore.

689
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,543

Since you will increase the types of
treatments you provide for women,

691
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,174
you want to renew your website.

692
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,509
Yes.

693
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:10,514
I'll help improve their basic problems
and support their health and beauty.

694
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:15,435
My services will include pressure therapy,
pelvic realignment and diet consultation.

695
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:20,232
I want to connect it to improving
femininity and maternal instincts.

696
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:21,817
-Want to give it a try?
-What?

697
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:25,070
What do you mean "what"?
You don't have kids yet, right?

698
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,905
You shouldn't be so indecisive.

699
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:31,159
Didn't I tell you?
Your energy levels will start to drop.

700
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,496
I won't have children.

701
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:38,500
You shouldn't give up on having kids.

702
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,544
That's not what I meant.

703
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:41,962
Then what did you mean?

704
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,215
I'm just really happy right now.

705
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,676
So I'm good.

706
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,434
But I'd like to learn more
about the pelvic realignment.

707
01:04:56,184 --> 01:05:00,522
I think there is a big need for it
since more people are working from home.

708
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:03,191
-Right? Isn't that right?
-Yes.

709
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,651
The younger people need it, right?

710
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,903
I think they need it
because they are young.

711
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,655
-Because?
-Yes.

712
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,824
It smells so nice.

713
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,242
Right? It has a great scent.

714
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,578
-Wow.
-Amazing.

715
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,622
-It does.
-What a flower.

716
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:17,789
Everyone.

717
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:21,376
We'll be using the cape jasmine today.

718
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,046
One stalk alone can be a work of art.

719
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,758
I want you all to think about using it
in a bold arrangement.

720
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,012
By the way,
the flower language for cape jasmine is…

723

I'm back.

724
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,426
Welcome back.

725
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:20,185
-Working?
-Yeah.

726
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,314
You're in a good mood.

727
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:26,775
You can tell?

728
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,861
That smells nice. Is it the flower?

729
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:30,946
Yeah.

730
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,240
What kind of flower?

731
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,826
Cape jasmine.

732
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,666
Why a bouquet?

733
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:53,844
Here.

734
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,473
You won't arrange it?

735
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,976
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
