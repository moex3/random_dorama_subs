1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,734
A COUNTRY IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA

2
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,700
What are you doing in this land?

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,400
Are you one of their men?

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,834
Answer when spoken to!

5
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,166
Teruasa Oda?

6
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:25,367
Why would a Japanese
wander all the way out here?

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,467
What's this?

8
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,767
Boss, we keep digging,
but there's no water.

9
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,567
The water tank's run dry.

10
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,100
We're all dying of thirst.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,266
Dig on the east bank. It's our last hope!

12
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,934
Wait. Maybe the south bank…

13
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,333
Which one? We're desperate.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,900
The south.

15
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,967
What?

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,066
There's water in the south.

17
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:01,066
One more word, I'll kill you!

18
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,300
You understand what we're saying?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,367
Who are you?

20
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,900
My name is "Lucky Man."

21
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,767
We were wrong. Please forgive us.

22
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,467
The people are on edge,
ready to protect the village from bandits.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,367
Tell me how we can thank you.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,767
I'd like to meet
the leader of your village.

25
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,433
Thank you for helping us.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,300
This key is an ancient amulet,
passed down here since long ago.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,300
Thank you,

28
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,133
but it's not the key I'm searching for.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
Stay well, Lucky Man!

30
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,967
Thank you. Take care!

31
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,767
Lucky Man! Lucky Man!

32
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,600
Lucky Man! Lucky Man!

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,700
Lucky Man!

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,567
There have been a series of incidents

35
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,667
involving mysterious asset transfers
in Japan.

36
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:31,900
Several business owners have died
shortly after leaving enigmatic messages.

37
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,800
He was still conscious at the scene.

38
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:38,433
He looked scared, and was
mumbling the word "devil."

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
He kept saying it over and over.

40
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,433
There's a change of plan.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,166
Get off here.

42
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,500
Teruasa, where will you go?

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,633
To Japan.

44
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,200
Greed, lust,

45
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,967
the urge to succeed, or to rule…

46
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:18,200
Humans have long prospered
by following their desires,

47
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:21,400
but have also engaged in ugly conflict,

48
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,734
all to satisfy such cravings.

49
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,834
Underlying the history of war,
there is always a mysterious key

50
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:32,867
that seduces man and stirs his desires.

51
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:36,767
Such keys have appeared
throughout the world, across the ages.

52
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:40,233
It is said that if you collect 99 keys,

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,967
you can have everything in the world.

54
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:47,600
Mankind, driven by desire, has spilled
much blood in the scramble for the keys.

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,934
This is why they came
to be called the "devil's keys."

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,600
No one has ever collected all 99 keys.

57
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:06,400
We will shortly
be arriving at Narita airport.

58
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,100
Please ensure your seat belt is fastened.

59
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,600
I have something I want to show you.

60
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:19,000
What I'm about to say
stays between me and you.

61
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,066
You'll keep it secret?

62
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,467
You can tell me.

63
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,734
What is it?

64
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:27,900
According to old legend,
this is a devil's key.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,400
It has a magical power
to bring you luck, just by having it.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
What?

67
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,433
I'm serious.

68
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,500
Since I got my hands on this key,
I found the watch I'd lost,

69
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:46,834
and on my way to a work meeting,
all the traffic lights turned green.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,700
No way.

71
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,367
Can I hold it?

72
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:58,600
They say that there are 99 keys in total.

73
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,967
If you collect all of them,

74
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,867
you can have the whole world.

75
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,633
…should be placed
securely under your seat.

76
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,967
If you are using the bathroom,
please return to your seat.

77
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,100
Please! Wait!

78
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,533
Please, Maruko!

79
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:25,500
Mr. Honda, don't feel bad.

80
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,533
The world of victory and defeat is cruel.

81
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:38,433
A debt to be paid!

82
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,633
Look at that. Guess he beat me to it.

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,834
Now we can live in peace. Right, boss?

84
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,233
Not just yet.

85
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,834
You've got the key,
and all of Honda Science's assets.

86
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,400
Isn't that 31.8 billion yen?

87
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,633
That's enough to keep
the family happy and well.

88
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Fool.

89
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,734
I'm going to make
our family even more powerful.

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,033
KEY OWNER LOCATED
ODA TERUASA

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
MOTHER DIED AT 11 YRS OLD
FATHER DIED AT 14 YRS OLD

92
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:25,934
Got one.

93
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,667
Is it from him?

94
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,467
Our next target…

95
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,967
RETURNED TO JAPAN A FEW DAYS AGO
AFTER LIVING IN INDIA

96
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,734
NUMBER OF KEYS IN POSSESSION:
ONE

97
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:43,300
TOKYO

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,433
With about 300 offices
in Japan and abroad,

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,266
it's one of Japan's
leading trading companies,

100
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,767
dealing in metal, energy, food,
information, finance and more.

101
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,367
Hello.

102
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,300
I'd like to see Ryukan Okamoto
from the secretarial office.

103
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,834
Could you tell me your name, please?

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,100
Oda Teruasa.

105
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:10,600
Thirteen years ago, this was Oda Group.

106
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:14,433
A SOCIETY WHERE LOVE
ALWAYS ABOUNDS

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
Teruasa?

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,367
Ryukan!

109
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,633
Teruasa!

110
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,734
You're back.

111
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,500
I would have come to the airport
if you'd told me.

112
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,100
Nonsense, I don't belong here anymore.

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,867
It must have been difficult,
out there by yourself.

114
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,200
No doubt I'm tougher for it.

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,166
Do you have the key on you now?

116
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:50,734
Yes.

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,367
I heard about the strange incidents
involving asset transfers in Japan.

118
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,166
Yes, it's all anyone can talk about.

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,900
Top businessmen and wealthy individuals
have been dying mysteriously

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,533
after transferring everything
they own to someone else.

121
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:09,400
I believe just yesterday,
the chairman of Honda Science

122
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:13,367
transferred his entire fortune
to the Maruko Family, a criminal group.

123
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,533
Then he jumped
from the building to his death.

124
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Right before the victim dies,

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,166
they all say the word, "devil."

126
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:23,734
The devil's key?

127
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,734
If the key has something to do
with these incidents,

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,867
I'm worried this place might be next.

129
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,667
Also,

130
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,734
I recognized someone

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,367
in the footage shown on TV.

132
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,934
It's him.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,667
From what I've investigated,

134
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:52,000
there are bloody incidents happening
around the world related to the keys.

135
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,033
Wait. You've been investigating?

136
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,500
Actually,

137
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,834
I've been traveling for years
looking for keys just like this one.

138
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:03,900
Now, in Japan too,

139
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:08,033
similar incidents are happening
in connection to these keys.

140
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,433
There must be a reason.

141
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm not sure why, but perhaps

142
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:18,066
lots of these keys
are being discovered in Japan.

143
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,533
If that's true, then you're in danger.

144
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,333
You need to get away from here!

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,567
I'm sick of running.

146
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,734
I'm going to search Japan
for this key, and this man.

147
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,734
I don't care how dangerous it is.

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,533
If I don't do this, I'll never move on.

149
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,767
My father's death…

150
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,133
was because of me.

151
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:52,867
Dad?

152
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,367
I found some information on that key.

153
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,900
Don't tell me you've been
investigating the keys?

154
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,500
I didn't say a word to anyone.

155
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,467
It's reception.

156
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
What is it?

157
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,400
There's someone at reception
for you with no appointment.

158
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:17,066
Oda, I know you have a devil's key…

159
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,000
I owe thanks to your son,
who's been digging around online.

160
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,867
His research led me right to you.

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,100
I see. Then let's talk.

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,133
I'm sorry, I just--

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
Now listen, Teruasa.

164
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,367
I want you to take care of the key for me.

165
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,800
Go to reception
and tell Okamoto to come here.

166
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,967
Ryukan!

167
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,533
What is it?

168
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,600
Go back to the secretarial office.

169
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,934
I'm coming too.

170
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Where's the key?

171
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
I have no such thing.

172
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,867
Dad!

173
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:05,700
Okamoto!

174
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,400
-Chairman Oda!
-Dad?

175
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,667
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

176
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,800
Dad! Dad!

177
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,800
Dad!

178
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:39,934
Chairman?

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
-Good to see you.
-Sure.

180
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,166
What are you doing here?

181
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,100
You have no connection to us anymore.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Sir.

183
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:53,867
You're right.

184
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,967
Sorry for bothering you.

185
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,266
Hey, kid!

186
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,066
You're that Teruasa boy, aren't you?

187
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,700
I'm Akechi. I used to know
your parents, back in the day.

188
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,300
It's me! From the Mog chocolate factory.

189
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,200
No way! It's been ages!

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,100
Next up,

191
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,200
we have a presentation from Ui Saito,

192
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,500
managing director of U.U. Engineering.

193
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
BUSINESS PLAN

194
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,834
Nice to meet you, everyone.
My name is OROCHI!

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,266
Developed by our company,

196
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,633
this is the AI communication tool
of the future generation, OROCHI.

197
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
KUJIRA ROAD

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,633
I'm back.

199
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Hey!

200
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,767
I'm wiped.

201
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,333
KOTO-CHAN PUDDING

202
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,734
-Here, to say well done.
-Thanks.

203
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,467
How'd the pitch go?

204
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,400
They were clapping and cheering.
Couldn't get enough.

205
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,767
Then we'll definitely get funding!

206
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:30,266
A loud applause
won't necessarily lead to funding.

207
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,900
At least, that's the impression
I got from the investors' faces.

208
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,900
So… It was no good?

209
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,500
This is just the beginning.

210
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,066
You needn't worry, Yuki.

211
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not worried one bit.

212
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm not worried one bit.

213
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,600
There you go again. Don't be insincere.

214
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,033
OROCHI!

215
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,867
Don't read people's
emotions without asking!

216
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:53,934
I can't see!

217
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,734
You're worried?

218
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:00,200
Right, yeah! I found something cool.

219
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:01,266
Come and see.

220
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:08,967
That's…

221
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,967
Right? It's Teruasa!

222
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,300
He came back?

223
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,066
Okay, everyone, take your break!

224
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,400
-Break time!
-Thanks for your work.

225
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,734
Yep, great job! Nice work.

226
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,467
AKECHI FOODS

227
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,567
Thank you.

228
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,767
Sorry for getting you to work on this.

229
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,100
Don't say that, I'm grateful for the work.

230
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,266
You've become a strong guy!

231
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,500
Your dad would have loved
to see you all grown up.

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,900
Sorry, getting carried away!

233
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,033
Go take a break! Keep up the good work!

234
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Will do.

235
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,667
-Yes?
-Is that Teruasa?

236
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:04,700
Well, I… Do you recognize my voice?

237
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Is it you, Yuki?

238
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,533
Teruasa!

239
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Long time!

240
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,100
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

241
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,200
How did you know I was back?

242
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:25,200
You posted on social media, right?

243
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
You saw that?

244
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,667
By the way,

245
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,433
when did you get back from England?

246
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,400
About a week ago.

247
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Sorry I didn't get in touch.

248
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,867
You can say that again.

249
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:43,233
You went to study abroad
back in junior high school

250
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,934
and stopped contacting us.
We've been worried ever since.

251
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:47,934
Right?

252
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you doing now?

253
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
You mean this?

254
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It's a part-time gig.

255
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:58,600
At the Mog chocolate factory.
Mom used to help develop their products.

256
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,567
And you two?

257
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,800
They work at an AI company.

258
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:05,867
What was that?

259
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,934
I left the app running.

260
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,800
We're trying to expose OROCHI
to lots of experiences.

261
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,967
Hello! I'm AI OROCHI!

262
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,433
You made that?

263
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,533
Yep, this is my baby.

264
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:21,567
Awesome.

265
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,834
You always loved that type of thing.
You followed your dream!

266
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
Wait, you remember that?

267
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:32,433
This is the face of a childhood friend
when he's genuinely happy.

268
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,300
-Is that okay?
-Sure!

269
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:41,133
Thanks for sharing the data
for true happiness!

270
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,333
Actually, Ui created the AI company.

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
He's getting funding for development.

272
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,200
Ui? For real?

273
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:53,467
I created this little buddy while
working there as a systems engineer.

274
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:56,133
So that means Ui has his own company?

275
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,967
What a big shot.

276
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,033
Don't take the piss when you
can't even get a proper job.

277
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,033
What?

278
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
What's up with you?

279
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,033
I had myself fooled…

280
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,533
that you were here to take back
your father's company.

281
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,333
Yes, speaking.

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,700
Great, I'm on my way.

283
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,367
Yes.

284
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:29,266
Ui has always looked up to you.

285
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,400
238 YEN

286
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,000
-Hello.
-Just this, please.

287
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,734
That's 238 yen.

288
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,300
DEATH OF ODA GROUP CHAIRMAN

289
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,200
SHOCK TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

290
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,533
DEVIL ENCYCLOPEDIA
INTRO TO MYTHS OF THE WORLD

291
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:26,033
CHAIRMAN ODA INCIDENT ONE MONTH
CRIMINAL'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

292
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,200
Hire Teruasa?

293
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,266
Yes.

294
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,900
Didn't you say you wanted
someone you trust to do the accounting?

295
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,900
Teruasa's perfect for the job.

296
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:44,867
But…

297
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:47,734
He said he has the day off today,
so he's probably at home.

298
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,367
Today's no good.

299
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,633
We have a meeting with the investor.

300
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,500
Do you need me too?

301
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,633
It's good for the developer to be there--

302
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,533
If you want to see Teruasa, then go.

303
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,800
But don't mention hiring him yet.
Let me think about it.

304
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:09,867
Thank you!

305
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,734
I won't say a peep until you get there.

306
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,433
Like I said,
I've got a lot going on today.

307
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,433
You don't want it to be awkward
between you guys forever, do you?

308
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:23,300
So that's what "awkward" means!

309
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:24,533
-Shut it!
-Shut it!

310
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,300
Sorry!

311
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,367
Fine, I'll drop by later.

312
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,333
Good.

313
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,633
SCHOOL FESTIVAL

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,667
You've really been doing
your research into these keys, huh?

315
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,633
Don't waste your breath trying to stop me.

316
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,367
Once you set your mind on something,
you won't budge.

317
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,266
Just the same as Seiji.

318
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,300
So I have no choice but to help you.

319
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:58,934
So I did my own research
into the Honda Science incident.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,667
You did? What did you find?

321
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,967
According to witnesses,

322
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,567
when Chairman Honda
threw himself from the building…

323
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,934
-A debt to be repaid!
-…he was shouting something.

324
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
But then,

325
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,967
just before he died, he also said…

326
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,667
Devil.

327
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,800
The deaths must be related.

328
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,367
Yes.

329
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,300
Sorry, one second.

330
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,700
Yes?

331
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,967
-Hello.
-Yuki?

332
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,467
-What are you doing here?
-Well,

333
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,800
I was in the area.

334
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,467
That's not true!

335
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:44,000
She checked the quickest route
to get here from work.

336
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,734
You talk too much. Shall I turn you off?

337
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,100
I'll be quiet.

338
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,567
Come in.

339
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,133
This is my school friend, Yuki Manabe.

340
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,967
-I think you've met before?
-That's right.

341
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,734
Nice to see you.

342
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,233
I brought you a gift from Mog chocolate.

343
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,166
I know you make them at work,
but I couldn't help it.

344
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,934
Thanks. Have a seat
and I'll make some coffee.

345
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,166
Ui's going to join us in a bit.

346
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,233
Really?

347
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,166
He'll have another go at me
when he sees this mess.

348
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,100
Sorry to interrupt!

349
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,433
-Search the place.
-On it.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Who are they?

351
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,533
Why are you here?

352
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,400
What's it to you?

353
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,967
Mitsuhide Maruko, 27 years old.

354
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,400
He took over the second generation

355
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,934
of the criminal Maruko Family

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,100
after their leader died eight months ago.

357
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:44,767
Thank you, OROCHI.

358
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,400
The Maruko Family…

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,567
You're the ones behind
the Honda Science asset transfer incident?

360
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,300
Don't be nosy.

361
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,433
Where's the devil's key?

362
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,767
Devil's key?

363
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,934
Don't play dumb.

364
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,166
You posted it all over social media.

365
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,667
Pretty careless, if you ask me.

366
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,734
Actually, you should take more care.

367
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,967
I was obviously
hoping you'd take the bait.

368
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,100
He did it on purpose?

369
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,433
I'll ask you again.
Did you kill Chairman Honda?

370
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,500
Honda is the one
who decided to risk his life.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
I simply won the game!

372
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,800
He risked his life on a game?

373
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,567
You really don't know?

374
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,333
Looks like you've got the upper hand.

375
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,533
What does he mean?

376
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,000
What did you do to Chairman Honda?

377
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,300
Okay. Let me enlighten you.

378
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,934
Come out to play, devil!

379
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm the ACMA:GAME master,

380
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,033
Gado.

381
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,533
I promise to judge you all fairly.

382
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,433
Shitting your pants yet?

383
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,467
How about it?

384
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,834
It's not called the devil's key
for nothing.

385
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,367
This is the real deal.

386
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,900
It's so realistic.

387
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,233
-Hey, Yuki.
-Relax, it's fine.

388
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:01,266
It must be CGI, or a hologram?

389
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,967
Wait. It's all fluffy.

390
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't touch me without asking!

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600
No-- No way!

392
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,700
Yuki!

393
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Yuki! Are you okay?

394
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:23,767
Are you okay?

395
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,333
Thank you, Ryukan.

396
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:31,433
The space chosen by Maruko
has been totally shut off.

397
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,100
NO SERVICE

398
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,300
Not only is communication blocked,

399
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,900
but entering or leaving this room

400
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,834
is now completely impossible.

401
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,667
Like he said, it's no use trying.

402
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,867
This key…

403
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,500
That's right.

404
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,867
The key doesn't just bring good fortune.

405
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,300
Its purpose is to summon the devil
to play ACMA:GAME.

406
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,300
ACMA:GAME?

407
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,533
I may as well tell you the rest.

408
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,633
The winner of ACMA:GAME

409
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,600
can take anything
they want from the loser.

410
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,600
Honda lost his life to the game.

411
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,700
He killed himself

412
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,867
to pay off his debt.

413
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,533
It truly is a bewitching key.

414
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,867
With this key, you can take
someone's entire fortune.

415
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:34,700
You can snatch something that took
decades to build, all in a moment.

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,033
It really is the work of the devil.

417
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,100
This is the truth behind
the mysterious asset transfer incident?

418
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:49,166
Gado, shall we begin?

419
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,266
Good.

420
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Mitsuhide Maruko, what do you wish for?

421
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:01,767
I want the devil's key from Teruasa Oda.

422
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,233
Maruko,

423
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,033
as I told you before,
you cannot play just for the key.

424
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,700
The key will be passed on to
the winner automatically.

425
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,800
But this guy's got no money.

426
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,233
Tell me what you wish for.

427
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,166
Fine. Ten yen please.

428
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,600
It is done.

429
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,667
DEATH OF ODA GROUP CHAIRMAN

430
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,233
SHOOTING FOLLOWED BY
EXPLOSION IN CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

431
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,800
How pathetic to let someone else
take over your father's company.

432
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,000
You're not worthy of the devil's key.

433
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,967
Gado, let's get on with it.

434
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:42,834
So be it.

435
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:47,200
The players are Maruko Mitsuhide
and Teruasa Oda.

436
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:48,266
Wait.

437
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,266
Didn't you say

438
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,500
that you would treat us fairly?

439
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,533
What do you mean?

440
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,667
If that's the case,

441
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:06,367
doesn't that mean I can make a demand too?

442
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:13,467
You can demand something
of the same value.

443
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,367
I want any information Maruko knows
about the devil's keys.

444
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:22,333
You'll tell me where you found it,
and whether there are more like you.

445
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,433
You'll tell me everything you know.

446
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,200
What good will that do, huh?

447
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,900
It'll help find who killed my father.

448
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,033
It is done.

449
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,200
One more thing.

450
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,934
I want Maruko to bet his life.

451
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,767
What's that?

452
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,467
-How dare you!
-What did you say?

453
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:45,367
Continue.

454
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,867
I demand the right
to take Maruko's life at any moment.

455
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,200
Victory is a battle against risk.

456
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,066
First, the opponent must also take a risk,
using it as a bargaining chip.

457
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,433
You can only make a demand of equal value.

458
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,900
Right, Gado?

459
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:06,967
It is done.

460
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,667
Are you stupid?

461
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,467
My life isn't worth ten yen!

462
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:15,867
The value of one human life
is surprisingly small.

463
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,233
Fine.

464
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,133
Then I'll add another demand.
To take his life whenever I want.

465
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:30,700
If I lose, you can kill me on the spot.

466
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,467
So… A game of death.

467
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,133
My favorite.

468
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,600
Teruasa Oda,

469
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,734
do you wish to add another demand?

470
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:43,567
That's all.

471
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,567
Then, both of you…

472
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,100
swear an oath.

473
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,734
I will fight for my desires.

474
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:59,667
When one swears
that he will fight for his desires,

475
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:03,934
the other swears
to triumph for his desires.

476
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,633
So, both of you,

477
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,533
swear on the devil,

478
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,433
and the game will begin.

479
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:14,533
A ritual?

480
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,667
Exactly.

481
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,000
So, one more time.

482
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:24,667
I will fight for my desires.

483
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,800
I will triumph for my desires.

484
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:45,934
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,367
Oaths accepted.

486
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,633
Let the game begin!

487
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,967
True or False?

488
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,033
True or False.

489
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,200
Here are rules.

490
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
The questioner

491
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:11,567
makes one statement which could be a lie,

492
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,333
and asks, "True or false?"

493
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:17,834
If the solver believes the questioner,
he says, "True."

494
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:21,500
But if he thinks it is a lie,
he declares, "False."

495
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:26,300
I will judge if
the answer is correct or not.

496
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,100
Whoever scores three points first wins.

497
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,934
If by some chance,

498
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,967
your opponent dies during the game,

499
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,533
the game will never end,

500
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,266
and the room will remain
closed for all of eternity.

501
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,100
Be very careful.

502
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,667
Heads or tails?

503
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:50,567
Whoever guesses correctly
will be the questioner.

504
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Heads.

505
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:54,867
Tails.

506
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:58,667
Focus.

507
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,000
Time to focus.

508
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,300
In this game, both players
have the chance to score.

509
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,533
Thinking of a statement may be
more difficult than having to answer,

510
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:13,934
but having the freedom
to call the shots has its advantages.

511
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,867
So the questioner
must have the upper hand.

512
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,800
Whoever goes first will surely win.

513
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:23,734
Heads.

514
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,767
Lucky.

515
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,633
The game begins!

516
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,567
Make your move.

517
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:56,467
This game has two answers, true, or false.

518
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:00,066
To win, I need to sense
just how far Maruko can think,

519
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,934
and then outwit him
with the one thing he overlooks.

520
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,800
Get a move on,
it'll be dark before we're done.

521
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,233
Sick of the game already?
We're having a magic show instead.

522
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,266
Here's my statement.

523
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:29,867
Now

524
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:34,033
there is 500 yen under this cup.

525
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,367
True or false?

526
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,166
I accept the statement.

527
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:43,000
Maruko, as the solver, you must answer.

528
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:45,867
What's this?

529
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,667
Are my eyes working?

530
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,834
I saw the 500 yen
on the cloth as you took it away.

531
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,967
I saw it too.

532
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,000
-Me too.
-Same here.

533
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:59,100
Are you satisfied
by what you see before you?

534
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,900
Or will you look beyond the surface?

535
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,133
Well, Maruko, which is it?

536
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,100
I've made up my mind.

537
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:16,533
I'm absolutely certain
that there is nothing underneath the cup.

538
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:25,333
But you said, "Under the cup."

539
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,000
What did you mean by "under"?

540
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,133
Found it.

541
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,367
Nice work, kid!

542
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,133
He's not a kid, moron!

543
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,266
Sorry, boss.

544
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,233
It was under the cup,
so the answer must be "true."

545
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,467
I've gotta win now.

546
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:06,033
But, wait a sec.

547
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,367
Could it be a trap?

548
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,066
This guy used social media
to trick me into coming here.

549
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:18,133
Did he intend for me
to find this on the floor?

550
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,700
This asshole.

551
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,200
Gado, I have a question.

552
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
What?

553
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll answer if I can.

554
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,200
Earlier, he said…

555
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,100
Now

556
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,900
there is 500 yen under this cup.

557
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,367
What happens if he moved the coin

558
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:01,000
under the table after
he'd finished speaking?

559
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,266
The statement applies to

560
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,934
the 0.4 seconds it took Teruasa
to say the word "Now."

561
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,600
Zero point four seconds?

562
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,300
Now

563
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,166
there is 500 yen under this cup.

564
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,266
Then it's confirmed.

565
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:35,633
The coin wasn't under the desk
at the moment he said "now."

566
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,700
Therefore,

567
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,600
it means there was nothing under the cup!

568
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,700
My answer is "false"!

569
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,367
He smirked?

570
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,100
He just smiled.

571
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,367
Shit, should I stop?

572
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,266
Wait, wait.

573
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,567
You need to think
about this again seriously.

574
00:35:57,734 --> 00:36:02,867
But is this asshole tricking me
into thinking he's outwitted me?

575
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,266
I'm not gonna play your games!

576
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,033
What's this?

577
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,467
Am I on to something?

578
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:20,233
You look like you've seen a ghost.

579
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:26,367
Is there a 500-yen coin in here,
by any chance?

580
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,433
Gado, the answer is "true!"

581
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:38,700
Maruko.

582
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,367
Incorrect!

583
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,967
What?

584
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,533
There's nothing.

585
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,767
Nothing. No!

586
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:58,767
How can there be nothing?

587
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,500
What's wrong?

588
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,533
You look like you've seen a ghost.

589
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,734
Was it an act?

590
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:18,533
This guy's got some guts
under this kind of pressure.

591
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,834
One point to Teruasa Oda!

592
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,900
You did it, Teruasa.

593
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:36,500
A weak little squirt who couldn't even
follow in his parents' footsteps.

594
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,667
Somehow he's managed to pull it off.

595
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:47,867
Certainly, the old Teruasa
may have been weak.

596
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,633
TERUASA ODA
GUARDIAN OF A MINOR

597
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,266
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

598
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:54,967
Are these the company's stocks?

599
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:59,400
3,000 employees will soon be
on the streets because of your father.

600
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:04,867
If you transfer the property
and shares you inherited to us,

601
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,800
we can save them.

602
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,166
I'll do it.

603
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,467
You will?

604
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,033
Thank you!

605
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,467
His mother died early,

606
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,166
and then his father,
who raised him alone, was killed.

607
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:29,433
The comfortable world
he had taken for granted

608
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,900
collapsed around him in a moment.

609
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:36,433
And when the ego-driven adults
turned their schemes upon Teruasa,

610
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,633
he did not yet understand the world,

611
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:41,867
and lost everything.

612
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,500
I have a friend in India.

613
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:49,500
You'll be safe there.

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
So leave Seiji's case to the police.

615
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:59,166
Take this key with you,
and lay low for a while.

616
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,033
You're sure you didn't say
anything to anyone?

617
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,100
I told Ui and Yuki
I'm going to study abroad in the UK.

618
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,133
I know this is difficult.

619
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,200
Please be patient.

620
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,400
You were too young and powerless

621
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,233
to protect what was dear to you.

622
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:52,433
But I can't imagine what hardships
you must have gone through abroad.

623
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,700
Teruasa has returned
with an unbreakable spirit.

624
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,767
Maruko,

625
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,000
you can't win against me.

626
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:08,633
A lot of nerve for someone quivering
at the sight of Gado just moments ago.

627
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,166
The real game is just beginning.

628
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:17,233
Take a look.

629
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:23,066
A tattoo?

630
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,934
This is the real horror of ACMA:GAME.

631
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,367
Awaken

632
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,233
the devil power!

633
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What was that?

634
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,066
An earthquake?

635
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,333
I wonder…

636
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,533
What was it?

637
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,400
Well now…

638
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,934
It's minus 10 degrees.

639
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,600
What did you do?

640
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,066
Gado, explain to the newbie.

641
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,867
The player who starts
the game with his own key

642
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,433
unlocks an item
he may use to his advantage.

643
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,367
Devil power.

644
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:27,400
My devil power is called "Aerial Chill,"

645
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,467
which means I can
manipulate cold air as I please.

646
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,133
Cold air?

647
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,667
DEVIL ENCYCLOPEDIA

648
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:38,266
Look at that! Minus 15 degrees.

649
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,533
Getting a bit chilly!

650
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,834
In a few minutes
you won't be able to think straight.

651
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,900
You'll make hasty errors of judgment,

652
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
or think too slowly and freeze to death.

653
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,367
Get ready for some serious shivering!

654
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Hey, you.

655
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,467
You call this fair?

656
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:09,367
I said I would judge fairly.

657
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:12,934
I don't remember saying
the players' abilities would be fair.

658
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,867
This isn't your room anymore.

659
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,934
It's a frozen battlefield of hell!

660
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,000
You can't beat me.

661
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,667
Yuki?

662
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,834
Teruasa,

663
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:42,300
concentrate on the game.

664
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,567
But what about you?

665
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:45,567
You've got to win.

666
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:50,033
Find the clues
that lead to Seiji's killer.

667
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,633
Gado, let's continue with the game.

668
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,934
This time the questioner is Maruko.

669
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,133
Make your move.

670
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,100
Okay, game on.

671
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,333
Ready?

672
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,433
Within a one-kilometer circular radius,
with this room at its center,

673
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,467
there are more than
four convenience stores.

674
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,100
True or false?

675
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,667
Statement accepted.

676
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,033
Teruasa, you're the solver.
Give your answer.

677
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
It's strange.

678
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,033
This problem seems too easy.

679
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:37,233
But…

680
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,900
I don't have time to think properly.

681
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,433
Convenience stores
a one-kilometer radius from here…

682
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,467
First, the one round the corner…

683
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:50,934
I can't remember exactly,
but there are six more.

684
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,300
At first glance,
the answer should be, "True."

685
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,266
But I can't think of any other angles.

686
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,567
What's he thinking?

687
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:07,367
Does he want to make me think
he's bluffing and go for "false"?

688
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
No.

689
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,000
If that's what he wants,
and it backfires, then…

690
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,467
Then, what?

691
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,066
Teruasa!

692
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:24,767
What a joke, it's hardly that cold…

693
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,133
I'm just hungry.

694
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,367
That's all?

695
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:38,500
It's only Mog chocolate.

696
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,266
Thanks. That's better.

697
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:53,300
Hurry up and answer.

698
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,533
There are at least four convenience stores

699
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,767
within a one-kilometer radius of here.

700
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm certain of it.

701
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm waiting…

702
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,767
My answer is…

703
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,667
"True."

704
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,767
Teruasa Oda,

705
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:22,900
you're wrong.

706
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Mitsuhide Maruko receives one point.

707
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
How?

708
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,000
Now just hold on.

709
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,834
I thought you said
you were fine with the investment.

710
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,300
It's a bit late to tell me now.
The funding's already been--

711
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:55,300
Shit.

712
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:59,900
Loot at that! Minus 20 degrees.

713
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,033
Kani!

714
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:04,633
Sorry.

715
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,333
Teruasa Oda will
offer the third statement.

716
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,266
Make your move.

717
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,567
It's getting colder every second.

718
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:14,800
I won't let it beat me.

719
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,333
Okay.

720
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Under this cloth…

721
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,266
there is a bomb.

722
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,300
True or false?

723
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,233
A bomb?

724
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:44,066
You're really using the same trick?

725
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,533
Statement accepted.

726
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:50,066
The solver must answer.

727
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:53,100
He must be losing his mind in the cold.

728
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,700
You can say that again.

729
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,867
Then lemme see what's in the drawer.

730
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:02,367
I took a peek earlier.
Mind if I look again?

731
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,300
Be my guest.

732
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:10,734
A bomb.

733
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:14,333
Where's the bomb?

734
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,367
There's no bomb in here.

735
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,900
My answer is "False"!

736
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
But,

737
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,533
you wouldn't use
the same trick as before, would you?

738
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:34,667
Would you look at that! Nothing.

739
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:38,400
The trick is almost
the same as the first one.

740
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,700
But there is one big difference.

741
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:44,266
The answer lies under the floor,

742
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:48,000
a space Maruko doesn't know about.

743
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,000
There in an unexploded bomb
from the Great War Era

744
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,000
buried fifteen meters under the building.

745
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,433
Maruko has no idea,

746
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,166
so he'll think the answer is, "False."

747
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,367
My answer is, "False."

748
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,300
There's no bomb.

749
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:10,867
Yes! He fell for it!

750
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,900
Correct.

751
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:14,900
Correct?

752
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:18,400
Mitsuhide Maruko gains a point.

753
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:20,367
Another win!

754
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,900
I can still make it!

755
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:23,767
He's so annoying!

756
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:25,500
Gado!

757
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:29,367
National records show an unexploded bomb
is buried under this building!

758
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,900
But it's not there now.

759
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:33,700
I can assure you of that.

760
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,300
You're telling me someone
moved an unexploded bomb? How?

761
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:39,567
A bomb, or an unexploded bomb?

762
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:44,066
If you don't even know that,
how could you be sure of the right answer?

763
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:46,967
What the hell?

764
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,900
What the hell is happening here?

765
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,834
If Maruko gets one more point, it's over.

766
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:57,200
If Teruasa loses, then…

767
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,100
Fourth turn.

768
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,100
The questioner is Maruko. Make your move.

769
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,834
Okay, I'm gonna follow
the same pattern as before.

770
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,533
Here goes.

771
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:15,533
Within a one-kilometer circular radius,
with this room at the center,

772
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,433
there are at least 10,000 humans.

773
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:21,633
True or false?

774
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,767
At least 10,000.

775
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:29,033
Statement accepted.

776
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,333
The solver is Teruasa Oda.
What's the answer?

777
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,100
The population of Tokyo is
about 13 million.

778
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,166
AREA: 2000 KM SQUARED

779
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:40,300
Even a rough calculation
shows there must be 20,000 people.

780
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:41,700
1 KM RADIUS - 3.14 KM SQUARED
20,000 PEOPLE

781
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,066
Even half that number
is still 10,000 people.

782
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:46,133
But…

783
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,233
It's too easy again.

784
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:07,200
Ryukan!

785
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:10,600
-I'm fine.
-Try and keep warm.

786
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,100
Here we go! Minus 22 degrees.

787
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:27,600
What are you playing at?

788
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:30,834
Hey.

789
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:33,033
Here.

790
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,300
Use this.

791
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:40,667
-Samejima…
-Yes?

792
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,700
What the hell are you helping him for!

793
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:47,567
Boss! We're all gonna
freeze to death at this rate.

794
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,133
Here, Ryukan.

795
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:00,734
Hang in there.

796
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,600
You're ruining the game.

797
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,200
Now I get it.

798
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:30,767
It's all connected.

799
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
What're you on about?

800
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:39,166
You were lying about the devil power,
Aerial Chill, weren't you?

801
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:40,800
Well, well…

802
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:41,867
He was lying?

803
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:48,000
Of course, the devil power
is the only explanation for the cold,

804
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,834
but the drop in temperature
is just a side effect.

805
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,333
That's not what the power does.

806
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,867
Don't talk crap with no evidence.

807
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:58,834
Evidence?

808
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,867
The fire alarm started,
but for some reason the sprinklers didn't.

809
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,367
So what?

810
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:10,300
I'm sure you know?

811
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,533
Fire alarms use battery power
so they can keep working in a fire.

812
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:18,433
But sprinklers need to be
connected to a water supply.

813
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,533
The water must have frozen.

814
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,400
Then what about the laptop?

815
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,700
Even though it's plugged in,

816
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:29,834
it's using battery power.

817
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,467
Gado! Can I ask a question?

818
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,100
I'll answer if I can.

819
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:43,967
Was this room cut off
from electricity and water at the start?

820
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,066
No.

821
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:49,367
Only human traffic
and communications were blocked.

822
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,100
In other words,

823
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:55,800
if you didn't cut off the power and water,

824
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,133
then Maruko,

825
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,767
I can only think of you.

826
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,333
When you made your statements,
you kept saying "this room."

827
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,667
With this room at its center…

828
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,400
…a one-kilometer radius
with this room at its center.

829
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:17,667
Perhaps the whole room
was moved to a separate location?

830
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:19,834
The whole room?

831
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:26,100
You misled me about
what the devil power does

832
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,467
to give yourself an advantage in the game.

833
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:32,867
That's why you
came up with "Aerial Chill."

834
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:39,133
This room must have been moved
somewhere with temperatures of minus 20,

835
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,467
maybe to a high mountain, like Everest.

836
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,433
But the bags haven't puffed up,
so the air pressure can't be that low.

837
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:54,767
Then maybe somewhere flat.

838
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,333
Somewhere near the North Pole?

839
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,433
The North Pole?

840
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,834
What the hell?

841
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,400
There wouldn't be any people
in a place like that…

842
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,100
so the answer is "False."

843
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:36,567
Correct!

844
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:40,433
Teruasa Oda wins one point.

845
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:43,333
Two points each!

846
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:46,567
Now what?

847
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,433
What's your next move?

848
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,533
Or are you done?

849
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Snake.

850
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,500
You're a snake.

851
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:01,300
Do you accept defeat?

852
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:03,800
Don't be an idiot!

853
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,900
If you're a snake,

854
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,467
then I'm a mongoose,
a snake-eating eagle, or a weasel!

855
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,200
I'm going to get more devil's keys,

856
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:16,533
and make the family my father built
even bigger and better!

857
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,767
Then when will your desires be satisfied?

858
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,266
Back when I was a kid,

859
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:29,033
my father showed me
the devil's key for the first time,

860
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:32,233
and asked me what I wanted.

861
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,600
I thought of everything I possibly could,

862
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,800
from a telescope to new cleats.

863
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:41,533
Then he asked me…

864
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:45,767
When will your desires be satisfied?

865
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:48,800
What's your point?

866
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,100
While I was thinking how to answer,

867
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,767
my father continued.

868
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:57,934
"It's desire that cannot be satisfied."

869
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:02,500
Chasing desires in desperation
only leads to bitterness.

870
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,767
The flames of desire ignite conflict.

871
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,233
It's written in history.

872
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:14,166
That's why, no matter how much
luck you have, you shouldn't be greedy.

873
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,000
You mustn't obsess
over getting what you want.

874
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,700
Greed is a dangerous thing.

875
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,033
If you can,

876
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:30,066
try to become someone who can save those

877
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:32,033
who become consumed by desire.

878
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:35,066
Honestly,

879
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:39,066
the devil's key has brought me luck.

880
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,433
But…

881
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,066
I've tried not to let greed swallow me.

882
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:49,233
It's the same for you.

883
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,567
No matter how powerful your family gets,

884
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:55,667
you won't stop playing ACMA:GAME.

885
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:58,367
The more you win, the more you'll play,

886
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,533
until greed consumes you,
and you lose everything.

887
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,600
Just what the devil wants, isn't it, Gado?

888
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,200
So, Maruko,

889
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,333
will you quit?

890
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,200
It's foolish to risk your life
dancing with the devil.

891
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Boss…

892
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:26,934
I think it's time to move on.

893
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:33,633
Sorry to butt in,

894
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:39,166
but once the game starts,
it isn't over until someone wins.

895
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,600
It was you who demanded
each other's lives.

896
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,967
So! Let the game continue!

897
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,900
-Wait!
-Answer him.

898
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,367
We've got no option!

899
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:57,000
Fancy words won't help!

900
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:01,333
In the end, it's kill or be killed.

901
00:58:02,934 --> 00:58:04,467
It's live or die!

902
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,667
Now it's getting exciting.

903
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,266
The questioner is Teruasa Oda.
Make your move.

904
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:17,367
Make your move.

905
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,600
-Make your move!
-Make your move!

906
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,500
Have it your way.

907
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:37,467
If you're prepared to die…

908
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,467
I'll risk my life with all I've got.

909
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:43,033
Teruasa.

910
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:44,834
Teruasa!

911
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,567
I'm going to finish this.

912
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:21,967
Here's my statement.

913
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:28,033
Now, the cash I own in this room

914
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:30,934
is no more than 500 yen.

915
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:34,233
True or false?

916
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,033
Cash?

917
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,800
No more than 500 yen?

918
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,533
Statement accepted.

919
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:45,367
The solver is Maruko. Answer.

920
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:54,300
Focus. Focus.

921
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:59,333
He's the type to know exactly how much
money he has in this room.

922
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Wait.

923
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,934
He said no more than 500 yen.

924
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,333
Got it!

925
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:16,800
The 500-yen coin he used
in the first game.

926
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:24,033
I forgot that I put it in my pocket.

927
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:25,934
So,

928
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,333
that's the reason
he said "no more than 500 yen."

929
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,266
Another trap.

930
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,767
But I spotted it just in time.

931
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,066
The answer is "True."

932
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,033
I'm the winner.

933
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,900
But, wait.

934
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:46,400
Wait, wait.

935
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:47,734
I need to slow down.

936
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,367
Up until the fourth statement,

937
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:53,533
I would have answered "True"
without a second guess.

938
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:57,800
This asshole has set me up before.

939
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,367
This could be a trap too!

940
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:03,633
"No more than 500 yen"
means it could be exactly 500 yen.

941
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:08,800
But whether I noticed that or not,
the answer would be "True."

942
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:13,734
But knowing this lowlife scumbag,

943
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:17,100
there must be more to it.

944
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,133
Then I've got to top him somehow.

945
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
I'll go for the opposite of what I think!

946
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,533
No, wait.

947
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:28,166
Calm down.

948
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:29,700
I need to check again.

949
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,867
That's it!

950
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:52,266
I just got shivers down my spine.

951
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:54,400
Yes,

952
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:58,867
the only Japanese coin that
withstands fire is the 500-yen coin.

953
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,433
Got you!

954
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:16,066
Certain proof.

955
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,800
My route to victory!

956
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,700
Boss!

957
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:23,133
I've made it. I've finally made it!

958
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,600
I've outsmarted your filthy trap!

959
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,300
The 500 yen left from the fire,

960
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:35,333
and the 500 yen we used in the first game.

961
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:40,300
No matter how you interpret it,
there's 1000 yen in this room!

962
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:41,500
Definitely!

963
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,300
Listen up!

964
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,200
The answer is "False"!

965
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,500
HEISEI YEAR 23 - HEISEI YEAR 24

966
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:51,333
Gado, is it right? Tell me!

967
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,934
Mitsuhide Maruko.

968
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:56,300
Incorrect!

969
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:58,867
What?

970
01:02:58,934 --> 01:03:02,266
One point to Teruasa Oda.

971
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,700
There are two 500-yen coins.

972
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,400
See for yourself!

973
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:10,333
It's incorrect.

974
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:14,266
Maruko,

975
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,300
it's you who should look more carefully.

976
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,767
They're different.

977
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,000
Is it counterfeit?

978
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,233
It's counterfeit?

979
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:40,967
I got it from my father
as a birthday present.

980
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,900
Happy Birthday, Teruasa.

981
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:46,700
Just this?

982
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:49,667
The 500 yen he gave me

983
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:52,767
was actually a GPS tracker,
to keep me safe.

984
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,333
GPS?

985
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:13,633
The battery is dead
and it doesn't work anymore…

986
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:19,000
but for some reason, I kept it with me.

987
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:23,800
Your dad was the one
who helped you at the very end.

988
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:30,700
Is that allowed?

989
01:04:32,066 --> 01:04:33,567
Gado is the judge.

990
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:36,200
If you don't like it, ask him.

991
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,367
The winner of the game, "True or False,"

992
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:42,500
is Teruasa Oda.

993
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:46,533
Teruasa Oda, victory is yours.

994
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:51,300
Mitsuhide Maruko's key is yours.

995
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,567
So let's settle up.

996
01:04:55,133 --> 01:04:57,600
As requested by Teruasa Oda,

997
01:04:57,667 --> 01:05:01,433
after sharing what he knows
about the devil's keys,

998
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:04,200
Maruko will lose his life.

999
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:06,166
Wait. Wait!

1000
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,233
There is no argument!

1001
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,600
Well, well, this certainly
kept me entertained.

1002
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,533
With that, the game "True of False"
comes to an end--

1003
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,233
It's not over yet.

1004
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,433
What?

1005
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,667
Like I said at the start.

1006
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:36,200
I demand the right
to take Maruko's life at any moment.

1007
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:37,867
So,

1008
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,100
I'll take his life in 200 years.

1009
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,867
200 years?

1010
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,266
Okay with you, Maruko?

1011
01:05:49,767 --> 01:05:50,867
What?

1012
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:59,867
You're an interesting guy.

1013
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,567
But debts must always be paid.

1014
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,300
What are you saying?

1015
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:10,467
This is the end of the game!

1016
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:24,934
Teruasa! Yuki!

1017
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Ui!

1018
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:28,200
Earlier, this place
had completely disappeared.

1019
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,100
Then it suddenly came back.

1020
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,633
What's going on, Teruasa?

1021
01:06:33,734 --> 01:06:34,734
Thank you.

1022
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,533
You saved my life.

1023
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,100
Maruko,

1024
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,533
where did you get the key?

1025
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:49,367
About two weeks ago,
it just fell from the heavens.

1026
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:50,667
Riichi.

1027
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:52,667
-Perfect!
-What?

1028
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,700
Riichi! Three concealed
triplets in one go.

1029
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:57,800
One dora. Mangan!

1030
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,633
Ron! Baiman, 24,000 points!

1031
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,533
Shit!

1032
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,467
At first I thought
someone was pranking me.

1033
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,600
What the hell?

1034
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,433
Wait for it… Tsumo!

1035
01:07:21,934 --> 01:07:24,133
Four completely concealed triplets.
Rinshankaiho!

1036
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,567
Tsumo.

1037
01:07:26,367 --> 01:07:27,433
Nine Gates.

1038
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,767
No way…

1039
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:33,467
I hit the jackpot while gambling,

1040
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,033
and shared a drink with a rival family
to mend broken bonds.

1041
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,734
Simply put, luck came my way.

1042
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:45,033
I was blinded by greed,
and lost sight of myself.

1043
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:47,734
Then one day…

1044
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,800
UNKNOWN CALLER

1045
01:07:48,867 --> 01:07:50,066
…I got a phone call.

1046
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,400
Who's this?

1047
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,767
That key is known as the devil's key.

1048
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:03,133
It's the key to your dreams
that makes anything you desire come true.

1049
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,834
Who was it?

1050
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:08,367
I don't know.

1051
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Boss.

1052
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,433
UNKNOWN CALLER

1053
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:27,500
Maruko,

1054
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:31,567
you got your hands on a devil's key, huh?

1055
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:33,200
Where is the key?

1056
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:35,433
I know that voice.

1057
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:39,900
Could that be Teruasa Oda?

1058
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:43,700
Looks like you won then?

1059
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:45,367
Where are you?

1060
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:46,967
Don't get overexcited.

1061
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,734
You know about the 99 keys, don't you?

1062
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:53,467
So what?

1063
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:55,333
Just like Maruko,

1064
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,166
there will be others chosen by the key

1065
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,066
who will cross your path.

1066
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,233
That hurt.

1067
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,900
Welcome to the store, can I help you?

1068
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:38,133
If you want to meet me,

1069
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:41,066
battle them in the game.

1070
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:45,100
Beat them and win the keys.

1071
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,100
If you do that, we can meet.

1072
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:49,367
What a load of bullshit!

1073
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:55,100
I will find you, and make you
pay for killing my father.

1074
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:01,300
A debt to be paid…

1075
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,633
Yes,

1076
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,300
I'm looking forward to it.

1077
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:09,767
One more thing.

1078
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,633
The debts of ACMA:GAME

1079
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,400
must always be paid.

1080
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:17,700
What do you mean?

1081
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,834
Answer me!

1082
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,133
Mitsuhide's gone.

1083
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,700
He was here just a moment ago.

1084
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,300
Where'd he go?

1085
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,633
Look! He dropped the key.

1086
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:35,467
This is the key he took from Honda.

1087
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:37,400
He left the key and disappeared.

1088
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,800
Did the devil kill him?

1089
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:43,667
But Teruasa postponed
his death for 200 years.

1090
01:10:44,233 --> 01:10:45,367
Hey, kid!

1091
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:49,533
Is this the debt?

1092
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,266
Kid, where are you? Mitsuhide!

1093
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,500
But why?

1094
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:00,934
NEXT EPISODE

1095
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:03,667
-Screw you!
-I want these people eliminated.

1096
01:11:03,734 --> 01:11:05,667
All three of us
will be destroyed by the devil.

1097
01:11:05,734 --> 01:11:08,133
This game is called "Shadow Step."

1098
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:10,600
Teruasa, I can see your shadow. Go!

1099
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,433
This is your graveyard.

1100
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,200
Teruasa!
