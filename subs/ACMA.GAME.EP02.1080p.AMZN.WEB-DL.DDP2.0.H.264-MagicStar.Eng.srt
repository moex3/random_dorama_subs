1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,800
The key increases your luck
just by wearing it.

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:10,033
It stirs a person's desire
and sends them mad.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,800
The devil's key.

4
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:16,100
Since long ago, many people have died

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,166
in their scramble for all 99 keys.

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,600
Where's the key?

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:25,700
Thirteen years ago, my father was killed
by a man who came after his key.

8
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,667
Dad! Dad!

9
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:32,033
I returned to Japan to investigate
a series of mysterious deaths,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,834
-and was reconnected with old friends.
-Teruasa!

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
I had myself fooled

12
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:39,400
that you were here to take
back your father's company.

13
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:43,367
The key summoned the devil,
and a cruel game of death.

14
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,800
ACMA:GAME

15
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,400
The game begins!

16
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:47,700
If I lose,

17
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,667
you can kill me on the spot.

18
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,133
I'll risk my life with all I've got.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
It's live or die!

20
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,233
Teruasa Oda, victory is yours.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,233
Just like Maruko,

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,066
there will be others chosen by the key

23
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,734
who will cross your path.

24
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,633
I will find you, and make you
pay for killing my father.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,000
The debts of ACMA:GAME

26
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,266
must always be paid.

27
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,633
A debt to be paid…

28
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,367
Mitsuhide's gone.

29
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,467
I pulled off a narrow win.

30
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,066
But as a bitter price for victory,

31
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:28,567
I may have taken someone's life.

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,500
But why?

33
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:54,834
Teruasa,

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,467
what do you intend to do with the key?

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,934
Seiji's killer warned you.

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,000
There will be others chosen by the key

37
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,100
who will cross your path.

38
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,166
I'll be waiting for them.

39
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,767
If I can win the games

40
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,600
and collect the keys

41
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,333
-it will lead me to him.
-Teruasa.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,734
A pen is a useful tool for writing.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,900
However,

44
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,066
it can also pierce a person's heart.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,333
Both desires and the means to fulfill them

46
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,567
are there for the taking.

47
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,033
That's exactly why…

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
you must choose to listen

49
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,667
to what's in here.

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,400
I will.

51
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm telling you, it was a real devil.

52
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,433
Will you calm down?

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,700
It was fuzzy, with horns
sticking out its head, and－

54
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,667
And it was huge, as big as this.

55
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,533
You were just dreaming.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,800
But the leader
of the Maruko Family vanished.

57
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:12,233
Yeah, well, I didn't really
get a good look at him.

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,667
But you saw this room disappear.

59
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,433
Well, yeah.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Was that a dream too?

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,100
Teruasa,

62
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,066
did the devil make Maruko disappear?

63
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, Teruasa, what actually happened?

64
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:38,700
You two must not say anything to anyone
about what you saw here.

65
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,233
And from now on

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,233
you've got to keep out of this.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,400
-Why?
-Why?

68
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,433
It's dangerous.

69
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,433
You mean the devil's key?

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,734
Devil's key?

71
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,834
It's the key to the game run by the devil.

72
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,800
If you win the game,

73
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:09,400
you can take anything you want
from the loser.

74
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,867
What are you going to do next?

75
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,133
Find who killed my father.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Alone?

77
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,667
Are you crazy?

78
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,734
Leave it to the police.

79
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,467
You can't just go hunting down a criminal
by yourself.

80
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,934
I've gotten this far alone.

81
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,000
Isn't that enough?

82
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,200
You're finally back home.
Isn't it time to live your life?

83
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,567
As long as I have this key,
I can't hope for a normal life.

84
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:37,934
Is that right?

85
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,600
Then why don't you use the key

86
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:45,433
to win back your father's company
from Miyanouchi Group?

87
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,300
Can't you take whatever you want?

88
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,166
The Ui I knew…

89
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,967
would have told me
to win it back honestly.

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,033
Get your head out of the clouds.

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,133
Ui.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,900
Thanks for sharing the data
for losing one's temper.

93
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,934
Anyway,

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,900
just stay out of it.

95
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,367
Got it.

96
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,166
Have it your way.

97
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,300
Wait. Where are you going? Ouch!

98
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,734
Gosh. Are you okay?

99
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,133
That stings.

100
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,667
Shirota's closing in!

101
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,734
Hyodo can't do anything!

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,066
He's slipped! It's a narrow escape!

103
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,033
A knee strike from Hyodo!

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,033
Now Hyodo's lucky punch!

105
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,100
Pounding him into the ground!

106
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,533
Pound him! We have a winner!

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Tonight, the goddess of victory

108
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,734
is smiling on Takeru Hyodo!

109
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,433
Takeru Hyodo is back in the game!

110
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:38,033
Congratulations, Chairman Miyanouchi.

111
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,500
You've gotten hold of a devil's key.

112
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,967
Who are you?

113
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:46,567
You can think of me as
a preacher to the devil's key.

114
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,333
The keys hold many secrets.

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,066
And there is a method to collecting them.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,600
My accomplice will explain
all you need to know.

117
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,133
Chairman!

118
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,066
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

119
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,500
A five game winning streak!

120
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,500
Congratulations!

121
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,834
Another one?

122
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,467
You've been doing well lately…

123
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,934
haven't you, Hyodo?

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,333
Are you a fan? Want an autograph?

125
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,600
I guess you've realized
this key is making you lucky?

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Leave us.

127
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,433
Who are you?

128
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,800
With more keys,

129
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,700
you could get even richer

130
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,367
and even more powerful.

131
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,200
Oh, didn't you know?

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,834
More keys?

133
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,266
There are others?

134
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,400
Of course.

135
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,467
I know someone with three.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,133
OROCHI, is this it?

137
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,467
There's a Hellenistic mural from
the 4th century BC,

138
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,266
that depicts a demon and a key.

139
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,667
You sure this is a good idea?
Teruasa told you not to get involved.

140
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,667
It's only a bit of research.

141
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,533
When was that photo taken?

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,500
Second year of junior high.

143
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,567
SCHOOL FESTIVAL

144
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,100
We took it at the school festival.

145
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,000
So that's called a "memory", right?

146
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,367
Yep. A good memory.

147
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,166
Sorry I'm late, OROCHI.

148
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,900
Yuriko! Hello.

149
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,533
I'm excited for my emotions class.

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,367
Yes, let's get to it.

151
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,266
Wait. I just remembered.

152
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,567
-What?
-What?

153
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,633
Are the keys numbered?

154
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,967
Or do the codes mean something?

155
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,300
Hold on.

156
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,467
Yuki?

157
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,000
Teruasa?

158
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,400
Is now a good time?

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sure.

160
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:57,233
It's a bit last minute, but I thought
we could go get that video today.

161
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,467
Video?

162
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,266
Don't you remember?
After the school festival in second year,

163
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,433
the three of us made a video.

164
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,367
It was called, To Us When We Are 20.

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Right…

166
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,500
The thing we buried at school?

167
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,166
Yeah. That's the one.

168
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,533
We agreed to dig it up
after we all turned 20.

169
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,066
Our school's going to be demolished,
so it'll be lost forever.

170
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,567
So why don't we go and dig it up?

171
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:30,367
Sorry.

172
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,433
I can't today.

173
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,667
Right.

174
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,266
Because Teruasa went to study abroad,

175
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,233
you couldn't dig it up like you agreed.

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,800
You lost contact with Teruasa

177
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,867
and have been searching for him
ever since.

178
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,800
OROCHI…

179
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,200
Then how about tomorrow?

180
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,066
Or the day after?

181
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,867
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:02,734
I can't.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,467
Oh, no.

184
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,133
Is this called "rejection"?

185
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,567
Mom! Don't tell OROCHI
everything single thing.

186
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:23,667
Teruasa just thinks it's dangerous
for me to spend time with him.

187
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,433
I see.

188
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,300
But

189
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,867
if it's so dangerous…

190
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,700
all the more reason to help him.

191
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:39,667
This emotion must be "love".

192
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,233
What? Tomorrow?

193
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,533
Yep.

194
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,233
Let's dig it up and have a screening.

195
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,233
Is he gonna be there too?

196
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,567
He has a name, you know?

197
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,500
But actually, Teruasa said no.

198
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,567
It might be a good chance
for you two to make friends.

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
-So…
-Next!

200
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,633
You're saying you want me to ask Teruasa?

201
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Yes, please.

202
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,467
Mr. Saito, U.U. Engineering.

203
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,533
Yes.

204
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,166
I'm gonna pass.

205
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,934
What? Wait.

206
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,867
-Thanks for waiting.
-No problem.

207
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm looking for additional funding.

208
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,667
-Additional funding?
-Yes.

209
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,500
I give up.

210
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,767
Do you want a ride home?

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,467
I'm okay.

212
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,667
I need to make a detour.

213
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,233
I'll see you later.

00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,533
Teruasa?

218
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,667
I－

219
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,567
I was in the area.

220
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,300
-Anyway.
-Wait!

221
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,333
Wait a sec! No excuses!

222
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You came all this way, so let's get it.

223
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,800
It won't take long.

224
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,033
Come on!

225
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,000
Over here.

226
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,967
We buried it somewhere here.

227
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,100
Can you remember?

228
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,367
Wasn't it next to that tire?

230
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,200
Hey, Ui. Let's bury it here.

231
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,433
Isn't that obvious? Someone'll find it.

232
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,800
Move over.

233
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,367
From the tire,

234
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:02,734
one, two, three steps.

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,567
How about here?

236
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,467
From the tire…

237
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,533
One.

238
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,367
Two.

239
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,066
Three steps.

240
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,533
Here?

241
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,667
Do you remember
what you said in the video?

242
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,567
I just chatted nonsense.

243
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,433
Like whether I'd have a driver's license,

244
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,166
or if I'd get a girlfriend
by the time I was 20.

245
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,300
-Did you?
-What?

246
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,767
Did you get one? A girlfriend?

247
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:54,834
Well,

248
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,934
I've dated a few girls.

249
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
What about now?

250
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,467
Not at the moment.

251
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,333
Can I have that?

252
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,934
-It's here. This is it.
-Yes.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,300
Yes. You found it.

You've got a message.

260
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
It's from Yuki.

261
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,533
Read it out.

262
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,767
"Change of plan. We got the video.

263
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm waiting at school with Teruasa,

264
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,066
so you should join us after work.

SCHOOL FESTIVAL

00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,033
Hey, Ui!

269
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,600
I told you to bring 30,000 yen.

270
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,200
I don't have that kind of money.

271
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,867
-Let me check your wallet.
-Give it back.

272
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,066
Ui!

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,934
Teruasa.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,166
What are you doing?

275
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Did they take something?

276
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,166
It doesn't matter.

277
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,500
-But wait－
-Forget it.

278
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:46,033
Leave me alone.

279
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,066
Yuki,

280
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,066
do you know who put this here?

281
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,600
No. It was there when I got here.

282
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,967
Okay, class is starting.
Get to your seats, please.

283
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,567
What happened to your face?

284
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,367
Fell over in soccer.

285
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,900
What? I just fell over.

286
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,266
Hey,

287
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,166
is the company doing okay?

288
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,767
It sounded like the funding fell through.

289
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,700
Yeah.

290
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,533
I'm worried about it too,

291
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,967
but Ui said to
leave the business side to him.

292
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,433
He won't say much.

293
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,066
I see.

294
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,734
Maybe he didn't want to worry you.

295
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I suspect that is because
Ui is such a lovely person.

296
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,800
That's exactly why we've gotta
keep working hard, for his sake.

297
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,767
OROCHI,

298
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,967
you should be more open with your friends.

299
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,100
That's more human.

300
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:30,066
Really? Got it.

301
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,667
Yuki!

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,100
Teruasa Oda?

303
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,133
You have a devil's key. Hand it over.

304
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,533
Stop!

305
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,600
Who are you?

306
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,500
That key…

307
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,367
Hurry up, hand it over!

308
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,633
I heard you!

309
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,667
Just calm down.

310
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:52,867
The key

311
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,000
is right here.

312
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,800
Amazing.

313
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,133
You can have anything.

314
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:03,266
Money, women, power. Whatever you want.

315
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,867
I was too careless. What now?

316
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,533
Give it here or I'll kill her!

317
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,533
Okay!

318
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:19,300
I'll put the key down there.

319
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,967
Yuki, run!

320
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,233
Ui! Ui!

321
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,700
Teruasa, escape with Yuki!

322
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,600
I can't let anyone else die.

323
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,567
You must listen to what's in here.

324
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Come out, devil.

325
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,367
What's happening?

326
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,867
My name is Gado.

327
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:18,433
I'm the ACMA:GAME master.

328
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,200
I promise to judge fairly.

329
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:29,033
It was my only option to save you both.

330
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,834
The space chosen by Teruasa Oda,

331
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,433
the entire school grounds,
has been totally shut off.

332
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,734
It is impossible to leave
or enter the premises

333
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,767
until the game is over.

334
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:46,667
SAFETY FIRST

335
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,400
Communication with the
outside world has been cut off.

336
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,433
Yuck!

337
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,567
Blunt weapons taste like mud.

338
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:06,533
Gado, first I want to ask you
about the last game.

339
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,667
What?

340
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,934
Why did Maruko disappear
because of the debt to be paid?

341
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,800
Exactly.

342
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,900
He was obliterated,
in accordance with the rules.

343
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,166
Rules?

344
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:22,200
So the devil made him disappear.

345
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,567
You!

346
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,533
So we meet again?

347
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,033
Are you going to faint?

348
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:43,900
Who are the players? You and Takeru Hyodo?

349
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:44,967
Yes.

350
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,233
How do you know my name?

351
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,467
What the hell is this monster?

352
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,934
Then Teruasa Oda, tell me what you demand.

353
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:57,633
I want Takeru Hyodo to tell me
everything he knows about the keys.

354
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,767
Accepted.

355
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,333
Takeru Hyodo,

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,734
what do you wish for from Teruasa Oda?

357
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,166
Wish for?

358
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,400
Let me explain.

359
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,967
In this game,

360
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,166
the winner will take all of the keys

361
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,100
in the loser's possession.

362
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,033
That's not all.

363
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:20,200
You may meet the opponent's bet
with a wager of the same value.

364
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,800
You can take anything, such as fortune,

365
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,300
or even,

366
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,233
his life.

367
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,734
Are you serious?

368
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,433
I guess once the game is over,

369
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,734
these three will report you for
threatening them with a knife.

370
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,934
If you want to avoid that,
you could wager their lives.

371
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,700
Okay, if I win, I want all three dead!

372
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,600
Demand accepted.

373
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,734
What is going on?

374
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,166
This is the real thing.

375
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,300
If I lose, you can take my life!

376
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:02,133
How entertaining. It is done－

377
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,467
Don't you dare!

378
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,967
His life is mine to take.

379
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,467
Gado,

380
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,166
I want the right
to take Hyodo's life freely.

381
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,133
A game of death. My favorite.

382
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,667
Accepted.

383
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,567
Now take your oaths.

384
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:27,033
The ritual to set ACMA:GAME in motion.

385
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I will fight for my desires.

386
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,633
I will triumph for my desires.

387
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,500
Swear on the devil.

388
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,667
I will fight for my desires.

389
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,734
I will triumph for my desires.

390
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,433
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

391
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,667
Oaths accepted.

392
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,967
Let the game begin!

393
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,433
"Shadow Step."

394
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,333
In this game, you must
step on your opponent's shadow.

395
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,066
The sun?

396
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
We've gone back in time?

397
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,600
Each game takes place
in a designated area.

398
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:26,667
If you step on your opponent's shadow
from the neck upwards,

399
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,767
you score one point.

400
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,700
The first to get two points is the winner.

401
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:34,800
Whatever…

402
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,100
I played the same game as a kid.

403
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,700
I've stopped time.

404
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:55,700
First, the one who used
the devil's key to start the game,

405
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:58,700
is given a devil's power
which he may unleash.

406
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:04,633
There are many different powers.
Look at your hand.

407
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:10,033
The devil's power that you can release

408
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,467
is called "Limited Perfect,"

409
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:16,033
also known as "One Minute Freeze."

410
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,300
Limited Perfect.

411
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,433
Any object that you touch

412
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
will be frozen still for one minute.

413
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:28,633
But it may only be used
once during the game.

414
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:36,300
I will give you both a word of warning.

415
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:40,700
In the unlikely event that one
of the players dies during the game,

416
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,400
the game cannot be terminated

417
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:46,834
and this space
will remain closed for all eternity.

418
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,233
Be very careful.

419
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,266
Understood.

420
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,500
Hyodo, do you understand?

421
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,266
This whole thing's nonsense!

422
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,433
But I guess I have no choice!

423
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,967
So let's just get this game over with

424
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,633
and have some fun!

425
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,533
Then the first round begins!

426
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,900
This is

427
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,533
the sports field?

428
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
SHADOW STEP
ROUND ONE

429
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:19,433
Now, fight with everything you've got!

430
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,433
That was a close one.

431
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,200
He's fast. Who is this guy?

432
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,533
Now,

433
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,166
it's my turn.

434
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,266
Teruasa!

435
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,400
That tattoo…

436
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,600
OROCHI, Search Takeru Hyodo.

437
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:05,233
There's no connection,
so I can't get the data.

438
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Shit.

439
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,367
Wait. Where are you going?

440
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,633
He's here! He's a fighter
who was banned for rigging matches.

441
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,133
HYODO TAKERU
BANNED FOR LIFE FOR CHEATING

442
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,233
I knew it.

443
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,400
I recognized his tattoo.

444
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,100
A while back,

445
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,934
Hyodo disappeared from the public eye

446
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,967
after he was caught rigging games
to help pay off his gym's debts.

447
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:36,500
Now there's a rumor he's unbeatable
in the underground fighting scene.

448
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,000
There's no way Teruasa
can win against someone like that.

449
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,467
I'm gonna get that key!

450
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,266
The weak are so desperate.

451
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,667
Look at you thrashing around,

452
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:57,266
struggling so hard
just to find an opening.

453
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,000
Take this!

454
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,266
Listen up,

455
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,367
there are two types
of people in this world.

456
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,533
Those who win for themselves,

457
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,567
and those who lose everything
to total strangers!

458
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,867
That's my life lesson to you.

459
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:32,533
Takeru Hyodo

460
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,600
has stepped on a shadow.

461
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,633
One point secured.

462
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,200
Time for round two.

463
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,500
Here's your next arena!

464
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,133
SHADOW STEP
ROUND 2

465
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:04,567
Teruasa!

466
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
How'd it go?

467
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,900
I lost the first round.

468
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:12,967
Come on.

469
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,767
A pro fighter?

470
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:20,500
Yes. Seems he was banned from playing

471
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,233
after he played illegal matches

472
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,834
to help the gym
where he trained pay off its debt.

473
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,467
Right…

474
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,233
You're in the lead by one point, huh?

475
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,100
You've got this.

476
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,233
You were there?

477
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm your second.

478
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,433
I've got a great strategy.

479
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:47,600
Wanna hear it?

480
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,567
You really wanna win, right?

481
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,100
Anyway,

482
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,567
why did you say that?

483
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,500
You said you'd take Hyodo's life.

484
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,066
I want the right
to take Hyodo's life freely.

485
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,467
No matter what situation
we've got ourselves into,

486
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,467
no matter how bad that guy is,

487
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,166
you don't have the right to take his life.

488
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,033
It's all meaningless if I don't win.

489
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,433
What are you saying?

490
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,400
Ui, leave it.

491
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,500
If we don't work together to win the game,

492
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,767
all three of us
will be destroyed by the devil.

493
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,100
Hey, look.

494
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,767
Our shadows are stretching
towards the hallway.

495
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:40,967
So it must be more advantageous

496
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,333
to be on the hallway side of the building.

497
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,867
Don't ya think that's a little naive?

498
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:47,066
Did you call me, "ya"?

499
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,233
There's nowhere to hide in the hallway.

500
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,200
So it'll be a game of stamina.

501
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,633
Which isn't exactly
Teruasa's strong point.

502
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,367
Isn't that a little rude?

503
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:58,133
I must be making progress!

504
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,934
Magic.

505
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What?

506
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,600
The game we used
to play in the hallway upstairs.

507
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,300
That's it.

508
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:13,066
-Ready?
-Yep.

509
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,700
Three, two, one.

510
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,467
-No way!
-Wow!

511
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,767
-Incredible.
-Amazing.

512
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,467
Three, two, one.

513
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,567
-Whoa!
-Wow!

514
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,233
Thank you.

515
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
What? How did you do that?

516
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,166
Well－

517
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,166
Here you are!

518
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,333
Run!

519
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,633
Yuki, hide somewhere.

520
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,567
Come out wherever you are!

521
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,467
Or I'm gonna break this guy's neck!

522
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,433
Don't be a coward!

523
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,834
Teruasa, I can see your shadow. Go!

524
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,834
Got you!

525
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
I win.

526
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:04,400
A dummy?

527
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,100
Teruasa Oda has stepped on a shadow.

528
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,767
One point secured!

529
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,633
I used to hide there
all the time to play tricks.

530
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:21,133
Three, two, one.

531
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,266
-No way!
-Wow!

532
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,233
-Three, two, one.
-Was that real?

533
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:27,667
-Whoa!
-Wow!

534
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,433
Right, Ui?

535
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,767
Now it's one point each.

536
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:40,166
Whoever wins round three
will be the final winner.

537
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:45,667
The final game should be
even more entertaining.

538
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:52,300
SHADOW STEP
ROUND 3

539
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:58,834
I can't see my shadow.

540
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,533
The gymnasium.

541
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,433
The haunted house
from the school festival.

542
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,033
Where is it? Where's your shadow?

543
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,300
Hey, Hyodo.

544
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,033
You're a pro fighter, aren't you?

545
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,633
So what!

546
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,633
What you really want

547
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,333
isn't money or power.

548
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,800
You want to be in the spotlight again.

549
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:44,333
If that's so, then you don't need the key.

550
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,100
You can achieve it by effort alone.

551
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,867
Don't give into desire!

552
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,467
Then you don't need the key either?

553
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,800
But you want it.

554
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,500
You hide behind a mask of innocence,

555
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,834
but it's you who has
already given into desire!

556
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,967
Perhaps the need for revenge

557
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,333
is also a form of desire.

558
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:13,934
But

559
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:17,200
if I'm going to find who killed my father,

560
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:19,734
I'll do anything for the keys!

561
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,133
Shit.

562
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,400
Hey, I was looking for you.

563
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,367
Hyodo is nearby.

564
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,633
What are you planning to do with that?

565
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm going to trap him. You two hide here.

566
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:41,800
Yuki,

567
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,700
I need OROCHI to do some calculations.

568
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,533
OROCHI isn't operating fully.
What do you need to calculate?

569
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,367
Timing.

570
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,233
Oda!

571
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,433
Show yourself!

572
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,300
Hyodo's extremely agile,

573
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:19,967
so I need to stop his movements
at just the right time.

574
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:31,300
I'll use the devil power "Limited Perfect"

575
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,967
to stop the curtain handle from moving.

576
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,033
LIMITED PERFECT

577
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,834
Then, I'll cut the rope
supporting the handle.

578
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,433
Now.

579
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,166
Hyodo.

580
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:12,500
Oda!

581
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:17,734
Ten,

582
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,100
nine,

583
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,233
eight, seven…

584
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,166
-Give it up.
-Six…

585
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,667
Five,

586
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,066
four,

587
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,166
three, two…

588
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,633
Just as planned.

589
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,133
Why didn't the curtain fall?

590
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,166
The key to this game

591
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,600
is simply a difference in ability.

592
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,500
Things don't always go to plan.

593
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,233
This is your graveyard.

594
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:00,967
Teruasa!

595
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,400
Ui!

596
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,767
Don't be an idiot!

597
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,600
The idiot is the one
not stepping on his shadow!

598
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,133
Get it, Teruasa!

599
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,800
That's it!

600
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,867
Teruasa Oda

601
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,734
takes the lead with two points.

602
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:27,100
Therefore, victory goes to

603
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,266
Teruasa Oda.

604
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,667
Wait!

605
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,734
In accordance with the rules,

606
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,767
the devil's key
in Takeru Hyodo's possession

607
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,066
goes to Teruasa Oda.

608
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,734
After Takeru Hyodo has told Teruasa Oda

609
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,133
all that he knows about the devil's keys,

610
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,100
he will lose his life.

611
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,066
I'm going to die.

612
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:57,200
After I go,

613
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,800
just like Maruko－

614
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,166
Wait.

615
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,233
What's this?

616
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,066
Gado,

617
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,266
now I know what happened last time.

618
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,567
What?

619
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,000
Last time,

620
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,834
I made my bet carefully
so that Maruko wouldn't die.

621
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,433
I demand the right
to take Maruko's life at any moment.

622
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,633
After the game,

623
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,767
I said I'd take Maruko's life
in 200 years,

624
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:27,300
to save him from death.

625
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,166
But he disappeared anyway.

626
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,333
When the first demands were made,

627
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,567
Maruko lost his temper,
and you accepted his words.

628
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:41,233
If I lose,

629
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,266
you can kill me on the spot.

630
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,567
My demand was overwritten.

631
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,033
That's why he disappeared?

632
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:59,333
This time, I made sure
to overwrite Hyodo's words.

633
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,800
If I lose, you can take my life!

634
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,567
How entertaining. It is done－

635
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,900
Don't you dare!

636
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Gado.

637
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:12,266
I want the right
to take Hyodo's life freely.

638
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
Gado.

639
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:22,967
You cannot kill Hyodo against my will.

640
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:26,266
I have the right to take his life.

641
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,600
I will be the one to decide when to do so.

642
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,367
Fine.

643
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,600
Then the Shadow Step game is over!

644
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
You saved my life.

645
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:06,900
Was that your plan all along?

646
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

647
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,133
Like I said,

648
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,500
it's all meaningless if I don't win.

649
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:22,800
But in the end,

650
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:25,233
I got you two mixed up in it.

651
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,066
I'm sorry.

652
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,300
At a time like this,

653
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,266
don't you mean "thank you"?

654
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,633
We're your friends.

655
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,934
Thank you.

656
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,233
Take it.

657
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:18,367
Hyodo, where did you get this key?

658
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,433
It just suddenly fell in front of me.

659
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,333
The same thing that happened to Maruko.

660
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
Then who told you about me?

661
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,734
Senya Uesugi.

662
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,133
Senya Uesugi?

663
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:40,166
That's all I know about the keys.

664
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,767
TO US WHEN WE ARE 20
JUNE 24TH, 2012

665
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,734
So, 13 years later,
it's time to watch the video!

666
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,166
Here goes!

667
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:58,266
Very good.

668
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,433
First up, Teruasa.

669
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,767
Three, two, one, go!

670
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:08,433
TO US WHEN WE ARE 20
TERUASA ODA

671
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,633
Hi, 20-year-old me. Are you watching?

672
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,200
Have you got a driver's license?

673
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,133
Did you get a girlfriend?

674
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Wow, you're acting all grown up.

675
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,600
Second-year Teruasa
didn't have a girlfriend.

676
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,667
Teruasa, what's your dream for the future?

677
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:29,233
I want to go to Canada
and see the northern lights.

678
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,300
Aren't you going to take over Oda Group?

679
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:35,133
That's kinda a long way off.

680
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,200
But you do wanna take over eventually?

681
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:45,166
Ui's next.

682
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,667
Three, two, one, go!

683
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,800
TO US WHEN WE ARE 20
UI SAITO

684
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:55,233
TO ME WHEN I AM 20
UI SAITO

685
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,000
I want to start my own IT company.

686
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,333
-It came true.
-Shush.

687
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,433
I'm kinda interested in that too.

688
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,834
Really? You too, Yuki?

689
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:07,934
That's a bit fishy.

690
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Is Yuki the reason
you're interested in IT?

691
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,867
No! Get off camera!

692
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,834
But that's so iffy, don't ya think?

693
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,133
No! Stop it!

694
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,233
Looks like this isn't the first time
you two have fallen out.

695
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,533
Three, two, one, go!

696
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,900
TO US WHEN WE ARE 20
YUKI MANABE

697
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,700
Last up, me.

698
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:35,800
When I'm 20…

699
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:37,233
Gonna be an AI developer?

700
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,633
Teruasa, get out the way.

701
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,834
When I'm 20,
I hope I'm still friends with you two.

702
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,033
What?

703
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:49,533
That's all!

704
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:54,900
THE END

705
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,300
What a cute friendship.

706
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:16,066
It nearly made me cry.

707
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,333
Who are you?

708
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,433
Senya Uesugi?

709
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,233
Call me Senya.

710
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:26,166
And you are?

711
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,533
That's right.

712
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,967
Can I call you Terurin?

713
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:32,367
How do you know who I am? Who are you?

714
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,667
Who?

715
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,533
Let's see…

716
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,533
Does this answer your question?

717
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,500
Are you an accomplice
of my father's killer?

718
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:50,133
Do you mean

719
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,400
Hoshin?

720
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,600
Hoshin?

721
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:57,433
You're kidding?

722
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,600
You don't know?

723
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,200
You don't know about his organization?

724
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,500
What do you mean, "organization"?

725
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:09,767
I'll tell you once the game is over.

726
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,533
Oh, yes.

727
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,433
I forgot you've got
all this baggage with you.

728
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Who are you calling baggage?

729
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,567
Why don't you and I
discuss this elsewhere?

730
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,467
Teruasa.

731
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,400
I'm going to give you

732
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:32,834
the greatest thrill of your life.

733
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,800
NEXT EPISODE

734
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:40,700
Play the game with me.

735
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:42,166
TERUASA VS A GENIUS GAMBLER

736
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:43,233
You're the best.

737
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,900
He's not just after the keys.

738
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,166
Guess the card symbol.

739
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,467
This is "Five One."

740
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:50,700
A master of his craft,

741
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,934
he's got me in the palm of his hand.
