1
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:07,300
Underlying the history of war,
there is always a mysterious key

2
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:11,166
that seduces man and stirs his desires.

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,567
Devil's key?

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,700
It's the key to the game run by the devil.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,033
If you win the game,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,066
you can take anything you want
from the loser.

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,567
Just like Maruko,

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:26,266
there will be others chosen by the key

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,700
who will cross your path.

10
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:31,266
I will find you, and make you
pay for killing my father.

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
Call me Senya.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Who are you?

13
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,266
Does this answer your question?

14
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:04,367
A man called Teruasa Oda has the same key.

15
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,467
He is an experienced player.

16
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,300
You don't stand a chance against him.

17
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:11,900
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD

18
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,333
If you have the choice…

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,500
you should take on a beginner.

20
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,567
KEY OWNER
YUKARI SHIKIBE - 18 YRS OLD

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,133
Yukari!

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,934
Yukari!

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,667
Yukari! Yukari!

24
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,200
Yukari! Yukari!

25
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,867
-Yukari!
-Thank you, everyone!

26
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,667
Yukari!

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,900
Aha.

28
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,633
Don't come near me!

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,166
I'm not giving this key to anyone!

30
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,300
Sorry, out the way.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,333
What?

32
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,266
You're the chairman of Miyanouchi Group.

33
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,900
The lucky owner of a key, huh?

34
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:35,433
Who are you?

35
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:56,100
Teruasa! Come and try this.

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
Is it chocolate?

37
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,700
Wow, it's yummy.

38
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,133
You like it!

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,867
Hey! He said it's yummy.

40
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,834
That's right,

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,066
your mom designed that
with the food department.

42
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,967
It's called "Mog chocolate."

43
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,066
-Mog chocolate?
-Yes.

44
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,900
-Think it'll sell?
-Dunno…

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,066
Looks a bit like bunny poop, so maybe not.

46
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,934
Don't be so cheeky!

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,767
A highly valued opinion.

48
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:29,500
Then can I join the company
and figure out how to sell stuff?

49
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
What's this?

50
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,767
You want to do what your dad does?

51
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,667
I wonder if I can.

52
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,700
I'm sure of it.

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,133
If you keep working hard.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,467
Well,

55
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,300
you can do it, Teruasa.

56
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,133
Do you promise?

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Promise!

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,967
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,300
I couldn't keep my promise.

60
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,900
TO TERUASA
HAPPY 11TH BIRTHDAY

61
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,633
It's okay to cry if you need to.

62
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,233
I can't.

63
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,834
Mom will be sad if I cry.

64
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,467
Where's the key?

65
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,433
I have no such thing.

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,867
Dad!

67
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,600
The man who killed you

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,066
contacted me.

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
This key

70
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,767
has many secrets.

71
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:50,867
How much did you know?

72
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,700
They want to invest?

73
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,700
Yes, okay.

74
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,300
Of course, thank you very much!

75
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,533
Score!

76
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
Good job, Ui!

77
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,333
Are you going to tell Yuki?

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,166
You bet.

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,200
Hey, Yuki,

80
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,533
I had a call just now－ What?

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,300
What video?

82
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:23,934
Yuki?

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Something bad's happened.

84
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,400
It's the chairman of the Miyanouchi Group.

85
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:31,400
Check the link I'm sending you now.

86
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,333
MESSAGE FROM YUKI MANABE

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,667
WATCH NOW!
THE CHAIRMAN'S IN TROUBLE

88
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,033
MAN THROWS MONEY FROM BRIDGE
#MIYANOUCHI

89
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,700
I, Yoshichika Miyanouchi…

90
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,967
CHAIRMAN MIYANOUCHI GOES MAD

91
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,066
…hereby pledge to transfer…

92
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,500
MONEY-THROWING MAN
IS THIS ASSET TRANSFER?

93
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:48,633
…all management rights
of the Miyanouchi group

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,000
to Uesugi!

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,367
I'll call you back.

96
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59,233
Is that Terurin?

97
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,433
I guess you saw the video?

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,100
What have you done to Miyanouchi?

99
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,633
More questions?

100
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,266
I'll answer if you win the game.

101
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,166
Where are you now?

102
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,433
Right now?

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,233
Somewhere I'm sure you've been before.

104
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:23,700
Just chilling out in the seat
your father used to sit in.

105
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,767
Why are you there?

106
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,333
Hurry along now.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,734
I'm waiting.

108
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:35,867
Teruasa!

109
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:36,934
Ui?

110
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:38,867
I saw the video.

111
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,633
Did Uesugi have something to do with it?

112
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,233
I think so.

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
I'm not letting you go alone.

114
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,433
Senya Uesugi is 27 years old.

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,734
He was arrested for gambling in 2017.

116
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,900
Numerous witnesses report
seeing him at black market casinos.

117
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:55,834
Uesugi!

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,834
Using my smile to turn frowns upside down,

119
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,066
I'm racing to the top of the idol world.

120
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:04,333
My name is Yukari Shikibe!

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,767
Right?

122
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,467
Right!

123
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,767
What?

124
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't tell me you haven't heard of Yukari?

125
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
She's an idol!

126
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,934
I thought she'd cheer you up.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,767
Even got her to wear her costume.

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,667
Oh, yeah.

129
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:29,133
By the way, she's got a devil's key too.

130
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,834
Chairman Miyanouchi came after me,

131
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,100
but Senya came to my rescue!

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
She liked me straightaway,

133
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,700
so I let her off the hook.

134
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,500
You see, women like a strong man.

135
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,467
-Right?
-Right!

136
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,900
Quieten down, little playboy.

137
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,333
If it means I can keep the key,

138
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,967
I'll flirt and smile all you want.

139
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
I wouldn't get mixed up in this
if I were you.

140
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,166
What's this?

141
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,433
Great advice!

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,533
Just like I thought,

143
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,367
you dragged your luggage along with you.

144
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,433
Quit babbling.

145
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,433
Uesugi, let's get to the point.

146
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Return the Miyanouchi Group.

147
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,133
Meaning?

148
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,300
Let's play the game.

149
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,633
Terurin, you are so lovely.

150
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,233
So, Senya Uesugi.

151
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,767
What do you want, and from whom?

152
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,333
Obviously, my opponent is…

153
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,567
Terurin.

154
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,700
And what I want is

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,066
maybe his friend's life?

156
00:08:59,133 --> 00:08:59,967
You can't!

157
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,433
Oh, sorry!

158
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,500
I want everything he knows
about the devil's keys.

159
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,233
Accepted.

160
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Teruasa Oda,

161
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,767
there will be no tricks
from you this time.

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,600
I want to know everything Senya Uesugi
knows about the keys and Hoshin.

163
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,667
Fine, accepted.

164
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:23,767
I'm not done.

165
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,533
I want you to return the company
to Chairman Miyanouchi.

166
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,667
Are you some kind of idiot?

167
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,266
Don't you want it for yourself?

168
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,166
Teruasa, you were supposed
to take over the company.

169
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:36,967
I know.

170
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,934
But winning a company on a bet
is ridiculous.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,133
I've made up my mind!

172
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,467
If you lose, I want you
to do three things for me.

173
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,667
Anything I like.

174
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,767
That spices things up.

175
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,000
Accepted.

176
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,166
Now take your oaths.

177
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,200
I will fight for my desires.

178
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,934
I will triumph for my desires.

179
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,300
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

180
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,000
Oaths accepted.

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,033
This time, the game is called…

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,567
"Five One."

183
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,967
"Five One."

184
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:26,300
The game uses 15 cards.

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,033
Diamonds, spades, hearts, and clubs.

186
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:39,800
And this one is a devil card?

187
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,567
There are three of each suit.

188
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,000
Fifteen cards in total.

189
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,767
One of these cards…

190
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,734
It's turned totally black.

191
00:10:56,734 --> 00:11:00,700
You must guess the symbol on this card.

192
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,867
This card is "Five One."

193
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,500
Each player is dealt three cards
from the rest of the pack,

194
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,233
which will give you the information
needed to start the game.

195
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,767
By reasoning from these three cards,

196
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:21,567
each player will take turns
to guess the suit of the black card.

197
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,500
The first to get the correct symbol,
gets one point.

198
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,033
The first with three points is the winner.

199
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,066
There are five types of card.

200
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,834
So the probability
of guessing right is 20 percent.

201
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:38,166
As the game continues,
the probability of guessing right goes up.

202
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,567
One more thing.

203
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,533
On the first turn only,

204
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,333
both players can reveal as many cards
as they like from their hand.

205
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:51,066
Of course, that means the opponent
will be able to see the symbols.

206
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
But

207
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,767
how is that useful?

208
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,100
If you show your cards

209
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,633
you receive the same number of new cards.

210
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
If you share information…

211
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,000
NEW CARDS

212
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,467
You get new information all to yourself,

213
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,333
which makes it easier
to figure out what the black card is.

214
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,133
Let the game begin!

215
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,834
In the first round,

216
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
this is the card I need to guess.

217
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,767
FIVE ONE
ROUND ONE

218
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,734
I have the devil power, Limited Perfect.

219
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,700
No doubt this guy
has some special ability too.

220
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,533
But what is it?

221
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,233
And when will he use it?

222
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,767
The first player is Senya Uesugi.

223
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,400
Declare how many cards you want to reveal.

224
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,567
I'm not showing any cards.

225
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,000
I already know the answer.

226
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,800
The symbol on the card is…

227
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:12,967
a club.

228
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,066
Incorrect!

229
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,166
Oh, what a shame!

230
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:24,000
That would have been
such a killer bluff if I'd been right.

231
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,266
You've gotta be kidding me.

232
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,934
Now clubs have been eliminated,

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,734
it leaves diamonds, spades,
hearts, or the devil.

234
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,500
A 25 percent chance of success.

235
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,867
But why didn't he show any cards?

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,867
Is he bluffing to mess with my head?

237
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:45,767
Or he gained something useful
from guessing straightaway.

238
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, yeah.

239
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,066
Since I'm calling you Terurin,

240
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,867
feel free to drop "Uesugi."

241
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,233
My first name will do.

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,600
We're not friends.

243
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
Cold as ice!

244
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,333
I should have added another demand.

245
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,600
To force you to become my bestie.

246
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:09,734
If he has three cards
of the same suit in his hand,

247
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,266
he's excluded the clubs,
and the suit in his hand,

248
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,200
and his chance of success is 33 percent.

249
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,500
So it was better to keep his cards hidden.

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,266
Now I have a huge disadvantage.

251
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,567
At the very least, knowing his hand
would have put us in the same position.

252
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:26,667
Wait…

253
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,900
I have a heart and two diamonds.

254
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,467
The symbol on the card is a club.

255
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,767
Incorrect.

256
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,300
Clubs have been excluded.

257
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,066
If this guy has three of the same card,

258
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,834
then they must be devil cards, or spades.

259
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:44,900
If that's true…

260
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,633
I'll show all three cards.

261
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,100
What have we here?

262
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,500
You receive three cards in return.

263
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,734
A spade.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,700
That means that he must have

265
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,867
three devil cards.

266
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,967
So there's no way
the black card is a devil card.

267
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,233
Two diamonds on the table

268
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,667
and one in my hand,
so it can't be diamonds either.

269
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:22,467
So the answer is hearts or spades.

270
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,667
Fifty percent chance of success.

271
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,066
Teruasa Oda, take your guess.

272
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,633
My answer is spades.

273
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,066
Incorrect.

274
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,133
Shit, you were wrong.

275
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,533
Don't worry.

276
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,734
I've reached the right answer.

277
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,066
It must be hearts.

278
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,633
Second turn. Senya Uesugi, you're next.

279
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,800
This time you can't show any cards.

280
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,233
Take your guess.

281
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,734
Okay! I'm going for…

282
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,900
hearts.

283
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,600
Just kidding.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,100
It's a devil card.

285
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
It's not a heart?

286
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:20,567
Correct! One point to Senya Uesugi.

287
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,066
Gotcha!

288
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,767
A devil card?

289
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,500
When you saw I didn't show any cards,

290
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,900
you made a rookie error,
assuming I had three of the same card.

291
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,767
Just because I said clubs…

292
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,266
a club.

293
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,600
You jumped to the conclusion
I didn't have a club in my hand.

294
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,367
But hold on.

295
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,033
That's too bad.

296
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,734
After that, you went
and showed me three cards,

297
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
just like I knew you would.

298
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,934
You gave away one heart and two diamonds.

299
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:02,767
So if you assumed I had
three of the same card,

300
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,367
you'd think the black card
was a devil or spade.

301
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:07,800
After you got three new cards,

302
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,400
you went for spades.

303
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,667
Incorrect!

304
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,300
Wonderful, truly wonderful.

305
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,567
You concluded I must have
three devil cards.

306
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,200
Meaning,

307
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,166
the three new cards you got
didn't include a devil card.

308
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,967
One heart on the table,

309
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
and two in my hand.

310
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,166
Spades was wrong,
clubs was wrong. Leaving…

311
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:41,934
A diamond or devil.

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,500
Well, let me remind you what you did next…

313
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,233
Incorrect!

314
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,266
Shit, you were wrong.

315
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,567
Don't worry.

316
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,667
You were so confident.

317
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,934
Just as if you knew
you'd get it right next term.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,166
That convinced me.

319
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:04,633
You eliminated the possibility
of it being diamonds.

320
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,433
Meaning the third diamond

321
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,533
must be in your hand.

322
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:16,000
Shit, you were wrong.

323
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,433
So the right answer was devil.

324
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,433
He knew what I was thinking.

325
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,033
Everything.

326
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,934
You're a smart cookie, a master of logic,

327
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,266
but to gamblers,

328
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,900
masters of logic

329
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,033
are worse than fools.

330
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,433
Sitting ducks.

331
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
This guy is good.

332
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,200
A master of his craft,

333
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,033
he's got me in the palm of his hand.

334
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,033
Time for the second round.

335
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:56,033
FIVE ONE
ROUND TWO

336
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,400
Hey, Ui.

337
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,667
Got anything I can write on?

338
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:09,333
Hold on a sec. What are you two up to?

339
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,934
This is a game of probability.

340
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:15,533
I'm gonna write down the math.

341
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,467
Is that allowed?

342
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:18,700
I'll allow it.

343
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,266
All I have to do

344
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,633
is make sure I don't give anything away.

345
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,567
To do that…

346
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,400
Awaken the devil power.

347
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
LIMITED PERFECT

348
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,800
I'll use my devil power to stick
the cards together, hiding the symbols.

349
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,367
I'm showing three cards.

350
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:43,433
The problem is whether this counts
as showing cards.

351
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,400
Now you receive three new cards.

352
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,200
Yes, he let it go.

353
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,500
What?

354
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,567
Why are they stuck together?

355
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,767
Could it be…

356
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,033
this is your devil power?

357
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,633
Who knows?

358
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:12,266
Gado, my guess is spades.

359
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,700
Incorrect.

360
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:18,066
The second player is Senya Uesugi.

361
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,233
Do you wish to show any cards?

362
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,266
It's a shit hand, so be my guest.

363
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,133
You receive three new cards.

364
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,400
Say, Terurin.

365
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:42,433
You seem to be trying your best
to keep me in the dark this time,

366
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,834
but you've given something big away.

367
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:50,000
The cards you fixed with the devil power

368
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,700
are all clubs, right?

369
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,400
-How the hell?
-Ui.

370
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,967
Look at that.

371
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,767
Did I guess right?

372
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,900
You can only use a devil power once,

373
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,300
so the best time to use it,

374
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,400
would be when you have a really good hand.

375
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:16,367
Like when you have three of the same card.

376
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,767
You made a crucial mistake.

377
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,100
Do you know what it was?

378
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,000
What are you talking about?

379
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,967
When you took the new cards,

380
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:33,433
you turned the middle one
the other way up.

381
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,867
The other two symbols must be upside down,

382
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:41,000
but that doesn't
seem to bother you, does it?

383
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,166
The cards on each side

384
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
must be diamonds?

385
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,367
Right.

386
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,767
Including the cards in my hand,

387
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:55,100
now I know 11 cards out of 15.

388
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,467
Spades were already guessed incorrectly,

389
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,834
so that means,

390
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,200
it's a devil card.

391
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,867
Incorrect.

392
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,333
No way!

393
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,033
Not three clubs?

394
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:25,667
But you gave it away.

395
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:29,467
Oh, sorry. Teruasa asked me to play along.

396
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,967
ACT LIKE HE'S RIGHT

397
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,066
IF HE GUESSES
WHAT THE THREE CARDS ARE

398
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,233
Teruasa had him fooled from the start.

399
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,667
Since you narrowed it down
to a devil card,

400
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,700
now I know you have
two hearts in your hand.

401
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,500
Therefore,

402
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,834
the answer is diamond.

403
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:03,734
Correct.

404
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,734
Teruasa Oda wins one point.

405
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,800
Crap, I think I'm falling for him.

406
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
So…

407
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,767
Shall we continue the game of deception
you love so much?

408
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,633
I'm suddenly starting to enjoy myself.

409
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,834
Teruasa and Ui?

410
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,233
I think they're playing Senya Uesugi
to win back the company.

411
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,467
Yuki, Yuki!

412
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,967
I got some new info on Senya Uesugi.

413
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,367
New info?

414
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,533
FIVE ONE
ROUND THREE

415
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,166
Yukari, will you get my bag?

416
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,100
-Here.
-Thanks.

417
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,800
Gado-chin, can I take a memo too?

418
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,467
Yes, I'll allow it.

419
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,166
Perfect.

420
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,467
Thanks to Terurin's little notepad trick,

421
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,734
I can use mine
without anyone blinking an eye.

422
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:16,166
If I mark the cards like this,

423
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,066
I'll know what's in his hand.

424
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,633
Isn't this a cute game,

425
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,867
Terurin?

426
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,667
Three cards.

427
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:32,734
You receive three new cards.

428
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,066
That's a pretty bad hand.

429
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,867
As long as I mark one more card, I'm good.

430
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,633
Your father was killed by Hoshin.

431
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,900
When did you decide to get revenge?

432
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,500
Ever since he died 13 years ago.

433
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,266
Seriously? You really know
how to hold a grudge!

434
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,133
That's enough.

435
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,667
You can't understand how someone feels
after losing their family like that.

436
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,533
You're right, I don't get it.

437
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,033
This idiot could not get any worse.

438
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:17,967
Senya Uesugi, what's your answer?

439
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,934
-Hearts.
-Incorrect.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,867
He's getting sloppy.

441
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,300
By the way, Terurin.

442
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,533
What would you do if you saw an old man

443
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:29,266
walking along with heavy bags?

444
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,767
I'd see if he needed help.

445
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,567
Impressive.

446
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,500
Instead of an old man,
what if it was a child?

447
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,567
The same thing.

448
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:40,133
Is that compassion?

449
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:43,033
You feel pity for those in trouble?

450
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
It may appear so.

451
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,934
So what if it was a 14-year-old
middle school student?

452
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,033
What if that student believed
he had caused his father's death,

453
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,934
and instead of bags,

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,400
he was carrying a heavy burden of guilt?

455
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:04,834
I owe thanks to your son,
who's been digging around online.

456
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
His research led me right to you.

457
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,166
Okamoto!

458
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,066
Chairman Oda!

459
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:14,000
Dad! Dad!

460
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,033
What are you trying to say?

461
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,767
"Responsibility" sure sounds fancy.

462
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:24,600
But are you living your own life?

463
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,467
Teruasa Oda?

464
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,767
Don't let him get to you, Teruasa.

465
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:38,834
I'm showing three cards.

466
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,834
You receive three new cards.

467
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,934
You've started doing it too.

468
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,567
Too?

469
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,633
No.

470
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,834
Where is it? Where?

471
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,266
The spade has one dot.

472
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,667
The club has four dots.

473
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,200
The devil card has five dots.

474
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
He marked them.

475
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,100
Finally realized?

476
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,200
I marked them too.

477
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,767
In the second round.

478
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,667
Impossible.

479
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:38,834
The answer

480
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,767
is clubs.

481
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,600
Correct.

482
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,166
Teruasa Oda gains one point.

483
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes.

484
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,033
You've got this.

485
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:55,567
Incredible.

486
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,633
That was incredible, Terurin!

487
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,667
I owe thanks to the gods
for meeting you. Wait!

488
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,900
I owe thanks to the devil.

489
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,400
Damn right.

490
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:13,834
But you're the only one I can't lose to.

491
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,333
What do you mean?

492
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
I'll tell you if you win.

493
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,100
But that'll never happen.

494
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,633
Ten years ago, when Senya Uesugi
was a high school student,

495
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,333
he came home late at night
after hanging out with a friend.

496
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,500
ELDEST SON FIRST
TO DISCOVER THE INCIDENT

497
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:30,467
AND REPORT IT TO THE POLICE

498
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:31,967
He saw his parents and younger sister

499
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,200
get attacked and murdered by a robber.

500
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:34,600
MURDERER STILL ON THE RUN

501
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:36,734
How awful.

502
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,467
And the robber?

503
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,900
He was caught half a year later.

504
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,533
But it wasn't the police who found him.

505
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,433
It was Senya Uesugi himself.

506
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,266
He caught him alone?

507
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,133
As the only survivor, he felt responsible,

508
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,400
and went behind the police
to catch the killer.

509
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,734
He went through
something similar to Teruasa.

510
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,867
Maybe

511
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,467
he's not just after the keys.

512
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,533
You're the best.

513
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,333
This is fun.

514
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,266
I wish we could play forever.

515
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,600
FIVE ONE
ROUND FOUR

516
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm showing two cards.

517
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you kidding me?

518
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,500
He's totally scribbled over them.

519
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,233
It's just one cool move
after the next with you.

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Gotcha. Both cards are marked.

521
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,734
Did you spot it?

522
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,266
Teruasa Oda, it's your turn to guess.

523
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,133
Hearts.

524
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,133
Incorrect.

525
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,700
Senya Uesugi, you go second.

526
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,667
How many cards do you want to show?

527
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:06,867
All three.

528
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:08,867
Just copying now?

529
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,066
I was thinking of doing it before you.

530
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,166
Promise.

531
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:16,233
It doesn't matter.
It's two diamonds and a spade.

532
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,767
Two clubs

533
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:24,500
and a devil card.

534
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,834
Now you're just giving it away?

535
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:31,066
You marked all three anyway.

536
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,767
No point hiding them.

537
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:36,400
By the way, I know what's in your hand.

538
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,433
A heart, diamond, and a club.

539
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,367
Don't expect me to tell you
if you're right or wrong.

540
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,367
Do what you want.

541
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,033
Then why don't we take a peek

542
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,533
at the back of these cards.

543
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,700
Both cards have five dots.

544
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,567
So it must be two devil cards, right?

545
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,100
If that's right, the answer is

546
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
spade?

547
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,266
No,

548
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,233
wrong.

549
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,667
Teruasa put fake markings on those cards.

550
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,233
They're actually spades.

551
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,700
So the answer is devil.

552
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,400
Senya Uesugi.

553
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:27,834
Wait!

554
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,567
What now?

555
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:31,400
I was about to say it's not spades.

556
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,333
I spoke just in time, didn't I?

557
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,066
Make your mind up!

558
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,133
Sorry.

559
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:40,734
Something pretty caught my eye.

560
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,500
I found your…

561
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,233
second markings.

562
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,800
On the key.

563
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:01,200
Terurin put a mark in black pen
on the black section.

564
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,734
You can see which card it is

565
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,066
by the way it catches the light.

566
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,066
He spotted it.

567
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,400
The black card

568
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,266
is a devil card.

569
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,266
Correct. One point to Senya Uesugi.

570
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,467
Take that!

571
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,734
Two points each!

572
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,166
You are a master of suspicion.

573
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,967
The next round will decide the game.

574
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:31,066
I'm looking forward
to the greatest thrill of my life.

575
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,900
FIVE ONE
ROUND FIVE

576
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:41,233
From the marking,
I know one of the cards is a heart.

577
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,133
The other two

578
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,533
have had their markings covered up.

579
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:52,300
Senya Uesugi goes first.

580
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,467
Do you wish to show any cards?

581
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,800
I'll show two.

582
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,834
The symbols are covered up.

583
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,600
Which cards are they?

584
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Well, well.

585
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,567
Two of the new cards

586
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,667
don't have a single mark
made by me or Senya.

587
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:22,066
There can only be two cards like that.

588
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,033
They must be hearts.

589
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,767
That makes three hearts in total.

590
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,200
Don't let him get away with it.

591
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:33,700
Might as well use my secret weapon,
"Senya-kun Eye."

592
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,967
Let me explain what it is.

593
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,900
It's a devil power that lets me
look through obstacles to see what I want.

594
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:43,934
Look through obstacles?

595
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,834
I can see a club and two diamonds.

596
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,934
So the answer is

597
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,633
spade.

598
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,834
Incorrect.

599
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,734
What? You're lying!

600
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,700
It makes perfect sense.

601
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,233
Teruasa Oda, you go second.

602
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,700
Do you wish to show cards?

603
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,667
All three.

604
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
This card must be a diamond.

605
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:22,934
Teruasa Oda, your answer.

606
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,367
In total, I know
what nine of the cards are.

607
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,433
Spades has been ruled out

608
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:36,133
so it must be a devil card, or clubs.

609
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,133
He must have been bluffing
about the devil power.

610
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,633
If he'd seen the card,
he'd have got it right.

611
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,000
Come on, we don't have all day.

612
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,133
But why would he lie?

613
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:55,800
Did he do it to divert my attention
away from something else?

614
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,700
The two cards he revealed at the start…

615
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:04,633
Could they have more markings on them?

616
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,800
Gado-chin, shouldn't he get a yellow card?

617
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:22,767
STEAL THE RABBIT

618
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,133
Fine.

619
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,133
Have some Mog chocolate for the wait.

620
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,567
Oh, crap.

621
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:32,166
-Hey!
-Here.

622
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,000
Thank you.

623
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
I win.

624
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,500
What?

625
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,734
You can't win if you don't guess.

626
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
A magician whose tricks
are this transparent,

627
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:46,800
ought to hang up their hat.

628
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
What's he planning to do?

629
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,533
A club and a devil card.

630
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
It's invisible ink.

631
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:08,300
It can only be seen with a black light.

632
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,233
I was right behind him
and even I didn't notice.

633
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,467
So, Teruasa Oda,

634
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,767
what is your answer?

635
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,767
The cards you were hiding
were a club and devil.

636
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
-Wait…
-The answer is…

637
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,734
Clubs.

638
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,400
Teruasa Oda,

639
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:35,433
incorrect!

640
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,367
What?

641
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,100
It can't be.

642
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,834
Just like I thought!

643
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,100
I knew you'd figure out my trick.

644
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,500
This is the pen.

645
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,000
On the other side,

646
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,967
it really is invisible ink.

647
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,667
But, hey.

648
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:04,767
Your discovery was all part of my

649
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,767
strategy.

650
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:10,934
Just as you guessed,
Senya-kun Eye was a bluff.

651
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:15,166
I used a little something called

652
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,934
acting.

653
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:21,867
I put on quite a show to lure you in.

654
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,767
Now for the big reveal.

655
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,467
Two clubs.

656
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:42,100
You were completely fooled.

657
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,900
You figured out my special trick,
but I still managed to deceive you.

658
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,700
I'm having too much fun, Terurin.

659
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:54,667
Senya Uesugi, what is your answer?

660
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:57,767
This is…

661
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,734
a devil card.

662
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,367
Correct.

663
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,600
One point to Senya Uesugi.

664
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,834
Bringing him up to three points,

665
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,533
the winner of Five One,

666
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,633
is Senya Uesugi!

667
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,266
How wonderful it feels!

668
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,700
Terurin…

669
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:27,000
You were the best opponent ever.

670
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,567
Teruasa.

671
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,000
Teruasa Oda,

672
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:38,533
that was short but sweet.

673
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,834
This brings the game Five One to an end!

674
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,500
There's a debt to be paid!

675
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,734
Teruasa! Ui!

676
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,834
Teruasa.

677
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:04,667
A debt to be paid.

678
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:06,700
Cough up.

679
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,467
You can thank me.

680
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,266
I've freed you
from the heavy shackles of responsibility.

681
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:26,734
What?

682
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,000
Teruasa lost.

683
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Well,

684
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,967
tell me all you know about the keys.

685
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,734
From my research,

686
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:42,333
the devil's keys
have been around since BC.

687
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:47,700
And have been the cause of much conflict.

688
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,266
There are 99 keys in total.

689
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,367
If you collect them all,

690
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,300
you can have the world.

691
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,233
On each key,

692
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,133
there is a number inscribed
that looks like some kind of code.

693
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,433
That's all I know.

694
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,233
Okay, next. I have three favors.

695
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,166
I can ask for anything I want.

696
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,867
Please, anything but someone's life.

697
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:20,667
Give me your hand.

698
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:22,867
What's he doing?

699
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,166
Turn around.

700
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,967
Good boy.

701
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,600
As for my final request,

702
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,100
I'll save it until later for fun.

703
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,066
Ten keys in total.

704
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,100
Yukari, wanna play?

705
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:54,133
What?

706
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:58,166
Now I kinda understand
how to use the keys.

707
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,633
I just need to find a sucker to play with.

708
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,767
#selfie #ponytailgirl
#mysteriouskey #iwanttostealkeys

709
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,033
Can I say－

710
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,867
Will you…

711
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,934
give the key back to Teruasa?

712
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Why, exactly?

713
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,533
Teruasa really needs that key

714
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,467
to catch who killed his father.

715
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:27,266
I don't know.

716
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:29,333
You're the same.

717
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:32,567
Your family was attacked and killed too.

718
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,934
You were just a high school student,

719
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:39,467
but you caught the attacker yourself
and turned him into the police.

720
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:43,500
Could it be
that you challenged Teruasa to a game

721
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,166
because you were intrigued
by how similar you are?

722
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:50,633
That's kinda messed up if it's true.

723
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,900
We can't begin to imagine
what they've been through.

724
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,967
You did your research, huh?

725
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,600
Honestly,

726
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,233
when I look at Terurin,

727
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,033
it reminds me my painful past.

728
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,266
It makes my heart ache.

729
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:11,967
It's been so difficult.

730
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,233
I wonder if the devil's key…

731
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,100
doesn't just bring good luck,

732
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:24,633
but also brings similar people together.

733
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:26,834
Uesugi…

734
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,000
It's all bullshit.

735
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,667
What?

736
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,900
It's all too touching to be genuine.

737
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,867
He may have been
Mr. Nice Guy in the past, but now,

738
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,867
all he wants is a cheap thrill.

739
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,133
You got me.

740
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:52,834
You bastard.

741
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,500
Why don't you give up
all this boring revenge shit?

742
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,333
If what you said is true,

743
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,033
Hoshin is collecting 99 keys,

744
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,367
and seriously trying
to take over the world.

745
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:05,000
A crazy guy like that.

746
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,300
You really wanna take him on?

747
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,567
How about

748
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,266
we make a bet on the key?

749
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:18,367
Say again?

750
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:24,233
With that key,
I can challenge Hoshin to a game,

751
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:28,834
unearth all the keys and destroy them.

752
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,900
I will crush Hoshin's ambitions.

753
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,600
That's how you'll take revenge?

754
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:37,700
Exactly.

755
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'll fight and crush
those swallowed by desire,

756
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,100
and set them free.

757
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,967
They'll probably kill you first.

758
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:49,166
But…

759
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,266
wouldn't that be
the best thrill of your life?

760
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,633
How about it?

761
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,900
Take the bet.

762
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,133
Join me in my plan,

763
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,233
and I'll make sure it's worth it.

764
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,767
Must be a bit lonely
collecting keys by yourself.

765
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:11,200
Team up with me.

766
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,467
Team up with me, take the keys
and destroy them all.

767
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:17,667
I'll make your life worth living!

768
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,667
Fine.

769
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,433
Glad to have you on board, Senya.

770
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,200
Can't wait, Terurin.

771
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:49,867
First of all, let me tell you about
Hoshin's organization.

772
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,133
Armed groups have crossed

773
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,533
the South American border
in a military incursion.

774
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:10,567
Thanks to the key.

775
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:14,500
To see our whole plan through…

776
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,133
We need to find all 99 keys.

777
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,033
Gungnir.

778
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:35,700
NEXT EPISODE

779
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,533
Whatever danger awaits…

780
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,633
TERUASA VS A GUNGNIR DELEGATE

781
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,300
…I will crush Gungnir's ambitions.

782
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,967
A fight for one hundred gold coins.

783
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,233
Cut the crap.

784
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,033
It's over.

785
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,633
I've won.
