1
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:09,166
If you collect 99 devil's keys,
you can have everything in the world.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,867
We have become wrapped up
in our struggle for the keys

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,233
and finally reached
the mastermind behind it all.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,166
First of all, let me tell you about
Hoshin's organization.

5
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:21,667
"Gungnir."

6
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,200
Gungnir.

7
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,266
"Gungnir is the spear of Odin,

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,834
who is the god of war
and death in Norse mythology."

9
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,700
Exactly what kind of organization is this?

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,333
Strange things
have been happening recently.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,066
Something is pulling the strings
behind the scenes…

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,500
Gungnir.

13
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,333
That's not all.

14
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,333
Politicians, high-ranking policemen,

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,867
and members of the self-defense force
have been mysteriously killed.

16
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,967
ACMA:GAME and Gungnir
seem to be responsible.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,333
What's Gungnir's end game?

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Beats me.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
But…

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,734
They want the key owners
to fight each other.

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,600
Unsuspecting citizens have no idea,

22
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:17,800
but Gungnir's influence
can be felt everywhere.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,367
How cool is that?

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,033
I'm getting goose bumps.

25
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,700
Show some respect.

26
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:28,033
Teruasa has had to live
with the consequences.

27
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,633
The baggage is still here?

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,266
You're just a background character.

29
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,066
-What did you say?
-Calm down.

30
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,433
You need to calm down.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,967
Can you really trust this guy?

32
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,834
Ui. Yuki, you too.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
It's too dangerous now.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,600
You need to stay out of this.

35
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:56,967
You need people you can rely on
to help decipher the keys.

36
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:58,533
I…

37
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,300
can't think of anyone
you can trust more than Ui and Yuki.

38
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,767
Teruasa,

39
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,900
let us help you.

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,233
We won't do anything
that would put you in trouble.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,233
She's right.

42
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:21,133
Okay. Thank you.

43
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,333
GUNGNIR

44
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,200
Did you find anything on Gungnir?

45
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,266
Nothing.

46
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,300
OROCHI searched everything.

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,567
It's useless.

48
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,900
I see.

49
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:44,000
I got some interesting data

50
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,066
thanks to you and Senya Uesugi.

51
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,233
What?

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,967
You two are like cats and dogs.

53
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:52,166
Thanks for the concrete example
of two people who don't see eye to eye.

54
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:55,667
Stop learning pointless stuff
and get on with your work.

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,667
Teruasa.

56
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,500
Sorry to barge in.
I got some data on the devil's key.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Everything the analytical engine found
is on here.

58
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,600
Here.

59
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,300
Thanks, I'll check it now.

60
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,200
Yoo-hoo, Terurin.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,367
-I let myself in.
-Senya.

62
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,400
-I've gotta go.
-That's a great jacket.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,333
URGENT NOTICE

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
WE ARE UNABLE
TO CONFIRM PAYMENT

65
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,834
AMOUNT OWED
18,000,000 YEN

66
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:51,734
Yes, this is Saito from U.U. Engineering.

67
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,667
Sorry to disturb you.

68
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,400
My name is Inukai, from Black Size Japan.

69
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,266
I see.

70
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:04,367
Yep! You seemed down in the dumps,
so I got you some bread.

71
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,633
Bread?

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,133
Oh, right. Terurin.

73
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,867
Know what this is?
It's called a "bread clip."

74
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,700
-Heard of it?
-Quiet.

75
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,767
Terurin, your lips look a bit--

76
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,867
-Don't touch me.
-They're so chapped.

77
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,533
You should use this lip balm I made.

78
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,200
Look!

79
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,433
I named it Senya-kun Lip.
Shall I put it on for you?

80
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,066
-I'm good.
-Pucker up.

81
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,400
Get away.

82
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,967
Dry lips are unpopular with the ladies.

83
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,166
Look at this.

84
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,166
More numbers appear
when you put three keys together,

85
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,834
and when I do a particular analysis,

86
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,767
you get two numbers.

87
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,367
Two numbers…

88
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,867
Yeah.

89
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,800
If you convert it to angle and distance…

90
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,066
It looks like
there was a devil's key here.

91
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,233
NATIONAL DIET BUILDING
NATIONAL DIET PRESS CENTER

92
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,133
I see.

93
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,000
So this is how Gungnir
has been finding key owners.

94
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,700
So…

95
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,834
I guess someone from Gungnir was here,
huh?

96
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,734
Teruasa, wait.

97
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,066
The coordinates are moving.
The key isn't here anymore.

98
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,000
Are you Teruasa Oda?

99
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,433
Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,633
I'm Nagakute, from Gungnir.

101
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,867
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm Inukai.

103
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,567
You're the CEO?

104
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,400
TAKEHIKO INUKAI

105
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,867
-Let me get straight to it.
-Right.

106
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:46,934
Have a seat.

107
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,767
This man is from Gungnir.

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,266
Let's skip the pointless chitchat.

109
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm here to play you at ACMA:GAME.

110
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:08,000
I think that's what you want too,
isn't it?

111
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,667
Don't, Teruasa.

112
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,900
You don't know what he's after.

113
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,867
I've been waiting ever since that day.

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
To take revenge…

115
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,333
Dad!

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
…on the one who killed my father.

117
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I accept.

118
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,200
Let's play.

119
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,934
Then…

120
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:39,233
let the game begin.

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Not Gado?

122
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,433
Gado?

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,533
Don't tell me you'd prefer
that tacky brute of a cow?

124
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,433
Not at all!

125
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:35,767
It's just that Gado's the only devil
Terurin has met so far.

126
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,133
How pitiful, to have only met Gado.

127
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,166
I'm the game master, Korjia.

128
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,433
I take fairness very seriously.

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,867
I promise to be a dignified judge.

130
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,033
There are different types of devil?

131
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,533
Korjia's personality is totally different.
I wonder if it will affect the game…

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
The players are

133
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:05,233
Yoichi Nagakute and Teruasa Oda, correct?

134
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:06,867
Yes.

135
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,367
Although I don't mind
if all three of you come at me at once.

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,133
Yoichi Nagakute, state your demands.

137
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:21,367
I want Teruasa to swear
never to defy Gungnir,

138
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,767
and offer total obedience
from here on out.

139
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,767
Total obedience?

140
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,367
Nice one!

141
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,300
Teruasa Oda, what are your demands?

142
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,767
He will tell me everything
he knows about Gungnir.

143
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,066
One player risks
total obedience to Gungnir.

144
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,300
The other risks
all of Gungnir's information.

145
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,533
The purity of your desires is admirable.

146
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,900
Take your oaths.

147
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,467
I will fight for my desires.

148
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,367
I will triumph for my desires.

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,133
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

150
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,834
Here is the game!

151
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,000
"Hundred Contest."

152
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,767
"Hundred Contest."

153
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,333
I can't believe
the company that made OROCHI

154
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,934
is suffering from financial difficulty.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,133
We're extremely willing to work with you.

156
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,333
That's amazing.

157
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,867
Thank you!

158
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:49,667
I just have one condition.

159
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,934
I want to take over OROCHI's rights.

160
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,633
If you agree to this condition,

161
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,734
I'll make sure your company thrives.

162
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:21,800
O.B. I can't spot any abnormalities.

163
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,567
Wow, what a cutie.

164
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,300
Can you stop messing about?

165
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,700
Quit nagging.

166
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,100
Wish I was allowed to play.

167
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,300
Put it back.

168
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,200
Uh-oh.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,667
I'm really sorry.

170
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,567
It'll be hard to tell them apart
with the body totally smashed.

171
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,467
I'll make a new one.

172
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,767
Lucky for you, Kor-chin is very forgiving.

173
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,867
Gado and I are totally different.

174
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,300
You really hate him, huh?

175
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll explain the rules.

176
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,300
For each player,

177
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,166
it's a fight for 100 gold coins.

178
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,433
The number of coins to be wagered
is decided at the start of each round.

179
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,266
In this case, you would play for 30 coins.

180
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:40,867
The importance of each round
hangs on the number of coins at stake.

181
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:46,033
Next, the players choose
which piece to use.

182
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,934
In strength order, there's a king,

183
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,700
general,

184
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:54,967
knight,

185
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,467
soldier,

186
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,600
and lastly, a commoner.

187
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,867
But the king can be
defeated by the commoner.

188
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:10,233
Once a piece has been used,
it cannot be used again.

189
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,233
The player must choose his piece
and place it in the opening.

190
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:22,900
Once both have chosen,
the choices are revealed.

191
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,200
Now for the last twist.

192
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,033
When you use a level-up diamond,

193
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,567
the piece you have chosen
levels up to the next rank.

194
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,266
However, like the pieces,
diamonds can only be used once.

195
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:46,066
Then the winner is decided.

196
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:53,066
The gold coins are awarded to the winner.

197
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,667
So even if you're about to lose,

198
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,200
you can use the diamond,

199
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,433
and make it a tie.

200
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,867
What happens to the gold if it's a tie?

201
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,133
It is discarded.

202
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,567
Neither of you get the coins.

203
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:14,000
What if both players have the same
number of coins after five rounds?

204
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,533
The player who still has a diamond wins.

205
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,633
If both players have used their diamonds,
the game starts over.

206
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:25,367
What if you use the diamond on a king?

207
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,700
It becomes a level two king.

208
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,100
In that case, you must use
a diamond on the commoner

209
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,967
to beat the level two king.

210
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:36,100
Any other questions?

211
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,300
So, a fight to the bitter end.

212
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,567
Let the game Hundred Contest begin!

213
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,800
ROUND ONE
TERUASA ODA - YOICHI NAGAKUTE

214
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,767
100 COINS REMAINING

215
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,934
You will play for seven coins
in round one.

216
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:25,200
Choose your piece,
and place it in the opening.

217
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:34,800
It makes sense to use the stronger piece

218
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,667
when there are more coins at stake.

219
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,934
There are only seven coins this time.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,033
So…

221
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,233
The best strategy is to save
the commoners to beat the king,

222
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
and use the soldiers instead, right?

223
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,066
So you'd think.

224
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:55,633
You've played three games so far.

225
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:00,367
You won against small fry
Maruko and Hyodo,

226
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,233
but lost miserably to Senya Uesugi.

227
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:08,400
You're desperate to win this game.

228
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,934
But the more you focus on winning,

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,166
the more clearly I will know

230
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,900
exactly which piece
you're going to choose.

231
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:21,100
I already know something about you.

232
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,233
You…

233
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,500
have experience working
in medicine, don't you?

234
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,533
O.B. I can't spot any abnormalities.

235
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,200
O.B. is a medical term
meaning, "No pathological findings."

236
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,867
Why would someone
who wanted to preserve life

237
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:43,433
join an organization like Gungnir?

238
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,934
Aren't you going to answer?

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Just like you said.

240
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,967
There was a time

241
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:58,834
when I worked in a hospital
specializing in intensive care.

242
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,600
The reason I worked there

243
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:05,367
was because I wanted to help
bring my wife out of a coma.

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,734
But no amount of treatment
could bring her back to consciousness.

245
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,200
I was in the depths of despair.

246
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,533
Then one day,

247
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,266
I witnessed a miracle.

248
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,567
Someone visited the hospital
and cured my wife completely.

249
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,066
That person was the leader of Gungnir.

250
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,834
The Guide.

251
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,500
Guide?

252
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,166
The Guide has power
beyond human comprehension.

253
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,767
An ordinary person like you
cannot understand it.

254
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,567
If you stand in his way,

255
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,567
I will destroy you.

256
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,867
Yowza.

257
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,100
Just watching this making my heart race.

258
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,934
I'm so turned on.

259
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,400
Yuki.

260
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,834
I need to concentrate.

261
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,967
Can you shut him up for me?

262
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Okay.

263
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,033
How many times do I have to tell you?

264
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Stop messing about.

265
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,667
I'm not doing anything wrong.

266
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,467
All you do is nag, nag, nag.

267
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,266
It is time.

268
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,467
I've chosen.

269
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,834
Me too.

270
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,967
Now I will reveal both pieces.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Both of you played a soldier.

272
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,767
If you wish to use a diamond,
place it in the hole.

273
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,633
We both took the expected approach.

274
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,500
The real game starts now.

275
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,133
Now…

276
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,734
How's he gonna play it?

277
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,367
Time to find out who the winner is.

278
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,233
The strength of both pieces
is evenly matched.

279
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,333
The first round is a draw.

280
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,967
Seven coins discarded.

281
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
Nagakute didn't use the diamond either.

282
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,767
He must think the same.

283
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,100
The point of the game
is when to use the diamond.

284
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,400
ROUND TWO

285
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,133
93 COINS REMAINING

286
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,500
The first round was a tie,

287
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,033
so 93 coins remain.

288
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,133
The second round is for 42 coins.

289
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,066
Forty-two?

290
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,734
To gain the majority, I need 47 coins.

291
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:25,333
If I win, I only need five coins
in the final three rounds.

292
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:29,433
In other words,
this round is a crucial turning point.

293
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:35,000
Choose your piece
and place it in the opening.

294
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,834
I need to win this round no matter what.

295
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,700
So I should use
the strongest piece, the king.

296
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:50,900
KING

297
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,467
But if he does the same,
it'd be better to play the commoner.

298
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,900
COMMONER

299
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,734
Or if he plays the commoner,
I need to play the general.

300
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,333
GENERAL

301
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,567
Either way, there are three choices,
but definitely not the knight.

302
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,400
But between these three,
it's pretty much rock-paper-scissors.

303
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:11,734
A one in three chance of winning.
A one in three chance of losing.

304
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,033
A one in three chance of a tie.

305
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,867
Even if I lose the second round,

306
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,767
the way I lose
will change things going forward.

307
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,166
If I lose with the king,

308
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:27,633
in the third round,
I can only draw to Nagakute's general.

309
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:34,900
If I lose with the commoner,
then the best I can hope for is a tie.

310
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:40,567
But if I lose with the general,

311
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:45,333
depending on the number of coins,
and whether I can keep the king,

312
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,100
I could just about make it.

313
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,734
So basically, I shouldn't
play the king or commoner,

314
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,700
but go for the least
risky option, the general.

315
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:58,033
So I should try to tie,
by using the general,

316
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,934
and then win the game
in the following rounds.

317
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:04,967
You're considering
the risk of losing, right?

318
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Just like I told you,

319
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:14,700
I know everything you're thinking.

320
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,800
That's why I have a proposal.

321
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,633
Shall we draw in the second round too?

322
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,633
Draw on purpose?

323
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,834
We won't get anywhere
trying to read each other's minds.

324
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,900
Even so, I don't want
to lose one third of the coins.

325
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,467
So why don't we both
play our knights and draw,

326
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,834
and then decide the game
on the third round?

327
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,700
Taking your time to enjoy the process

328
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,800
is the best part of ACMA:GAME.

329
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,533
I don't need your opinion.

330
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,300
If I agree and play my knight,

331
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,333
how do I know
you won't play the general or king?

332
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,066
If you agree to my proposal,

333
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,700
I'll show you my piece
before I place it down.

334
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,033
Of course,

335
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,266
I expect you to do the same in return.

336
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,767
Now you're talking.

337
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:24,000
So, what will it be?

338
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,000
Things are heating up.

339
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,800
What's this guy's devil power?

340
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,367
Surely whatever I do, he'll win somehow.

341
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,500
But I don't know what he is capable of,

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,367
so I shouldn't do anything stupid.

343
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,066
Get the show on the road.

344
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,867
The suspense is killing me.

345
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,333
I'm falling asleep here.

346
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:09,867
Cut the crap.

347
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,066
Teruasa is fighting a serious battle.

348
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,100
Who are you again?

349
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,233
Yuki Manabe.

350
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,633
You've got a nice slap on you.

351
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,533
I like it.

352
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,500
I'm gonna call you Yukky.

353
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:36,900
-Hey--
-Such a pleasure, Yukky.

354
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,500
Get off me.

355
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,834
Sorry!

356
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:48,500
I feel bad for you.

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,700
Your friends are really dragging you down.

358
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,433
Forty-two coins is huge win.

359
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,166
The one thing I have to avoid
is losing this round.

360
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,467
Nagakute's goal
is to get me to play the knight,

361
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:07,200
and then beat me with a king or general.

362
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:11,734
If he can win with either,
there's no reason to use the king.

363
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,100
So he'll use the general.

364
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,734
I accept your proposal.

365
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,633
Then…

366
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,300
we'll put them down on three.

367
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,066
Three,

368
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,333
two,

369
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
one.

370
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,433
I have checked the pieces.

371
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:51,133
I will reveal what each player set down.

372
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,734
A knight?

373
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,934
You didn't expect me to
follow through on my promise?

374
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,367
Is he using a devil power?

375
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,066
You're busy thinking,

376
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,900
"Is that really a knight?"

377
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,767
And now you hesitate.

378
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,200
If you lose,

379
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:29,800
you'll lose a grand total of 42 coins.

380
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,600
If you wish to use a diamond,
place it in the hole.

381
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,667
What should I do?

382
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,767
He used a diamond.

383
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,200
And now for the results.

384
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,633
Based on the strength of the pieces,

385
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,233
round two is a tie.

386
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,667
Forty-two coins are void.

387
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,266
A tie?

388
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:37,033
So it wasn't just Teruasa,
but both of you used a diamond?

389
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:45,867
It's his devil power.

390
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:47,667
That's right.

391
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,967
My devil power

392
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:52,333
is called Poor Scapegoat.

393
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:56,233
Also known as a shoddy substitution.

394
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,367
I can change…

395
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,633
the appearance of an object.

396
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:10,800
Like the name implies,
it's a pretty shitty skill.

397
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,266
I don't deny it.

398
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,934
But the one you should
be laughing at is Teruasa,

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,834
who was tricked into using a diamond.

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Wait,

401
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,200
But Teruasa has stronger pieces left.

402
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,934
He can still win.

403
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:28,867
You're wrong.

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
Teruasa already knows.

405
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:36,500
His chances of winning are very slim.

406
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,500
How?

407
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,433
-The diamond.
-What?

408
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,333
He can use his diamond
to make a level two king.

409
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,767
But Terurin has used his diamond,

410
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,066
so he can't level up his commoner.

411
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,800
It's a guaranteed win for Nagakute.

412
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,734
If he takes that win on a round
with a high number of coins,

413
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,333
it's the end.

414
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,133
Did that sink in?

415
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,266
I have an impossible advantage.

416
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,533
Time for the third round.

417
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:14,900
ROUND THREE

418
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,033
Since the second round was a tie,

419
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,734
there are 51 gold coins left.

420
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,333
Three rounds to go.

421
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:29,567
It could be three lots of 17,
or something like that.

422
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,333
Then he still stands a chance.

423
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:37,834
But if the number is 26 or more…

424
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:46,233
Thirty gold coins
are up for grabs in round three.

425
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,133
At the end of this round,

426
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
there will be 21 gold coins remaining.

427
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,967
Whatever happens cannot be reversed.

428
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:59,667
Victory will be decided.

429
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,000
It's over.

430
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,133
Teruasa Oda.

431
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,200
I must admit,

432
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:22,333
I am not as forgiving
as you and Senya Uesugi.

433
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,700
You will serve as Gungnir's slave…

434
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,200
until the day you die.

435
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,400
Teruasa…

436
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:41,133
Choose your piece
and place it in the opening.

437
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,600
He's already used his diamond.

438
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:49,133
If I choose the king

439
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,233
and use my diamond, victory is certain.

440
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,567
I will reveal both pieces.

441
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,333
A commoner?

442
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,500
That doesn't make sense.

443
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:15,500
If you wish to use a diamond,
place it in the hole.

444
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,500
I've won.

445
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,500
My Guide,

446
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,367
I dedicate this victory

447
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,567
to you.

448
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,400
Yoichi Nagakute.

449
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Checkmate.

450
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,633
Victory is decided.

451
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,200
The pieces are a level two king,

452
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,166
and a level two commoner.

453
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,400
The commoner wins the gold coins.

454
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,233
Therefore, Teruasa Oda is the winner.

455
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,433
You did it!

456
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,333
Nonsense.

457
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
There must be a mistake!

458
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,633
You used a diamond in the second round.

459
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,867
I didn't use it then.

460
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,600
When I was listening
to the rules of the game,

461
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:41,533
I realized that the whole game
hung on a diamond.

462
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,567
So…

463
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,700
I need to concentrate.

464
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,834
Can you shut him up for me?

465
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Okay.

466
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:54,467
In the first round, I put a Mog chocolate
wrapper in the hole,

467
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,834
to check that Korjia
wouldn't challenge my method.

468
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,066
In the second round, I used the cap
of the lip balm I got from Senya.

469
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:06,433
To make you think I had used the diamond.

470
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
That's a lie.

471
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,133
If you did, then in the second round,

472
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:15,867
my general would have beaten your knight!

473
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,700
Just like you,

474
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,500
my knight was really a general.

475
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,934
But in my case,

476
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:33,400
I used brute force.

477
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,333
I was in front of you the whole time!

478
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,834
There's no way I would have missed
something so obvious.

479
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
That's why…

480
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,500
I let you have it your way.

481
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:54,333
Although I don't mind
if all three of you come at me at once.

482
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,734
I need to concentrate on the game.

483
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,633
GIVE THIS PIECE TO SENYA

484
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Can you shut him up for me?

485
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,200
Okay.

486
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,900
How many times do I have to tell you?

487
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,800
Stop messing about.

488
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,100
What's wrong?

489
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,734
All you do is nag, nag, nag.

490
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:21,900
I trusted Senya to understand
what I wanted him to do.

491
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,400
You've got a nice slap on you.

492
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,300
I like it.

493
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,266
I'm gonna call you Yukky.

494
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,367
-Hey--
-Such a pleasure, Yukky.

495
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:33,767
-Get off me.
-And so,

496
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,867
he gave the two altered pieces…

497
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,934
-Sorry!
-…back to Yuki.

498
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,700
Just like you wanted, right?

499
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,200
But I gotta say, I didn't expect a slap.

500
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,033
Right, sorry!

501
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Although,
you were winding me up pretty bad.

502
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,600
Who the hell does he think he is?

503
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,900
That was a risky gamble.

504
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:00,233
Messing with something
prepared by the devil…

505
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,467
They could have ended up unrecognizable.

506
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:06,900
I don't think so.

507
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,567
When that happened before…

508
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,200
It'll be hard to tell them apart
with the body totally smashed.

509
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:15,300
I'll make a new one.

510
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,233
These pieces…

511
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,533
look identical except from the crown.

512
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,867
Most people would
identify the piece by the crown.

513
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:26,934
But,

514
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,734
Korjia specifically mentioned the body.

515
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,633
That's when I thought.

516
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,200
Korjia didn't tell them apart
by the crown,

517
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:39,033
but by something inside its body.

518
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,800
If so,

519
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:44,000
it wouldn't make a difference
if I switched the crowns.

520
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:05,667
Nagakute,

521
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,533
you lose.

522
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,700
A fascinating battle.

523
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:18,066
The game Hundred Contest is complete.

524
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:43,533
Will you share
everything you know about Gungnir?

525
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,967
What's happened?

526
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,066
A debt to be paid.

527
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,767
Who are you?

528
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,133
What do you mean?

529
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,400
This place…

530
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,066
Seems his memory was tampered with

531
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,300
by his defeat in ACMA:GAME.

532
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,467
That's not all.

533
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,000
If he loses again,

534
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:37,100
he has been carefully conditioned
to lose his memory completely.

535
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,900
So what about the info on Gungnir?

536
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't ask me.

537
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,567
Guess we're back to square one.

538
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,166
Wait.

539
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
My wife.

540
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:56,166
My wife, where is she?

541
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,066
My wife had six months to live.

542
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,133
I have to watch her.

543
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,300
If I'm not by her side, she'll die.

544
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,433
My wife…

545
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:23,633
I…

546
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,367
Why am I alive?

547
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:46,767
I see.

548
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,300
I got confirmation.

549
00:37:58,367 --> 00:37:59,533
CHAIRMAN ODA INCIDENT

550
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,700
Yoichi Nagakute's wife
died seven years ago.

551
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,266
How awful.

552
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,100
How is Nagakute?

553
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,467
His mental health deteriorated suddenly,

554
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:18,333
and a hospital I know took him in.

555
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,166
Recently,

556
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,767
I've been thinking a lot
about what my dad said.

557
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,233
The flames of desire ignite conflict.

558
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,533
Try to become someone who can save those

559
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,433
who become consumed by desire.

560
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Those who are taken by desire,

561
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:43,166
and consumed by it,

562
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,367
are those in misery.

563
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,333
If I'm going to save those people,

564
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,433
I need to fight Gungnir.

565
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,800
Thank you.

566
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,400
Yuki.

567
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,467
Yes?

568
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,600
Can I speak to you?

569
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,533
What?

570
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,066
I…

571
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,000
Well…

572
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,934
Remind me,
how long have we been working together?

573
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:37,400
What's wrong with you?

574
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,033
You sound like an old man.

575
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,433
I've always been grateful to you.

576
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:47,834
I don't even pay you that much.

577
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,033
I'm sure you could work somewhere
with better conditions.

578
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,567
Can I tell you what your problem is?

579
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,467
What?

580
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,867
You jump to conclusions
by spending too much time thinking alone.

581
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,567
Isn't it exhausting?

582
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:16,667
Contrary to what you might think,

583
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,266
I've always been simple and self-centered.

584
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,600
I like it here.

585
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:27,700
That's why I work here.

586
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
If I get to keep working
with you and OROCHI,

587
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,400
then I'll be okay.

588
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,467
Especially if Teruasa
comes over from time to time.

589
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,500
Don't invite Senya Uesugi though.

590
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,500
Sure.

591
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:48,967
I see.

592
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,166
I'm sorry,

593
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,767
I'm afraid that

594
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,133
I have to refuse your offer.

595
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,700
My colleagues and I will work hard

596
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,934
to ensure our company's survival alone.

597
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:09,967
I understand. But take a look at this.

598
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,934
SECURITIES DISHONOR NOTICE

599
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,300
When investors and banks see this notice,

600
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,367
they won't want
to invest in U.U. Engineering.

601
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,967
If that happens, you'll go bankrupt.

602
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:27,800
AI OROCHI will be seized by Mitsuba bank,

603
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:31,266
and I will buy it out, as arranged.

604
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:34,934
You tricked me?

605
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,533
Your developer is amazing
and so is OROCHI.

606
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
However,

607
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,100
you are out of your depth.

608
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:47,600
They'd be better off
without you in the picture.

609
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:05,867
Yoo-hoo, Terurin!

610
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,200
Hey,

611
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:09,567
Yukarin's going to be in a drama.

612
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,900
She got lucky with the devil's key.

613
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:13,967
You seem pleased.

614
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,166
I like girls who are honest
about what they want.

615
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:20,333
What do you want?

616
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:22,633
You didn't come here for small talk.

617
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,100
I want your opinion.

618
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,834
My opinion?

619
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,500
You got it.

620
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,500
INVITATION - TERUASA ODA

621
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:55,100
YOU ARE INVITED TO AN
ACMA:GAME TOURNAMENT

622
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,700
IF YOU WIN
YOU WILL RECEIVE A DEVIL'S KEY

623
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,500
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ATTEND?

624
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,166
Well, what you gonna do?

625
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
This is a trap set by Gungnir.

626
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,800
It's too dangerous.

627
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:10,533
Don't say things you don't mean.

628
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,166
I had already made up my mind.

629
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:17,967
Whatever danger awaits,

630
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:22,000
I will crush Gungnir's ambitions.

631
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,033
Hey.

632
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,734
Hey, wait.

633
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:51,100
Compared to Teruasa,

634
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,333
I'm…

635
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,567
Drink this.

636
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,133
NEXT EPISODE

637
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,734
The ultimate ACMA:GAME begins.

638
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,867
I already have you in my trap.

639
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:47,367
The ability of the real devil.

640
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:48,400
BEST FRIENDS
BECOME WORST ENEMIES

641
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:49,300
Why?

642
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:52,300
I've always wanted to fight you.
