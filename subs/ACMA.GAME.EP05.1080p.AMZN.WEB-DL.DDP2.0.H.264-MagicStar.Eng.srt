1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,233
INVITATION - TERUASA ODA

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,333
Whatever danger awaits,
I will crush Gungnir's ambitions.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,934
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ATTEND? - YES

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
Yoo-hoo, Terurin.

5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,266
Senya.

6
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,333
You gotta be kidding me!

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,967
There's really no signal out here?

8
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,467
What a joke!

9
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,233
Is that Mori, the shogi Dragon King?

10
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,767
What have we here?

11
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,133
We gotta fight someone like him?

12
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:33,800
Shit, this is gonna be intense.

13
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,633
Welcome, my friends.

14
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,734
I'm the organizer of this tournament.

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
My name is Inoru Hoshin.

16
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,166
Hoshin!

17
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,233
No need to get carried away.

18
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,233
Our time will come.

19
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,834
But I wonder if you'll get that far.

20
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,600
You're up against some fierce opponents.

21
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:20,734
Here he is. Someone very important.

22
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:24,967
No…

23
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,000
Why're you here?

24
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,667
Now for the real fight.

25
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:47,734
The ultimate ACMA:GAME begins.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
as chosen by the devil,

27
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,867
each of you holds a key.

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,367
Here, and all over the world,

29
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,967
tournament trials are underway.

30
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:21,400
The total number of keys distributed
among the players is 49.

31
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,400
In other words,

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,967
the winner has the chance
to take all 49 keys.

33
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,333
Forty-nine?

34
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,333
There may also be
some additional rewards for the winner.

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,967
Why are you doing this?

36
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,934
You'll understand sooner or later.

37
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
But for now,

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,700
who wants to get their hands on
all 49 keys?

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
I do.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Me too.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,800
I have an endless list of desires
I want to fulfill.

42
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,834
Too bad.
I'm gonna take the keys for myself.

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,433
And you, Teruasa Oda?

44
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,600
Suit yourself.

45
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,200
Either way, now that you're here,

46
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:22,000
there's no turning back.

47
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:28,767
Let me explain the principles of the game.

48
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:32,467
The rules are extremely simple.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,033
The loser's life will fall into
the hands of the winner.

50
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,900
Give up our lives?

51
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,633
The loser's life belongs to the winner
for all eternity.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,066
Toying with your life until death,
choosing to kill you at any moment.

53
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,800
The loser can never defy the winner.

54
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,667
But you'll have no idea

55
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,900
what demands get made
during the games, will you?

56
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,467
If you disobey the rules,
there will be no additional reward.

57
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:02,867
What do you want from us?

58
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,767
We aren't your playthings.

59
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,533
Don't you ever shut up?

60
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,667
I'm trying to listen to him.

61
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,233
First, we need to decide on pairs
for the first round of the tournament.

62
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,433
Please choose one card.

63
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,700
The person with the same mark
will be your first opponent.

64
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,467
I'm first!

65
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,033
Yoink!

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,467
It's me, the idol Yukari Shikibe.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,333
I'm so happy to see you again.

68
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,500
Nice to meet you.

69
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:56,233
I'm a psychologist. Shunichiro Date.

70
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:01,834
Hi! I'm the famous YouTuber, Mitsuru Asai!

71
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,433
I'm sure you've heard of me.

72
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,300
Am I left all alone?

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,500
Wait! This sucks.

74
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:13,567
Senya Uesugi,
your opponent will be revealed later.

75
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,533
Keeping me guessing? I like your style.

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,500
First up, we have
Teruasa Oda vs. Yukari Shikibe.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,533
And Ui Saito vs. Shunichiro Date.

78
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,066
The first round starts in one hour.

79
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,000
Will they really hand over their lives?

80
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,533
Mark my words.

81
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:41,400
Humans are just creatures
pulled by the strings of desire.

82
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,734
Ui.

83
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,467
What the hell happened?

84
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,467
I never wanted you two wrapped up in this.

85
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,033
I've changed.

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,166
My luck is going up.

87
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,033
TAKEHIKO INUKAI ARRESTED
FOR FRAUDULENT STOCK TRADE

88
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,734
This guy was trying to buy us out too.

89
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,667
What? Really?

90
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,867
We're lucky he was arrested.

91
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,433
Guess our luck is going up, huh?

92
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,700
Did you pick up a devil's key somewhere?

93
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,033
Stop it. You're scaring me.

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,700
It was just an AI joke!

95
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,500
Your mom's been
teaching me all about jokes!

96
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,300
Hello, this is U.U. Engineering.

97
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,700
Really? Our loan was approved?

98
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,333
Thank you very much.

99
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,734
That's not all.

100
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,400
After I got the key,
my true feelings were finally clear.

101
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,500
Your true feelings?

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,467
Deep down,
I've always wished I could fight you.

103
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,266
What is it, Teruasa?

104
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,266
You think I can't make it
through the tournament?

105
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,400
-Ui--
-I'll make sure I win.

106
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,667
Then I'll take you on next.

107
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:58,834
Now leave me alone.

108
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:15,600
The first round is about to begin.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Players are asked…

110
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,834
Terurin!

111
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,400
…to move to the game room.

112
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,700
If you lose before you get to me,

113
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,567
I'll never forgive you.

114
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,600
Well, go get 'em.

115
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:36,533
I'm gonna get in the zone
by checking out the area.

116
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,400
ARENA ONE

117
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm going to fight with all I've got.

118
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,667
ARENA TWO

119
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,600
Let the ACMA:GAME tournament

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,433
commence.

121
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,667
So, we meet again,

122
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,734
Teruasa Oda, Yukari Shikibe.

123
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,967
Gado! You're in a good mood.

124
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:12,066
That's because you humans invent
such cruel yet delightful games.

125
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,633
An ACMA:GAME tournament.

126
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,567
Let's get started straightaway.

127
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,266
I have a question first.

128
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,967
A question?

129
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,266
Ui found a devil's key.

130
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,967
Who dropped it?

131
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,266
I'll explain.

132
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,667
The one who let a devil's key
fall at Ui Saito's feet

133
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,533
was me.

134
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,166
Why would you do that?

135
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,133
Watching humans suffer
at the mercy of their desires

136
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,266
is a devil's greatest pleasure.

137
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,300
Are you devils

138
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,900
being manipulated by Gungnir?

139
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Time to start the game.

140
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,400
What do you want to bet?

141
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,700
The loser will give his life

142
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,066
to the winner.

143
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,166
Same here.

144
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,867
I'm gonna be on the edge
of my seat to the very end.

145
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,100
Now take your oaths.

146
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,200
I will fight for my desires.

147
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,800
I will triumph for my desires.

148
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,533
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

149
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,066
Oaths accepted.

150
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:38,600
Let the game begin!

151
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,600
"Hide &amp; See."

152
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,900
"Hide &amp; See."

153
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,633
Now for the rules.

154
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,266
One player is a Hider
and the other is a Seer.

155
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,467
The Seer must sit in the chair on stage.

156
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:02,934
The Seer cannot leave the seat
until he or she gives an answer.

157
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,467
The Hider takes this coin

158
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,033
and hides it somewhere
in the designated arena.

159
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:13,033
Once hidden, the Hider says, "I'm ready."

160
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,800
Basically, the Seer has to find where
the Hider has hidden the coin?

161
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,100
Exactly.

162
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,033
However, you don't need to give
specific details as to where the coin is.

163
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,633
The Seer must simply declare
which of the six tables

164
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,367
is closest to the hidden coin.

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,867
1 TABLE - 100 POINTS
2 TABLES - 50 POINTS

166
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:37,934
3 TABLES - 30 POINTS

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,467
You may choose several tables if you wish.

168
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,500
4 TABLES - 20 POINTS
5 TABLES - 10 POINTS

169
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:47,333
Naturally, the fewer tables you choose,
the higher the score for a correct answer.

170
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,266
You switch roles each turn,
with three sets in total.

171
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,867
What happens if the coin changes position

172
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,000
while the Seer is wondering
which table to choose?

173
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,400
What if it falls, or rolls somewhere else
after you've hidden it?

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
The coin location is decided

175
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:12,967
once the Hider says, "I'm ready."

176
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,734
It makes no difference
if it moves after that.

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Got it.

178
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,700
Yukari Shikibe used her devil's key,

179
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,734
which means she gets a devil power.

180
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,567
We'll toss a coin.

181
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,867
What will it be? Heads or tails?

182
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,166
-Heads.
-Tails.

183
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,900
Teruasa Oda,
which role do you choose first?

184
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,400
I'll be the Seer.

185
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:47,467
I bet she wanted Seer first too.

186
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,300
Now I can see what the arena looks like
from the stage, and check for blind spots.

187
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:56,000
With that, Hide &amp; See begins!

188
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,867
Crap, no signal.

189
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,867
Come on.

190
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,600
Come on, signal.

191
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,467
I'm waiting.

192
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,767
Shit.

193
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,367
Who are you again?

194
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:23,100
Famous YouTuber Asai!

195
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,900
We literally just met!

196
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey!

197
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
SET ONE - HEADS

198
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,200
The first Hider is Yukari Shikibe.

199
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,000
Hide the coin.

200
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,166
There are more blind spots than I thought.

201
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,600
I need to keep my eyes peeled
for any unnatural movements.

202
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,667
Is she trying to make it look
like she's hidden it at every table?

203
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,100
That's a solid approach.

204
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm going to have to rely on a luck alone.

205
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
If I choose five tables,

206
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,834
there's still a one-in-six,
17% chance I'll be wrong.

207
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,300
Even if I win, I'll only get ten points.

208
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,867
I'm ready.

209
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,767
Teruasa Oda, as the Seer,

210
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:45,233
you must choose the closest table
to the hidden coin.

211
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,500
Since she didn't go near table six,

212
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,667
it makes sense to choose
from tables one to five.

213
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:57,133
But why didn't she go near table six?

214
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,500
That's the only strange thing she did.

215
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,533
Wait…

216
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:06,433
There it is.

217
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,600
An unnatural movement.

218
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,033
Can you get on with it?

219
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,667
How much time do you need to think?

220
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,533
Sorry.

221
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,333
But I wasn't thinking.

222
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,800
I was observing.

223
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,066
Come again?

224
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,567
Yukari Shikibe,

225
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:55,300
while you were waiting,
I was watching for unnatural movements.

226
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,166
You didn't notice me looking.

227
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:04,100
Your gaze shifted in many directions.

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,100
But you didn't look at table six once.

229
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,800
Humans tend to subconsciously avert
their gaze from something they're hiding.

230
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,800
In other words, table six,
the one you wouldn't look at,

231
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,100
is exactly where I should look.

232
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,734
Stop blurting random crap.

233
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,867
I didn't even go near table six.

234
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,033
How could I have put the coin there?

235
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,834
What if you rolled it
from behind table five?

236
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,934
There's a blind spot,
so I wouldn't have seen you do it.

237
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,734
Teruasa Oda, what is your answer?

238
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,033
I choose table six.

239
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,200
Table six.

240
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,333
Incorrect.

241
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,333
The correct answer is table four.

242
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:11,967
I knew you were "observing" me
from the very start.

243
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,834
When people are watching,

244
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,233
I never stop
paying attention to how I look.

245
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,700
That's idol life.

246
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,000
There's seriously no signal at all.

247
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,934
Not a soul in sight either.

248
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,100
Gives me the creeps.

249
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,800
The creeps?

250
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,300
Mog chocolate? Gimme.

251
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,533
Hands off. My friend gave this to me.

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,967
-So what?
-Hey.

253
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't hog it all.

254
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,867
Okay, fine! Sorry.

255
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,033
SET ONE - TAILS

256
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,133
Next, the Hider is Teruasa Oda.

257
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,867
Hide the coin.

258
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:26,667
Why's he checking
the curtains and pillars?

259
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,100
Is he going to hide it there?

260
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
What now?

261
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,667
What's he up to?

262
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,567
He still hasn't hidden it?

263
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,967
I'm ready.

264
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,066
That's gotta be table four, right?

265
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:45,233
Gado, are the table numbers
fixed at the start?

266
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:49,233
Or do they change
if you move the number plates?

267
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,800
The current number plates are valid.

268
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,266
What a shame.

269
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,300
Your plan wasn't just to move the tables.

270
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,734
You wanted to switch the number plates,

271
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,734
to make table five
appear to be table four.

272
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,500
But you heard him.
I can use the current number plates.

273
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
That was a little clumsy.

274
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,300
I choose table four.

275
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,934
Table four.

276
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,033
Incorrect.

277
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,500
The correct answer is table one.

278
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,000
Are you kidding me?

279
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,033
It's right here!

280
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:36,734
It's…

281
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
a fake?

282
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,033
Was this your plan from the beginning?

283
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,100
You misled me into thinking
I'd discovered your number plate plan.

284
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,367
You tricked me?

285
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:59,867
He's good at this after all.

286
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,767
I'm starving.

287
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,934
This is exhausting.

288
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,066
Can we go now?

289
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,734
A radio tower?

290
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,333
What? You mean there's signal?

291
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:16,266
What's that?

292
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,900
What the hell?

293
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,934
Shit.

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,467
Shit, shit, shit!

295
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,066
It's coming!

296
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,100
What the heck was that?

297
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,266
A self-destructing drone.

298
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,667
Looks like we were the targets.

299
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
You can't be serious.

300
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,700
Those guys aren't messing around.

301
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,000
They really want us dead.

302
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:23,133
Neither of you scored points,
so the first set is a tie.

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,567
Fingers crossed for more treachery
in the second set.

304
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,667
You're very good at this.

305
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:39,800
But there's someone
I'm even more scared of playing.

306
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,367
The psychologist Shunichiro Date.

307
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,233
The first set's score is 20-0.

308
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:52,266
Shunichiro Date wins.

309
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,533
He can read people completely.

310
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,667
No one can beat him.

311
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,166
That's just the beginning.

312
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,400
He is cruel.

313
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,900
To him, people are just research subjects.

314
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,467
If you put your life in his hands,
who knows what horrible things he'll do.

315
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,200
You must be worried.

316
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:22,333
His opponent is a dear friend of yours.

317
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,934
I wonder how he must be suffering.

318
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,400
Is it painful to imagine?

319
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,834
But wait.

320
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,600
Didn't you guys have an argument?

321
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,266
Perhaps it's kinda convenient then!

322
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,066
You're a malicious creature.

323
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,066
My favorite.

324
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,033
SET TWO - HEADS

325
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,633
The Hider is Yukari Shikibe.

326
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,800
Hide the coin.

327
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,867
I'm ready.

328
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:42,667
Well, Teruasa Oda,

329
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:44,934
which table do you choose?

330
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,367
What was she doing?

331
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,033
She didn't go near
tables one, two or three.

332
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,500
Then at first glance,

333
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,800
if I guess tables four, five and six,
I'll win thirty points.

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,133
But is that really it?

335
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,600
Why would she risk
not going near three tables?

336
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,300
Perhaps…

337
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,567
I used a devil power?

338
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,333
That's what you're thinking.

339
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,500
I'm sorry if my words upset you earlier.

340
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,100
I'll give you a hint to make up for it.

341
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,533
My devil power is called

342
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,767
Double Invisible.

343
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,367
Invisible?

344
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,133
Transparency?

345
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,633
She can create
a double of herself that I can't see?

346
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,567
Was she moving weirdly

347
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:55,767
because she was controlling her double?

348
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,967
Was that why her gaze was out of focus

349
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,000
when she fell down?

350
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,800
Then where did
her real self hide the coin?

351
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,200
Table one, two, or three?

352
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,033
But the whole thing could be an act.

353
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,066
Which is it?

354
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,967
Teruasa Oda,

355
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,000
make your choice.

356
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,834
I choose tables one, two and three.

357
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,266
Incorrect.

358
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,233
The correct answer is table four.

359
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,533
This time you put on an act,
only pretending to use your devil power.

360
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:54,200
I love people like you
who are easy to trick.

361
00:27:57,033 --> 00:28:00,100
Idols trick their fans for a living.

362
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:06,300
Well, well. Let's continue the game.

363
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,500
SET TWO - TAILS

364
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,467
At this rate, she's going to win.

365
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,667
I need to take back control.

366
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,300
Awaken the devil power.

367
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,033
LIMITED PERFECT

368
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,767
I'm ready.

369
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,567
Shit, I missed it.

370
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,867
Yukari Shikibe, you are the Seer.

371
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,867
Choose your table.

372
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,900
I can't panic now.

373
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,767
That's exactly what he wants.

374
00:28:57,367 --> 00:29:00,533
It's fine. I can do this.

375
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:06,467
As it stands, my best bet is to
choose four tables and secure 20 points.

376
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:11,066
Then he'll be under pressure
in the third set.

377
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,033
The problem is which tables to choose.

378
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,734
I have a devil's key,

379
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,834
so I should be lucky…

380
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,166
Three.

381
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,667
Four.

382
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:42,400
One.

383
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,333
Five.

384
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,800
Yukari Shikibe, time to answer.

385
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,266
I choose table one, three, four and five.

386
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,066
Correct.

387
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,000
Yukari Shikibe,

388
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,867
since you chose four tables,
you gain 20 points.

389
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,967
At the end of the second set,

390
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:17,800
Yukari Shikibe is in the lead at 20-0.

391
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,934
You are totally cornered,

392
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,266
Teruasa Oda.

393
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,900
At the end of the second set,
the score is 30-30.

394
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,834
A tie.

395
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,767
He's more clever and decisive
than expected.

396
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:55,834
Above all, his unwavering
determination to win is formidable.

397
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,367
I wonder…

398
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:02,000
What kind of experiment
shall I use him for?

399
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:11,133
Then now it is time
for the third and final set.

400
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,900
Teruasa Oda, your turn to get on stage.

401
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,133
Yukari Shikibe,

402
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,633
I've figured you out.

403
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,700
It's my turn to win.

404
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,433
The third set of Hide &amp; See begins.

405
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,900
SET THREE - HEADS

406
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,567
Why would Teruasa Oda say that?

407
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,700
Was he just lashing out
because I'm winning?

408
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,400
Why's he not watching?

409
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,734
He should have his eyes glued to me
at a time like this.

410
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
What's wrong?

411
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,066
Haven't you hidden it yet?

412
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,400
How did he know I haven't hidden it yet?

413
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,400
I can't miss a thing.

414
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,066
I have to beat him.

415
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:22,066
I've got to.

416
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:25,667
His phone?

417
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,300
There's no signal here.

418
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,367
What's he looking at?

419
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,667
No way. There's a camera.

420
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:44,600
Was he trying to connect to the camera
when he was touching the curtain?

421
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,533
Is he really capable of that?

422
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:54,233
I wouldn't put it past him
after he used that phony coin.

423
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,266
What do I do?

424
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:05,200
Find a blind spot
that's also hidden from the camera?

425
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,166
No.

426
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:14,667
Instead, I'll use it against you.

427
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,133
I'm ready.

428
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,834
The Seer is Teruasa Oda.

429
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,533
Choose your table.

430
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,333
Teruasa Oda,

431
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,633
I already have you in my trap.

432
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,700
If you're not monitoring the camera,

433
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:40,000
you need to choose
between tables one to six

434
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,166
purely on the basis of luck.

435
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,767
And if you are monitoring the camera,

436
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,300
you'd have seen me
hiding the coin at table four.

437
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:55,667
But what you don't know is that
it's the fake coin you used earlier.

438
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:01,266
Either way, you can't win.

439
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,567
Teruasa Oda, time for your answer.

440
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,800
I choose table five.

441
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,333
Correct.

442
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,400
Shit.

443
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:20,133
I noticed you holding the fake coin.

444
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:26,133
So I misled you into using it.

445
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,500
I knew it.

446
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,567
I knew you'd be sharp enough

447
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,233
to suspect I was watching the camera,

448
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,734
and then use it to your advantage.

449
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,166
I'm not a bad actor either.

450
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,333
Teruasa Oda,

451
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,200
since you chose one table,
you win 100 points.

452
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,400
It's not over yet.

453
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,333
I still get one turn to be Seer.

454
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,667
The last turn.

455
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,400
Keep up the entertaining work.

456
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,767
I'm gambling everything on this game.

457
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,467
I need to concentrate, so keep quiet.

458
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,033
Especially you and your loud voice.

459
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,033
It hurts my ears.

460
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,633
Hurts your ears?

461
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,767
I really wanna win this.

462
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,233
So don't distract me.

463
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:31,700
Only because the game is heating up,

464
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,133
you can have it your way.

465
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:46,667
Please, let me win.

466
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:52,300
Praying to the devil
in times of distress, huh?

467
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,233
Begin!

468
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,667
SET THREE - TAILS

469
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:42,000
He's doing the same thing at each table.

470
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,834
The best way to make it difficult.

471
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm ready.

472
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,533
Now Yukari Shikibe, as the Seer,

473
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,200
choose your table.

474
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,500
But I'm going to win this.

475
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,633
Just watch me take 100 points.

476
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,266
She's taking longer than usual.

477
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:29,567
This is the last chance.

478
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,800
It makes sense to be extra careful.

479
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:33,367
But…

480
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,200
her expression.

481
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:40,734
What does it mean?

482
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,400
She's waiting for something,
quietly confident.

483
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,667
Is she acting again?

484
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:52,333
No. There's no point acting
when she's the one searching for the coin.

485
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,800
What's she waiting for?

486
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,400
Could this be

487
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,667
her real devil power?

488
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,667
Then where is her real body?

489
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,533
I need to concentrate, so keep quiet.

490
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,967
Especially you and your loud voice.

491
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,633
It hurts my ears.

492
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
That's it.

493
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,500
All Timer?

494
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,567
That's right.

495
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,800
Focus your attention
on an object of your choice,

496
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:38,033
and it will make a noise for 30 seconds.

497
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,900
That's my devil power?

498
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:46,500
But it won't kick in until ten minutes
after the power is unleashed.

499
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:50,000
Isn't it just perfect for this game?

500
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:51,934
Ten minutes?

501
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,867
Please, let me win.

502
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,166
ALL TIMER

503
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,867
Now I can't hear the timer.

504
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,133
Where is it?

505
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,333
Just as I thought, a power
that uses sound to reveal location.

506
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,767
I've always been alone.

507
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,767
Abandoned at an orphanage
as soon as I was born.

508
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,734
I've lived my whole life
without letting anyone in.

509
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,800
But I've always wanted to be seen.

510
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,533
YOU BECAME AN IDOL
AND EVERYONE LOVES YOU

511
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,233
That's why I wanted to be an idol.

512
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:02,367
I dreamt of being loved
all over the world.

513
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:16,467
Yukari Shikibe, what is your answer?

514
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,433
My choice is…

515
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,166
table one.

516
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,867
Incorrect.

517
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:34,100
The correct answer was table six.

518
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,667
The final score is 100-20.

519
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:41,333
The winner of Hide &amp; See is Teruasa Oda!

520
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,367
Teruasa Oda,

521
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:49,333
from now on,
Yukari Shikibe's life is yours.

522
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:56,767
I look forward to seeing
what you do with her life.

523
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:08,533
Why?

524
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:13,834
Why did I have to lose?

525
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,967
The flames of desire ignite conflict.

526
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:21,467
Try to become someone who can save those

527
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,600
who become consumed by desire.

528
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:27,867
Yukari Shikibe,

529
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:30,700
you're a tough player.

530
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:38,400
You should have trusted your own strength
instead of relying on luck.

531
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,633
The power to win was already in you.

532
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,133
Teruasa Oda…

533
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,667
I hate your guts.

534
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:33,000
Now for the results of Hide &amp; See.

535
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,133
The final score is 80-50.

536
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,767
Ui Saito wins!

537
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,433
It's an honor to entrust my life

538
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,867
to someone of such caliber.

539
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:08,367
Teruasa Oda managed to win.

540
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,033
He's very strong-willed.

541
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,834
I see why The Guide had high expectations.

542
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,100
But,

543
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,600
let's see what happens
in the second round.

544
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Ui!

545
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,400
Who won?

546
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,767
You're my next opponent.

547
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:48,934
The next game
will be a tough one for Teruasa Oda.

548
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,700
Is it time yet?

549
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:28,567
I can't wait for a fight.
The anticipation is killing me!

550
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,700
What happened? You guys look miserable.

551
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,333
What a roller coaster that was yesterday.

552
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,033
Today, another game begins.

553
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:45,800
The genius shogi player, Akira Mori,

554
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:49,667
will face famous YouTuber Mitsuru Asai
in a special show down.

555
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,600
I have high expectations.

556
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,667
Hey, who am I playing?

557
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,900
I'm sick of waiting.

558
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:58,400
Yes, yes.

559
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,500
You opponent has just arrived.

560
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,567
For real?

561
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,066
Yuki?

562
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:25,734
Senya Uesugi's opponent is Yuki Manabe.

563
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:29,033
Show us a good game, okay?

564
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,066
NEXT EPISODE

565
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,533
What do you want us for?

566
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,200
"Gold Gun &amp; Silver Gun."

567
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,767
The person who shoots first
wins the money.

568
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:44,166
To shoot or not to shoot.

569
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:45,066
YUKI VS SENYA

570
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:48,667
There's only one thing she can do.
Win the game.

571
00:45:48,734 --> 00:45:50,000
Jump!
