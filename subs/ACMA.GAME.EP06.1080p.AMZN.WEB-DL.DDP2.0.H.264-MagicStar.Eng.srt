1
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:07,266
A mysterious key that stirs human desire.

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,533
It summons the devil
and starts a game of death.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,100
A devil's key.

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,300
When I returned home
to find out who killed my father,

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:19,333
-the organization Gungnir was waiting.
-The ultimate ACMA:GAME begins.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,100
A tournament is being held
on a deserted island

7
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,133
to collect all 99 keys in the world.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,033
The last participant to arrive

9
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,834
was my best friend, Yuki.

10
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,066
Yuki,

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,166
where did you get that key?

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
A little present from me.

13
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,000
Yuki Manabe

14
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:49,734
developed OROCHI,
the future of AI technology.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,266
She is naturally gifted.

16
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,633
Why are you here?

17
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,834
Everybody has something they want.

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,166
She may appear gentle,

19
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:03,200
but her heart is stained with greed,

20
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,433
just like the rest of you.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,333
You sound like a sore loser.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
You only cling on to your Dragon King
title because you have a key.

23
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,300
No way, is that true?

24
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:18,433
Anyway, how does she know Teruasa?

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,066
Silence!

26
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,533
I've got something fun to show you.

27
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,867
There were some unexpected casualties

28
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:28,433
after an attempted escape
from one of the foreign game arenas.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,066
This recording is from 30 minutes ago.

30
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,266
What happened to them?

31
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,867
That drone! That drone
must have killed them!

32
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:48,467
What drone?

33
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,767
Nothing…

34
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,367
Yes?

35
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,200
Nothing.

36
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:05,166
You can only tell if you go outside,
but this island is under surveillance.

37
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,767
Island?

38
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,066
We're on an island?

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,433
From what I saw yesterday,
it's about 20 km all the way around.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,633
No supermarkets, convenience stores
or traffic lights.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,934
An uninhabited island.

42
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,166
And the drone?

43
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,734
A drone with a bomb attached.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,300
I wonder what it was intended for?

45
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,567
Better not to think about it too much.

46
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,533
Just concentrate on the game.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,166
If you win the game and collect more keys,

48
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,133
you can have whatever you want.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,934
Every last one of you needs those keys,
or am I mistaken?

50
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,433
Is it fun? Playing with our minds?
Making us fight?

51
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,567
What do you want us for?

52
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,300
Can you stop getting in his way?

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,767
I just want to focus on the game.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
-This man is a murderer.
-Even if he's a dictator,

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
it makes no difference to me.

56
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,867
I'm glad you understand.

57
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:12,333
Call me a dictator if you like,

58
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:18,200
but small sacrifices have to be made
for the greater good.

59
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,867
I don't know what
greater good you're after,

60
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,700
but are you referring to my father?

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,867
Are you calling my father's life
a small sacrifice?

62
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:29,967
Don't move!

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,033
Toba?

64
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:38,066
The second match of the first round
starts in one hour.

65
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,133
Then see you later.

66
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,667
See you in the next game, huh?

67
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:57,934
Yukky.

68
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,800
Yuki, why are you doing this?

69
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,333
I had no choice.

70
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,633
Yuki.

71
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,166
They took your mother and brother hostage?

72
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,767
If I lose the game,

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,800
they're going to kill my mom and brother.

74
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,166
Ui.

75
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,300
Where are you going?

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,333
Don't you care about Yuki?

77
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,600
There's only one thing she can do.

78
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,700
Win the game.

79
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,633
Don't look at me! I'm not doing that.

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
Her family's lives depend on it.

81
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,400
True. But don't forget,

82
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,867
all of our lives hang on this tournament.

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,133
Including yours

84
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,300
and mine.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,734
There was some trouble
at the Aegean Sea game arena,

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,333
but we've dealt with it here.

87
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,133
Yes.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,734
Gonna steal the phone?

89
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,667
I guess you think you can
contact the outside world,

90
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,533
and save Yuki's family
before the game ends?

91
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,266
But

92
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,300
you'll never get away with it
with those guards.

93
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,233
OUT OF RANGE

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,533
There's no signal on the island.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,734
Oh, really?

96
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:01,200
The footage from the other arena
was recorded just 30 minutes ago.

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,200
There must be a secret
communications facility on the island.

98
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,367
Well, now that I think about it,

99
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,533
I saw a huge radio tower.

100
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,934
That's where the drone attacked us.

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,700
Was it protecting the radio tower?

102
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,633
Who knows?

103
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,967
After that I went to the beach
and there was a boat just sitting there.

104
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,700
I thought that could be my escape route,
so I went to check it,

105
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,600
but another drone appeared, and bam!

106
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,734
Just as if I was being played with.

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Really pissed me off.

108
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,333
Yuki.

109
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,734
I think I can help your mom and brother.

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,967
Come in.

111
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,500
WATCH OUT FOR DRONES
HOTEL

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,166
-A radio tower?
-Yes.

113
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,066
I think we can call for help from there.

114
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:21,300
I'll try and get them to safety
before the game is finished.

115
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,066
But what if something happens to you?

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I'll be fine.

117
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,333
It's nothing like what I went through

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,734
when I was looking for
devil's keys abroad.

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,700
But promise you'll be careful.

120
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:41,333
The second match
of round one is about to begin.

121
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,133
-Players are asked…
-Yuki.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,500
-…to move to the game room.
-Any idea where your family is?

123
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,500
No. None.

124
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,767
I could track them down
with an Internet connection.

125
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,834
Oh, right!

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,200
Teruasa, I'll do anything
to help Yuki's family.

127
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,233
Will you take me to the radio tower?

128
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,633
But wouldn't you rather have
OROCHI with you in the game?

129
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,533
If it'll help my family,

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,667
I'll manage on my own.

131
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,233
Okay.

132
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,667
I know you can do it.

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,300
I need you to listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

134
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,066
You've reached Teruasa Oda.

135
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,333
I can't answer the phone right now.

136
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,533
Hyodo.

137
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,667
He wasn't at work either?

138
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,166
No.

139
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,200
He said he wanted to watch
me fight, so I brought tickets.

140
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,266
FUJIN SHOW 2025

141
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,867
WATCH OUT FOR DRONES

142
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,667
BEWARE OF ROCKS
WATCH OUT FOR DRONES

143
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,700
You heard about the radio tower?

144
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,567
TOURNAMENT ROUND ONE
ARENA ONE

145
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:05,967
Thanks for telling us about it.

146
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,000
You think I was trying to help?

147
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,400
SENYA UESUGI VS YUKI MANABE

148
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,934
-Weren't you?
-No way.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,333
Of course not.

150
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,033
I made a bet to see
whether I'd beat you first,

151
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,567
or Terurin would rescue your family first.

152
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,633
Playing against a little newbie like you
wasn't quite doing it for me.

153
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,800
So shall we get on with it?

154
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,367
Senya will do his best
to mess with your head.

155
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:33,900
Whatever the game is,

156
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,834
the winner is one who
masters manipulation.

157
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,967
So keep up a strong guard
and don't let him read you.

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,100
Then you can take the lead
and control him.

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,333
Wait!

160
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
What's this?

161
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:54,467
I've never started a game before,

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,433
so I don't have a devil power.

163
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,767
Is it fun to beat me
with such a big advantage?

164
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,667
Or maybe…

165
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:13,300
you're intimidated by the creator
of something as amazing as OROCHI.

166
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,433
You're telling me.

167
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,433
I expect Terurin's filled your head
with tactics, but…

168
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,433
fine by me. Go for it.

169
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,233
Come out, devil!

170
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,967
TOURNAMENT ONE
ARENA TWO

171
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,767
MITSURU ASAI VS AKIRA MORI

172
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,133
Go on.

173
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,333
I summon the devil.

174
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,300
Welcome to the world of ACMA:GAME.

175
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,333
Here by your summoning,
I am the game master, Elva.

176
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:04,300
I am a very noble devil,

177
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,166
so I will be a fair judge to you both.

178
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,800
It's a pleasure, El-chin.

179
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:12,066
You're quite the gentleman
compared to that Gado-chin.

180
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,467
Please accept my gratitude.

181
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,700
Would you be so kind
as to state your demands?

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,500
Let me see.

183
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,367
I'd like to make you give me a kiss,

184
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,934
but I guess I'll follow
the tournament rules.

185
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,266
I demand control of her life.

186
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,600
Same here.

187
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,033
I accept your requests.

188
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,633
Now for your oaths.

189
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,567
I will fight for my desires.

190
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,633
I will triumph for my desires.

191
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,100
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,967
Oaths accepted.

193
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,133
This time, the game is called…

194
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,734
"Gold Gun &amp; Silver Gun."

195
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,767
Please go ahead. Kindly open the boxes.

196
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Wow.

197
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,633
Robbery and citizen?

198
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,800
El-chin, how do we play?

199
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:33,900
You are in the Old West,
the American Frontier.

200
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:38,133
You find yourself in a bank in the city.

201
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,133
Really? Do we get money?

202
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,633
It's just the game's setting, right?

203
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,000
There are $1,000 dollars in the bank.

204
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,200
Senya, if it were up to you,

205
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,600
what would you do with the money?

206
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,467
I'd take my gun and steal it all.

207
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,967
You'll get caught.

208
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,433
Is that how the game works?

209
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
If you wish to steal the money
press the "robbery" button.

210
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:14,266
But if you prefer not to,
please press the "citizen" button.

211
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,100
SENYA - ROBBERY

212
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,367
YUKI - CITIZEN

213
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,400
Now what?

214
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,000
I will say the word "judge."

215
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,900
The room will become dark for ten seconds.

216
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,867
If you think your opponent
has pressed "robbery,"

217
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:39,700
then while it is dark,
please pull the trigger on your gun.

218
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,266
Will we die?

219
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,533
Please rest assured,

220
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
the gun will shoot flames
and make a flashy bang,

221
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,100
but no one will be harmed.

222
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,166
Nothing?

223
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,066
It can only shoot during the darkness.

224
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:01,400
Incidentally, when you shoot,
it automatically hits the target.

225
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,633
Either of you may fire your weapon.

226
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,633
If neither of you shoots
within ten seconds,

227
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,000
the darkness ends.

228
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,233
Shoot or wait ten seconds.

229
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
RULE ONE

230
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,500
If you choose to be a robber
and don't get shot, you win the money.

231
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,500
If you choose to be a citizen,
you get nothing.

232
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:22,633
RULE 2

233
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:27,033
What happens
if we both choose to be robbers?

234
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,700
The person who shoots first
wins the money.

235
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,767
RULE 3

236
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,633
Then surely it's best to be a robber?

237
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,767
If you accidentally shoot someone
who chose to be a citizen－

238
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,567
Yes?

239
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,533
Please excuse me.

240
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
RULE 4

241
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:47,266
If you accidentally shoot a citizen,
there will be a $3,000 fine.

242
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,734
And if a citizen shoots a robber?

243
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,767
The money in the safe is defended.

244
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,967
RULE 5 - DEFENSE

245
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:57,500
Should I be citizen or a robber?

246
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,533
To shoot or not to shoot.

247
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,767
What?

248
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,967
What's happening?

249
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,800
Yuki, you used your key
for the first time,

250
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,333
so your devil power is released.

251
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,633
I just paused time for a little moment.

252
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,400
My devil power?

253
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,900
Yuki, your devil power is

254
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,934
Contagion Program.

255
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,867
It is also known as
the contagious power to command.

256
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,567
Contagious power to command?

257
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,433
You choose an object to command,

258
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,533
and when that object is
in your opponent's hands,

259
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,867
they will subconsciously follow
whatever command you gave.

260
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:49,367
So if I tell this object to laugh,

261
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:50,834
then give it to him,

262
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,667
whenever he touches it,
he'll laugh for no reason?

263
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Yes, exactly as you imagine.

264
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,400
But, how am I supposed to
use that to my advantage?

265
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,233
Do you presume that I will
answer every little question?

266
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,667
Humans are such inferior creatures.

267
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,867
Now I'll reset the safe.

268
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,200
Please place your cases in front of you.

269
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,967
Let the game
Gold Gun &amp; Silver Gun commence!

270
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,533
GOLD GUN &amp; SILVER GUN
SET ONE

271
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:32,266
Like I said before,
I'm not gonna go easy on you.

272
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,200
The word "defeat" is not in my dictionary.

273
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,667
Then allow me to write it in for you.

274
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:56,433
So, will you steal or defend the money?

275
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,667
If I win $5,000 now…

276
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:02,967
WHICH TO CHOOSE?
ROBBERY - CITIZEN

277
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,700
…it won't matter if I lose $3,000
for killing a citizen later on.

278
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:07,834
THE CHOICE HAS TO BE ROBBERY

279
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,233
So I'll be a robber.

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But wait.

281
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,533
He wants the money, same as me.

282
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,900
If I press "robbery,"
we'll both have to shoot each other.

283
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,667
So perhaps I should be a citizen
and get him to shoot me.

284
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,133
That's a good plan.

285
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,834
But if he sees through my plan,
and doesn't shoot,

286
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,734
then I'll lose all of the money.

287
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:35,900
Right! I'll choose "citizen," and wait
for a few seconds after it goes dark.

288
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:36,967
WILL THE OPPONENT SHOOT?

289
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,233
If he still doesn't shoot,
then I'll shoot him.

290
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
DO I SHOOT?

291
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,467
With this strategy,
I'm ready for anything－

292
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,633
No I'm not.

293
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,800
He could be a citizen.

294
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,066
If he is, and I shoot him,

295
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,400
I'll pay a $3,000 penalty.

296
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,233
You look like you're getting in a muddle,

297
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
but there's no point strategizing.

298
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,934
It's not about gains and losses.

299
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,266
It's about analyzing
the opponent's thoughts.

300
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
It's about controlling
the opponent's thoughts.

301
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,900
YUKI CHOOSES TO BE A CITIZEN

302
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,033
Time to judge.

303
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,166
He fired!

304
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,867
ROBBERY

305
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,567
CITIZEN

306
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,800
Senya chose to be a robber,

307
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,400
and shot Yuki, a citizen!

308
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,233
Senya incurs a penalty of $3,000.

309
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,900
Senya loves a thrill,
so he'd never choose to be a citizen.

310
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,667
My analysis was correct.

311
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,433
Oh, dear.

312
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,166
What a letdown.

313
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,233
I had high hopes you'd be clever enough
to attack in the first set.

314
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,800
You won't beat me
if you're on the defensive from the start.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Pigtail girl.

316
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,967
Did I piss you off?
I don't mind if you're mad.

317
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:10,667
Emotional people
are the easiest to manipulate.

318
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,934
You're an attention seeker.

319
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,233
There's nothing you love more
than seeing a look of surprise

320
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,667
on your opponent's face.

321
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:24,567
So obviously someone like you
would fire from the start.

322
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,734
You really are

323
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,333
pretty simple, aren't you?

324
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:38,967
Would you look at that?

325
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,567
You're unexpectedly feisty, aren't you?

326
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:45,266
Do you like this kind of thing, Senya?

327
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,633
I don't just like it.

328
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,600
I love it.

329
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,166
The safe is reset.

330
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
Why are you following me?

331
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,333
I－

332
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,166
Earlier, what were you
talking about in Yuki's room?

333
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,567
Go back to the hotel.

334
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,333
Just tell me.

335
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,467
Why can't I know?

336
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,800
You don't care about Yuki.

337
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,800
-But I care about you.
-What?

338
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,100
I mean, because you have my key
and you control my life.

339
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,800
-A drone's seen us. Run.
-What?

340
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,033
What should we do?

341
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,533
-Jump!
-What?

342
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,767
$1,000.

343
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:53,700
Will you steal or defend the money?

344
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,266
GOLD GUN &amp; SILVER GUN
SET TWO

345
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,867
A grand is no good to me.

346
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,734
The real problem is

347
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,567
how do I regain the lead from Yukky?

348
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,700
Maybe I'll try the strategy
I came up with earlier.

349
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:11,066
Why would he blurt out his plan?

350
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,900
Is he trying to trick me?

351
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,967
Even though you're
a total adrenaline junkie,

352
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,667
you're not going to shoot me this time?

353
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:26,467
If you risk it just for $1,000,

354
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,433
it'll be tragic to see you
get another penalty, don't you think?

355
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Well,

356
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,166
what will it be?

357
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,934
I'm not robbing this time either.

358
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,934
I'll be a citizen.

359
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,300
YUKI CHOOSES TO BE A CITIZEN

360
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,800
Make your judgment.

361
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,767
He fired!

362
00:22:55,367 --> 00:23:00,367
Senya chose to be a robber,
and shot Yuki, a citizen!

363
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:04,834
Senya gets another $3,000 penalty.

364
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,166
Just like I thought.

365
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:12,533
His gambler's pride got in the way,
and he tried to do something unexpected.

366
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,300
So he dared to shoot
when he shouldn't have.

367
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:20,166
At this rate, if I keep winding him up,
he'll get more and more frustrated,

368
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:21,934
and I'll win.

369
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,133
Senya,

370
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,834
you've got a stubborn streak.

371
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,934
Not a good trait for a gambler.

372
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:32,667
Oh, please.

373
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:38,233
Then let me show you
just how stubborn I can be.

374
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,433
Now what's this, Senya?

375
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,934
You've thrown away the silver gun?

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,367
That's right.
I don't need it in the next set.

377
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,433
What do you make of that, Yukky?

378
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Safe reset.

379
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,867
Tell me what Gungnir's purpose is.

380
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,133
I want to beat him.

381
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,100
To do that,
I need to know what you're after.

382
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,433
I can tell you,

383
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,200
but once you know, you can't go back.

384
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I don't care.

385
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,400
That's what I came here for.

386
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,834
I thought we were going to die.

387
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,100
Teruasa, haven't we gone
quite far off route?

388
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:42,900
What's that app?

389
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,700
Nice to meet you! I'm AI OROCHI.

390
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:48,834
Where's the radio tower?

391
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,900
That's what you're looking for?

392
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,033
Yes!

393
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,533
To save Yuki's mom
and her brother, Kazuma.

394
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,533
-Yukari, will you wait here?
-Yukari?

395
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm going to the radio tower alone.

396
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,033
Wait!

397
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,900
You can't just leave me here.

398
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:06,867
Will you carry me?

399
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,867
She's kinda selfish.

400
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
GOLD GUN &amp; SILVER GUN
SET THREE

401
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,333
$1,000.

402
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,800
Will you steal or defend the money?

403
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,734
I've chosen already.

404
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,800
He threw away his gun,

405
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,433
but I bet he'll shoot me anyway!

406
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:33,166
I don't know how he's going to do it

407
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,367
but this guy is a sucker
for doing things others can't.

408
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,767
So I'm going for the same again.

409
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,934
YUKI CHOOSES TO BE A CITIZEN

410
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,567
Judge.

411
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,000
What? He's not gonna shoot?

412
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:48,934
Why not?

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,934
Then should I shoot? What should I do?

414
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,266
That's right, Yukky.

415
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,333
ROBBERY

416
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
CITIZEN

417
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,934
Since neither of you fired this time,

418
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,200
as the robber, Senya wins $1,000.

419
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,834
I thought I could read him,
but he saw right through me.

420
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,133
Why would you be a citizen
when I chucked away my gun like that?

421
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,333
Maybe those other wins were just flukes?

422
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,033
What are you going on about?

423
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:27,567
I wouldn't get too carried away
when you only won back $1,000.

424
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,700
It's kind of a letdown.

425
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:34,066
I was expecting big things from you.

426
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:37,900
I had high hopes you'd pick up the gun
and show me what you're made of.

427
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:39,967
What's this?

428
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,633
Isn't that…

429
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:45,934
exactly what I said to you earlier?

430
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,967
What a letdown.

431
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:52,266
I had high hopes you'd be clever enough
to attack in the first set.

432
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,367
Everything's going completely backwards
from the first set.

433
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,100
He's suddenly taken control.

434
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,867
I can't let this continue.

435
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,166
The safe is reset.

436
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:09,066
GOLD GUN &amp; SILVER GUN
SET FOUR

437
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,567
$10,000!

438
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,133
My luck is back.

439
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,734
Let's do this.
I don't need my gun in this set either.

440
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
Again?

441
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,100
She's only a childhood friend.

442
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:28,000
You shouldn't put yourself
in danger like this.

443
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,500
Didn't you come here

444
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,633
to avenge your father's death?

445
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,033
That's not the only reason.

446
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:38,900
What's the other reason?

447
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,800
There it is. We found it.

448
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,867
I'm ready.

449
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,300
You take all the time
you need to think, okay?

450
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:55,166
In this game, the more you think,
the murkier it gets.

451
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,467
What would you do,

452
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:00,667
Teruasa?

453
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,867
If you dwell too much on the enemy,
you'll lose sight of your own strategy.

454
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,500
You need to have an accurate
understanding of your enemy's strengths.

455
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:14,367
Teruasa is so good at this
because he can do that without trying.

456
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,900
I've gotta figure out
how to do the same thing.

457
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,200
YUKI CHOOSES TO BE A ROBBER

458
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,533
Judge.

459
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:32,967
What?

460
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,600
Two shots?

461
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Senya chose to be a robber,

462
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,333
and shot Yuki first,
who was also a robber.

463
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,834
Senya wins $10,000!

464
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,033
What? How did you shoot me?

465
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,567
And how were you so quick?

466
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,533
Did you use a devil power?

467
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,266
Wrong!

468
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,633
During the second set,

469
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:01,333
I checked that pulling the trigger
before the judgment

470
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
would count as firing a shot.

471
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,600
Once that was confirmed,
in the fourth set,

472
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:11,266
I picked up the gun, pulled back
the trigger, and chucked it away.

473
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:17,834
The gun doesn't have to aim
at the opponent to hit the target.

474
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:25,233
What a comeback!

475
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,367
The safe is reset.

476
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,633
NO OPEN FLAMES - HIGH VOLTAGE

477
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,900
-I'll put you down.
-Okay.

478
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,066
A bomb?

479
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,667
It's good you noticed that, Teruasa.

480
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,834
We managed to lose the drone
and went off route.

481
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,934
Why do you think we found it so easily?

482
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,533
It was a trap?

483
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:58,033
Yes.

484
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:00,633
Senya said something similar
happened to them.

485
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:06,500
Just as if I was being played with.
Really pissed me off.

486
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,400
Being played with? How do you mean?

487
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:24,166
OROCHI, do you know how to disable it?

488
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,333
I need to search
what type of detonator it is,

489
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,000
so start the computer
and connect me to the Internet.

490
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:32,934
Yippee!

491
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,800
DETONATION ACTIVATED

492
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,133
What's happening?

493
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,734
That looks like a countdown!

494
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,100
Just as I thought.

495
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,133
We've been forced into a game
designed by Gungnir.

496
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,600
It looks like you have to enter
a four-digit code to disarm it.

497
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,900
Our latitude or longitude?
Or how many steps it took to get here?

498
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,200
None of those are four digits…

499
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:59,200
This isn't the time for thinking!

500
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,600
We need to get out of here!

501
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:08,900
"Believe in the path you are on.
A new path will appear."

502
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,200
Maybe it's a hint.

503
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,700
So, Yukky,

504
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,633
shall we finish this?

505
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,433
GOLD GUN &amp; SILVER GUN
SET FIVE

506
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:29,133
$5,000 in the bank for set five.

507
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,233
Senya,

508
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,300
shall we crank things up a notch?

509
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:40,233
What?

510
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,100
What do you mean?

511
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,200
Shall we swap our cases?

512
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,700
-You what?
-Well, well…

513
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,767
So you decide if I'm a robber or citizen,

514
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,734
and I'll decide if
you're a robber or citizen.

515
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:57,767
But wait,

516
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,867
are you worried you won't be in control?

517
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,500
El-chin, is that even allowed?

518
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:08,166
If both parties agree, I'll allow it.

519
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,800
How exciting. I'm in!

520
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,667
I'm loving the spontaneous exchange,

521
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:27,567
but if you think about it,
we both have to be citizens.

522
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,467
Well, what will it be?

523
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,066
I'll make you a citizen.

524
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,834
Then I don't have to worry
about you stealing the money,

525
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,767
or about getting
a penalty for shooting you.

526
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,700
Surely you're thinking the same.

527
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,133
So I'm going for "citizen."

528
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,033
If that's what you think, go for it.

529
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,200
I don't know what you're thinking,

530
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,800
but however you look at it,
"citizen" is the only choice.

531
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,567
Okay. Me too.

532
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,367
Judge.

533
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,734
We must both be civilians.

534
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,333
So no one shoots, and we draw.

535
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,233
I'm in the lead by $5,000.

536
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:16,600
If we keep drawing like this, I'll win.

537
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,867
What's she gonna do?

538
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,033
CITIZEN

539
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,133
ROBBER

540
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:29,834
What?

541
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,467
You're a robber?

542
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,300
How?

543
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,834
Since neither of you fired,

544
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,734
Yuki, the robber, wins $5,000.

545
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,834
The safe is reset.

546
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,233
You fell for it.

547
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,433
You used it didn't you? Your devil power.

548
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:00,667
Earlier…

549
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,166
So, Yukky.

550
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,200
Shall we finish this?

551
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,033
I used my devil power on the switch.

552
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,734
CONTAGION PROGRAM

553
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,433
Shall we swap our cases?

554
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,433
You what?

555
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
While you were touching the switch,

556
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,100
even though you wanted to press "citizen,"

557
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:23,734
you unintentionally pressed "robbery."

558
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,433
This is my devil power.

559
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,233
SENYA UNINTENTIONALLY
CHOSE YUKI TO BE A ROBBER

560
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,500
Contagion Program.

561
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,667
ARENA TWO

562
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,066
End of the final set.

563
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:35,133
FINAL SET

564
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,000
Here are the results.
Akira Mori has $15,000,

565
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:41,967
but Mitsuru Asai has $5,000.

566
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:46,734
And so Akira Mori
is the winner of the game.

567
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,367
Thank you very much,

568
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:54,967
Asai.

569
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,633
Shit!

570
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,734
It's my key!

571
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,266
Goodness me.

572
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:10,200
How fitting for the final set.
A hefty sum.

573
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,333
Will you steal or defend the money?

574
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
ARENA ONE

575
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,700
Since it's a tie…

576
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:17,467
FINAL SET

577
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,567
…whether it's $10,000 or $1,000,
whoever takes this set will win.

578
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,200
You're right.

579
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,567
The winner will be decided.

580
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,266
Yukky,

581
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,700
you used your power just now didn't you?

582
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,867
What the hell could it be?

583
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,633
You can only use a devil power
once per game,

584
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,367
but my Contagion Program

585
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,333
is effective for as long as
the game lasts.

586
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,867
So he'll keep unintentionally pressing…

587
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:46,934
YUKI'S SWITCH

588
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:50,367
…the "robbery" button on my switch.

589
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,867
Hey, Yukky.

590
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,333
Hurry up and choose "citizen."

591
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,367
First, why don't we dial up the tension?

592
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,734
How about we swap guns too?

593
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,800
The guns?

594
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:06,967
What's he up to?

595
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,700
Does he know what my power is?

596
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,000
No, there's no way he could.

597
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:16,967
This is the last turn,
so why don't we mix it up?

598
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:20,767
That's what gambling's all about, right?

599
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:23,700
What's wrong?

600
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,000
Are you too scared?

601
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,867
Go on then, let's swap.

602
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,066
It's okay right?

603
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,433
I'll allow it.

604
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,867
Thanks.

605
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,300
This must be a trap.

606
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,567
He must be about to use his devil power.

607
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,834
I don't know what it is,

608
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,066
but he can only use it once in the game.

609
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:02,500
So if I can use my devil power
to keep it at a tie,

610
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,867
I can extend the game,
and gain the upper hand.

611
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,500
Even though you used your devil power,

612
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,333
I admit you played well.

613
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,734
And you really did a cool job
making OROCHI.

614
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:19,600
You think you've already won?

615
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,233
I'm happy to take over your life,

616
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,567
but I do hope Terurin can do something
to save your family.

617
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Of course he will.

618
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
I believe in him.

619
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,033
That goes without saying.

620
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,000
But,

621
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,700
I'm still going to do
everything I can to win

622
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,266
and protect my family. You'll see.

623
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:43,900
Don't hate me when I win.

624
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,567
I was going to say the same to you.

625
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:51,066
Next you'll press "robbery" on my switch.

626
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:55,166
Then I will press "robbery"
on your switch too.

627
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,200
YUKI CHOOSES SENYA TO BE A ROBBER

628
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,400
Judge.

629
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,567
He's not firing.

630
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:08,533
Because we exchanged guns
neither of us should shoot.

631
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:12,700
Then it will be a draw,
because we are both robbers.

632
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:13,767
I can extend the game.

633
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,734
ROBBER

634
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,600
Yes, you're a robber.

635
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,300
I'm a robber too, so it's a tie－

636
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
No.

637
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:27,867
CITIZEN

638
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,734
Citizen?

639
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,500
Because neither of you took a shot,

640
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,800
the robber, Senya, takes $10,000.

641
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:41,200
The results: Yuki Manabe has $5,000,

642
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:45,834
and Senya Uesugi has $15,000.

643
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,266
Senya Uesugi is the winner of the game.

644
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,166
Even more fun than expected.

645
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:54,633
Thanks to you, Yukky.

646
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,133
How? How can I be a citizen?

647
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,834
It's not possible.

648
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,667
Your power was the ability
to command others?

649
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:09,033
I guess the power
was hidden in the switch?

650
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,033
Just like I thought.

651
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:15,800
How?

652
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,667
A pin?

653
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,200
I thought of it.

654
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:29,133
I wanted to press "citizen,"

655
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:33,333
but I guess your power
made me press "robbery" instead.

656
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:37,367
So I put a pin on the "robbery" button,

657
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:38,867
and tried to press "citizen."

658
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,333
And then, just as I thought…

659
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,934
Even a devil power beyond human knowledge

660
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,300
can be dealt with
once you know the source.

661
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:56,867
The point is…

662
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,900
I shouldn't try to press "robbery."

663
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,934
So I didn't touch the switch
directly with my hand,

664
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,266
but I managed to press "citizen."

665
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,433
With this pen. See?

666
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:15,600
Yuki's power

667
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,767
only works if the opponent
touches the object directly.

668
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:25,867
Because he used a pen,
the power did not work.

669
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:29,734
Senya, you didn't use a devil power?

670
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,734
If you think using a devil power
is always better, you're wrong.

671
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Sometimes not using it
is a better strategy.

672
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:41,333
Devil powers are very strong.

673
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:47,000
There are times when the true power
of the trump card is not using it.

674
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:56,800
I lost.

675
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,867
Time to settle the bets.

676
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,500
Yuki Manabe, the defeated,

677
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:07,667
will entrust her life
to Senya Uesugi, the winner.

678
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:12,400
This brings the game
Gold Gun &amp; Silver Gun to an end.

679
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:17,433
For a couple of pitifully stupid humans,
that was a fun game!

680
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,934
See ya, El-chin.

681
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,300
I'll take that.

682
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,300
Mom.

683
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,100
Kazuma!

684
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:42,467
Yuki.

685
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,734
Your mom and brother are safe.

686
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Terurin?

687
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:56,533
We were pulled into a game
at the radio tower by Gungnir.

688
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,367
"Believe in the path you are on."

689
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,934
WATCH OUT FOR DRONES

690
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:10,133
We only have 30 seconds!

691
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,433
"A new path will appear."

692
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,266
We're not gonna make it.

693
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,000
You have to run, Teruasa!

694
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:24,166
WATCH OUT FOR DRONES

695
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:28,266
BEWARE OF ROCKS

696
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,033
CONGRATULATIONS
GAME CLEARED

697
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,867
It stopped.

698
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,033
OROCHI, hurry.

699
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,333
Roger!

700
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Once we cleared the game
and stopped the detonation,

701
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:46,367
OROCHI connected to the Internet,

702
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:51,000
and hacked into traffic and car cameras
at the time they were abducted.

703
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:58,834
I contacted Ryukan,
and Hyodo was with him.

704
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,633
The two of them went to help.

705
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,967
It's okay.

706
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:18,400
You're Yuki's mother?
And her brother, Kazuma?

707
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:19,467
Yes.

708
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:21,734
Thank goodness.

709
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,967
I'm so relieved.

710
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,400
Thank you.

711
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:35,600
Seriously?

712
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,767
I lost a bet against Terurin.

713
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,367
Senya.

714
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Yes?

715
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:45,633
If I hadn't made it in time,

716
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,333
what would you have done?

717
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:54,467
I always knew you'd make it.

718
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,467
How can you say that?

719
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:58,834
Bullshit.

720
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:04,200
Unbelievable.

721
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,166
You were all very impressive.

722
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:12,667
-Well done on your first win.
-Do I get something?

723
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,600
You too, Teruasa Oda.

724
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,867
You played a brilliant game.
A feast for the eyes.

725
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,166
They were watching us after all.

726
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,533
I saved the hostages.

727
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,467
I don't give a damn about the hostages.

728
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,767
She participated in the tournament.

729
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,934
That was my goal.

730
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,433
What is Gungnir's plan behind all this?

731
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:42,333
I'm looking forward to the next game.

732
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,867
Wait!

733
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,433
Here he is.

734
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,433
I'll leave the rest to you.

735
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,967
The creation of a new world map.

736
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,633
Gungnir is using the devil's keys

737
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,133
to reclaim this filthy world,

738
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
and create a new one

739
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,633
under the leadership of Our Great Guide.

740
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:10,467
Guide?

741
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:13,700
Gungnir has 50 devil's keys.

742
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Then what is the aim of the tournament?

743
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,834
If you want to know that,
you'll have to beat me.

744
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,834
-Ui－
-However,

745
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,133
the next round is a team game.

746
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
Team?

747
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,133
NEXT EPISODE

748
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,500
-What has Gungnir done to you?
-I will beat you.

749
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:39,800
"Basket Fruits."

750
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:43,300
You must guess what kind of fruit,
and how many are in the basket.

751
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,800
Human betrayal is a sweet thing.

752
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:47,600
There was some kind
of underground facility?

753
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,066
-Come on.
-I will beat you no matter what.
