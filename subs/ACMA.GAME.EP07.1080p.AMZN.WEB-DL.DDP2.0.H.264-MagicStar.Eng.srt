1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,133
If you collect 99 devil's keys…

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,367
Jump!

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,934
…you can have everything in the world.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,200
The mysterious organization Gungnir
is holding an ACMA:GAME tournament.

5
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,667
If it'll help my family, I'll manage.

6
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:17,600
I beat Yukari, and even though Yuki lost
to Senya, I managed to save her family.

7
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:20,300
What is Gungnir's plan behind all this?

8
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,667
The creation of a new world map

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:26,133
under the leadership of Our Great Guide.

10
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:29,000
If you want to know more,
you'll have to beat me.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
My dear friends who made it
through the first round,

12
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,700
let me first say congratulations.

13
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,900
We're adding a new twist
in the second round with team games.

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,233
Your teammate is whoever you
played against in the first round.

15
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:59,300
In the first game,
Teruasa Oda and Yukari Shikibe

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,200
will battle against
Ui Saito and Shunichiro Date.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,133
In the second game,
Senya Uesugi and Yuki Manabe

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,033
will battle against
Akira Mori and Mitsuru Asai.

19
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:13,734
First,

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,333
tell us what you mean
by "creating a new world."

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,567
What are you conspiring
to do with 50 keys?

22
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:24,934
Shouldn't you forget that and worry
about the next game instead?

23
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:31,700
Haven't you and Saito
been best friends since middle school?

24
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:36,200
Seems as though
this fight was written in the stars.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,233
The first game will begin in one hour.

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,333
Mori, let's do this!

27
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,500
Great! This is gonna be fun.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,800
Are you okay, Teruasa?

29
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,700
I didn't think you'd have to fight Ui.

30
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,266
-OROCHI and I will search the hotel.
-What?

31
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,934
There must be devil keys somewhere.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
-If I can steal them－
-You mustn't.

33
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,633
Don't do anything dangerous.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,367
-But I－
-Yuki.

35
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,166
Thank you.

36
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,266
But I said I'm fine.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,266
It's an honor to be on your team.

38
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,467
I'll follow your lead.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,200
I've been curious.

40
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,400
You went easy on me last time, didn't you?

41
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,633
No.

42
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,567
You've got it wrong.

43
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
By the way, when you face your friend…

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
will you go easy on him?

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,667
Never.

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,934
I'll take him down with all I've got.

47
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,300
TOURNAMENT ROUND 2
1ST GAME

48
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Tell me…

49
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,467
TERUASA ODA &amp; YUKARI SHIKIBE
VS UI SAITO &amp; SHUNICHIRO DATE

50
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,367
…who is this Guide?

51
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,533
The guy at the top?

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,400
You should show respect
when you speak his name.

53
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,600
Ui,

54
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,433
what has Gungnir done to you?

55
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:49,967
Why would you join them?

56
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,166
You should concentrate.

57
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,133
Teruasa…

58
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm going to defeat you.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,767
Ui…

60
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,600
I summon the devil.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,200
Did you enter Ui into the tournament
because he's Teruasa's friend?

62
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,600
That's not the only reason.

63
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:39,600
Though his life is in turmoil
because of his kind nature,

64
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,000
as expected from someone chosen
by the devil, he's an outstanding player.

65
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:49,567
Most importantly,
Saito knows Oda inside out.

66
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,800
He will be a formidable match.

67
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,700
The last time I saw a team match
was in Babylonia,

68
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,433
or was it ancient Rome?

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,700
This game will be fitting
for a two-player team game.

70
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,433
"Basket Fruits."

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,467
"Basket Fruits"?

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,133
Let me explain how the game works.

73
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,500
First, you each roll the dice,

74
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,500
and sit in order around the table,
from highest to lowest.

75
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,333
UI - YUKARI
TERUASA - DATE

76
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,467
FIG - ZUCCHINI - ORANGE
PEAR - APPLE

77
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,000
Next, you choose which fruits
to put in the basket

78
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,867
by selecting five tiles from the drawer.

79
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:48,967
However, you can only choose
up to three of the same fruit.

80
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
FIG - ORANGE - APPLE

81
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,934
The five fruits you have chosen
will appear in the center

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
as plain marbles that all look the same.

83
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:05,133
Since there are four of you,
there will be 20 marbles in total.

84
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,834
You know what your own five marbles are,

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,734
but the other 15 are a mystery.

86
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,233
You take turns to play.

87
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,200
When it's your turn, you choose a fruit,

88
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:20,567
and make a call, declaring that
there is x amount or more of that fruit.

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,800
For example, you might say,
"There are five or more figs."

90
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,600
FIVE OR MORE FIGS - CALL

91
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,834
If the next player thinks the call
is wrong, he must say, "Doubt."

92
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
DOUBT

93
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,500
If he thinks the call is right,
he also chooses a fruit,

94
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,700
and makes a new call.

95
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,834
If you choose a fruit
that has already been called,

96
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,133
naturally, you must
offer a greater number.

97
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:51,033
Basically, you have to guess how many
of which fruit are in the basket.

98
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,066
What happens when you say "Doubt"?

99
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:59,400
I will reveal how many of that fruit
there are in the basket.

100
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,400
In this case, there are four figs.

101
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,500
Because the first player guessed
that there were five or more,

102
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,533
the doubter is correct.

103
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,867
Whoever is correct wins however many
points the chosen fruit is worth.

104
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,166
What if the doubter is wrong?

105
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,367
If the person
who made the call is correct,

106
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,100
he wins however many points
the chosen fruit is worth.

107
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,967
A fig is worth one point,
a zucchini is two points,

108
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,867
an orange is three points,
a pear is four points,

109
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,633
and an apple is five points.

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,767
The numbers are in the words.

111
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,734
F1g, 2ucchini,

112
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,900
orang3, pe4r, and a5ple.

113
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,400
That's kinda lame.

114
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,066
Excuse me?

115
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,433
An incorrect doubter must fold.

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,767
TERUASA - YUKARI - UI - DATE

117
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,967
They lose the same number of points,
and their tiles are revealed.

118
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,834
If someone declares
that there are 12 or more of one fruit,

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,200
the next player must always say "Doubt."

120
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,367
Twelve fruits…

121
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't see how everyone
would choose three of the same fruit.

122
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,433
How do you win?

123
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,367
Once three people are out,
the set is over.

124
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,533
At the end of each set, if someone
has ten points, that person wins.

125
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,000
If there is no winner,
the points are carried over,

126
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:26,000
and the set is repeated
until someone wins.

127
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,633
And with that, let Basket Fruits begin!

128
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,200
You may all choose five fruits.

129
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,433
The main gist of the game

130
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:42,033
is to use the fruits you choose
as a clue to guess what's in the basket,

131
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,000
and then decide
whether to doubt the caller.

132
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:48,000
It must be easier to guess
if I don't play too many different fruits.

133
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,567
I can choose a maximum
of three of the same fruit,

134
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,834
so I'll play a set of three,
and a set of two.

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,133
BASKET FRUITS
SET 1

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,667
Yukari Shikibe, your turn to call.

137
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,166
There is one or more fig.

138
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,834
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

139
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,266
It's only one fig, so even if I doubt her,
she'll only lose one point.

140
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,934
She took the safe option.

141
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,934
There are two or more figs.

142
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,467
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

143
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,200
It makes sense to add one more fig
to the previous call.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,500
But I don't have fig.

145
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,567
TERUASA

146
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,800
If I change the fruit now, I'm basically
admitting I didn't choose any figs.

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,967
So…

148
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,133
There are four or more figs.

149
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,700
Ui Saito, do you wish to call or doubt?

150
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,734
Now if he thinks I have two or more figs,

151
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,500
I can mislead him.

152
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,266
You can do better, Teruasa.

153
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,333
There are seven or more apples.

154
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,567
He just up and changed the fruit?

155
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,500
And he started with seven?

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,066
Yukari Shikibe,
do you wish to call or doubt?

157
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,900
Seven out of 20 are apples?

158
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,333
Surely I should doubt that.

159
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,333
But I played two apples.

160
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
YUKARI

161
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:24,233
If he's so confident it's seven,
he must have played three apples.

162
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:28,100
With my two, that's already five apples.

163
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:32,000
If Date or Teruasa
have two between them, that makes seven.

164
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,467
Wait, surely Teruasa…

165
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:42,166
There are eight or more apples.

166
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,166
That's a good call.

167
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,667
I've got three apples, so it could be
enough to reach eight.

168
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,734
TERUASA

169
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,500
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

170
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,266
Doubt.

171
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,767
Then let's see.

172
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,500
The number of apples in the basket is…

173
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,367
six.

174
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:13,467
Shunichiro Date, who doubted correctly,
gets five points.

175
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,934
The incorrect guesser, Yukari Shikibe,
loses five points.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
YUKARI -5 - DATE 5

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
Yukari Shikibe, you're out.
Now the others can see your tiles.

178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,900
YUKARI

179
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,333
Since you're out,
move to a seat in the back.

180
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,166
There are six apples in total.

181
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,667
Three of them are mine,
and two of them are Yukari's.

182
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,734
YUKARI - TERUASA

183
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,734
So between Ui and Date,
they only have one apple.

184
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,934
And yet, he called seven apples.

185
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,533
Teruasa,

186
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,734
I'm the one who knows you the best.

187
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,400
Is that really all you've got?

188
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,166
Gungnir is much more powerful than you.

189
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,367
Shunichiro Date, since you were correct,
it's your turn to call.

190
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,000
There are two or more zucchini.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,967
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

192
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:16,333
Now that Yukari's fruits are exposed,

193
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,133
they can guess what most of mine are.

194
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,567
I mustn't make a reckless call.

195
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,767
Maybe this will work.

196
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,834
There are three or more oranges.

197
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
Ui Saito, do you wish to call or doubt?

198
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,066
There is one or more pear.

199
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,633
But there are already
two pears in the basket.

200
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
YUKARI

201
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,033
Why would he do that?

202
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:43,300
Shit. Is that what he's doing?

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

204
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,133
Doubt.

205
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,600
Let's see.

206
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,667
The number of pears in the basket is…

207
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,934
six.

208
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,867
Ui Saito, who guessed correctly,
wins four points.

209
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,533
Shunichiro Date, who was incorrect,
loses four points.

210
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,734
Your tiles are revealed, and you're out.

211
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,633
DATE

212
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:18,400
Date doubted him on purpose
to win points for Ui.

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
That was their team strategy.

214
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:26,000
Ui Saito, as the correct guesser,
it's your turn to call.

215
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,567
Looks like it's a duel to the finish.

216
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,467
But it's already checkmate.

217
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,266
Judging from the exposed tiles…

218
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,500
TERUASA - YUKARI - UI - DATE

219
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,333
…and from the number of apples and pears,

220
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,700
you must have

221
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,333
three apples.

222
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
TERUASA

223
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,500
And two pears.

224
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,300
Let me tell you what else.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,266
"Four or more figs" has been called,
but only one has been revealed.

226
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,333
YUKARI

227
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,767
Even if I have three figs,
it's still only four in total.

228
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,367
So I can't call, "five or more figs."

229
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,734
"Two or more zucchini," was also called,
but since neither of us has one,

230
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,633
only the two on display are confirmed.

231
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
DATE

232
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,467
I can't raise the call higher
for zucchini either.

233
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,433
So the only option left is oranges.

234
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,233
Only one is out in the open.

235
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
DATE

236
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:24,867
Since you don't have one,

237
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,667
this is the only call worth making.

238
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,800
There are four or more oranges.

239
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,266
You can't raise the guess any higher.

240
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,900
Your only option left is to doubt me.

241
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,834
Ui must have three oranges.

242
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:49,967
So there are four in the basket.

243
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,667
If I doubt him, I'll lose.

244
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,734
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

245
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,900
If he's lying about not having
any zucchini, maybe I should call.

246
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,900
No,

247
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,633
he's not the type to tell a cheap lie.

248
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:07,967
But then…

249
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,567
the only option is "doubt,"
even though I know I'm wrong.

250
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,467
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

251
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,100
Wait.

252
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,600
The best option in this situation is…

253
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:24,967
There are 12 or more…

254
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,767
figs.

255
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:35,533
Since Teruasa called 12 fruit,
Ui Saito must doubt his guess by default.

256
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,467
The number of figs in the basket is…

257
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
two.

258
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,867
Ui Saito wins one point.

259
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,967
Teruasa Oda loses one point

260
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,100
and is out of the set.

261
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,200
TERUASA -1
UI 5

262
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,000
Now that three players are out,

263
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,333
the first set is finished.

264
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:01,600
You scraped through with minus one
because you were careful not to doubt me.

265
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,233
That was a good decision.

266
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,734
I've been totally defeated in this set.

267
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,100
Now, Teruasa,

268
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,433
you better come at me
with everything you've got.

269
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,700
Ui, what's making you do this?

270
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,333
There doesn't seem to be anything unusual.

271
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
They must be keeping
50 keys somewhere safe.

272
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,867
Maybe they're not in the hotel after all?

273
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,066
Your approach was right.

274
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,100
Ui just got ahead of us somehow.

275
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:18,300
I'll do anything to make sure you win.

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,333
Yukari－

277
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,133
So tell me everything about Ui Saito.

278
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,000
Whoa, how'd you get so good?

279
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
You could barely
hit the ball the other day.

280
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,266
I just practiced.

281
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,000
I want to be as good as you.

282
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,767
But even with practice,
you got good at lightning speed.

283
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,867
Whatever situation he finds himself in,
Ui never gives up.

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Whatever he does,
he does it with full conviction.

285
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,867
He's not the kind of guy
to be driven by greed.

286
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,500
That's why I want to believe he must
have a reason for joining Gungnir.

287
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,667
Yukari, we need a strategy
for the second set.

288
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:16,734
Yes.

289
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,667
I've been thinking.

290
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,066
The apple is worth the most points,

291
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,400
so it does the most damage
if you're wrong.

292
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,900
Let's use that to get the upper hand.

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,467
Ui will call the lowest number
of apples possible.

294
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:34,633
Then Date will repeat his strategy,
trying to fail on purpose

295
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,667
so he can win points for Ui.

296
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,667
Yes, we need to block their strategy.

297
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,433
BASKET FRUITS
SET 2

298
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,266
Teruasa Oda, make the first call.

299
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
There are three or more apples.

300
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,333
Ui Saito, do you wish to call or doubt?

301
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,133
Three apples.

302
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,133
That's a bold start.

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,900
I guess you think I'm going to get
Date to win points for me again?

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,100
If I call four or more apples,

305
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,834
it'll be a risky move
for Date to doubt me.

306
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,533
But this time,

307
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,166
I had Date choose three apples.

308
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Teruasa,

309
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,834
I know you too well.
If you call three apples,

310
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,800
you probably have one in your hand.

311
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,767
TERUASA

312
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,900
Crap, how did he figure that out?

313
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:37,433
So with Date's three apples,

314
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,734
there must be at least four apples.

315
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:45,200
Shit. If Date doubts him now,
Ui will get more points.

316
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,633
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

317
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,567
Doubt.

318
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Now for the big reveal.

319
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,934
The number of apples in the basket is…

320
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,266
one.

321
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,533
Shunichiro Date guessed correctly,
and wins five points.

322
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,767
Ui Saito guessed incorrectly,
and loses five points.

323
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,934
Your tiles are revealed,
and you must concede.

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,133
Impossible. There must be some mistake!

325
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,033
This tickles my feathers.

326
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,633
Human betrayal is a sweet thing.

327
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,467
There's no mistake.

328
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,867
I don't have a single apple.

329
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,200
Date.

330
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,934
What are you doing?

331
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
The psychologist Shunichiro Date.

332
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,767
Many people who connected to Date,

333
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,667
including family and close friends,
have committed suicide.

334
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:53,867
What?

335
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,700
I don't know the details,

336
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,400
but there are rumors
that Date drove them to suicide.

337
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,700
And his purpose for doing so…

338
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,767
Human observation.

339
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,100
Brilliant!

340
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,200
That beautiful face of yours,
twisting in despair!

341
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,667
All humans before me
are simply guinea pigs.

342
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,567
They exist merely to be observed.

343
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,266
He's a total psycho.

344
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,133
You betrayed him just for that?

345
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Yep.

346
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,934
Well, the correct guesser
must make a call.

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,800
There are five or more…

348
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:35,834
oranges.

349
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,000
Yukari Shikibe,
do you wish to call or doubt?

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,200
Five? He's on the attack.

351
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,233
Yukari,

352
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
go for 12 pears.

353
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,233
There are 12 or more pears.

354
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Twelve fruits have been called,
so Teruasa Oda must doubt by default.

355
00:21:58,867 --> 00:21:59,934
As for the results,

356
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,266
the number of pears in the basket is…

357
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,367
three.

358
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:11,367
Teruasa Oda guessed correctly,
and wins four points.

359
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,934
Yukari Shikibe guessed incorrectly,
and loses four points.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,533
Your tiles are revealed,
and you are out of this set.

361
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,233
Teruasa, the rest is up to you.

362
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,033
Your team's doing point transfers too now?

363
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,734
I have no sympathy for Ui.

364
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,300
But I don't like this guy's style.

365
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:41,600
Teruasa, as the correct guesser,
it's your call.

366
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,200
YUKARI

367
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,533
First, I watch and wait.

368
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,834
There are two or more zucchini.

369
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,700
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

370
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:52,834
Doubt.

371
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,800
Now for the results.

372
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,433
The number of zucchini in the basket is…

373
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,066
two.

374
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,867
Teruasa Oda, who guessed correctly,
receives two points.

375
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,367
Shunichiro Date guessed incorrectly.
He loses two points.

376
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,166
You're out of the set.

377
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,900
With three players out,

378
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,800
the second set is finished.

379
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,300
Why did Date let Teruasa have his points?

380
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,300
You don't even care about winning.

381
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,066
You're just enjoying watching us squirm.

382
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,133
You're twisted, just like Yukari said.

383
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm sorry for the way I played.

384
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,834
My life is in your hands.
I'm prepared for you to kill me.

385
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,433
This tournament

386
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,333
has reminded me that the only person
I can trust is myself.

387
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,266
I'm going to win this single-handedly.

388
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,033
I will never be beaten.

389
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,867
I'm so intrigued by you.

390
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Your obsession with beating your friend
is second to none.

391
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,900
I want to examine you more.

392
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:31,300
Please, let me help you win this time.

393
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,967
BASKET FRUITS
SET 3

394
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:42,033
Teruasa Oda, you take
the first turn in set three.

395
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,633
There are six or more oranges.

396
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,967
Straight to six?

397
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,900
But it's not worth much
compared to an apple or pear.

398
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,767
That makes it hard to analyze.

399
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,333
Shunichiro, do you wish to call or doubt?

400
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,767
There are two or more apples.

401
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:04,834
Leave out apples?

402
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,867
In the next set, we don't
put any apples in the basket.

403
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,633
Then we doubt apples early in the set.

404
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,867
How many apples until we decide to doubt?

405
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:17,233
Ui and Date will probably
have two or three, so wait for four.

406
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,734
Once they hit four, we doubt their guess.

407
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,867
Until then, let's just
add one apple each turn.

408
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:26,100
Yukari Shikibe,
do you wish to call or doubt?

409
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,734
There are three or more apples.

410
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:31,166
Ui Saito, call or doubt?

411
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,133
Doubt.

412
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,967
Already?

413
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,567
Then let's see.

414
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:42,033
The number of apples in the basket is…

415
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
zero.

416
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,166
Ui Saito was correct. Five points.

417
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,667
Yukari Shikibe, you were wrong.
You lose five points.

418
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,333
TERUASA 5
DATE 4

419
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
YUKARI -14
UI 5

420
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,033
No apples?

421
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,166
What a coincidence.

422
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
You took the same strategy
and left out apples.

423
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,066
It's true.

424
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,200
You really are close friends, huh?

425
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,834
But why?

426
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,600
Why doubt so early on?

427
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,700
Teruasa's strategy wasn't the problem.

428
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:21,500
You were the one that gave it away.

429
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,333
What?

430
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,066
You always pause a little
before you make your call.

431
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,133
But this time
you spoke without hesitation.

432
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,834
Just as if you were carrying out
a pre-meditated plan.

433
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,467
I never let my guard down.

434
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,433
I never take my eyes off you.

435
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,433
My acting was that bad.

436
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:50,066
Yukari Shikibe, you're out.

437
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,066
Saito Ui, as the correct guesser,
you go next.

438
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,533
There is one or more fig.

439
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,433
Ui is still working with Date.

440
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,467
How should I play it?

441
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:08,266
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

442
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,133
There are two or more figs.

443
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,467
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

444
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,500
Surely Date will call pears

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
so that Ui can take the points next.

446
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,767
There are 12 or more oranges.

447
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,600
Oranges?

448
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,333
Twelve fruits have been called,
so Ui Saito must doubt by default.

449
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,533
Let's take a look.

450
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,500
The number of oranges in the basket is…

451
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
seven.

452
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:47,567
Ui Saito guessed correctly
and receives three points.

453
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,734
Unfortunately, Shunichiro Date was wrong.
Three points deducted.

454
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,300
UI - 8
DATE - 1

455
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,433
Your tiles are revealed. You're out.

456
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,767
DATE

457
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,333
Why?

458
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,200
Why would Ui get him
to call oranges for three points,

459
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,400
rather than pears for four points?

460
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,533
Don't you get it, Teruasa?

461
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm going to win by taking
the highest number of points from you.

462
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,000
Ui Saito, as the correct guesser,
it's your turn to call.

463
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,467
There are five or more pears.

464
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,767
Teruasa Oda, do you call or doubt?

465
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,967
Neither Yukari nor I have a pear.

466
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,033
There are only two pears in Date's hand.

467
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
DATE

468
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,400
It all hangs on whether
Ui has three pears.

469
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,233
He's made flawless guesses up until now,

470
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,233
so he must have three pears.

471
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,166
Whether I make a new call,
or doubt his call, I'll lose.

472
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,100
So…

473
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,000
There are five or more figs.

474
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,600
Ui Saito, do you wish to call or doubt?

475
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,867
What are you going to do now?

476
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:05,934
There are six or more figs.

477
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I've got him.

478
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,266
Yukari had two figs, Date had one fig,
and I don't have any.

479
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,333
TERUASA

480
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,967
Three in total.

481
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,633
Unless Ui has three figs,
there can't be six.

482
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,100
But Ui has three pears,

483
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,934
so he can't have more than two figs.

484
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,567
Doubt.

485
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,233
I'll reveal the results.

486
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,834
The number of the figs in the basket is…

487
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,433
six.

488
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,066
As the correct guesser,
Ui Saito wins one point.

489
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,567
Teruasa Oda, you were wrong.
One point deducted.

490
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,000
You're out.

491
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:51,900
How…

492
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,867
In my hand, I had…

493
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,166
two zucchini,

494
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,066
and…

495
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,500
three figs.

496
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,734
I'm an idiot.

497
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,567
He called five pears
when he doesn't even have one?

498
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,800
He knew exactly what I would think.

499
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,333
I've nearly won.

500
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,200
I'll get that last point, just watch.

501
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,500
Bring it on.

502
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Ui,

503
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,834
I will beat you no matter what.

504
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,033
OROCHI…

505
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,500
Yes, you're right.

506
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,233
Who was that?

507
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:17,166
I don't know,
but someone's definitely following us.

508
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:24,000
It's me. Famous YouTuber Mitsuru Asai.

509
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,934
-Know who I am?
-No, I don't.

510
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,533
Yukarin's pretty hot, but you're cute too.

511
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,900
Let me post you on my channel.

512
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:31,800
-Wait－ No thanks.
-How 'bout it?

513
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:34,033
-Don't be so unfriendly!
-Get off.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll pay you if you want. Here, look.

515
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Senya?

516
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,433
Geez. I thought I saw you
running off somewhere.

517
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:47,233
Wait… Who are you?

518
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,266
I told you, I'm the famous YouTuber Asai!

519
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm your next opponent.

520
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,834
Oh, yeah. You're playing too?

521
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,133
I'd rather fight Morin alone.

522
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Whatever.

523
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,734
You think you're gonna get a proper fight?

524
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,133
Dragon King Mori is a monster.

525
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,300
They say even AI that can predict
500 million moves can't beat him.

526
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,834
500 million?

527
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,700
Yikes!

528
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,033
Oh, really?

529
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,500
Now I'm even more excited.

530
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,867
I just remembered.

531
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,433
You're Yukari from Super Funky Pixies.

532
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:37,567
Yes.

533
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,500
It's fascinating to see a current idol
competing in the tournament.

534
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:45,000
I'd love to chat
over a cup of tea sometime.

535
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Ui,

536
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:57,266
I have a plan that will secure your win.

537
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:01,300
What is it?

538
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:03,834
Yukari.

539
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,166
I'm sorry, Teruasa.

540
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,467
I made a mistake.

541
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,667
Hey!

542
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,767
Cheer up.

543
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,367
Teruasa.

544
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,200
It wasn't your fault.

545
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,433
I played terribly, that's all.

546
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,100
Plus,

547
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:29,967
he's very good.

548
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,433
Ui knows what my devil power is.

549
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,300
But we still don't know either of theirs.

550
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,867
I wonder when they'll use them.

551
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:45,400
If only you had a secret weapon
rather than Ui.

552
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,133
A secret weapon.

553
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,734
BASKET FRUITS
SET 4

554
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,333
It's your turn first, Ui Saito.

555
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,266
There is one or more zucchini.

556
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,333
What is it?

557
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:17,433
You're Yukari from Super Funky Pixies.

558
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:20,367
Now we can listen to their strategy.

559
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,867
Date, you－

560
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,266
Don't tell me you think I'm playing dirty.

561
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,900
If you really want to win against Oda…

562
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,734
then you can't be picky
about how you do it.

563
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:47,100
This time, don't choose any oranges.

564
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,900
As for the others…

565
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,100
Teruasa Oda, do you wish to call or doubt?

566
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,967
There is one or more fig.

567
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:02,600
Teruasa, I know what
all of your marbles are.

568
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:07,166
Shunichiro Date, call or doubt?

569
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,166
There are two or more zucchini.

570
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,166
Yukari Shikibe, call or doubt?

571
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,767
There are two or more oranges.

572
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,533
Here's our chance.

573
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,800
Neither Date nor I have oranges.

574
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,667
There are no oranges in the basket.

575
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:30,033
Ui Saito, do you wish to call or doubt?

576
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,567
Doubt.

577
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,867
Then let's take a look.

578
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,333
The number of oranges in the basket…

579
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,900
If I get three points, I'll be on 12.

580
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,567
I'm the winner.

581
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:51,767
Six.

582
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:55,266
Yukari Shikibe wins three points
for guessing correctly.

583
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,266
Ui Saito loses three points.

584
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,333
Your tiles are revealed, and you're out.

585
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
UI

586
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,633
What the hell?

587
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Surely not.

588
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:16,133
You've been bugged.

589
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,567
I THINK IT WAS DATE

590
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,266
This time, don't choose any oranges.

591
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,500
As for the others,

592
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,700
first, go for one fig.

593
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,900
Ui Saito, you're out!

594
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:01,633
Well, since you guessed correctly,
it's your turn, Yukari Shikibe.

595
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,834
There are 12 or more apples.

596
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:09,266
Twelve fruits have been called,
so Teruasa Oda must doubt by default.

597
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,367
Let's see the results.

598
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,133
The number of apples in the basket is…

599
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,266
three.

600
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,900
Teruasa Oda wins five points
for guessing correctly.

601
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,900
Yukari Shikibe loses five points
for an incorrect guess.

602
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,533
Your tiles are shown and you must fold.

603
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,000
TERUASA 9 - YUKARI -16
UI 6 - DATE 1

604
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:32,333
If Teruasa can get one more point,
and knock Date out of the set, he'll win.

605
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,400
From the look on his face,

606
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,233
Ui hasn't given up yet.

607
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:45,400
Teruasa Oda, as the correct guesser,
it is your turn to call.

608
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,800
There are four or more zucchini.

609
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,166
Shunichiro Date,
do you wish to call or doubt?

610
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,667
Date doesn't have any zucchini.

611
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,133
Yukari Shikibe didn't have any either.

612
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,266
YUKARI

613
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,700
I have two zucchini in the basket.

614
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,467
So if Teruasa has more than two,
he should call.

615
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,200
But if he has one, or none,
he should doubt.

616
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:09,767
Which is it?

617
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,967
The game hangs on this point.

618
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,867
I've been waiting a long time

619
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,233
for this moment.

620
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
HIJACKED SIGHT

621
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,533
Unleash Hijacked Sight.

622
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,667
Is that your devil power?

623
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:43,900
Oda and I will
exchange vision for ten seconds.

624
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,066
What? My vision's gone black.

625
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
What?

626
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,300
I can't see the tiles.

627
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,400
Wait.

628
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,166
They won't budge. No.

629
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,467
That's right.

630
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,333
I fixed them in place
using Limited Perfect.

631
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,100
LIMITED PERFECT

632
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:09,800
Time's up.

633
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,166
My own vision is back.

634
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:19,400
It worked! You did it.

635
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Wrong.

636
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,333
The real game starts now.

637
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,834
Just as planned,
I got Teruasa to use his power.

638
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,433
Unleash

639
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,567
Yes-Man Sheep.

640
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,133
YES-MAN SHEEP

641
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:36,467
Teruasa,

642
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,734
from now on, when I ask you a question,

643
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,867
you answer truthfully, with yes or no.

644
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,266
Seriously? A power like that
makes you invincible.

645
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,433
Teruasa…

646
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,734
do you have two or more zucchini?

647
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,500
Teruasa, don't answer him.

648
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,667
Answer me, Teruasa.

649
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,166
Yes.

650
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,200
Why are you smiling?

651
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,834
You're the one I was watching.

652
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:17,266
The power Yes-Man Sheep

653
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,200
forces people to answer with "yes,"
no matter what I ask.

654
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
That's right.

655
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,633
Your expression told me everything.

656
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,033
Teruasa's real answer was, "no."

657
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,233
He doesn't have two or more zucchini.

658
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,500
So there are no more than
three zucchini in the basket.

659
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:40,233
Date, you should choose, "doubt."

660
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,900
Exactly.

661
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,333
I'm sorry, Teruasa.

662
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Doubt.

663
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,033
Now for the results.

664
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,333
The number of zucchini in the basket is…

665
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
four.

666
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,467
Teruasa Oda wins two points
for guessing correctly,

667
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:08,400
but Date loses two points
for an incorrect guess.

668
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,767
You're out.

669
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,633
This brings the fourth set to a close.

670
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,633
With 11 points,
the winner of Basket Fruits is…

671
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,967
Teruasa Oda.

672
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,400
What a delightful battle.

673
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:33,567
Teruasa!

674
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Thanks for your help.

675
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:39,033
It makes no sense.

676
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,667
Did you see through my lie?

677
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:49,200
I waited until the very end to do my part.

678
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I never let my guard down.

679
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:53,867
I never take my eyes off you.

680
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,166
You put on an act
because I was watching you?

681
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,500
When people are watching,

682
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,700
idols are always performing.

683
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Plus…

684
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:07,734
Yukari,

685
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,600
my secret weapon is you.

686
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:13,400
Teruasa's words inspired me.

687
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,300
I couldn't have won alone.

688
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:25,467
Yukari and I worked together
from start to finish.

689
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:30,033
But…

690
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:36,333
you're the one who taught me
that I'm stronger with friends around me.

691
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,166
Teruasa Oda won?

692
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,734
Yes.

693
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,300
That means that Teruasa Oda

694
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:09,600
controls the lives of Yukari Shikibe,
Ui Saito, and Shunichiro Date.

695
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:13,233
The Guide will be very happy.

696
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,200
I knew you'd win, Terurin.

697
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,967
Now you can fight me in the final.

698
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,166
You still have to play the second game.

699
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,734
I'll win.

700
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:25,600
Promise.

701
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Okay.

702
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,000
Where's Ui?

703
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,100
I don't know. I can't find him.

704
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,333
You two need to speak properly.

705
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:39,800
Of course, that's what I wanted.

706
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:45,767
Thank you for helping Teruasa.

707
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:50,767
It was nothing. I didn't do it for you.

708
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,000
Hey, Teruasa,

709
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,900
I think I might have found
Gungnir's hideout.

710
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:02,066
What?

711
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,033
There was some kind
of underground facility.

712
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,033
But I didn't have time
to look any further because of the game.

713
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,000
What the hell?

714
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:17,934
GET READY…

715
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,400
This game is played using clay.

716
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,066
It's way more difficult than I thought
to make it look like a dog.

717
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,300
You fell straight into the trap I set.

718
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:26,700
Isn't family more important to you?

719
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,967
Why bother making us compete in the games?

720
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:30,800
I have to stop them
from getting what they want.

721
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:31,867
A SHOCKING FINALE
