1
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:05,533
If you collect 99 devil's keys,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,200
you can have everything in the world.

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,867
The mysterious organization Gungnir
is holding an ACMA:GAME tournament.

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,600
Who is this Guide?

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,767
You should show respect
when you speak his name.

6
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,600
What has Gungnir done to you?

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,266
I think I might have found
Gungnir's hideout.

8
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:30,767
What the hell?

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Get up here quickly before you fall.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
Hurry!

11
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,166
You're out of your mind.

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,667
Why are you here?

13
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,900
Did Hoshin tell you to spy on me?

14
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,767
Do you want to know more
about the keys and Gungnir's Guide?

15
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,033
Then come with me.

16
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:04,600
What do you mean?

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,600
What are you hiding?

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,734
Let's speak while we walk.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,300
A drone will find us if we stay here.

20
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:20,100
A while back,
things were going badly for the company.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,734
I was drowning in it all,
when a key fell in front of me.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,367
After that, Hoshin called
to tell me about the tournament.

23
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,400
He said you'd be playing too.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
I guessed you accepted the invitation

25
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,033
to avenge your father's death.

26
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,133
So I pretended to be consumed by greed

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,400
to get closer to Hoshin and find out more.

28
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,867
I confided in Yuki a while ago.

29
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,233
So…

30
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,867
I didn't betray you.

31
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:54,233
Before I came here,
and since I've been here,

32
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,500
I've always been on your side.

33
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:08,100
The second match
of round two is about to begin.

34
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,934
-Players are asked…
-Yuki's next?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,266
-…to move to…
-If anything happens…

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,934
-…the game room.
-…I hope Senya will help her.

37
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,433
Brother,

38
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,667
why didn't you save me?

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,700
Senya,

40
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,633
why are you the only one who survived?

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,567
You're alive for nothing.

42
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,100
You'll be alone forever.

43
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,133
-Brother, brother…
-Senya!

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,166
Not again.

45
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,100
Senya, it's me.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,367
I want to win this.

47
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,333
I want to be like Ui, and help Teruasa.

48
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,767
Ui? Isn't he a traitor?

49
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,233
You've got it backwards.

50
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:14,900
He was on our side.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,000
He's searching for Gungnir
with Teruasa right now.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,100
Hoshin.

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,533
The Guide could be in there.

54
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,300
There are no surveillance cameras.

55
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,166
Come on.

56
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,600
-He's happy.
-Having fun?

57
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,667
-He's having fun.
-He's in a good mood.

58
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,600
-Here we go.
-Look.

59
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:22,967
Face this way.

60
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,533
-Look!
-He's smiling. So cute.

61
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,967
Daddy can't stop filming you, can he?

62
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,233
KING

63
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,333
I win.

64
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,166
I always win.

65
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,433
Mori was Dragon King at 19 years old.
He must be a genius.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A genius, huh?

67
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,033
But Date said he's only held on to
his title because of the key.

68
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,834
It's true that he lost a game once,

69
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,133
and apparently at one point
he couldn't play shogi at all.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

71
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:06,033
But since he got the key
he's been on a winning streak.

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,700
He'll be a tough opponent.

73
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,433
Sorry, Mori. Are you okay?

74
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,133
Here.

75
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,834
Now don't get cross.

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,467
I'll get outta your way.

77
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,033
Let's go, Yukky.

78
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,333
Sorry.

79
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,967
Is that Mori's phone?

80
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,633
Yep, you got it.

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
You're a thief. Give it back!

82
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:54,000
If we wanna win,
we need information on the enemy.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,633
But－

84
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,834
Nice to see you, my friends.

85
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,066
I'm sorry we're late.

86
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,800
It's the second match of round two
of the ACMA:GAME tournament.

87
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,600
The battle between Uesugi's team
and Mori's team begins.

88
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:24,500
The only thing at stake
is the right to each other's lives.

89
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:29,767
I can't wait to see the results.

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,734
Okay.

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,867
Shall we start?

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,367
Can I summon the devil?

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,433
Give my phone back first.

94
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,767
What? What do you mean?

95
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,200
You took it when you bumped into me.

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,333
It's here.

97
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,567
-Hey, wait.
-Sorry.

98
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,400
Yukky. Are you kidding me?

99
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,667
Did you see it?

100
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,567
So what if we did?

101
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,867
Even a sour-faced grouch like you
gets all cutesy around the family.

102
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,100
Hope they're not gonna be taken hostage
like Yukky's family was.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,867
Don't worry.
My wife and son are safe at home.

104
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,000
I came here by choice.

105
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:19,867
To make sure I win

106
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,500
and get the keys.

107
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,500
I see.

108
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,767
Have you met Gungnir's Guide?

109
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,033
No.

110
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
Unfortunately, I haven't
even seen what he looks like.

111
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,667
But I did find out something about him.

112
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:45,166
The Guide and I have been acquaintances
for over ten years.

113
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,033
Ten years ago was around the time

114
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,734
of the Oda group case, wasn't it?

115
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,467
Yes.

116
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,734
Our Guide instructed us to do that too.

117
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,500
The Guide was the one
who attacked my father?

118
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,266
Yoo-hoo, El-chin.

119
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,533
Can you make it a game
that suits teams, El-chin?

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,066
I shall gladly comply with the wishes

121
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,934
of you silly, lowly humans.

122
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,300
Senya and Mori,

123
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,867
what do each of you demand?

124
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,700
I want the right to do
whatever I like with their lives.

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Same for me.

126
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,900
I accept your requests.

127
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,033
This time, the game is called…

128
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,333
"Clay Dialogue"?

129
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:57,233
This game is played using clay.

130
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,500
Clay?

131
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,367
I love it already.

132
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,433
There are four turns in each set.

133
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,867
First, it's the question turn.

134
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,333
One person from the first team
goes through the door,

135
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,300
and writes a theme on the paper.

136
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,533
The theme must be a common, tangible noun.

137
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,700
A tangible noun.

138
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,533
So, like, "poop," or, "poop"?

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,867
You love poop, don't you?

140
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,166
The time limit
for the question turn is ten seconds.

141
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:35,800
A game with time limits, huh?

142
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,266
Next, the teams switch,

143
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,500
and the production turn begins.

144
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,633
One person on the opposing team

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,767
checks the theme chosen by the first team,

146
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,033
and tries to mold it with the clay.

147
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,367
The time limit is 60 seconds.

148
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,967
What? Only 60 seconds?

149
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,200
You can only communicate
the theme by using clay.

150
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,066
Can we write letters in the clay?

151
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,667
You may.

152
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:11,967
However, there is a risk that the letters
will be erased in the obstacles turn.

153
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,834
In the obstacles turn,

154
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,667
the second person from the team
who chose the theme

155
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:22,667
is allowed to mess up the clay sculpture
to make the theme unrecognizable.

156
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,200
The time limit is 20 seconds.

157
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,100
Well, makes sense.

158
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
The final turn is the answer turn.

159
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,367
In the answer turn,

160
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,800
the second player from the team
who created the clay sculpture

161
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,600
looks at the messed up clay,

162
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,133
and guesses the theme
originally chosen by the other team.

163
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,533
Those who guess the theme perfectly
score one point.

164
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,700
Incorrect guessers get nothing.

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,066
Both teams take turns to play six sets.

166
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,500
At the end, the player with the highest
number of points is the winner.

167
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,867
Can you do whatever you want
outside the door?

168
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,433
To make sure you don't
give the answer away during the set,

169
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,066
the other players will lose their sight,
hearing, smell, touch, and taste.

170
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:12,433
In other words,
all five senses are suppressed.

171
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,433
No way!

172
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,266
-In total darkness?
-Yes.

173
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,533
And no sound?

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,033
None.

175
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,600
Oh, right.

176
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,367
Mori's team will begin the question round,

177
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,800
and start the game!

178
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:34,433
CLAY DIALOGUE
SET 1

179
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,667
Remaining players, your senses
will be suppressed,

180
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,433
so please take your seats.

181
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,233
Senya, that includes you.
Please be seated.

182
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,667
Fine.

183
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,567
You will now lose all five senses.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,667
I really can't see a thing.

185
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,033
Or hear anything.

186
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,834
No smell either.

187
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,433
SET 1
QUESTION

188
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Cool.

189
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,767
Asai,

190
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,033
write down a theme.

191
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,033
You have ten seconds.

192
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,200
Gotta think of something impossible.

193
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,934
Hamburger? Steak? Mont Blanc?
I have no idea.

194
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,633
Five seconds have passed.

195
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,900
Oh, shit.

196
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,834
Done.

197
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,934
Good work, Asai.

198
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,967
Your senses will be suppressed.
Please sit.

199
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,700
What? That's so annoying.

200
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,967
This is creepy.

201
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,834
Shit, this is gonna feel weird－

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
What?

203
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,233
Yuki, please go through the door.

204
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,700
Sheesh, this could be bad.

205
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,867
SET 1 PRODUCTION

206
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,834
You have 60 seconds to produce something.

207
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,633
DOG

208
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,433
A dog? Way too easy.

209
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,233
Five seconds have passed.

210
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,934
Wait, does it actually look like a dog?

211
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,233
Doesn't it look like a cow or a pig?

212
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,433
It's way more difficult than I thought
to make it look like a dog.

213
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,734
Thirty seconds have passed.

214
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:22,834
I know.

215
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,734
He looks in pain,
even though all his senses are blocked.

216
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,600
Why?

217
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,700
Well done, Yuki.

218
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:51,300
Your senses will be suppressed.
Please sit.

219
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Okay.

220
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,667
Mori, it's time for the obstacles turn.

221
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,300
Please go through the door.

222
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:18,233
SET 1 OBSTACLES

223
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,533
So it's a dog and a kennel?

224
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,367
Mori, you have 20 seconds
to mess up the clay sculpture.

225
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,734
-Why didn't you save me?
-Senya,

226
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,233
-why are you the only one who survived?
-Senya.

227
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,000
Senya!

228
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,133
It's the answer turn.
Please go through the door.

229
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,767
Right.

230
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,066
You look a bit pale.

231
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,600
Are you okay?

232
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
SET 1 ANSWER

233
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,567
Please say what you think the theme is.

234
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,900
There is no time limit for this round,

235
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,200
so please think carefully.

236
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,967
Here goes.

237
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:38,867
For real?

238
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, well. What are you going to do next?

239
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,233
What's this?

240
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:49,200
The clay is rock solid.

241
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,834
The clay is designed
to harden after a certain period of time.

242
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,567
All of it?

243
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,100
No exception?

244
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,333
Does that include
the clay that doesn't get used?

245
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
No.

246
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,266
Any clay that wasn't used
to create a sculpture won't harden.

247
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,600
It can still be reshaped.

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
Then what is this?

249
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,600
A dog

250
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,834
and a kennel?

251
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,100
And Mori has already
tried to sabotage this, right?

252
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,600
Indeed.

253
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:33,967
So which bit did Mori add on?

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,533
Why does the roof only
stick out at the back?

255
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,900
He just flattened one side?

256
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,967
That must be it.

257
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,333
I can see where Mori tried to trick me.

258
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,767
Reasoning invites doubt,
leading one far from the answer.

259
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,300
That's my strategy.

260
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,367
I'm alive.

261
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,967
Senya, it's time to answer.

262
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,133
My answer is…

263
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,367
house.

264
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Senya,

265
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,433
incorrect!

266
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,333
You're kidding?

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,734
The answer is, "dog."

268
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,433
Dog?

269
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,233
Senya's team scores zero.

270
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:45,066
Then why is there only
an overhang at the back?

271
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,133
To convey a dog,

272
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,667
first, Yuki simply made a dog.

273
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,100
But she lost confidence
once she saw the result.

274
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:56,233
She probably thought you might
think it was a different animal.

275
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,633
So she made something else
associated with a dog.

276
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,734
Done!

277
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,934
A dog kennel.

278
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,667
When I saw it, I got thinking.

279
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:10,834
What small change could I make
to the kennel to mislead you?

280
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,800
Eaves on one side.

281
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,533
Just as I predicted,
you misinterpreted that small change.

282
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,934
You decided the dog was a decoy.

283
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,667
So the answer couldn't be, "dog,"

284
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,834
but must be, "house."

285
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,166
You're better at this than I thought.

286
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,700
But you fell

287
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
straight into the trap I set for you.

288
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,100
My bad.

289
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,500
This guy is bad news.

290
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,266
Senya, can I speak to you?

291
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:56,834
Yeah.

292
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,934
Did you see Mori just now?

293
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,467
He gives me the heebie-jeebies.

294
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,567
You looked like you were
struggling earlier. Is everything okay?

295
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,433
I'm totally fine.

296
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,867
You must be seeing things.

297
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,900
We're on the same team.
You shouldn't hide anything from me.

298
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,400
I promise I'm fine.

299
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,166
Shall we?

300
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,333
It's my turn to choose a theme.

301
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,367
What are those markings?

302
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,333
An attack.

303
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,333
Military invasion.

304
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,633
Revolution.

305
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,767
Coup d'etat.

306
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,266
They look like

307
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,734
current conflict zones across the world.

308
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:14,333
Why are they logging conflict zones?

309
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
And that star.

310
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,100
"Eliminate G20 from this world."

311
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
What does it mean?

312
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,700
Key locations?

313
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,533
The locations with the most keys are

314
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
the Caribbean,

315
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:34,800
the Aegean Sea,

316
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,867
and off the Ogasawara Islands.

317
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,000
This island is probably there.

318
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,934
They find information on the key owners

319
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,700
and enter them into the tournament.

320
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,333
Then,

321
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,033
why mark the conflict zones?

322
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,433
Could it be that?

323
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,233
SET 2
ANSWER

324
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,166
Mori, it's time for you to answer.

325
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,533
My answer is "valley".

326
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,133
Incorrect!

327
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,467
The correct answer is, "hill."

328
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,433
Shit!

329
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,333
That was a malicious sabotage.

330
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,934
You're welcome.

331
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,200
It's zero points each.

332
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,533
Ui, Gungnir have 50 keys, don't they?

333
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,133
Yes.

334
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,867
So the aim of this tournament
is to take our keys.

335
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:51,500
If Gungnir takes ours, they will have 99.

336
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:55,200
By bringing conflict and destruction
to the current world,

337
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,834
they intend to create a new one.

338
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,300
But then why wouldn't they
just take the keys by force?

339
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,266
Why bother making us compete in the games?

340
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:07,834
I don't know.

341
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,700
I don't know why they're
making us compete in ACMA:GAME.

342
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:11,767
But…

343
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,934
the total number of keys between us
in this tournament is 18.

344
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,200
But there are 57 keys on this island.

345
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,133
So Gungnir's keys are on this island.

346
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,500
And somewhere else,

347
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,600
there's a place with 11 keys.

348
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,433
The Guide?

349
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,266
Yes.

350
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,734
The Guide is moving
the rest of Gungnir's keys.

351
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,533
It's on route to Japan.

352
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
He's coming here?

353
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,500
Many people will die if we let this go on.

354
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,166
It'll be a blood bath.

355
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,367
We need to find the rest of the keys
and destroy them.

356
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,834
I have to stop them
from getting what they want.

357
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,467
SET 3
ANSWER

358
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,834
The answer is "clay".

359
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,900
Senya.

360
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,100
CLAY

361
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,200
Correct!

362
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,266
We did it!

363
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:22,834
SET 4
ANSWER

364
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,500
The answer is "tile".

365
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,200
Mori.

366
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,867
TILE

367
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,400
-You're correct!
-Take that!

368
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:38,166
Smashed it!

369
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,233
We're tied.

370
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:42,133
Hey, Mori.

371
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,667
I have a little suggestion.

372
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,000
In the last two rounds,
why don't we switch the order?

373
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,767
I really don't care,

374
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,767
but you won't win with dirty tricks.

375
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay with you, El-chin?

376
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,467
I approve.

377
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,233
I just need more time.

378
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,800
I've almost got it.

379
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,633
A foolproof way to beat him.

380
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,967
Teruasa, Hoshin's on his way here.

381
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:27,967
Hurry.

382
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,834
If we use a drone,
we can track down Ui and Teruasa－

383
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,166
No, no.

384
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,867
We don't need to find them.

385
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,667
It's a waste of time.

386
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,767
SET 5
ANSWER

387
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,166
Mori, what's your answer?

388
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,567
My answer is "house".

389
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:57,300
HOUSE

390
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,900
Correct!

391
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,967
Yes! We've won!

392
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,333
Now for the final set.

393
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,166
The question setter
must go through the door.

394
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:14,033
Bring it on!

395
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,233
Crap, we can't get ahead.

396
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,500
No matter what,
we need to get a draw in this set.

397
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,166
Then we will win next.

398
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,500
Yukky.

399
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:41,066
The next problem is…

400
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
how long will I last in the darkness?

401
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,967
All five senses will be blocked.

402
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,767
Teruasa!

403
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,467
Yukari, who won the game?

404
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,600
It's not finished yet.

405
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,934
Anyway, where did you go?
I was looking for you.

406
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,166
I stole devil's keys hidden by Gungnir.

407
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,467
-What? Seriously?
-Yes.

408
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,400
There aren't any keys in here.

409
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,467
That's not possible.

410
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,333
They disappeared?

411
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:32,834
Yukari,

412
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,066
play ACMA:GAME with me.

413
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,533
What?

414
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,066
I hate what comes to me in the quiet.

415
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,567
Regret and loneliness wash over me
again and again.

416
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:56,000
October 23rd, 2015.

417
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,467
When I got home in the night,
my home was destroyed,

418
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:03,233
and my mother and sister
had stopped moving, like broken dolls.

419
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,533
Senya!

420
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,433
The color is draining from your face.

421
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:27,800
Time for the production turn
of the final set.

422
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,834
FINAL SET
PRODUCTION

423
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,166
WATER

424
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:36,266
"Water."

425
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,967
Water doesn't have a fixed shape.

426
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,633
A pond, river, puddle,

427
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,834
a cup of juice, plumbing.

428
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,166
This is a really tough one.

429
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,633
But it doesn't matter.

430
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,533
I'll use this hiding place and my power.

431
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,333
It's a foolproof plan.

432
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Time's up.

433
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,333
Senya, stop whatever you're doing.

434
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,133
I didn't want to have to use it.

435
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,033
But I have no choice.

436
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,633
Mori, it's time for the obstacles turn.

437
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,367
Please go through the door.

438
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,000
Sorry, Mori.

439
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:14,867
I'm going to hit you where it hurts.

440
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,300
You'll regret letting me
unleash my ability.

441
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:24,133
FINAL SET
OBSTACLES

442
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,667
It's you!

443
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,000
Shizu? How did you get here?

444
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:30,900
Where am I?

445
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,000
We were at home,
then suddenly we were here.

446
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,767
Devil power.

447
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,967
You have 20 seconds
to mess up the clay sculpture.

448
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,800
What's that? Whose voice was that?
Hey, you!

449
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:46,433
This is bad.

450
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,066
My devil power is Super Delivery.

451
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,900
Also called Rapid Retrieval.

452
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,633
As long as I know where it is,

453
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,000
I can bring in anything
from outside the sealed room.

454
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,400
No matter how formidable Mori may be,

455
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:04,400
the sudden appearance
of his dear family will confuse him,

456
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,633
and before he knows it,
his time will be up.

457
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,367
What a pity I can't watch
as your face gets all flustered.

458
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,266
What is this place?

459
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,633
You've been away for days.

460
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,967
What are you doing here?

461
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,500
Answer me!

462
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,133
Ten seconds have passed.

463
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,066
I can't mess this up now.

464
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,066
What?

465
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:37,867
It's the answer turn.

466
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:40,533
Yuki, go through the door,

467
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,900
look at the clay sculpture,
and make your guess.

468
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,433
Could that woman holding the baby
be Mori's family?

469
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,934
I don't know how they got here,

470
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,467
but Senya used his devil power.

471
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,834
Mori must have been in shock.

472
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,333
He didn't have time to think
and made a mess of the clay.

473
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,433
But it's fine.

474
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,367
The answer isn't here.

475
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,567
The correct answer is over here.

476
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,934
Here!

477
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,000
Inside the clay.

478
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:20,633
The clay on the main table

479
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,400
hardens at the end of the turn,
and can't be modified.

480
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,333
But the clay
on the workshop table is different.

481
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,400
However much time passes,
the clay stays soft.

482
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:31,800
Found it.

483
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,000
Mog chocolate?

484
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,467
I'll bet this Mog chocolate
on a game with Yukari.

485
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,233
Understood.

486
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,233
-Then let the game－
-But first,

487
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,934
I have some questions.

488
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,867
What do you want to know?

489
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,100
I stole the devil's keys in Gungnir's
possession, but they disappeared.

490
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,633
Where did they go?

491
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,266
Unless the owner passes them on,

492
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,433
or you beat the owner at ACMA:GAME,

493
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,867
devil's keys cannot be moved.

494
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:11,867
So the keys were returned to that room.

495
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:21,567
It appears that the finals
at the other venues have finished.

496
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:23,800
I see.

497
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,700
Sorry to bother you.
The Guide will arrive shortly.

498
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,467
I'm coming.

499
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,533
What's happening?

500
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:03,667
FINAL SET
ANSWER

501
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,367
Yuki, it is time for you to answer.

502
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:16,900
My answer is…

503
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,433
ice.

504
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:27,900
Yuki.

505
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,934
Incorrect!

506
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,934
Take that!

507
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,600
The correct answer is, "water."

508
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,800
Therefore, the winner of Clay Dialogue

509
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:44,767
is Mori's team!

510
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,600
What happened, Yukky?

511
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,900
Did he find the hiding place?

512
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,200
You wrote the answer
in the middle of the soft clay.

513
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,700
I had the same idea.

514
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:07,033
But I was surprised.

515
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,500
My wife and son were behind that door.

516
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:15,300
I guess you summoned them here
with your devil power.

517
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,300
But you should have lost your shit,
and the ability to reason calmly.

518
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:23,500
Twenty seconds should have flown by!

519
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,834
So, is this your wife and baby?

520
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,734
I'm Mori's wife, Shizu.

521
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,700
Nice to meet you.

522
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,266
It's lovely to meet you too－

523
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,367
Wait, what?

524
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:37,967
What was that for?

525
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:41,333
Hold on one second,
your wife and child are right here.

526
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,266
Seems so.

527
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,000
I mean, like, right here.

528
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
What the hell?

529
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,000
How can you be so calm?

530
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,400
Stop it, Senya.

531
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:54,633
You were reunited with your family.

532
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,233
How can you ignore them like that?

533
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,266
Isn't family more important to you?

534
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:04,867
Winning

535
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,700
is my one and only priority.

536
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:12,834
Winning is more important to me
than my family.

537
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,834
You're disgusting!

538
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,500
Don't speak to my husband like that.

539
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:18,867
What?

540
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:22,667
The most valuable thing to Mori
is winning a serious game.

541
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,467
That's what my husband lives for.

542
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,433
You can have your own values
and ideas of happiness,

543
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,600
but please don't impose them on us.

544
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:46,467
When they appeared,

545
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,900
I lost my concentration.

546
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,834
What are you doing here?

547
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,100
Answer me!

548
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,500
Ten seconds have passed.

549
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,266
I can't mess this up now.

550
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,667
I'm in the middle of a game! Go away!

551
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:00,800
Akira－

552
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,533
Shut Out.

553
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,767
Also known as Distraction Elimination.

554
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,033
It's a devil power
that makes a chosen object

555
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:13,200
imperceptible to the senses
until the end of the game.

556
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,033
I had a few seconds left.

557
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:19,900
Just enough to change the kanji
from "water" to "ice".

558
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,166
Now we must settle the bets.

559
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:30,033
Mori now has the right
to do as he wishes with your lives,

560
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,200
Senya and Yuki.

561
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,734
All devil's keys in Senya's possession,

562
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
fall into Mori's hands.

563
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:41,700
This brings the game Clay Dialogue
to an end.

564
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Until we meet again.

565
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:17,633
Thank you.

566
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,233
That was quite the game,

567
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Senya.

568
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,033
Akira.

569
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,133
Sorry for brushing you aside
during the game.

570
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,200
Isamu,

571
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,133
I've missed you.

572
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:05,200
Sorry, Yukky.

573
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,000
I lost it.

574
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,467
Why are you apologizing?

575
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,900
I'm the one who should be sorry.

576
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,333
You were in pain throughout the game,

577
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:23,500
and there's nothing I could do.

578
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm meant to be your friend.

579
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Senya, Yuki.

580
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:35,567
Teruasa.

581
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,166
Who are they?

582
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,667
Senya.

583
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,567
Sorry, Terurin.

584
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,834
I couldn't keep my promise.

585
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,000
The game isn't over yet.

586
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,934
I'm no use to you anymore.

587
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:29,066
That's not true.

588
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,066
Have you forgotten?

589
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,233
You made a bet against me.

590
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:39,800
So help me finish this.

591
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:45,934
If I'm going to destroy all of the keys,
I'll need your help.

592
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,633
Guess I'm outta options.

593
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,500
Looks like I'm gonna be
stuck with you a little longer.

594
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,500
Wait there.

595
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,000
You're worse than Gungnir.

596
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:27,000
What we gonna do if you destroy the keys?
They're worth everything to me.

597
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,400
More than a person's life?

598
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,233
That's totally irrelevant－

599
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,166
They want the keys to take the lives
of huge numbers of people.

600
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,333
We're just pawns in their game.

601
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,300
What?

602
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,533
Take lives?

603
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,066
I went to their hideout.

604
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,500
There was information on the key owners,

605
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,000
and a world map
marked with conflict zones.

606
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,400
What Gungnir describes
as "creating a new world,"

607
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,600
means taking our keys
to create an even bigger war.

608
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:06,767
Why bother with a tournament
when they could just take the keys?

609
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,667
You can't take the keys by force.

610
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,967
Unless the owner passes them on,

611
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:14,066
or you beat the owner at ACMA:GAME,

612
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,500
devil's keys cannot be moved.

613
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,600
So they'll use the game
to take them from us?

614
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,166
Probably. The Guide will take on

615
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,633
whoever makes it to the end.

616
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:28,033
Is this Guide even that good?

617
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:31,367
The Guide?

618
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:35,400
As the one with the most keys
in the world.

619
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,266
His luck is boundless.

620
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:42,400
You'll be like
a lamb to the slaughter before him.

621
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,367
We're all being used by Gungnir.

622
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,867
This whole tournament

623
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,533
is just part of his trap.

624
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,467
Ui.

625
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:01,400
The finals at the other two venues
have been completed.

626
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,867
Everyone apart from the winner,

627
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:07,166
friends and enemies alike,
were executed by Gungnir.

628
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,767
What? Will the same happen to us?

629
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:11,433
That's what they'll do
if we hand over our lives?

630
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:13,967
The guide has planned the whole thing.

631
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,400
Well, well,

632
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,333
thank you very much, Ui.

633
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:22,467
You saved me the trouble of explaining.

634
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:23,533
Hoshin,

635
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,233
where is The Guide?

636
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,266
You want to meet him that much?

637
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,700
Just tell me.

638
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:29,767
Teruasa,

639
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:31,667
calm down.

640
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:33,700
The Guide's true identity is－

641
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:35,333
No, no, no!

642
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:39,166
Don't take all of the fun out of it.

643
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,467
So,

644
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,533
the Guide has arrived.

645
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:09,266
Father.

646
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,266
How?

647
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,233
NEXT EPISODE

648
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,367
DIVE INTO THE FINAL CHAPTER

649
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,567
A fierce showdown between father and son.

650
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:33,667
I will remold this world
into a better one.

651
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:36,533
I will crush all of your ambitions.

652
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,500
This is our fate, as father and son.
