1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:07,266
Teruasa Oda broke into
Gungnir's secret base,

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,300
and discovered their plan

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:13,033
to collect all 99 keys
and take over the world.

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:17,900
You'll be like a lamb
to the slaughter before him.

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,500
We're all being used by Gungnir.

6
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,834
The Guide has arrived.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,233
Father.

8
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:36,867
Is it really true?

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,333
You're going to kill
everyone but the winner?

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,066
The time has come to tell you
everything about the tournament.

11
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:47,900
The winner of the qualifier for group B,

12
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,800
which will be Teruasa Oda or Akira Mori,

13
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:54,934
will fight the winners of groups A and C.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Whoever is victorious

15
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:00,667
will get their hands on 49 keys.

16
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:06,133
As I mentioned before,
the winner will get a special prize.

17
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,867
The chance to go up against Our Guide.

18
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:11,967
If you can beat him,

19
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,500
including the keys in our possession,

20
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:19,033
you will win a grand total of 99 keys.

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,000
So even if we win,
we'll be killed if The Guide beats us.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,667
So we will all be slaughtered in the end.

23
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:29,066
The chance to fight The Guide
is an honor itself.

24
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,600
Bullshit! I'm not doing this!

25
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:35,166
Do you want to die right here, right now?

26
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,166
Teruasa.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,200
What does this mean?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,033
Was this whole thing set up by you?

29
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,467
We will speak alone, Teruasa.

30
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:07,667
This time tomorrow, we'll all be dead.

31
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,433
Listen, we have to get off this island.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
How?

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,166
It's an uninhabited island.

34
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,967
If we can get across the sea somehow…

35
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,066
It's pointless.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,533
Gungnir's troops will be waiting
to attack us from the shore.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,533
The chance of making it
out of here safely is 0%.

38
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,367
This all started
on that day thirteen years ago.

39
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,800
INORU HOSHIN
ARCHAEOLOGIST

40
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:59,567
It's a true pleasure to meet you,

41
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,433
the famous Oda Group chairman.

42
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,433
How did you come to know that
I have a devil key in my possession?

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,200
I believe that those
chosen to be key owners

44
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:16,367
have a certain mission to fulfill.

45
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:20,333
I have been searching for someone
who can share that mission.

46
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,400
A mission?

47
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:29,433
To save the world.

48
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:36,734
This is my plan,
and all the information on the keys.

49
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:45,100
I'd be extremely grateful for your help.

50
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,066
At first, I thought it was
just some unrealistic fantasy.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,567
But now I believe that
by using the key's power,

52
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,867
a creation beyond human comprehension,

53
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:02,133
we can change the world.

54
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,834
His claims were remarkably similar

55
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,967
to my fears about the state of the world.

56
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,800
The moment I learned of his plans,

57
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,233
I felt a ray of light in my heart.

58
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,567
Eventually, I joined Hoshin,

59
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,300
disappeared by faking my own death,

60
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,600
-and founded Gungnir.
-Dad! Dad!

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,400
Desire is what leads humans into conflict.

62
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,033
We live in an absurd world.

63
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,734
I will bring an end to it,

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,033
and create a new order.

65
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,600
A new order?

66
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,533
I will remold this world

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
into a better one.

68
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:01,367
What gives you the right to do that?

69
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,667
It's not my right.

70
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,166
It is my moral duty.

71
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,367
Moral duty?

72
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,567
How can you say that?

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,934
Even if we need to halve
the world's population,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,967
we will see the plan through to the end.

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,533
Father.

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,200
Should you be concerned
about other people at a time like this?

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,734
You need to focus

78
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,667
on tomorrow's tournament final.

79
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,000
How can you be so calm?

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,533
If I lose,

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll be killed.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Teruasa…

83
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,934
As my son…

84
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,600
Prove to me that you
can emerge victorious.

85
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,867
Teruasa?

86
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,133
Senya.

87
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,300
You're a wreck.

88
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,667
What a waste of a pretty face.

89
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,166
I don't know…

90
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
what to fight for anymore.

91
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
Terurin,

92
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,400
since the day we lost our families,

93
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,133
we've both been living
with a hole in our hearts.

94
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,400
All of the fun,

95
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,600
happiness,

96
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,367
and joy in my life slipped away from me.

97
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,100
But when I met you…

98
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,767
I felt the ache in my heart
beginning to mend.

99
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,533
It makes me laugh.

100
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,500
Everyone's been worried,

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,433
searching for you all night.

102
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,300
Even though their own lives
are about to be snuffed out.

103
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,266
Terurin…

104
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,166
Our game isn't over yet.

105
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,533
There's still something we can do.

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Shall we?

107
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,867
Here we are!

108
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:14,367
Ta-da.

109
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,800
Teruasa.

110
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,266
Teruasa!

111
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,600
Wow.

112
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,233
Thank goodness you're okay.

113
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,467
I'm sorry for worrying you all.

114
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,100
You can say that again.

115
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,600
Yuki was crying like crazy.

116
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,233
It's true!

117
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,667
Well, never mind!

118
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,266
Terurin is filled with remorse.

119
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,667
He'll fight extra hard today
to make up for it.

120
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,367
Fight? You mean the final round?

121
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,100
I have something
I need to discuss with you.

122
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,433
I'll get loads of views with this.

123
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:50,867
You're too cute. My view count
is gonna go through the roof.

124
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,867
Let's make some money.

125
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,166
I'm gonna be rich.

126
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,467
So you're saying
there's a way out of this mess?

127
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,800
Yes.

128
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,567
But I need your help.

129
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,400
What do you think? Will you join me?

130
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Everything is ready.

131
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,433
As soon as the winner is decided,
we'll launch an attack on the G20 summit.

132
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:41,367
A grand display of gunfire
that will shake the whole world.

133
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,266
What? Has something happened?

134
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,834
The network's dropped.
International communications are down.

135
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,800
Did something happen to the radio tower?

136
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,900
Is it sealed off
by the creation of an enclosed space?

137
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,500
An enclosed space?

138
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,333
Who would do that?

139
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,467
Guide!

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
I will crush

141
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,767
all of your ambitions.

142
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,300
I've been watching humans
since the beginning of time,

143
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:31,900
but it's the first time
I've seen them do anything this peculiar.

144
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,000
This whole island has been
turned into an enclosed space.

145
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:41,367
I want you to play ACMA:GAME and use
the whole island for the enclosed space.

146
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,333
If the island is shut off,

147
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,500
Gungnir can't attack,
and we can avoid playing the final.

148
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,400
It'll keep your family safe too.

149
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:55,700
Let's do it.

150
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,734
I don't want my family in any more danger.

151
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,567
I have one more request.

152
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,867
When you create the enclosed space,

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,033
make sure that only
The Guide's room is left unsealed.

154
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:11,533
Shogi players have
exceptional spatial awareness.

155
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,834
You're the only one

156
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
who can do it.

157
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,333
Seems you were right.

158
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,700
The radio tower is in an enclosed space.

159
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,467
This means we can't
give the order to attack G20.

160
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,300
Let's settle this one-on-one.

161
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,834
Of course.

162
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,834
This must be the only area
excluded from the enclosed space.

163
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,700
This is our fate, as father and son.

164
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,100
I accept.

165
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,700
I'll let you fight me.

166
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,200
Show yourself, Gado.

167
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,066
I am Gado, master of this game.

168
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:17,367
Let's see how pride and greed clash
as they come together.

169
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,867
The players are Teruasa Oda

170
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,734
and Seiji Oda,

171
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,133
or rather, The Guide, correct?

172
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:28,934
Yes.

173
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,900
Exactly as you say.

174
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,300
What's so funny?

175
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,033
Devils have an insatiable appetite
for family quarrels driven by desire.

176
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,367
I'm expecting a fierce showdown
between father and son.

177
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,100
The flames of desire ignite conflict.

178
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,433
That's why, no matter how much
luck you have, you shouldn't be greedy.

179
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,700
Greed is a dangerous thing.

180
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,133
Teruasa Oda, what do you demand?

181
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
The total destruction of Gungnir.

182
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,433
Guide, what is your demand?

183
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,633
I want Oda Teruasa
to say farewell to his past.

184
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,233
Farewell to his past?

185
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,800
What does he mean?

186
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,734
Very good!

187
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,000
Swear your oaths.

188
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,600
I will fight for my desires.

189
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,700
I will triumph for my desires.

190
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:36,300
-I swear on the devil.
-I swear on the devil.

191
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,934
Oaths accepted.

192
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:41,300
Let the game begin!

193
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,867
"Word Investigation."

194
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,166
"Word Investigation."

195
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,333
Let me tell you the rules.

196
00:14:56,066 --> 00:15:00,600
Each player thinks of three words.

197
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,734
The words must be tangible nouns

198
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,300
that are known to both players.

199
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:10,467
The point of the game
is to guess your opponent's words.

200
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
It is a turn-based game.

201
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,900
When it is your turn,

202
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,900
you either ask a question,
or make a guess.

203
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:22,700
They must only be yes or no questions.

204
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,033
YES - NO

205
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,967
I will then go through
the three words one by one,

206
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,633
confirming whether the answer is
either "yes," or "no."

207
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:34,100
If the answer is not clear,
I will answer with "unknown."

208
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,800
If you prefer to make a guess,

209
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:40,433
you must say the exact word
the opponent decided on.

210
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,700
The player who guesses all
three of his opponent's words correctly

211
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,633
is the winner of the game!

212
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,834
Furthermore, in Word Investigation,

213
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,800
the players can consult
with a friend by using a doll.

214
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:56,433
Naturally, it is otherwise forbidden

215
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,433
for friends to offer hints to players.

216
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,400
Now, both players

217
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:05,734
choose your three words.

218
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,333
What's wrong?

219
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,633
Did you think the Guide

220
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,667
was dying of some nasty disease?

221
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,900
It's a drug that
stimulates brain function.

222
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,533
The Guide's devil power

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,667
has taken a heavy toll on his brain.

224
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,734
It's damaged his brain?

225
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,667
Sounds like a horrible ability.

226
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:36,734
OROCHI?

227
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,533
I can't analyze the emotion
on The Guide's face.

228
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,734
Write your words on the stone slabs.

229
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,900
As usual, he works quickly.

230
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,600
The Guide is abnormally intelligent.

231
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:13,166
I need to think of words we both know,
but are difficult to guess.

232
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,400
Know what this is?
It's called a "bread clip."

233
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,934
Heard of it?

234
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,934
I'll go with that for the first word.

235
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,967
As for the last two…

236
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,400
Teruasa,

237
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,800
shall we make a separate bet?

238
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,900
A bet?

239
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,934
If I get a correct guess,

240
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,433
you give me your earring.

241
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,233
Fine.

242
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:59,500
What do you want from me?

243
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,834
I don't need anything.

244
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,000
With that, let Word Investigation begin!

245
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,734
First, Teruasa Oda,

246
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,467
declare whether you wish to
ask a question, or make a guess.

247
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,600
I'll ask a question.

248
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,300
He chose question first.

249
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,533
The Guide and Teruasa must know
a huge amount of the same words.

250
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:29,700
They both need to narrow it down somehow.

251
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,867
There are two types of questions.

252
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,967
Broad category questions,

253
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,333
and smaller questions,
limited to something specific.

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,767
Both types of question are important.

255
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,900
First, I should find the broad category,

256
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,333
and then narrow it down.

257
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,934
Here's my question.

258
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
Is it a living thing?

259
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,700
The answers are…

260
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,467
NO - NO - NO

261
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,000
All answers are, "no".

262
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,133
Okay. Good start.

263
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,633
It's a good thing
all three had the same answer.

264
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,934
If it was a mix of "yes" and "no,"

265
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,166
it would be hard to narrow down
with the next question.

266
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,200
Next it's The Guide's turn.

267
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,433
Question.

268
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,300
Is it a living thing?

269
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,533
I knew he'd ask the same thing.

270
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,500
By asking the same question,
he doesn't give anything away.

271
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
But…

272
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,467
The answers are…

273
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,066
YES - YES - NO

274
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,800
The answer is "yes,"
for the blue and red stone slabs.

275
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,834
But the answer is "no,"
for the white slab.

276
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,800
You did it. A split answer.

277
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,934
It's only a marginal difference,

278
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,300
but Teruasa Oda has the upper hand.

279
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,367
Next it's Teruasa Oda's turn.

280
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:51,834
None of words written on the stone slabs

281
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,600
are living things.

282
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,900
I can exclude people, animals, and plants.

283
00:19:56,967 --> 00:20:01,033
But that changes if it's used for cooking.

284
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,367
Like beef, for example,

285
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
or pork,

286
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,433
or tuna, when it's used for sashimi.

287
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:10,000
Surely they aren't living things either.

288
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,433
I'll ask a question.

289
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,000
As far as I would know,

290
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,867
is it something people eat?

291
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:22,734
The answers are…

292
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,967
"Yes," for green and black,
but "no," for yellow.

293
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,166
A split answer.

294
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,734
The green and black words
can be eaten, but are not living things.

295
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,066
The yellow one can't be eaten,
and isn't a living thing.

296
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,867
The Guide knows that

297
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,100
the red and blue are living things,

298
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,467
but the white isn't.

299
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,533
How is he going to attack?

300
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,667
A living thing.

301
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,500
An animal, plant, human.

302
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,700
But it's not likely to be a person.

303
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:01,000
Someone you both know
would be too easy to narrow down.

304
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:06,333
Unless he was bold enough
to choose that on purpose?

305
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,667
The Guide's turn.

306
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,834
Are the red and blue words people?

307
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,834
You haven't changed, Teruasa.

308
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,567
Ever since you were a child,
when you have something to hide,

309
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,467
you always pull that face.

310
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,233
Question.

311
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,500
Are they people?

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,367
The answers are…

313
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:48,200
red and blue, "yes." White, "no."

314
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,300
Deary me,

315
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,433
he's totally seen through him.

316
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,433
I'd expect nothing less.

317
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:02,367
Players are allowed
to ask each other questions directly.

318
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:06,266
You let your guard down, Teruasa.

319
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:11,333
This is the true strength
of The Guide, leader of Gungnir.

320
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,734
Forget that.
This is not the time to be weak.

321
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,166
First I'll narrow down the question.

322
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,700
A question that applies
to all three words.

323
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:25,367
Humans tend to only pay attention
to things that relate to their own lives.

324
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:27,066
Time to verify that notion.

325
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Question.

326
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,266
Do they exist

327
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,433
within Japan?

328
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,633
The answers are…

329
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
"yes," for all three.

330
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,333
That question really paid off.

331
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,033
He's ruled out loads of options.

332
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,433
The Guide's turn next.

333
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,667
Question.

334
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,433
Is it something Teruasa
has touched before?

335
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,433
The answers are…

336
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,834
"yes," for all.

337
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,300
Shit, he's good at this.

338
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:12,066
The red and blue are living things.

339
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,433
They're people that
Teruasa Oda has touched.

340
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,100
The white is also something
Teruasa has touched.

341
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,600
The Guide should try to
figure out the white one first.

342
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,066
Teruasa Oda, it's your turn.

343
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:30,100
Is it generally sold for less
than 10,000 yen in Japan?

344
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:36,100
Green and Yellow are, "yes."
Black is, "no."

345
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,467
Is it something I've eaten?

346
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,333
All are, "no."

347
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:47,734
Is it available in Japan
for less than 1,000 yen?

348
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,567
"Yes," for all.

349
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,367
Does it fit inside a cube
with sides one meter long?

350
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,533
"Yes," for all.

351
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,200
Is it a tool?

352
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,633
Green, "no,"

353
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,834
yellow, "unknown," black, "no."

354
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,767
Does it fit in a cube
with sides 10 cm long?

355
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,834
Red, "no," blue, "no," white, "yes."

356
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,567
We have a lot of information to go on.

357
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:20,033
First, the green is something
you can eat for under 1,000 yen.

358
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,300
It's most likely a food item.

359
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,433
The yellow is under 1,000 yen,

360
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,133
but you can't eat it,

361
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,633
and the answer for whether
it's a tool is, "unknown."

362
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,467
But what does that even mean?

363
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,166
Something that exists within nature?

364
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,633
A natural object?

365
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,300
A natural object?

366
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,600
Yeah.

367
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,467
For example, trees
can be sold as firewood.

368
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,667
So it's not originally a tool,
but it can be used as one.

369
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:45,967
So the answer is "unknown."

370
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,767
Yeah, that seems a likely scenario.

371
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,033
But the information we have
on the black one is strange.

372
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,467
You can eat it,

373
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:57,066
and it's not sold for under 10,000 yen,

374
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,667
but you can get it
for less than 1,000 yen.

375
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,867
The important word is, "generally."

376
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,867
It's not generally sold,

377
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,400
but if you want to, you can
get it for less than 1,000 yen.

378
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,233
That's it…

379
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,767
Perhaps a specially prepared food…

380
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,233
Question.

381
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,667
Did it exist on Earth

382
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,333
before mankind?

383
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,200
That's a good question.

384
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,533
Yes. Typical Terurin.

385
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,166
What do you mean?

386
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,934
If the answer to green is "yes,"

387
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,834
he can rule out prepared meals
and processed food.

388
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
If yellow is "yes,"

389
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,967
he can confirm that it's a natural object.

390
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:44,500
Right, Ui?

391
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,667
Yes.

392
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,667
It also helps with the black.

393
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,100
Since it's something edible,

394
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,533
it'll be useful to know
if it was around before mankind.

395
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,500
Now for the answers.

396
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,166
Green, "yes," yellow, "yes,"
and black, "no."

397
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,767
Yes. Exactly what we wanted.

398
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,867
The green is a natural food,

399
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,333
the yellow is a natural object,

400
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,066
and the black
is an artificial food, right?

401
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,667
Looks like it.

402
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:12,633
Getting closer.

403
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,467
Teruasa, you can do it.

404
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,433
I've narrowed most of it down.

405
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
But I'm still at a disadvantage.

406
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,734
The Guide discovered that
the red and blue answers are people.

407
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,533
Now what?

408
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,967
Will he chase after the white?

409
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,033
NOT A LIVING THING - NOT HUMAN

410
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,500
TERUASA HAS TOUCHED IT
THE GUIDE HASN'T EATEN IT

411
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:34,767
FITS INTO A 1 METER
AND A 10 CENTIMETER CUBE

412
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,367
Guide, your turn.

413
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:37,967
Question.

414
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,767
Is it a tool?

415
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,600
The answers are…

416
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:47,767
red "no," blue, "no," yellow, "yes".

417
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,834
He still can't identify them.

418
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,233
It's going to be difficult now.

419
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,100
Teruasa Oda, it's your turn.

420
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,934
It's also getting harder for me.

421
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,767
What should I ask?

422
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,967
Gado, I want to use a doll.

423
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,700
Understood.

424
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:21,767
Senya.

425
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,066
Do you remember
the promise you made to me?

426
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,467
Promise?

427
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,533
I have three favors.

428
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,266
I can ask for anything I want.

429
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,133
As for my final request,

430
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,734
I'll save it until later for fun.

431
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:36,633
Here's my request.

432
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:38,834
Let me play one turn?

433
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,567
What are your chances of success?

434
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,200
Well…

435
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,533
Yukky and Yukarin said

436
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,400
it'll never work.

437
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,767
Let me hear it.

438
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:55,633
I've fought against
superior people countless times.

439
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,867
They have a bad habit.

440
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,834
They want to win
by pulling off an astounding victory.

441
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,166
The most amazing victories

442
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:07,667
use methods an ordinary person
would never try.

443
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,000
Maybe that's what The Guide is after?

444
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,967
Terurin, that's my third demand.

445
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,066
Okay.

446
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,633
Question.

447
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,533
Is it within this enclosed space?

448
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,500
The answers are…

449
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,934
all "yes."

450
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,033
You did it!

451
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,033
What a painful blow.

452
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
We've gotta win now.

453
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,033
The Guide's words
are all things in this room.

454
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,934
He's totally cornered.

455
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,667
In the end, Senya is the key player.

456
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:06,433
Write your words on the stone slabs.

457
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,233
Teruasa,

458
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,867
one of your answers

459
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,900
relates to an exchange
you had with Senya Uesugi.

460
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:20,200
He told you a word
that you didn't know before.

461
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,767
You thought it would be more difficult…

462
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:28,967
for me to guess such a word.

463
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
But…

464
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:34,734
I'm afraid you were wrong.

465
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,600
Unleash my power.

466
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,567
Falcon Kujo.

467
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,767
FALCON KUJO

468
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:49,934
What's this?

469
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,300
This is so cool.

470
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:57,233
I'll make a guess.

471
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,734
The word on the white stone slab is…

472
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,533
"bread clip".

473
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,600
The answer is…

474
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:08,834
BREAD CLIP

475
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,600
Correct!

476
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:14,266
You're kidding.

477
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,266
He traced my memory

478
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,600
and found the answer.

479
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Your memory?

480
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,734
Isn't that cheating?

481
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,000
He's a monster.

482
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,333
So, Teruasa…

483
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:35,033
Just as we agreed, I'll take that earring.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,767
You always wear those earrings.

485
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,800
That's right. They're my special ones.

486
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,567
They're the first ever gift
your father gave to me.

487
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,667
What was that for? They were Mom's－

488
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:03,767
It's like I said!

489
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:09,200
Saying farewell to your past
means destroying who you were before.

490
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:16,333
If I guess the next one correctly,
I want your watch.

491
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,967
POUR TO LIMIT

492
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,867
As I have said many times,

493
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,934
if you spill even one
drop of water, you lose.

494
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,333
What an honor it is.

495
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:37,567
To think I get to play ACMA:GAME
against Dragon King Mori.

496
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,367
He's only playing with you to buy time.

497
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,433
Quiet.

498
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,367
Mori, it's your turn next.

499
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,333
-Akira!
-Are you okay?

500
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,066
Yes.

501
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,100
I didn't know it would be this difficult

502
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
to create a specific enclosed space.

503
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:06,000
But I have to keep the game going
as long as possible.

504
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:07,367
Every second counts.

505
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,367
Wait.

506
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:21,834
Are you deliberately stalling
to stop the game from finishing?

507
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,100
How impertinent.

508
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,300
Our secret's out.

509
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,033
Let me just say this.

510
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,967
In the event that a player dies,

511
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:34,834
the enclosed space
will remain closed for eternity.

512
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,934
Keep calm, Teruasa.

513
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,033
He's only guessed one correctly.

514
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,934
I need to make a guess too.

515
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,600
I know the most about the yellow one.

516
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:54,166
It's not a living thing,

517
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,233
it can't be eaten,

518
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,333
you can get it for under 1,000 yen.

519
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,400
I don't know whether it's a tool.

520
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,633
It existed on Earth before mankind.

521
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:09,200
It's a natural object
that is definitely in this room.

522
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:12,367
The obvious ones

523
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,867
would be stone or wood.

524
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,367
That must be it…

525
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,233
I'll make a guess.

526
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,500
The word on the yellow stone slab is…

527
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,467
stone.

528
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:36,834
Now for the answer…

529
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,567
STONE

530
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,600
Correct!

531
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,166
-We've caught up!
-That was amazing, Teruasa.

532
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,166
But how did he know?

533
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,367
Don't ask me.

534
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,166
But I'm still the one who's cornered.

535
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,567
He's already narrowed down
the red and blue a lot.

536
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,300
The red and blue are living things.

537
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:04,166
They're both people
that Teruasa has touched.

538
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:06,767
But wait.

539
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,800
The fact that it's a living thing…

540
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,934
Here's my question.

541
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,033
-I got that information…
-Is it a living thing?

542
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
…by copying Teruasa's first question.

543
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:17,867
What if

544
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,333
that was a trap from the very beginning?

545
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:25,900
Here's my question.

546
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,834
Are the red and blue words

547
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,633
someone who is currently dead,

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,633
a person who no longer exists?

549
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,533
The answers are…

550
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,800
"yes," for both red and blue.

551
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,934
Just as I suspected.

552
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
That can't be.

553
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,400
The red and blue are living things.

554
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,367
How does that work?

555
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:55,834
If we're talking about right now,
the dead are no longer living.

556
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,133
But they were living things once.

557
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,700
Teruasa,

558
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,567
your answer recognizes the dead
as "living things."

559
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:11,166
You misled me into thinking
of someone who is alive, just as I am now.

560
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,300
He's seen through my plan.

561
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,567
There's no time to waste.

562
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,400
I have to guess the green or black.

563
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,700
NATURAL FOOD
ARTIFICIAL FOOD

564
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,700
The green and black can both be eaten.

565
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,400
They're in this room.

566
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,266
Have any of you got anything edible?

567
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,767
Just candy.

568
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,667
I don't know about the black,

569
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,133
but the green is something
that existed before mankind,

570
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,200
so it can't be candy.

571
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,900
Earlier, I guessed stone rather than wood

572
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,133
because of something Senya said to me.

573
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
They have a bad habit.

574
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,233
They want to win
by pulling off an astounding victory.

575
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,400
This room is full
of stuff made from stone.

576
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,700
The Guide was daring enough
to pick something obvious.

577
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,433
So perhaps he did the same for the green.

578
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,433
Have I overlooked something?

579
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,734
Something else edible in this room?

580
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:13,667
It can't be a human.

581
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,834
Beef?

582
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,934
What you looking at?

583
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,433
Surely not…

584
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Teruasa Oda,

585
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
are you thinking of something wicked?

586
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,600
That's it.

587
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,033
It's an edible meat
that has existed since before mankind,

588
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,033
and something that humans have now.

589
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,066
A cut of meat, or organs.

590
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,567
Tongue, liver, the neck, or heart.

591
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,600
There are endless edible
body parts and organs.

592
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,867
Which word would he pick
to show off the most?

593
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:47,800
Think.

594
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:54,367
95% of Egypt is desert land.

595
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:59,000
Back then, people called him
the "beating heart of Oda Group."

596
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm going to guess.

597
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,533
The green word is…

598
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:09,633
heart.

599
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:11,934
The answer is…

600
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,934
HEART

601
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,266
…correct!

602
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,033
Finally! Teruasa's in the lead!

603
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Way to go!

604
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,934
Guide, it's your turn next.

605
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,900
I'll make a guess.

606
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,033
The red stone slab

607
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,066
is Reika Oda.

608
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,166
The answer is…

609
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,967
REIKA ODA

610
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,367
…correct!

611
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:47,066
When I think about the dead,

612
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,867
your mother is the first person
that comes to mind.

613
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:54,633
Teruasa,

614
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,567
hand over the watch.

615
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,367
This is something I used long ago.

616
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:21,700
Being attached to the past
is a sign of weakness.

617
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,233
Like me, you must abandon your past.

618
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Why do you care what I do?

619
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,033
You left me when you faked your own death.

620
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,033
You abandoned me.

621
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:36,633
No…

622
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,633
I've always been
watching over you from afar.

623
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,867
I believed that one day

624
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,667
you would come back to me.

625
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,433
I love you.

626
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,900
You are broken, after all.

627
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,300
This world is broken.

628
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,767
Two questions correct on both sides.

629
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:11,667
The person who
figures out the last one wins.

630
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,066
Very entertaining.

631
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,967
Now we're getting to
the heart and soul of ACMA:GAME.

632
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,333
Victory hasn't been decided yet,

633
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,200
and I'm going to win.

634
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,333
Let me tell you something.

635
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,900
I already have an idea

636
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,200
what the last answer is.

637
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:43,066
How long are you going to
keep up this charade?

638
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:45,100
Date, your turn.

639
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,200
Dragon King Mori,

640
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,600
I have a great deal of respect for you.

641
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:56,000
To maintain a huge but
delicately designed enclosed space

642
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,800
takes a huge amount of willpower.

643
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,367
What are you doing?

644
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,767
You've decided to finish the game?

645
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:11,767
The winner of Pour to Limit is Akira Mori,

646
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,200
and the game now comes to a close.

647
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,266
Wait! No!

648
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,500
A debt to be paid.

649
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Date,

650
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,734
what are you trying to do?

651
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,600
A genius like you doesn't know?

652
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:31,667
I just

653
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,800
want to observe human nature.

654
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Asai,

655
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,900
you and I need to start
playing ACMA:GAME right now.

656
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,433
I need to create another enclosed space.

657
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:49,800
Akira!

658
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:50,867
Dragon King!

659
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:55,367
You pushed yourself too far.

660
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,367
You don't have the strength
to make another enclosed space.

661
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:04,033
Dragon King!

662
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,200
Akira, Akira!

663
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:11,000
The enclosed space created by Mori
has been terminated.

664
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,967
No way.

665
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,200
What good news.

666
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,834
Now when The Guide wins,

667
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,600
we can attack G20.

668
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,000
The Guide will definitely guess next time.

669
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,967
If Terurin is going to win,

670
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,567
he's gotta do it now.

671
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,900
The black stone slate
is the only one left.

672
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,467
OROCHI.

673
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:40,400
The information we have so far,
is that it's not living,

674
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,600
it can be eaten,

675
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,734
it can't be sold for under 10,000 yen,

676
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,133
but you can get it for 1,000 yen.

677
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,767
It's not a tool,

678
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:52,400
and it didn't exist
on Earth before mankind.

679
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:55,100
It's inside this enclosed space.

680
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:59,333
But what can be edible in here
and fit all those conditions?

681
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,867
Teruasa Oda, your turn.

682
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,500
Gado, I want to use a doll.

683
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,533
Understood.

684
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,667
Yuki.

685
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:21,767
Why me?

686
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,667
You have a weird way of helping me relax.

687
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,667
Plus, calm analytical skills
are something I'm lacking.

688
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:34,934
I see.

689
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:39,500
So,

690
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,000
a cheap piece of candy
sold for less than 1,000 yen

691
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,266
might be worth much more
if owned by someone like Yukari.

692
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:53,900
I'm sorry, that's all I can think of.

693
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:01,734
No,

694
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:04,700
that's a good approach.

695
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:09,300
Back then, we got Mog Chocolate
sent to our house from the factory.

696
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:14,533
You wouldn't exactly
say that it was sold to us,

697
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,633
but we could get hold of it
for less than 1,000 yen.

698
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:21,734
Yum, Mog Chocolate.

699
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,400
Yes, please.

700
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,667
Dad! Don't gobble that much!

701
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,600
If he wants to put on a show
with an incredible victory,

702
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,300
he'd pick a word close to my heart.

703
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:45,533
That's if he still remembers

704
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,467
things that make me happy.

705
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:53,967
Thank you.

706
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,100
I want to make a guess.

707
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:03,633
The word on the black stone slab is…

708
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:06,400
mogmog chocolate.

709
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,567
The answer is…

710
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,400
incorrect!

711
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,033
Hang on!

712
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:30,033
Shit! What should we do?

713
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,400
I can hear it.

714
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:36,633
The cries of your screaming hearts.

715
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,633
All of your hopes are devastated.

716
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,433
Game over is nearly here.

717
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:49,834
Teruasa,

718
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,533
accept your fate.

719
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,633
Teruasa Oda.

720
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,734
You're in a tight spot.

721
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:07,567
Guide, it's your turn.

722
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:16,133
NEXT EPISODE

723
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,000
THE FINAL CHAPTER

724
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:21,333
Thank you for fighting with me.

725
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,100
We followed you because
we knew we wouldn't regret

726
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,567
whatever outcome you achieved.

727
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:26,934
Let's restore this world together.

728
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,400
Look out!
