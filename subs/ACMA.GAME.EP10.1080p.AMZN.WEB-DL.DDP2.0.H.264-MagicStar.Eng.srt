1
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:05,066
I am Gado.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,633
By collecting 99 keys,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,000
Gungnir plans to take over the world.

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,033
The one fighting against Gungnir
and all that they stand for,

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,166
is none other than
The Guide's son, Teruasa Oda.

6
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,700
With all of his friends' lives
depending on it,

7
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,567
the final battle continues.

8
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,633
The foolish humans

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,967
struggle and suffer,

10
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,433
shedding tears of blood.

11
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,667
Teruasa, accept your fate.

12
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,066
Teruasa Oda, Guide,

13
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,433
you both have one word left.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,133
The blue word is something that fits
into a cube with sides one meter long.

15
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,633
It's a person,

16
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,800
and Teruasa Oda has touched it.

17
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,700
The person is deceased.

18
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:17,767
The black word

19
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,000
is edible,

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,667
and is in this room.

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,533
It is not a living thing.

22
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,934
It did not exist
before the birth of mankind.

23
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,166
It is not a tool.

24
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,600
It's possible to get it
for less than 1,000 yen.

25
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,433
The Guide still has three chances
to consult with a friend.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,867
Teruasa Oda can only consult
with a friend once more.

27
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,200
If The Guide guesses correctly this turn,

28
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,066
he will be the winner.

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,667
I'm out of time.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,567
Forget a counterattack.
If he guesses correctly now, I've lost.

31
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,200
If that happens…

32
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:59,367
All eight of us who participated
in the tournament will be killed.

33
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,000
The only way to save everyone

34
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,200
is for Teruasa to win the game.

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,166
And as soon as the game ends,

36
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,333
they're going to attack
the G20 summit venue.

37
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,767
If we let that happen,
the world will fall into chaos.

38
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,400
And a huge number of people
will lose their lives.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,100
All of that pressure
on Terurin's shoulders…

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,333
Don't give up!

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,767
You have fought very bravely.

42
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,200
I am proud of you.

43
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,900
Keep your opinions to yourself.

44
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,400
I had respect for you when I was a child.

45
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:45,934
But now…

46
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,967
I feel sorry for you,
clinging pathetically to the keys.

47
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:54,367
I will use the keys to create a society
free from conflict, and save thousands.

48
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,433
You're wrong!

49
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,266
The keys are just instruments
from which desire is born.

50
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,767
Something like that
can't be used to save anyone.

51
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,900
Wasn't it you who said we should
save people from their desires?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,066
Have you forgotten?

53
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
When you first showed me the key…

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,100
It's desire that can never be satisfied.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,667
The flames of desire ignite conflict.

56
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,033
It's written in history.

57
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,166
That's why, no matter how much
luck you have, you shouldn't be greedy.

58
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,834
You mustn't obsess
over getting what you want.

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Try to become someone who can save those

60
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,800
who become consumed by desire.

61
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,834
I wanted to become like you.

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,166
That's why after you were gone,

63
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,233
I always tried to
follow in your footsteps.

64
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,600
Even when I got caught up
in the civil war in Africa,

65
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,667
or when I escaped with
captives in South America,

66
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,900
I thought desperately,
"What would you do?"

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Trying my best to save those around me.

68
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,834
That's why Teruasa

69
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,000
tried to save Maruko.

70
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,834
Will you quit?

71
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,700
It's foolish to risk your life
dancing with the devil.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
That's not the only time.

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,467
When he fought Hyodo…

74
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,600
What you really want

75
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,333
is to be in the spotlight again.

76
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,900
If that's so, then you don't need the key.

77
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,300
You can achieve it by effort alone.

78
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,300
Don't give in to desire!

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
I see.

80
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,033
Terurin got his excessive sense of justice

81
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,066
from his dad?

82
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,233
Whatever danger awaits,

83
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,166
I will crush Gungnir's ambitions.

84
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:52,633
That's what saved me too.

85
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,266
You're a tough player.

86
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:00,467
The power to win was already in you.

87
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,533
Don't you remember what you said to me

88
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,967
that night we went camping?

89
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,100
I remember very well, even now.

90
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,934
Then what is all this for?

91
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,300
You're going to kill a lot of people.

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,433
Then let me ask you.

93
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,900
Do you think you are innocent?

94
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,333
You also took a life
when you first played ACMA:GAME.

95
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,867
I knew that man too.

96
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,967
That man

97
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,300
had his life taken by Gado.

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,133
Deceased.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,266
I want to make a guess.

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,633
Then, Guide, go ahead.

101
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,066
The correct answer is

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,834
the head of the Maruko family,

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,700
Mitsuhide Maruko.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,533
If I lose, you can kill me on the spot.

105
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:18,934
I accept your guess.

106
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,467
The answer is…

107
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,867
INCORRECT

108
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,500
…incorrect!

109
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,300
The Guide was wrong?

110
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,467
Maruko's name came to mind first.

111
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,834
But that's not what I wrote.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,967
I knew that was a name
you'd reach eventually.

113
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,066
He's not invincible after all.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,834
One more chance.

115
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,133
Guide, why not use a doll?

116
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,367
I don't need to.

117
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,266
-But--
-Don't overstep.

118
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,100
Forgive me.

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Now's my chance to counterattack.

120
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,834
It won't open!

121
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,633
It must be an enclosed space.

122
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,300
Can Oda stop The Guide alone?

123
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
I'd rather he doesn't.

124
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,667
If The Guide wins,
everyone's going to die!

125
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:37,000
But it will shake up the world.

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,900
It's going to be a historical moment.

127
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,967
Isn't it exciting?

128
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,200
Ouch.

129
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,900
Pain is proof you're alive.

130
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,734
You should be thankful.

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Oda,

132
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,767
we're counting on you.

133
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,100
Then it's your turn,

134
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,533
Teruasa Oda.

135
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,700
Choose whether to ask a question
or make a guess.

136
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,767
Okay.

137
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,467
The black word

138
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,633
is something that
didn't exist before mankind,

139
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,033
so it must be a food created by humans.

140
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,633
And you can get it
for less than 1,000 yen,

141
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,400
and it's in this room.

142
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,200
There's one thing in this room
that fits those conditions.

143
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,367
But I can't be 100% sure.

144
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,967
Should I consult with Ui and the others?

145
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,567
Or save my last doll,
and make my own guess?

146
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,533
What should I do?

147
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,333
By the way,

148
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:45,800
I came here to play the game,
but also to separate you from your past.

149
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,367
First, you lost a memory of your mother.

150
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,567
Next, a memory of me.

151
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,934
If there is anything
worthy of a final farewell,

152
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,233
what better than…

153
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,233
the lives of your friends.

154
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
All of them

155
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,100
risked their lives to be here.

156
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,867
I just need to win.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,533
Gado, I want to make a guess.

158
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,633
Then, let's hear it.

159
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,667
The black stone slab is

160
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,333
herbal tea.

161
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,233
The answer is…

162
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,700
incorrect!

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,667
No.

164
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,233
I was wrong.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,200
What a pity to fail
at such a critical moment.

166
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,100
Then the turn goes to the other player.

167
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,467
Guide, choose whether to answer or guess.

168
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,767
Do you feel as though
you've been pushed into an abyss?

169
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,133
How are you going to get out?

170
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,500
Or maybe better to give up.

171
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,500
Even in an abyss,

172
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,867
miracles can happen.

173
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
As long as you don't give up,

174
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,367
there is always a ray of light.

175
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,300
Miracles?

176
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I too believed in such things long ago.

177
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,734
To restore this filthy world,

178
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,200
first, I hunted down the key owners.

179
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,166
Instead of fighting,
I asked for cooperation.

180
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,166
I taught them how to use the keys,

181
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,033
and persuaded them to join me.

182
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,166
But…

183
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,433
once they realized the power of the keys,

184
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,500
they were consumed by desire,
and began to fight.

185
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,934
Not only that, but I became
the target of their desires.

186
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,433
They wanted my company's fortune
and management rights,

187
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,967
and even my family's lives.

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,100
So your death…

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,767
Chairman Oda!

190
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,233
Dad! Dad!

191
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,867
That's why

192
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:50,667
I decided to end my life as Seiji Oda.

193
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,433
After that, I tried to find people
to join me, by searching for key owners,

194
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,100
but there was not a single person

195
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,467
who agreed with my noble ideals.

196
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,300
My faith in humanity dimmed,

197
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,900
and all that was left was despair.

198
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
And so I decided

199
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,066
that I would take the lead

200
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,633
and guide people in the right direction.

201
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,467
The Guide was born in that moment.

202
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,567
To prepare for a new world,

203
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,567
I brought together successful people
from different fields to create Gungnir.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
All that time…

205
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,066
you never once
considered destroying the keys?

206
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,066
Destroy them?

207
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,500
You've seen it all.

208
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,100
The ugliness the keys bring out in people.

209
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,867
You didn't think a world without the keys
would be a better place?

210
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,767
There is no point
trying to get rid of the keys.

211
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,834
What do you mean?

212
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,700
A devil's key can never be destroyed.

213
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:17,867
They can't be destroyed?

214
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,400
Exactly.

215
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,633
It is not possible
to eradicate them from this world.

216
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Even if the owner of a key dies,

217
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:32,333
the key is simply returned to us.

218
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:37,734
Then we allow the key
to fall in front of another.

219
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,633
It is done at random.

220
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,700
And so the history of conflict
repeats itself once more.

221
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,400
Teruasa, don't be fooled.

222
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,533
What?

223
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,233
Devils have long been known
for deceiving people.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,533
If you take him seriously,
he will only crush your beliefs.

225
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,633
Guide?

226
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,500
I'll ask a question.

227
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,934
What?

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
He's not making a guess?

229
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,700
That's unusually cautious for him.

230
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,100
He must be after something.

231
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,934
Is the blue word a name from the past?

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Now for the answer.

233
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,033
Yes.

234
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,233
Has he figured it out?

235
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,467
If I don't guess correctly now,
he'll win the game next turn.

236
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,100
A boat?

237
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,166
Yes.

238
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,233
Seems that Asai found a boat
around here before.

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Can we use it to get off the island?

240
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,667
No.

241
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,000
But the boat The Guide arrived on
must be somewhere.

242
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,467
They're coming this way.

243
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,233
Then the turn goes to the next player.

244
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Teruasa Oda,

245
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,066
will you guess or ask a question?

246
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,500
Teruasa.

247
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,800
Gado, I want to use a doll.

248
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,400
Good,

249
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,066
the last doll.

250
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:58,433
Are you okay?

251
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,667
You need to carry this burden alone.

252
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:06,233
You trusted your father all this time,
and now you have to fight him.

253
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,367
It must be overwhelming.

254
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,800
He'll try to use it against you
by psyching you out.

255
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,667
But, Teruasa…

256
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,934
you're not alone.

257
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,533
We might not be able to do anything,

258
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,166
but we are here by your side.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,133
Ui.

260
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,900
Do you remember this?

261
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,834
You still have it?

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,300
The wallet they stole
from me in middle school.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,633
It was you who got it back, wasn't it?

264
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:47,533
I--

265
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,467
When I saw it on my desk,

266
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,700
I was so happy.

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,533
What happened to your face?

268
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,667
Fell over in soccer.

269
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,867
I knew I had someone by my side
who was looking out for me.

270
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:06,633
That's why I've come this far.

271
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,367
This time I'm looking out for you.

272
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,166
No matter how this ends,
I have no regrets.

273
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:15,934
I'm just happy…

274
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,066
that I got to see you again.

275
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,033
Ui.

276
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,600
You've always been
an important friend to me.

277
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,500
You looked up to me,

278
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,200
thinking of me as your competition.

279
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:37,800
To tell you the truth,

280
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
I thought the same about you.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,266
So when you said you wanted to fight me,

282
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,567
I was happy.

283
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,734
I'm going to defeat you.

284
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm glad I got to see you again too.

285
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Teruasa.

286
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Yuki.

287
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,367
It's been amazing

288
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,633
to see your happy face again.

289
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,333
I owe that happiness to you.

290
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,700
You…

291
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,333
Gonna be an A.I. developer?

292
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,300
…were always smiling by our side.

293
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,166
You're so kind.

294
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,567
Ui and I

295
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,233
thought that we had to protect you.

296
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,033
But it was your kindness
that protected me.

297
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,166
Thank you.

298
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,900
Teruasa.

299
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,867
You're pleased you met me too, right?

300
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,100
Of course.

301
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:05,033
I'm a stronger person, thanks to you.

302
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,834
I know the real Yukari.

303
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,734
Your strength saved me many times.

304
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,166
-Jump!
-What?

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,834
Thank you for fighting with me.

306
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,700
You reassured me.

307
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,233
If you win, you can come and see my show.

308
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,433
I want you to see

309
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,000
how I shine on stage.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You really did

311
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,133
make this a fun ride, right to the end.

312
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,734
I've played countless guys
at gambling in my life,

313
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:52,300
but this is the first time
I've been tense just watching a game.

314
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,000
It sucks, huh?

315
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,133
I went to the trouble of betting on you,

316
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,433
and looks like you're gonna lose.

317
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,467
Senya.

318
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,100
You beat me once.

319
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,667
How wonderful it feels!

320
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,567
You were the best opponent ever.

321
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,100
Our game isn't over yet.

322
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:15,266
There's still something we can do.

323
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,767
But you're by my side now.

324
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,967
This gamble I've got to win.

325
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,500
We didn't follow you
because we thought you were going to win,

326
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,700
but because we knew we wouldn't regret

327
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,033
whatever outcome you achieved.

328
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,567
Teruasa,

329
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,600
are you still unsure?

330
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
No.

331
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,700
Now I'm confident.

332
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,266
Then go get it.

333
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Gado,

334
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I'll make a guess.

335
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,600
Please go ahead.

336
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,166
Guide,

337
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,900
you can't help but win with a flourish.

338
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,867
So the answer

339
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,633
must be something obvious.

340
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,633
Such as…

341
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,300
the liquid you injected
right in front of me.

342
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,500
The drug that stimulates brain function.

343
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:46,700
If it's a drug,

344
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,667
it's not a living thing or a tool.

345
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,533
Also, it's not usually available for sale.

346
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm sure I've heard
it costs less than 100 yen.

347
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:01,233
So it's possible to get it
for under 1,000 yen.

348
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:05,867
Since it's injected into the bloodstream,

349
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,200
it must be safe to enter the stomach.

350
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,500
In other words, it's edible.

351
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,300
The word on the black stone slate is

352
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:17,934
Theobrom.

353
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,433
I accept your guess.

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,600
The answer is…

355
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,367
THEOBROM

356
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,934
Correct.

357
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,433
He did it!

358
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,166
He got it.

359
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,333
All three! All three!

360
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,000
Now we stand a chance.

361
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,533
If The Guide misses the next one…

362
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,934
You finally realized that the drug
counted as something edible.

363
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,700
It took you even longer than I thought.

364
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,266
Guide.

365
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,333
Teruasa Oda has three correct answers,

366
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:06,033
so if you guess incorrectly,
you will lose.

367
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,166
That's not going to happen.

368
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,967
I'm certain my answer is correct.

369
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,533
Then, Guide,

370
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,266
do you want to ask a question,
or make a guess?

371
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,166
Since it took a lot to get here,
shall I use a doll before I answer?

372
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,166
You wish to consult?

373
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,333
Very good.

374
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,567
Get me a glass of water.

375
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,734
What? He's just taking a break?

376
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,734
Jeez. Why's he always gotta be so cocky?

377
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,600
Guide.

378
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I told you not to speak out of turn.

379
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,133
It's not that I don't trust you,

380
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:08,000
but we must avoid closing the path

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
to a world without conflict at all costs.

382
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:15,467
You don't care what happens to this world.

383
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,400
You just want to take my key.

384
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,233
So you'll obey me.

385
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,734
As you wish.

386
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:33,066
Someone's coming.

387
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,567
Wait, it's not what you think.

388
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:39,166
I'm Mori. Akira Mori.

389
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,033
The Dragon King Mori?

390
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,667
Are you here playing a game?

391
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,233
Yes.

392
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,100
Do you know about the tournament?

393
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,166
Yes.

394
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,934
I heard about it from Teruasa.

395
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,667
Oda?

396
00:24:56,433 --> 00:25:01,233
The Guide, or Gungnir's leader,
is planning something terrible?

397
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Yes.

398
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:09,367
The true identity of The Guide
is Teruasa Oda's father.

399
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,133
What?

400
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:17,767
Why did you change?

401
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,200
No matter how I try,

402
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,700
I can't believe you are the same man
as the Seiji Oda I knew.

403
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Why do you think the chairman
of a trading company

404
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,734
would fake his own death

405
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,867
and become obsessed
with a world free from conflict?

406
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,700
I started this because of your mother.

407
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,433
Mom?

408
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,834
It was your eleventh birthday.

409
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,367
She died in a traffic accident
when traveling in Brussels.

410
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,800
It's okay to cry if you need to.

411
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,567
I can't.

412
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,467
Mom will be sad if I cry.

413
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
But that's not the whole truth.

414
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,667
Now you're telling lies just to get to me?

415
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,400
That rainy day in Brussels,

416
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:19,133
an ambassador from
the Republic of Miravelia was targeted.

417
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,200
Your mother was killed in the attack.

418
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,967
Take cover! Move, move, move!

419
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,033
TO TERUASA
HAPPY 11TH BIRTHDAY

420
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,600
WISHING YOU A FUTURE
FILLED WITH HAPPINESS

421
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:56,433
Impossible.

422
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,166
Of course, you wouldn't know.

423
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:05,300
At the time, Japan was set to provide
several tens of billions of yen

424
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,133
in humanitarian aid
to the war-torn Republic of Miravelia.

425
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,266
At that moment…

426
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:20,667
if it came out that a Japanese citizen
had lost her life due to terrorism,

427
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,734
it would impact
the decision to provide aid.

428
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,834
And so…

429
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,033
the terrorist attack was covered up.

430
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,433
I found out

431
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,567
after I became the owner of a key.

432
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,333
It was right after
the day you and I went camping.

433
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,066
Your mother

434
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,633
was killed by a world
that continues to start ugly conflicts.

435
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,033
You must understand.

436
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,633
Originally, this tournament was for you,

437
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,000
to put your strength to the test.

438
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,867
For me?

439
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,500
It was designed to challenge you.

440
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:17,133
And so…

441
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:22,266
I put you up against
those who are closest to you.

442
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:27,066
As I hoped, you came out on top

443
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:29,133
and found your way back to me.

444
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,333
I don't believe that was chance…

445
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,300
but fate.

446
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,367
Teruasa…

447
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,333
you're ready.

448
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:47,500
Join me.

449
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,367
Let's restore this world together.

450
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:56,867
I can't do that.

451
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,734
I'm going to win this game

452
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,233
and destroy every last key.

453
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
And…

454
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,967
I'm going to rescue you
from the key's spell.

455
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,734
Looks like I have no choice
but to finish this.

456
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,600
Bring glory to Gungnir.

457
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,033
Gado, I'll make a guess.

458
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:40,667
Guide, go ahead.

459
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,967
The blue word is
a human Teruasa has touched.

460
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,967
A deceased person.

461
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,734
A name from the past.

462
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
The correct answer is…

463
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,033
Reika Oda's maiden name,

464
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,033
Reika Yamamoto.

465
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,233
I accept your guess.

466
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:06,834
The answer is…

467
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,800
incorrect!

468
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,433
The winner of Word Investigation is

469
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,100
Teruasa Oda!

470
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:38,633
We won.

471
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,600
We won!

472
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,033
We did it, we won!

473
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,066
Unbelievable.

474
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:52,567
Guide,

475
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,800
I beat you.

476
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,900
Time to settle the bets.

477
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,033
Once the enclosed space is opened,

478
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,367
first the loser will hand over
all of his keys to the winner.

479
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,934
What the hell?

480
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,800
Next, as demanded by Teruasa Oda,

481
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:13,700
The Guide will bring Gungnir to an end.

482
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:20,400
A world free from conflict

483
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,934
is what I want too.

484
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:26,767
So,

485
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,700
I don't deny your ideals.

486
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:32,467
Humans thrive

487
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,567
by following their desires,

488
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,367
but at the same time,

489
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,433
they engage in ugly conflicts
to satisfy such cravings.

490
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:49,333
The devil's key is a forbidden tool

491
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:52,166
that stirs up man's desires.

492
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,000
Something like that won't save anyone.

493
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:04,800
If you really were The Guide,
leader of mankind,

494
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,266
you wouldn't have been defeated.

495
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,100
Isn't that right?

496
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,400
That may be so.

497
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,266
Wait! Guide--

498
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,400
That's enough.

499
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Gungnir is over.

500
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,233
What a showdown between father and son.

501
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,033
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

502
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:34,233
Guide.

503
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:39,033
Since you no longer have a key,
this will be my final goodbye.

504
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,100
Teruasa Oda,

505
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,734
I look forward to seeing you again.

506
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:46,800
Wait.

507
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Gado…

508
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,033
I have no intention of meeting you again.

509
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,367
What's that supposed to mean?

510
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:04,300
I told you,
you can't completely destroy the keys.

511
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,767
Don't expect me
to believe the words of a devil.

512
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,000
Whatever you say is impossible

513
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:13,867
is likely the opposite.

514
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,433
I…

515
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:24,133
will find a way
to destroy all of the keys.

516
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,233
If you can find a way,

517
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,800
be my guest.

518
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:40,166
I'm sure we will meet again.

519
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,266
Guide!

520
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:11,767
It's over.

521
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,166
Teruasa…

522
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:28,467
Wow, fancy!

523
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
It's open!

524
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:47,433
Oda.

525
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
-Mori, are you okay?
-Yes.

526
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,667
Who won? The Guide?

527
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,266
Teruasa would never lose.

528
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,500
Thank god! He saved us!

529
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:58,834
Teruasa!

530
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Ryukan!

531
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,200
Hyodo, you all came too.

532
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,934
Okamoto.

533
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,100
You look well.

534
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,266
It's been a long time.

535
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,300
I'm not sure what I should call you.

536
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,700
Hyodo-chin, been a while.

537
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:21,734
You're here too?

538
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
What? Got a problem?

539
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,133
Hoshin!

540
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,500
Don't move!

541
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,166
This time I'll aim for the head.

542
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,734
What are you trying to do?

543
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,767
I should be asking you that.

544
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,266
After ten long years,

545
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:46,200
just when I thought
we could finally collect all 99 keys,

546
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:49,333
you decide to put on a display
of fatherly affection

547
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,633
and hand them all over to your son?

548
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,200
Don't make me laugh!

549
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Give it up.

550
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,233
They were never your keys to have.

551
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,066
Yes.

552
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:07,000
That's why you're no use to me now.

553
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,100
Look out!

554
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:11,867
Are you okay?

555
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,400
Hey! Hey!

556
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,066
No!

557
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:22,900
What have you done?

558
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:24,567
Why?

559
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,533
Why you?

560
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:44,967
It's going to collapse!

561
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,233
Everyone, get out of here!

562
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:48,367
Ui!

563
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,867
Quickly!

564
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,700
-We're going to die!
-Go!

565
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:53,633
-Run!
-Teruasa!

566
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,800
-Yuki! Quickly!
-No! No!

567
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,300
-Teruasa!
-Quickly!

568
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,533
Hurry! Hurry!

569
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:10,667
Teruasa,

570
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,734
what was the last word you wrote down?

571
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,600
Forget it, let's go!

572
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,667
Was it me?

573
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,600
SEIJI ODA

574
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Yes.

575
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:35,133
The Seiji Oda I knew died 13 years ago.

576
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:39,800
Go to Miteratert.

577
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,233
The devil's keys.

578
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:45,633
Extinguish them.

579
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,166
Please.

580
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,433
My son.

581
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,233
Dad!

582
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:08,367
Dad. Dad! Dad!

583
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,033
-We need to go!
-Dad!

584
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
-There's no time!
-Dad!

585
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:12,967
Teruasa!

586
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,633
Teruasa!

587
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,867
Come and try this.

588
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,000
Wow, it's yummy.

589
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,333
You like it!

590
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Hey! He said it's yummy.

591
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,000
That's right,

592
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:50,800
your mom designed that
with the food department.

593
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,166
Think it'll sell?

594
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,867
Then can I join the company
and figure out how to sell stuff?

595
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,000
You want to do what your dad does?

596
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,667
I wonder if I can.

597
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:09,533
I'm sure of it.

598
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,133
If you keep working hard.

599
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,633
You've grown up.

600
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,667
One week has passed
since the ACMA:GAME tournament.

601
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:57,600
No one suspects that they were
about to lose their lives in an attack,

602
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,734
and the world goes on as usual.

603
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,233
Like nothing happened.

604
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:07,000
No one knows what occurred on that island.

605
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:11,133
Not a word was announced
about The Guide or Gungnir.

606
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,800
We searched the island,

607
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,600
but Hoshin was nowhere to be found.

608
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:18,400
He escaped.

609
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:22,734
Ryukan invited me to join Oda Group,

610
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:24,934
but I refused.

611
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,400
There's still something I need to do.

612
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:35,700
Did you hear? The fans are going
to vote for who takes lead vocals.

613
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,533
What? Isn't it me?

614
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,233
Yukari, how many shows did you miss?

615
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,767
Management was furious.

616
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,433
You didn't even pick up the phone.
What were you doing?

617
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:53,834
I guess I was growing up.

618
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,166
DRAGON KING AKIRA MORI
VS NEWCOMER AI OROCHI

619
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:04,233
As a player who rarely appears
before the media,

620
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,667
what circumstances led to
you taking on a game against AI?

621
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,000
One of my previous opponents is Manabe,

622
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,300
the developer of OROCHI.

623
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,900
Yuki!

624
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,934
Relax.

625
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Got it.

626
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,967
Breathe.

627
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,934
That's the spirit!

628
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,066
Teruasa's not answering?

629
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,567
I know.

630
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,400
It's only the biggest show of a lifetime
for you and OROCHI.

631
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:42,667
What the hell is he doing?

632
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:47,834
Do you think he's searching for keys?

633
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,734
We told him we'd help him.
He wouldn't go alone.

634
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:54,166
Don't worry. He'll be here.

635
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:02,667
OROCHI, locate Teruasa's key,
just in case.

636
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Roger that.

637
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:05,700
Let's see.

638
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,500
Looks like the keys
are hidden where they should be.

639
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,567
Wait, there's one key outside the room.

640
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:13,266
What?

641
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,367
Ui, Yuki,

642
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,066
what are you looking at?

643
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,800
Teruasa's key is abroad for some reason.

644
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,767
-Cambodia?
-Cambodia?

645
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,166
CAMBODIA

646
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:31,266
CAMBODIA

647
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:49,934
MITERATERT RUINS

648
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:23,133
Collect all 99 keys and end it all.

649
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,100
My father's dying wish falls to me.

650
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,800
Terurin,

651
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I couldn't help joining.

652
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:56,834
Senya, how did you get here?

653
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,667
You're here to collect the keys, right?

654
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:02,667
You went off by yourself again.

655
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,400
Ui-ui and the others will be angry.

656
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,266
I'm doing this alone.

657
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:11,166
I know the names of the winners
of the tournaments that took place abroad.

658
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,800
You may have done your research,

659
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,467
but so did I.

660
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:28,066
So…

661
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,834
where do we go from here?

662
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,633
Good question.

663
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,967
Our first stop…
