1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:05,872
<i>Did you…</i>

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,942
<i>commit murder?</i>

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,047
I'll ask again.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,184
Did you…

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,054
commit murder?

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,928
Let me ask a different question.

7
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,234
What do you think it means

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,203
to live as a murderer?

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,441
<i>"Killer." "You don't deserve to live."</i>

10
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,977
<i>"Scum." "Pay for your crime with death."</i>

11
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,247
The moment they convict you,

12
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,883
those words will rain down upon you.

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,788
Strangers you've never met
will pierce your heart as if it's nothing

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,624
with tens of thousands of knives.

15
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,161
And it won't just be directed at you.

16
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,032
Your family, partner, friends, colleagues…

17
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,502
Everyone who's been part of your life

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,741
will be forced to wear the label
of being associated with a murderer.

19
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,145
Innocent people
will be treated as if they were criminals.

20
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:23,716
It might even be more cruel
than serving time in jail as a murderer.

21
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,757
Of course, if you
genuinely repent for your crime,

22
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,261
and they consider you rehabilitated,
you might be able to end your sentence.

23
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,230
Legally speaking, that is.

24
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,235
But it doesn't absolve you of your crime.

25
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,442
Even if you've committed an offense,
you can still start fresh.

26
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,779
Do you believe that Japan is
a forgiving country that allows for that?

27
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,181
Consider this.

28
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,652
What if a murderer
moved into a room next to yours?

29
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,156
If they confessed to you,
"I've killed someone,"

30
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,091
could you nod and smile in response?

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,262
It's the same with
rehabilitation centers for criminals.

32
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,198
Everyone acknowledges
their importance to society,

33
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,801
but no one desires to live near one.

34
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,103
That's human nature for you.

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,041
You understand now, don't you?

36
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,645
Even if you're forgiven
within the confines of the law,

37
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,413
in the real world,

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,517
the public isn't about to forgive someone
who's committed a crime.

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,286
No matter how much they've reformed,

40
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,723
there's no place for them
once they leave prison.

41
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,892
They can never find happiness.

42
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:43,796
Eventually, they succumb to despair,
kill again, or end their own lives.

43
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,899
It's the only future that awaits them.

44
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,603
The instant you become a murderer,
your life is over.

45
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,439
It can't be helped. After all…

46
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,145
you've committed murder.

47
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,082
Apologies.

48
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,852
Let's get back on track.

49
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,924
Today, I've come to share
something important with you.

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,829
What you decide to do
with this opportunity is up to you.

51
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,573
I will ensure

52
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,474
you receive an acquittal.

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,164
Will we arrive on time?

54
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,602
We're cutting it close.

55
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,004
But I can't go any faster.

56
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,689
Aren't you going too fast?

57
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,857
Huh?

58
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,004
What's going on?

59
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,173
Pull over after the traffic lights.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,676
For crying out loud!

61
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,756
Open the window, please.

62
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,725
You were going pretty fast.
Please step out.

63
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,062
I'm so sorry.

64
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,196
My passenger, he…

65
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,600
How fast were you going?

66
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,537
Here's my card.

67
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,706
ATTORNEY MASAKI AKIZUMI

68
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,876
For speeding, the protocol is
to tail the vehicle for 100 meters,

69
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,445
assess their speed,
and then activate the siren.

70
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,213
At what speed were you pursuing us?

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,983
-Seventy kilometers.
-I see.

72
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,887
Let's start here.

73
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,691
One, two, three, stop.

74
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,259
That's three seconds.

75
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,630
To pursue us
from that alley for 100 meters,

76
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,899
you would have had to drive at 120 kilos.

77
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,902
I hate debating
whether one did something or not,

78
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,905
so I've taken to recording videos
for self-protection.

79
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,541
Also, if you want to crack down
on drivers, don't lurk.

80
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,677
I suggest you patrol boldly
in the middle of the road.

81
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,213
Especially since
the roads in Tokyo are dangerous.

82
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,817
See?

83
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,052
Good day.

84
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,946
Good morning.

85
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,515
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

86
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,651
I'm glad to see you seem so busy.

87
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,822
Thankfully, I believe I've finally
caught up with your level, Mr. Himeno.

88
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
You're being too modest.

89
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,693
But punctuality is crucial.

90
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,429
Despite how it may seem,
we're quite busy as well.

91
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,931
Though perhaps not as busy
as the hotshot lawyer.

92
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:39,999
Thank you.

93
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,468
I was able to get ready
while you were lecturing me.

94
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,137
Shall we begin?

95
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,271
By the way…

96
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,874
I've also had to wait.

97
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,510
You've invested much time
in the interrogation.

98
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,178
How many rearrests did you make?

99
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,915
It's my policy to conduct
thorough investigations.

100
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,250
Is that right?

101
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,119
Your Honor, since time is limited,
shall we start?

102
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,721
Indeed.

103
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,894
As stated in the indictment,
the victim is Asao Hanegi, aged 54,

104
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,431
the president of Hanegi Seiko,
a small factory located in Ota Ward.

105
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,001
The accused is Keita Hiyama, aged 35,
an employee of the said factory.

106
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,937
He's accused of homicide
under Article 199 of the Penal Code.

107
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,807
<i>On January 30th, 2024,</i>

108
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,975
around 9:45 p.m…

109
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:28,481
The victim was murdered
at his residence adjacent to Hanegi Seiko.

110
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,583
VICTIM: ASAO HANEGI

111
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,419
According to Mr. Hitoshi Ogata,
the first person on the scene,

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,956
Mr. Hiyama, the accused,
was assigned overtime work that day.

113
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,826
Please, let me go home already.

114
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,027
Sure thing.

115
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,729
Once you've finished what I asked,
then you can leave.

116
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,565
Don't make me repeat myself.

117
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,834
Did your parents not teach you anything?

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,170
<i>As he hid in the shadows,
waiting for the argument to end…</i>

119
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,273
You'd better clean that up.

120
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,281
I'll kill him.

121
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,998
What now?

122
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,033
You still have a problem?

123
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,714
That's the perspective of the prosecution.

124
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,149
But we're still uncertain
about its accuracy.

125
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,986
The motive seems to stem
from your typical power harassment.

126
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,723
They should enact laws recognizing
self-defense in cases of harassment.

127
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,725
It won't justify murder, though.

128
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,395
Thirty-five years old,

129
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,298
no prior criminal record,
a first-time offense…

130
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,902
Mr. Akamine, is this your first time
dealing with a homicide?

131
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,169
Yes, it is.

132
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,072
I've handled an assault case
at my previous workplace,

133
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,807
but I'm new to lay judge trials.

134
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,442
Well, you'll adjust soon enough.

135
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,178
By the way,

136
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,615
what's the evidence
linking Mr. Hiyama to the murder?

137
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,920
Security camera footage showing
the accused entering and leaving.

138
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,888
His fingerprints found at the crime scene.

139
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,593
The accused's DNA
found under the victim's fingernails.

140
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,095
And the testimony of Mr. Hitoshi Ogata,

141
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,398
the accused's coworker
who was first on the scene.

142
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,901
Based on these four,
we will prove his guilt in court.

143
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,071
Very well.

144
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,975
Anything from the defense counsel?

145
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,148
Allow me to confirm once more.

146
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,484
Is this all the evidence you've requested?

147
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,387
It is.

148
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,425
Thank you.

149
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,368
Will the focus be on how
to mitigate his sentence?

150
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,308
Mr. Akamine, could you join
Mr. Akizumi from now?

151
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:10,843
Of course.

152
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,846
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

153
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,616
This is the place.

154
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,854
HANEGI SEIKO

155
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,257
You must be out of your mind!

156
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,726
I have nothing to say. Leave!

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,361
Wait, please! I beg you!

158
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,606
Ms. Shinomiya, right?

159
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,875
It's me, Akamine.

160
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,279
Mr. Aoyama instructed me to come here.

161
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,219
Isn't it risky to visit the crime scene
and meet the victim's family?

162
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,187
We're not on their side, after all.

163
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,490
Go home, then.

164
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,261
Raise your arm up to your shoulders. Good.

165
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,331
If you throw the ball now,
you should get some good distance.

166
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,470
-Hey.
-Hmm?

167
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:16,042
Did you know? Ueno Zoo
got a new red panda called Sei.

168
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,644
Minato,

169
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,279
remember not to talk to strangers.

170
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,082
And wasn't that at Tama Zoo?

171
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,116
Was it?

172
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,217
Yup.

173
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,353
And Sei went abroad already.

174
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh…

175
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,890
Here, Minato. That was fun.

176
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,991
Let's play again.

177
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,592
-Yeah. Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye.

178
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,294
Let's go inside.

179
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,163
Excuse me.

180
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,731
Come on. Let's go.

181
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,733
How'd it go?

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,101
Not good.

183
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,969
As expected.

184
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,105
Minato seems to be doing okay.

185
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,473
That's a relief.

186
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,442
-Yeah.
-Is Mommy home?

187
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,412
That man back there is
Mr. Ryo Sato, an employee.

188
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,780
Is something bothering you?

189
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,415
No, not yet.

190
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,383
Not yet?

191
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,587
Starting today,
I'm officially joining your team.

192
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,590
-I'm Aka--
-Akamine, how would you defend this case?

193
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,259
Me, sir? Um…

194
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,996
Given the circumstances
of the crime scene,

195
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,232
it seems clear
that Hiyama committed the crime.

196
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,201
So I'd focus on his motive
and mitigating--

197
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,303
Mr. Hiyama is pleading not guilty.

198
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,940
True, but the prosecution has presented
four pieces of evidence.

199
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,875
That's quite a lot.

200
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,176
Let me tell you something.

201
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,851
For us, the more evidence
there is, the better.

202
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,652
What do you mean?

203
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,525
Is Mr. Akizumi a masochist?

204
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,893
Are you stupid?

205
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,396
The footage is from this camera.

206
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,502
It shows Mr. Hiyama leaving the factory
around 9:45 p.m.,

207
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,238
the time the crime allegedly occurred.

208
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,042
However, this doesn't prove
that Mr. Hiyama committed the murder.

209
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,344
On the contrary…

210
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,747
What would constitute
strong evidence in this case?

211
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,816
The murder weapon.

212
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,853
When he left, he wasn't wearing the jacket
he had on when he arrived for work.

213
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,757
Maybe he removed the jacket
because it was stained with blood?

214
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,093
It might be inside this bag,

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,197
or he might have disposed of it
somewhere within the factory.

216
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,968
Locating either the weapon or the jacket
would provide the prosecution

217
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,371
with an advantage
in proving Mr. Hiyama's guilt.

218
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,707
These two items were not among
the evidence presented by the prosecution.

219
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:33,212
The fact that they deliberately
submitted weak security camera footage…

220
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:34,980
It's like a hedgehog.

221
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,081
Huh?

222
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,551
The prosecution lacks
decisive evidence for this case.

223
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,553
So they're relying on camera footage,

224
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,955
fingerprints,
eyewitness testimony, and DNA.

225
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,258
They're trying to establish guilt
with multiple pieces of evidence.

226
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,629
It's as if they're acknowledging
that each piece of evidence alone is weak.

227
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,799
Even a hedgehog without
its thousands of spines is just a rodent.

228
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,404
One spine alone is weak, which is why
it defends itself with multiple spines.

229
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,440
The more evidence, the better.

230
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,410
In other words, we just need
to pluck the spines one by--

231
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,149
Is that him?

232
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,718
Yes, he's Mr. Hitoshi Ogata,
the first on the scene.

233
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,422
You can't.

234
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,458
Engaging with the prosecution's witness
can raise issues!

235
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,659
Akamine, take that off.

236
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,594
Mr. Ogata.

237
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,397
You're Mr. Ogata, right?

238
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,402
Who the hell are you?

239
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,472
Sorry for interrupting your break.
Could I have a moment?

240
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,308
Apologies, Himeno couldn't make it today.

241
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,376
Himeno?

242
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,378
Oh, the prosecutor.

243
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,480
We're here to hear more from you again.

244
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,983
He may seem pleasant,
but he's quite the taskmaster.

245
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,888
But I've already told him everything.

246
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,656
Do you enjoy the races?

247
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,057
Sort of.

248
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,560
I've been considering
getting into them myself.

249
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,527
Are they exciting?

250
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,563
Well, yeah.

251
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,065
Sorry, please let us double-check.

252
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,734
Mr. Hiyama is claiming innocence.

253
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,168
Are you aware of this?

254
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,306
You only found the victim on the floor,

255
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,508
and you didn't see the perpetrator.

256
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,310
What led you to suspect Mr. Hiyama?

257
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,512
Why does it matter?

258
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,748
I just need
to follow your instructions, right?

259
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,617
You're not the one
who actually killed him, are you?

260
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,186
What?

261
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,355
You know how they always say
in detective dramas,

262
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,557
suspect the first person on the scene?

263
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,260
Did I get it right?

264
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,628
Absolutely not!

265
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:35,067
I returned to the factory
to get my glasses around 9:40 p.m.

266
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,969
Did your parents not teach you anything?

267
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,705
<i>That's when I overheard Hiyama
arguing with the boss.</i>

268
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,981
<i>Then, I heard a scream from his house,
so I hurried over there.</i>

269
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,918
Boss!

270
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,720
Boss!

271
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,955
What's going on?

272
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,992
Honey, what happened to you?

273
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,093
-Talk to me!
-Boss!

274
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,330
Then I witnessed the boss
lying on the floor near the entrance,

275
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,498
and I promptly called
the police and ambulance.

276
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,399
Very good.

277
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,268
Your account is quite precise.

278
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,836
You must have rehearsed it a lot.

279
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,109
By the way,

280
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,847
the machine Mr. Hiyama was using…

281
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,349
Which one is it?

282
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,583
Huh?

283
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:30,856
That one?

284
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,560
Um, may I ask you something?

285
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,197
When you were reading earlier,

286
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,532
you weren't wearing your glasses.

287
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,201
Are you nearsighted?

288
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,803
On the night of the incident,

289
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,239
you headed home
without your glasses, right?

290
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,810
That's why I went back to get my glasses!

291
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,314
Give me a break already.

292
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,516
I told you I'm showing up
for the trial, okay?

293
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,051
Sorry about that.

294
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,986
Apologies for taking up your time.

295
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,236
Why did you ask about his glasses earlier?

296
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,170
Huh?

297
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,440
Well, I'm nearsighted as well.

298
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,076
I can't step outside without my contacts.

299
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,779
So when he mentioned forgetting
his glasses, it seemed odd.

300
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,614
-Sorry if I overstepped.
-It's fine.

301
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,983
By the way,
I couldn't confirm from the footage

302
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,486
whether Mr. Ogata was wearing glasses
when he returned to the factory.

303
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,621
I see.

304
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,057
Um…

305
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,493
they'd be furious if they found out
we contacted their witness.

306
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,395
We even lied we were the prosecution.

307
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,833
There's no law against
contacting the prosecution's witness.

308
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,603
And we never claimed to be
the prosecution in the first place.

309
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,445
AKIZUMI LAW OFFICE

310
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:04,049
Mr. Akizumi, you have evidence
that Mr. Hiyama is innocent, right?

311
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,954
Um, I mean…

312
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,757
Given the false accusation case
six months ago,

313
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,126
I'm curious how you'll get
an acquittal for Mr. Hiyama.

314
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,295
I don't have any evidence.

315
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,533
Does that mean we're actually
trying to help a murderer, then?

316
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,135
A murderer?

317
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,737
Tell me, Akamine,

318
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,140
why do you believe
Mr. Hiyama committed murder?

319
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,076
Because…

320
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,846
he suffered severe power harassment.

321
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,147
That's why he killed?

322
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,784
An attorney's duty

323
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,454
is to defend the legitimate interests
of their client, the accused.

324
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,657
Regardless of how heinous the crime,

325
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:50,162
until convicted, they should be
treated as innocent and protected.

326
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,566
Any attorney who presumes
Mr. Hiyama's guilt at this stage

327
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,135
should resign immediately.

328
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,339
Anyway, whether
he actually committed a crime or not

329
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,608
is not our concern as attorneys.

330
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,377
But if we're unsure
about a client's guilt,

331
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,346
how can we protect them?

332
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,014
You crush it.

333
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,454
It's the prosecution's job
to gather evidence and establish guilt.

334
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,189
And our role, as attorneys,

335
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,125
is to take the evidence presented
by the prosecution…

336
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,663
and crush it in our hands.

337
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,191
<i>The race has started.</i>

338
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,926
Dammit! He got a late start!

339
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,864
Damn…

340
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,833
Come on…

341
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,837
Go!

342
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,706
Pass him!

343
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,075
Go!

344
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:16,114
Go!

345
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,989
What the hell? Dammit!

346
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,858
Dammit.

347
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,905
I delved into Mr. Ogata's background.

348
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,974
He's been changing jobs quite frequently.

349
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,276
Whoa, that's a whole lot.

350
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,945
There must be a reason
he can't hold down a job.

351
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,513
A reason?

352
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,650
Mr. Ogata only repeated
what was written in the statement.

353
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,785
The prosecution has coached him well.

354
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,722
I witnessed the boss
lying on the floor near the entrance,

355
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,724
and I promptly called
the police and ambulance.

356
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,859
Like reciting a script?

357
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,796
Is it normal for the prosecution
to micromanage their witnesses?

358
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,834
Maybe they didn't want their witness
to speak freely for some reason.

359
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,238
It's inconvenient for the prosecution
that Mr. Ogata was the first on the scene.

360
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,041
So they coordinated the narrative
and scripted a testimony.

361
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,977
This might be related to
why he's constantly changing jobs.

362
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,679
Maybe we should tail him a little.

363
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,088
And it falls on me to tail him.

364
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,296
Oops.

365
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,373
<i>Regarding his motive,</i>

366
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,476
<i>Mr. Hiyama has admitted
to experiencing power harassment.</i>

367
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,211
Although it's not strong evidence,

368
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,913
the security camera also shows

369
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,283
that Mr. Hiyama was present in the factory
at the time of the victim's death.

370
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,955
If it's true that Mr. Hiyama's DNA
was found on the body,

371
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:04,990
all that remains is…

372
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,024
I'm back.

373
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,925
The fingerprints.

374
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,026
Correct.

375
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,532
Mr. Hiyama's fingerprints were found
on the inside of this door and this shelf.

376
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,701
Could they have been left
before the incident occurred,

377
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,637
rather than on the day of the incident?

378
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,712
The prosecution claims these fingerprints
were left on the day of the incident.

379
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,916
However, they haven't substantiated
that they were indeed left on that day.

380
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,021
Fingerprints indoors
can persist for up to two months.

381
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,090
Sounds too convenient…

382
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,892
Sorry.

383
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,860
Welcome back.

384
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,662
Keep going, Ms. Shinomiya.

385
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,630
In 2019,

386
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,000
there was a case where the accused
faced charges of burglary and murder.

387
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,571
But they couldn't verify if the prints
were left on the day of the crime,

388
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,272
resulting in an acquittal.

389
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,742
The prosecution is operating
under the assumption

390
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,543
that Mr. Hiyama is the culprit.

391
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,781
They've cleverly woven together
the evidence they've collected

392
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,650
and crafted a narrative
that aligns with their agenda.

393
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,020
In that case, our task
is simply to reshape the narrative

394
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:13,525
to steer toward the conclusion
that Mr. Hiyama is not the culprit.

395
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,828
So that's what he meant
by crushing the evidence.

396
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,733
But to achieve that, we'll need to prove

397
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,470
that Mr. Hiyama was inside
Mr. Hanegi's house before the incident.

398
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,339
I have nothing to say. Leave!

399
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,840
Wait, please! I beg you!

400
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,177
That day, is that why…

401
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,716
I think we still have options to explore.

402
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,832
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

403
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,409
Good morning.

404
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,077
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

405
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,381
So, how did the defense counsel react?

406
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,651
Despite the abundance of evidence
we presented, they remained unfazed.

407
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,021
They even seemed to expect
more evidence from us.

408
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,689
That's attorney Akizumi for you.

409
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,124
I've heard

410
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,961
they're requesting the victim's family
as witnesses for the upcoming trial.

411
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,463
It's outrageous.

412
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,866
They'll exploit even the victim's family
to secure their desired verdict.

413
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,401
They're despicable.

414
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,703
And what's your take?

415
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,538
Her husband was murdered.

416
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,342
I've never heard of the bereaved
testifying on behalf of the accused.

417
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,445
I even gave her a warning, just in case.

418
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,914
-I'm impressed.
-But Ms. Midorikawa.

419
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,351
Why did that man appoint
himself to defend Hiyama?

420
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,857
He must be confident
he can secure an acquittal.

421
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,160
There's concrete evidence against him.

422
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,864
If it were that easy
to get an acquittal for a murderer,

423
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,799
this country would be hopeless.

424
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,246
I'm back.

425
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,481
Well, I'm calling it a day.

426
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,049
See you.

427
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,724
How did it go?

428
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,425
Did Mr. Hanegi's wife talk to you?

429
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,731
I got you a pastry

430
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,932
if you want it.

431
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,567
If you're hungry…

432
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,969
No, thank you.

433
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,338
Okay.

434
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,974
I'll have it, then.

435
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,309
Go ahead.

436
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,510
Don't worry.

437
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,679
Shinomiya's always like that
with newcomers.

438
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,847
Got it.

439
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,619
I've emailed you the details
regarding the mass food poisoning.

440
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,754
Thank you.

441
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,889
But I suppose this matter
takes precedence.

442
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,325
It's a tough one, isn't it?

443
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,395
This household never invited
their employees inside?

444
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,396
That's right.

445
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,332
But I'll try to speak
with Mr. Hanegi's wife again.

446
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,568
Only two more days
until the trial. Good luck!

447
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,171
Yum.

448
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,140
<i>Anko</i> sweet bean paste and cheese.

449
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,548
COURTHOUSE

450
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,223
Good day.

451
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,994
Um, Ms. Shinomiya isn't here yet.

452
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:37,996
Good luck.

453
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,197
Thank you.

454
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,437
Mr. Akizumi.

455
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,711
Are you trying to stage a performance
for the lay judges?

456
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,149
You want the victim's wife
to testify for the accused.

457
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,951
I highly doubt she'll show up, though.

458
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,391
Mr. Himeno.

459
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,466
Let's do our best.

460
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,645
All rise.

461
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,198
THE FIRST PUBLIC TRIAL

462
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,676
The court is now in session.

463
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,818
I will address the accused.

464
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,053
On the day of the incident,

465
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,890
you pursued the victim who had
returned home from the adjacent factory.

466
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:50,261
You subsequently struck
the victim's head with a blunt object.

467
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,097
You are denying this accusation.

468
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,233
Yes.

469
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,669
I didn't kill him.

470
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,472
I'll proceed with my questions.

471
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,210
What were you doing around 9:45 p.m.?

472
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,580
Mr. Hanegi instructed me to keep working,

473
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,716
so I was cutting and shaving metal parts.

474
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,051
Can anyone corroborate this?

475
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,386
No.

476
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,789
In order to refresh his memory,

477
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,025
I'd like to present evidence number 7
as requested by the prosecution.

478
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,060
May I?

479
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:23,828
You may proceed.

480
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,767
This is camera footage
from the day of the incident.

481
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:33,037
It shows you arriving at the factory
and leaving in a hurry.

482
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,405
Do you notice anything?

483
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:36,975
That's right.

484
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,578
On your way out, you're not wearing
the jacket you had on when you arrived.

485
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,448
So, where did that jacket go?

486
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,083
Is it inside this bag?

487
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,417
I don't know.

488
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,120
When you killed the victim,
his blood got on your jacket,

489
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,689
so you disposed of it along
with the weapon. Am I wrong?

490
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:54,859
Objection!

491
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,497
That question unfairly assumes
the accused is guilty.

492
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,900
Prosecutor, what is your stance?

493
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,336
I believe it's acceptable to pose
questions based on logical assumptions.

494
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,907
Objection sustained.

495
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:14,445
Prosecutor, please inquire
about the facts based on the evidence.

496
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,780
Apologies.

497
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,918
You endured verbal abuse
from the victim on a daily basis,

498
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:26,825
with insults such as "idiot,"
"moron," "sluggard," and "useless."

499
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,929
I have statements
from other employees corroborating this.

500
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,599
You were experiencing power harassment.

501
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,536
And on that day, your pent-up frustration
reached its breaking point.

502
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,505
I'd never take a life for such a reason.

503
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,242
Then why were your fingerprints
found at the murder scene?

504
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,077
Apart from the victim's family,

505
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,613
only your prints
were discovered in the home.

506
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,318
Additionally, DNA from your skin
was found under the victim's nails.

507
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:58,923
Isn't this because you had a tussle
with the victim on that day?

508
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:18,610
We'll move on to the defense counsel's
interrogation based on their evidence.

509
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:24,082
First, the victim's family,
whom they requested as witnesses…

510
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,688
What now, Mr. Akizumi?

511
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,224
Defense counsel?

512
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,186
Your Honor, we will examine the witness
we have previously requested.

513
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,455
Here is our witness.

514
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,726
The witness is Minato Hanegi,
the son of the victim.

515
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,228
He's five years old.

516
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,397
Wait a moment.

517
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,400
How could you put
such a young child on the stand?

518
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,668
He's the victim's family!

519
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,603
He's present with his mother's consent.

520
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,338
This is outrageous!

521
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,641
He's a witness listed
in the evidence request.

522
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:32,083
HARUKO HANEGI
MINATO HANEGI

523
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:44,562
Minato, can you share with everyone here
what you told me earlier?

524
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,563
Yeah.

525
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,564
Thanks.

526
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,567
What's your favorite game?

527
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,468
Ball.

528
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,270
You enjoy playing ball?

529
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,438
Where do you play?

530
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,907
In front of my house.

531
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,709
With your friends from kindergarten?

532
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,178
No, with a young mister.

533
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,079
A young mister?

534
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,348
Who is this young mister?

535
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,249
Is he here?

536
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,051
That man.

537
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,888
The man you pointed to,

538
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:15,259
is he the one seated next to the men
dressed like police officers?

539
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,627
-Yeah.
-Your Honor!

540
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,697
I believe the defense counsel guided
the witness to point to the accused.

541
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,532
Is that so?

542
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,702
It didn't appear that way to me.

543
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,373
Defense counsel, please proceed.

544
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,407
Thank you.

545
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,708
Minato,

546
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,380
do you often play ball
with the man you pointed to?

547
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,849
Yeah. He fetched my ball for me.

548
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,851
He fetched your ball?

549
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,953
Where was the ball?

550
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,254
Behind the doggie.

551
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,860
To clarify his statement,
I'd like to present a photograph,

552
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,429
evidence number 32,
as requested by the defense counsel.

553
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,231
You may proceed.

554
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,101
You said the ball was behind the doggie.

555
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,505
Do you mean
this white doggie in the photo?

556
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,706
Yeah.

557
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,375
Your ball ended up behind the doggie,

558
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,879
and that man helped you retrieve it?

559
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,715
Yeah. I couldn't reach it even if I tried.

560
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,518
Thanks.

561
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,358
The prosecution's evidence shows
they found the accused's prints here too.

562
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,163
And Minato's testimony suggests

563
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,332
the accused would've been
inside their home prior to the incident.

564
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,969
Can you get that ball
behind the doggie for me?

565
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,711
Found it.

566
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:42,947
Here you go.

567
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,549
Thanks.

568
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:48,119
In other words, the prints
the prosecution presented as evidence

569
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,122
can be traced back
to before the incident happened.

570
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,558
The witness is just five years old.

571
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,660
Children's memories can be vague.

572
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,428
His testimony isn't reliable!

573
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,699
True. It's normal to doubt
what a young child says.

574
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,167
Mister!

575
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,405
I find it hard to believe
the witness is lying.

576
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,409
Article 143 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure states,

577
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:16,047
"The court may, except as
otherwise provided in this Code,

578
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,884
examine any person as a witness."

579
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,553
That was a legitimate testimony.

580
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,692
It is up to all of you
to determine its credibility.

581
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,428
That is all.

582
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,415
See? There's Mommy.

583
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,450
Minato!

584
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,120
-Were you okay?
-Yeah.

585
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,355
Thank goodness.

586
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,823
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye.

587
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,292
I'll see you out.

588
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,894
Let's go, Minato.

589
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,266
I'm amazed you got Minato to testify.

590
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,735
You're incredible, Ms. Shinomiya.

591
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,510
I'll never testify for you.

592
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,680
I don't recall ever allowing
that man into our house.

593
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,284
My husband was murdered!

594
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,687
I'll call the police
if you keep harassing me.

595
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,956
I have LEGO sets of a zoo.

596
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,024
And ANIA toys too!

597
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,025
Yeah?

598
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,160
Excuse me.

599
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,796
Minato said he wanted to show me his toys.

600
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,299
Stay away from my son.

601
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,301
He might receive the death penalty.

602
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,407
We don't believe
Mr. Hiyama is the culprit.

603
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,510
Minato testified

604
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,515
that he let Mr. Hiyama inside the house
before the incident occurred.

605
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,586
This testimony
will be absolutely pivotal in the case.

606
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,155
Minato, go inside.

607
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,892
I heard that
Mr. Hanegi's relationship with Mr. Hiyama

608
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,796
took a sudden turn
for the worse in the last six months.

609
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,497
Do you know what caused it?

610
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,398
No.

611
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,470
Well, there's a rumor going around
that you were attracted to Mr. Hiyama.

612
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,840
That's ridiculous.

613
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,477
Hiyama, did you get a haircut?

614
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,679
You're looking even more handsome.

615
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,617
I just…

616
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,886
gave him a simple compliment
about his appearance.

617
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,822
You can't assume I was attracted to him.

618
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,024
Let's consider a hypothetical scenario.

619
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,395
Even if it was just a joke
and you didn't intend anything by it,

620
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:49,500
what if Mr. Hanegi overheard your words?

621
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,372
What if his misunderstanding led
to the deterioration of their relationship

622
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,842
and played a role in this incident?

623
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,381
We're not asking you to lie on our behalf.

624
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,718
I believe it is true
you never let Mr. Hiyama inside your home.

625
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:13,090
However, Minato told us clearly
that he let Mr. Hiyama inside.

626
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,227
If we don't clarify this in court,

627
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,129
Mr. Hiyama will be convicted,

628
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,265
and he'd have to live
the rest of his life as a murderer.

629
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,568
There's a precedent for this.

630
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,906
A person was arrested for murder
and sentenced to death.

631
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,810
They spent over ten years in prison,

632
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,446
waiting for their execution day.

633
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,549
But what if they were innocent all along?

634
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,852
They lost their family,

635
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,222
and endured life inside
a dark, cold, grim cell,

636
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,825
simply waiting for death.

637
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,698
Strangely, the evidence in that case
was deliberately covered up,

638
00:38:53,764 --> 00:39:00,204
and everyone involved still carries
with them a deep sense of sadness.

639
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,609
Could you live a life like that?

640
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,792
Thank you for your cooperation.

641
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,728
That's the last time.

642
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,249
Akamine, isn't it time soon?

643
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,284
Right.

644
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,999
Mister!

645
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,934
Minato!

646
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,369
Welcome back.

647
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,338
Let's play.

648
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,472
Sure.

649
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:09,807
May we?

650
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,575
Yeah. Thanks.

651
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,346
Thank you very much.

652
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,849
Let's play ball inside.

653
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,951
We'll play outside.

654
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,255
If we play indoors, the ball might
end up behind the doggie again.

655
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,192
That lady is good at magic tricks.

656
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,894
Come on, Minato.

657
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,495
Last time you mentioned it was…

658
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,963
<i>The witness is just five years old.</i>

659
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,932
<i>Children's memories can be vague.</i>

660
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,034
<i>His testimony isn't reliable!</i>

661
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,342
Excuse me!

662
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,977
Yes?

663
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,112
I'll go get my ball.

664
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,616
What you mentioned just now,

665
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,386
about getting the ball for him.

666
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,622
Did you tell Akizumi about that?

667
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,392
Uh, yeah.

668
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,394
The other day,

669
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,163
he asked me
if I've ever been inside the house.

670
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,668
Excuse me.

671
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,858
Excuse me.

672
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,295
Oof.

673
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,099
I've taken the video.

674
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,539
This is part of an attorney's job, right?

675
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,575
Rest assured, this action
doesn't breach any regulations.

676
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,010
I understand that.

677
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,113
Do you always do this kind of thing?

678
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,189
SAYA

679
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,426
Excuse me.

680
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,699
Hey.

681
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,268
Are you free now?

682
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,036
I just got some leashes.

683
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,705
<i>The old one is getting worn out, right?</i>

684
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,040
So, I bought new ones.

685
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,842
But I couldn't decide on the color.

686
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,745
<i>Which do you think
would suit Mill better? You choose.</i>

687
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,647
Go with whichever you like.

688
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,081
<i>Oh, please!</i>

689
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,183
Fine. I'll get back to you later.

690
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,852
I'm still working.

691
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,621
Right, sorry. I'll text you later.

692
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,722
Bye.

693
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,494
You dropped this.

694
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,620
I've been following him for a while,

695
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,423
but besides the fact that
he's into gambling and drinking,

696
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,291
I didn't notice anything odd.

697
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,494
That explains his debt.

698
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,429
Huh?

699
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,763
Check this out.

700
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,666
He's borrowing a total of 1.5 million yen
from consumer finance.

701
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,936
That implies he's spending
that much on gambling.

702
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,304
How did you find that out?

703
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,140
You want to know?

704
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,742
Yikes…

705
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,612
He was borrowing money
from the victim, Mr. Hanegi, too.

706
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,713
How much?

707
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,847
About 300,000 yen.

708
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,619
One of the employees witnessed
Mr. Hanegi shouting, "Give back my money!"

709
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:45,656
In other words, Mr. Ogata
was quarreling with the victim over money.

710
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,928
You know, it's been bothering me.

711
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,799
Mr. Ogata always
wears glasses when he's out.

712
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,936
How could he forget them that night?

713
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,740
Did he really just go back
for his glasses?

714
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,576
What if it was actually Mr. Ogata who…

715
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,182
Akamine.

716
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,117
Yes?

717
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,819
Let's bet on the next race.

718
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,962
Go!

719
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,466
Go!

720
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,344
We picked the wrong one!

721
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,413
Trio, 5th, 8th, 15th!

722
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,815
If only 5th and 15th
were swapped, we'd have hit it!

723
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,283
No beginner's luck, huh?

724
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,518
Let's tear this up!

725
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,952
Wait a minute!

726
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,589
Huh? Mr. Prosecutor?

727
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,691
Oh.

728
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,161
You won, you know.

729
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,062
Huh?

730
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,396
This is a trio.

731
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,831
The order doesn't matter.

732
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,201
If all these numbers
place in the top three, you win!

733
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,669
Really?

734
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,404
You won 300,000!

735
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,605
That's amazing.

736
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,377
What's going on?

737
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,979
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

738
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,082
I forgot to ask you something
the other day.

739
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,117
Give me a break.

740
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,386
You've won 100,000.

741
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,288
Huh?

742
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,957
If you hadn't intervened,

743
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,194
we would've tossed away 300,000 yen.

744
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,930
You deserve at least 100,000 yen.

745
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,401
What do you say? How about we grab drinks?

746
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,172
The drinks are on us, of course.

747
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,776
Let's call it a day soon.

748
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,578
Thank you.

749
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,653
No way we newbies
could've known what trios mean.

750
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,288
Are you sure I can take this cash?

751
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,957
Absolutely.

752
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,458
Here.

753
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,795
What sort of jobs have you had, Mr. Ogata?

754
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,764
What's this all of a sudden?

755
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,298
I'm just curious.

756
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,539
I've worked at a bar,
a karaoke joint, traffic control…

757
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,141
I've done a bunch of stuff.

758
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,610
Why so many?

759
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:20,577
Dammit.

760
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,114
They all fired me, saying I was useless.

761
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,718
They all looked down on me.

762
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,754
Is that so?

763
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,689
Do you think your current job will last?

764
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,526
Excuse me. Here's your order.

765
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,161
Thank you.

766
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,263
You really are nearsighted.

767
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,331
That's why you took them off at work.

768
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,801
Your job did seem to demand precision.

769
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:47,971
And you happened to forget your glasses
on the day of the incident.

770
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,241
Come on, drink up.

771
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,309
Thanks.

772
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,445
Sorry. Let's stop talking
about the incident.

773
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,781
When did you start getting into races?

774
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,818
Any thoughts on which horse
might perform well next week?

775
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,854
Let's stop talking about work.
It puts a damper on the drink.

776
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:06,990
You're right.

777
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,931
So, do you say stuff like,

778
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,399
"Objection!

779
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:20,304
The defense counsel is leading
the witness with their questioning."

780
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,305
No.

781
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,673
I don't.

782
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,741
I'm the one
who receives those accusations.

783
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:25,642
Huh?

784
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,244
I forgot to introduce myself.

785
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:31,148
I'm defending Mr. Keita Hiyama.

786
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,016
I'm Akizumi.

787
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,917
Defending?

788
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,053
You're not a prosecutor?

789
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:36,954
No.

790
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:41,959
I see.

791
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:48,265
You guys made me drink and buttered me up
to win me over to your side.

792
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,767
Attorneys sure use dirty tricks.

793
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,072
But I'm still going to testify

794
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,607
that it was Hiyama who did it.

795
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,375
I don't mind.

796
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,348
However, please keep
today's events between us.

797
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,016
Huh?

798
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,285
I gave money to you, a witness,

799
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,520
and even treated you to drinks.

800
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,991
I could be accused
of witness interest extortion.

801
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,860
And, naturally, you'd be just as guilty
for accepting them.

802
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:17,995
Unless,

803
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,564
you'd like to return
the money I just gave you.

804
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,600
F-Fine.

805
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,636
I'll keep quiet about this.

806
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,770
Wonderful.

807
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,416
There's no such law.

808
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,220
Ignorance can be dangerous, can't it?

809
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,091
But you knew and didn't tell him.

810
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,227
You're just as guilty as me.

811
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,163
I just want to uncover the truth.

812
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,099
Well, see you tomorrow in court.

813
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:19,523
Good evening.

814
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,243
All rise.

815
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:48,018
THE SECOND PUBLIC TRIAL

816
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,529
Mr. Ogata,

817
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,366
on the day of the incident,

818
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:06,370
you realized you had forgotten something
and returned to the factory, correct?

819
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,539
Yes.

820
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,909
I had left my glasses behind
and went back for them.

821
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,016
<i>I assumed the factory would be closed,</i>

822
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,717
<i>but the lights were still on.</i>

823
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,167
<i>And there, I overheard an argument
between Mr. Hanegi and Mr. Hiyama.</i>

824
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,469
Please, let me go home already.

825
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,804
Sure thing.

826
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,373
Once you've finished what I asked,
then you can leave.

827
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,741
Don't make me repeat myself.

828
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,978
But making one takes quite a bit of time.

829
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:48,912
What?

830
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,648
Are you really talking back?

831
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,218
You're worthless to society,

832
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,220
and I'm only hiring you out of kindness.

833
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,623
Is this how you were raised?

834
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,725
Did your parents not teach you anything?

835
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,061
Bring your mom,
and I'll give her a talking-to!

836
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,930
Oh, she died, didn't she?

837
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,866
<i>I figured it would be a hassle
if they found me,</i>

838
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,636
<i>so I decided to stay still
until the boss left.</i>

839
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,209
I'll kill him.

840
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,212
<i>After a while,</i>

841
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,780
<i>the two left.</i>

842
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,950
<i>So I tried to leave discreetly.</i>

843
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,458
<i>Then, I heard a scream
from the boss' residence.</i>

844
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,094
And when I went to check it out…

845
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,598
My apologies for bringing up
the distressing memories.

846
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,368
Everyone,

847
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,438
the security camera
inside the factory shows

848
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:53,110
Mr. Ogata entering
the premises at around 9:45 p.m.

849
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,746
This testimony
presents compelling evidence

850
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,117
that the accused was present at the scene
and murdered the victim.

851
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,518
That is all.

852
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,990
Now, defense counsel,
commence the cross-examination.

853
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,816
I'm Akizumi, representing the defense.
I have a few questions.

854
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,120
Mr. Ogata, you overheard

855
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,825
an argument between the victim
and the accused at the factory, correct?

856
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:43,827
Yeah.

857
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,496
I mean, yes.

858
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,733
Did the victim truly
utter the words "I'll kill him"?

859
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,434
Yes.

860
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,938
I see.

861
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,109
Very well.

862
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,849
Your Honor,

863
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,486
I request permission
to conduct an ex officio inspection.

864
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,055
What type of inspection?

865
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:16,726
And is it crucial
to the proceedings of this trial?

866
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,727
Yes, Your Honor.

867
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,597
This inspection
will provide the crucial material

868
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:24,434
necessary to establish the uncertainty
of Mr. Ogata's testimony.

869
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:27,637
Prosecutor,

870
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,206
may he proceed?

871
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,813
Well then,

872
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,216
please listen carefully.

873
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,922
<i>Please, let me go home already.</i>

874
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,290
<i>Sure thing.</i>

875
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,893
<i>Once you've finished what I asked,
then you can leave.</i>

876
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,228
<i>Don't make me repeat myself.</i>

877
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,229
<i>Right,</i>

878
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,231
<i>but I've already finished.</i>

879
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,298
<i>What?</i>

880
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,900
<i>You've already made the part?</i>

881
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,935
<i>Impressive.</i>

882
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,171
<i>All right, you can go home.</i>

883
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:02,872
Pause there.

884
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:06,476
Mr. Ogata,

885
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,646
this reconstructed dialogue
reflects the ambiance

886
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,516
of the interaction between the victim
and the accused, based on your testimony.

887
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,620
In this audio,

888
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:20,023
what did the man at the end say?

889
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,028
He said, "Don't leave
until you finish making the part."

890
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,467
Mr. Ogata, I'll ask you another question.

891
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,970
What was the tone of voice
used by this man?

892
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,741
He gave an order in a commanding manner.

893
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,477
Did he say, "You can go home"?

894
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,014
H-He never said that.

895
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,485
Do you confirm that the conversation

896
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:52,055
between the accused and the victim
that you heard was akin to this audio?

897
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,291
Y…

898
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,159
Y-Yes.

899
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,131
We intentionally integrated
machinery noise into this audio

900
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,600
to replicate the ambiance of the factory.

901
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,369
Next, please listen to this audio clip

902
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,339
without the machinery noise.

903
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,210
<i>Please, let me go home already.</i>

904
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,545
<i>Sure thing.</i>

905
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,048
<i>Once you've finished what I asked,
then you can leave.</i>

906
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,582
<i>Don't make me repeat myself.</i>

907
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,784
<i>Right,</i>

908
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,652
<i>but I've already finished.</i>

909
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,553
<i>What?</i>

910
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,088
<i>You've already made the part?</i>

911
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,023
<i>Impressive.</i>

912
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,526
<i>All right, you can go home.</i>

913
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,565
Mr. Ogata, I'll inquire once more.

914
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,033
At the time of the incident,

915
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,038
was Mr. Hanegi shouting
at Mr. Hiyama, just like in this audio?

916
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,007
Uh…

917
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:48,812
Did you truly hear an argument
between the accused and the victim?

918
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:54,718
Is it possible that you couldn't discern
their conversation amidst the noise?

919
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,553
No…

920
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,988
And are you sure
about forgetting your glasses?

921
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:03,526
Perhaps, to conceal the true motive
behind your return to the factory,

922
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,765
you and the prosecution fabricated
the story of retrieving your glasses.

923
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,435
But, in reality, you went back
for something else entirely.

924
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,572
Let's see, for instance…

925
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,208
a hearing aid.

926
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,286
Objection!

927
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,389
That is mere speculation by the defense!

928
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,390
APD,

929
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,892
Auditory Processing Disorder.

930
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,728
It's the condition you have.

931
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:43,833
While it may not significantly impact
comprehension of everyday conversations,

932
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,502
in noisy and bustling environments,

933
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,572
voices may become muffled
and comprehension may be challenging.

934
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,308
It seems you like races,

935
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,310
yet even at the racetrack,

936
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,580
you always listen to radio commentary
through earphones.

937
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:04,821
<i>They rent out radios to individuals
with visual or hearing impairments.</i>

938
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:10,193
<i>The racetrack is always
bustling and noisy, after all.</i>

939
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:16,800
I have questioned the neighbors
about the circumstances of the incident.

940
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,101
HANEGI SEIKO

941
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:23,573
<i>They reported hearing the sounds
of machinery late into the night.</i>

942
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,545
<i>The machine Mr. Hiyama was using
is used for shaving metal pieces</i>

943
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,180
<i>and produces considerable noise.</i>

944
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,750
To clarify the witness' statement,

945
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,586
I request to play the audio,
marked as evidence number 38,

946
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,222
as requested by the defense counsel.

947
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:44,828
This recording captures the ambient noises
of the factory under similar conditions.

948
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,162
Very well.

949
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,163
Proceed.

950
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,213
Mr. Ogata, you maintain

951
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,282
that even amidst this machinery noise,

952
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,520
you could accurately discern
the contents of the conversation.

953
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,055
Is that correct?

954
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,257
W-Well…

955
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,561
You've changed jobs frequently
due to this condition.

956
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,797
No matter what job you got,

957
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,433
you were dismissed
because of your hearing.

958
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,668
It must have been hard.

959
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,605
You can't keep mistaking orders like this.

960
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,639
<i>It must've been painful.</i>

961
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,808
Mr. Ogata, you can't keep doing this.

962
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,376
<i>It must've seemed unfair.</i>

963
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,280
I offer my sympathies.

964
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:38,715
You!

965
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,752
This isn't what we discussed!

966
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,888
This is why I didn't want to do this!

967
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,689
-You bastard!
-Calm down!

968
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,526
Screw you! You bastard!

969
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,794
-Hey!
-I order the witness to leave!

970
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,597
You bastard!

971
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,599
Hey!

972
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,241
Order in the court!

973
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,747
The court will adjourn for the time being.

974
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,087
Prosecutor.

975
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,292
You're not surprised.

976
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,628
But that's expected.

977
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:29,198
There's no way you would be
unaware of the witness' condition.

978
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,967
If it were to become known,

979
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,403
it would undermine
the credibility of his testimony.

980
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,572
You told Mr. Ogata,

981
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,975
"I'll handle this discreetly
so your condition remains hidden.

982
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,977
Just testify as instructed."

983
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,178
Isn't that right?

984
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,583
It was an impressive statement indeed.

985
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:22,752
Hey!

986
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,924
Did you approach me
only to learn about my hearing impairment?

987
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,694
Will you even expose my condition
just so you can win?

988
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,264
That's why I invited you to that place.

989
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,402
Sorry. Let's stop talking
about the incident.

990
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,070
When did you start getting into races?

991
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,506
Any thoughts on which horse
might perform well next week?

992
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,342
Let's stop talking about work.
It puts a damper on the drink.

993
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,111
<i>Amidst the noise of the trains,</i>

994
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,381
I wanted to see
if you could discern my words.

995
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,451
What grudge do you have against me?

996
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,553
Hiyama killed the boss.

997
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,423
He's a criminal! A killer!

998
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,858
My apologies.

999
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,529
I'm driven to win, even if it means
revealing someone's disorder.

1000
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,831
It's simply part of my job.

1001
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,301
Screw you!

1002
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,436
Hey!

1003
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,139
I might lose my job again!

1004
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,741
You want me to die, is that it?!

1005
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,444
Do you want to die?

1006
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:26,015
Whether you live or die
is none of my concern.

1007
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,551
I'll exploit anything,
even a person's disability.

1008
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:33,189
As long as your account of hearing
their conversation remains unclear,

1009
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,925
I'll stop at nothing to prove that.

1010
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,762
I'll go to any lengths
to serve my client's interests.

1011
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,297
That's what attorneys do.

1012
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,166
I have only spoken the truth.

1013
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,735
You have no grounds to resent me. Goodbye.

1014
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,475
Nevertheless,

1015
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,312
consider this a form of reparation.

1016
01:01:57,113 --> 01:02:00,783
Dismissing someone due to a condition
that doesn't impact business operations

1017
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,452
constitutes unfair dismissal.

1018
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,855
If you pursue legal action
against every company that dismissed you,

1019
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:06,823
you could probably…

1020
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,292
win 10 million at least.

1021
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:14,597
Since we've shared drinks together,
I'll handle this case at no cost, anytime.

1022
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,631
Consider it.

1023
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,203
It may seem unusual coming from me,

1024
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,673
but you should never forgive those
who discriminate against you

1025
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,742
because of your disability.

1026
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,410
Goodbye.

1027
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,637
Stay in line.

1028
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,474
-Hello.
-Hello.

1029
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,150
Mr. Akizumi says he'll return
after making a call.

1030
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,151
Hmm.

1031
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,954
He's probably calling his daughter.

1032
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,222
Saya, was it?

1033
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,291
Huh?

1034
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,959
Huh?

1035
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,429
SAYA HAS SENT A PHOTO

1036
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:22,865
<i>How do you like the leash?</i>

1037
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,102
Hey, I want to take a picture.

1038
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,471
Mame, look this way.

1039
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,506
Hey.

1040
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,541
Stop that.

1041
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,509
I'm trying to take a picture!

1042
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,548
MASAKI AKIZUMI

1043
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,664
Okay, let's have Class 2 go first.

1044
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,867
-Hello!
-Hello!

1045
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,709
-Hello!
-Hello!

1046
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,210
You're so full of energy.

1047
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,745
A prosecutor's job is…

1048
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:50,086
to teach people that it's important
to say sorry when they do something wrong.

1049
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,053
Why?

1050
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,088
Tell us.

1051
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:56,792
I bet your mommy and daddy
tell you that too.

1052
01:04:56,859 --> 01:05:00,329
If you do something wrong,
you have to feel sorry for it

1053
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,231
and never do it again.

1054
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,799
Oh? Don't they tell you that?

1055
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,868
-Yeah!
-They do!

1056
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,103
But the thing is,

1057
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:11,474
it's human nature to make mistakes.

1058
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:16,178
So we help people who have done wrong

1059
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:21,584
by giving them time
to reflect on their wrongdoing.

1060
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:25,087
What do you think happens to them?

1061
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,322
They become better people.

1062
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,556
-Better people!
-Better people!

1063
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,891
I really hope so!

1064
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,794
Japan is a country

1065
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:36,766
where even people who've
made mistakes can make a fresh start.

1066
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,301
Do you believe that?

1067
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:40,870
Consider this.

1068
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,705
Think about it.

1069
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:47,343
After someone who did something wrong
leaves prison,

1070
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,614
how can they find a place
for themselves in the world?

1071
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,183
How can they find happiness?

1072
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,585
They can never find happiness.

1073
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:02,258
Eventually, they succumb to despair,
kill again, or end their own lives.

1074
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,460
It's the only future that awaits them.

1075
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,966
The instant you become a murderer,
your life is over.

1076
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,134
It can't be helped. After all…

1077
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,106
you've committed murder.

1078
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,454
The court is back in session.

1079
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,355
Your Honor,

1080
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:37,493
we would like to request
an investigation into new evidence.

1081
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,296
New evidence?

1082
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,199
What kind of evidence?

1083
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,704
We've been searching
for this for a long time.

1084
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,606
It's the murder weapon.

1085
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,878
Defense counsel, could you please confirm?

1086
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,686
Please confirm.

1087
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,599
<i>What's the plan now?</i>

1088
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,602
There's no need to worry.

1089
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,439
Carry on as usual.

1090
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,707
But that hammer is mine--

1091
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:25,674
Mr. Hiyama,

1092
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,078
try to remember.

1093
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,182
Before the incident,

1094
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:37,686
did you happen to misplace the hammer?

1095
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,539

THE VERDICT IS DELIVERED!

AKAMINE DISCOVERS A SHOCKING TRUTH
