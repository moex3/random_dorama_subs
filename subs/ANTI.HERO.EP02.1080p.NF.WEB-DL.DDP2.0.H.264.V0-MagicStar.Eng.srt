1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,873
<i>Keita Hiyama, aged 35.</i>

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,375
<i>He's accused of homicide.</i>

3
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:20,420
The victim was murdered
at his residence adjacent to Hanegi Seiko.

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,554
Your Honor,

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,157
We've been searching
for this for a long time.

6
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,458
It's the murder weapon.

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,393
But that hammer is mine--

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,460
Mr. Hiyama.

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,995
Before the incident,

10
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,265
did you happen to misplace the hammer?

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,215
You walked into the shop empty-handed,

12
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,151
seeking "to cool off from the heat."

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,453
You pulled out a bag
from your front pants pocket,

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,022
placed a pillow inside,
and attempted to exit the shop.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,427
You entered the shop
intending to steal, didn't you?

16
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,431
Given these facts,

17
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:10,136
it's clear that the theft of the pillow
was deliberate rather than impulsive.

18
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,807
It can't be denied the crime was malicious
with the potential for repetition.

19
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,241
That is all.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,179
Defense counsel, do you wish
to conduct a redirect examination?

21
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,086
I, Shinomiya, the defense counsel,
will ask another question.

22
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,121
The bag you carried,

23
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,958
wasn't it of personal significance to you?

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,261
Hyperventilation syndrome.

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,697
Three months ago,

26
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,167
you collapsed at Setagaya-Daita Station
on the Odakyu Line.

27
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,836
That's absurd.

28
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,705
I present evidence number 12,
as requested by the defense counsel.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,575
It's a diagnosis of the accused
by psychosomatic medicine.

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,446
After the accused collapsed
due to hyperventilation syndrome,

31
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:58,218
he began carrying a bag in his pocket
as an emergency treatment measure.

32
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,186
The paper bag method

33
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,655
is not presently endorsed
from a medical perspective.

34
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,724
However, in this instance,

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,729
the accused carried it
as a means of safeguarding his own life.

36
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,499
Therefore, his crime was not premeditated.

37
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,014
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

38
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,491
REFERENCE ROOM

39
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,194
DNA PROFILING TEST REPORT

40
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,418
How unusual.

41
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,987
Were you doing some research?

42
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,559
At this rate,
Hiyama's guilt will be established.

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,461
That's the report I've received.

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,967
I'm sure that is the outcome
the prosecution desires.

45
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,570
Those who have committed a crime

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,806
should face appropriate judgment.

47
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,841
Right?

48
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,810
That's the ideal.

49
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,615
The trial isn't over yet.

50
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,516
Excuse me.

51
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,654
<i>The murder weapon, huh?</i>

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,258
Apparently, a police officer who happened
to be patrolling the area found it.

53
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,695
It sounds too convenient
that it'd been found amid trial.

54
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,929
It's suspicious.

55
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,466
It was discovered on a dry riverbed
two kilometers away from the crime scene

56
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,268
and exposed to rain for three months.

57
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,737
Yet, they detected
the victim's blood on it.

58
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,139
Can blood linger that long?

59
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,274
I'm not sure.

60
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,210
I've heard blood on clothes
can still be detected

61
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,179
even after three washes with detergent.

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,550
The presence of Mr. Hanegi's blood
suggests it was used for the murder.

63
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,153
But even this isn't decisive evidence.

64
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,154
True.

65
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,590
The hammer belongs to Mr. Hiyama,

66
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,327
but the prosecution hasn't been able
to prove he used it for the murder.

67
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,729
Welcome back.

68
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,530
How did it go?

69
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,066
He'll get around two years, I think.

70
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,369
Thanks for getting
the diagnosis on short notice.

71
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,337
Linking it to hyperventilation
was a stretch,

72
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,141
but letting the old man die in prison
would've been too pitiful.

73
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,625
Misplaced it?

74
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,265
Mr. Hiyama misplaced
his hammer before the incident,

75
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,235
and someone else used it for the crime.

76
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
So, it was either stolen
or found by someone else.

77
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,606
Something like that, I imagine.

78
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,410
It was used without Mr. Hiyama's knowledge
or consent and happened to be found.

79
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,744
That's all there is to it.

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,012
No need to worry about it.

81
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,147
No need?

82
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,415
More importantly…

83
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,784
Mr. Aoyama.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,287
I did some digging on Mr. Himeno.

85
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,325
Every year, he receives commendations
from the Chief Prosecutor

86
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,592
for his achievements.

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,860
At the young age of 30,

88
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,364
he was appointed the Senior Prosecutor
for major incidents across a wide area.

89
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,266
He's clearly seen as promising.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,369
How is his background relevant?

91
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,338
Look at this.

92
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,973
Is this a list
of all the cases he's handled?

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,810
Yes, Mr. Akizumi looked this up.

94
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,484
The cases that required DNA tests

95
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,386
were nine in total.

96
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,489
All of which were handled
by Professor Tadao Nakajima

97
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,659
of Metropolitan Medical University,
who also worked on this case.

98
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,363
Professor Nakajima is
a leading authority in forensic medicine.

99
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,465
How is his involvement relevant?

100
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,468
Isn't it common
for investigative authorities

101
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,103
to consult the same expert?

102
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,874
The incident took place
on January 30th of this year.

103
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,778
Despite ample evidence,

104
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,081
the police repeatedly requested
Mr. Hiyama to come in voluntarily.

105
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,685
They also made multiple re-arrests
for minor offenses like property damage,

106
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,620
and took a long time to indict him.

107
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,189
This was clearly
at the instruction of the prosecutor.

108
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,092
So, they needed time until the indictment.

109
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,596
Was it to locate the murder weapon,
which would serve as decisive evidence?

110
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,497
Or maybe…

111
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,832
for another reason?

112
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,940
Prosecutors are creatures that
craft narratives to suit their purposes.

113
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,410
For instance…

114
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,213
Consider a scenario
where a capable prosecutor,

115
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,650
highly regarded by upper management,
is assigned to a homicide case.

116
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,720
<i>The suspect is most certainly the culprit.</i>

117
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,589
The upper management
believes he's 100% guilty.

118
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,592
But all they have
is circumstantial evidence

119
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,962
and they still lack decisive proof.

120
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,865
"What do I do?"

121
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,735
"As things stand, there's a great risk

122
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,572
<i>that the defense counsel
could overturn the existing evidence."</i>

123
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,309
This prosecutor,
precisely due to his competence,

124
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,180
is attracting attention and facing
immense pressure from his superiors.

125
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,048
Losing this case

126
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,852
could tarnish all the achievements
he's amassed thus far.

127
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,454
<i>So thinking,</i>

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,656
<i>he tells himself,</i>

129
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,359
"That man is undoubtedly guilty."

130
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,598
"For the sake of justice,
I must ensure his conviction."

131
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,567
"I know."

132
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,637
"If DNA evidence
is found on the victim's body,

133
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,973
such as under the nails,

134
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,844
it would be highly compelling evidence."

135
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,379
And so,

136
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,551
he directs the police
to resubmit samples for DNA testing.

137
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,853
At the same time,

138
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,857
he reaches out to a professor
with whom he's closely connected,

139
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,927
and requests tampering
with the DNA test results.

140
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,198
That would explain
the delay in making the indictment.

141
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,635
Requesting another round of testing
and inventing evidence from the results

142
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,470
would take considerable time.

143
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,806
The prosecution
would never engage in tampering.

144
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,641
But there is a precedent for this.

145
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,910
Over a decade ago,

146
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,613
there was a case
where a certain system was abused.

147
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,750
A Senior Prosecutor tampered
with evidence data on a floppy disk.

148
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,253
Even prosecutors are human.

149
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,722
Can you be confident
it won't happen again?

150
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,893
Even politicians,
meant to embody model citizens,

151
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,229
have been involved in numerous
egregious injustices and cover-ups.

152
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,798
Even the police have been guilty

153
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,101
of illegal investigations,
mistaken arrests,

154
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,637
and even ties with antisocial forces.

155
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,040
There's no reason to think
only the prosecution is innocent.

156
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,309
We should look into this.

157
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,211
On mere speculation?

158
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,112
Akamine.

159
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,017
Every discovery and invention in the world

160
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,153
are built on speculation and theories.

161
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,993
<i>Excuse me.</i>

162
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,330
What happened?

163
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,832
It seems Attorney Akizumi

164
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,336
has been digging into
your past trial records.

165
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,640
Why was he doing that?

166
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,475
Any ideas?

167
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,178
No.

168
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,752
Your hand.

169
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,487
You should stop that.

170
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,837
-We're a camera club.
-We're a camera club.

171
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,973
-Check it out.
-Check it out.

172
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,508
-We're a tennis club.
-I can still pass as a university student.

173
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,544
<i>The DNA test was conducted</i>

174
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,280
in the genetic testing room
at Metropolitan Medical University.

175
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,717
The first thing I need you to check
is the room's usage log.

176
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,519
You can find it
in the Research Management Section.

177
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,122
RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SECTION

178
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,190
Excuse me.

179
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,091
Yes?

180
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,161
I'd like to check the usage log
of the genetic testing room.

181
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,863
Your student ID, please?

182
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,298
Right.

183
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,642
Sorry, I think
I might've left it somewhere.

184
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,616
But I have a participation certificate
from the Genomics Conference

185
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,085
hosted by the National Society
of Forensic Medicine the other day.

186
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,620
Along with a group photo.

187
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,661
METROPOLITAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY
ASUKA SHINOMIYA

188
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,230
NATIONAL SOCIETY OF FORENSIC MEDICINE
GENOMICS CONFERENCE

189
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,410
All right.

190
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,778
Just a minute.

191
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,685
About that photo…

192
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,820
We got Mr. Aoyama to prepare it.

193
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,121
It's a composite photo.

194
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,425
We didn't fabricate a student ID,
so we're just skirting the law.

195
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,261
Don't let it show that you're disturbed.

196
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,365
I was terrified thinking what would happen
if they found out you took a photo.

197
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,001
The online career fair,

198
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,769
when's the deadline to apply for it?

199
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,670
Well…

200
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,872
As stated in the report, on February 1st,

201
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,910
a DNA test was carried out
right after the legally-ordered autopsy.

202
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,978
Mr. Aoyama, I've just sent it to you.

203
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,313
Hold on.

204
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,951
I see.

205
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,054
It seems the test was indeed
conducted on February 1st.

206
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,355
In that case,

207
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,225
the typical turnaround
for test results is about a week.

208
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,328
So, the prosecution
would likely receive them

209
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,465
around February 7th or 8th.

210
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,535
<i>But Mr. Hiyama's DNA
wasn't identified in this test.</i>

211
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,003
<i>That's our assumption, right?</i>

212
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,904
Yes.

213
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,673
This put pressure on the prosecution,

214
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,943
prompting them to ask
Professor Nakajima for another test

215
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,213
<i>to ensure that Mr. Hiyama's DNA
would appear.</i>

216
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,415
If they intended to tamper
with the results,

217
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,151
why bother with another test at all?

218
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,489
<i>DNA test reports are protected
with anti-copying watermarks,</i>

219
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,524
<i>making it difficult
to directly alter them.</i>

220
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,392
<i>If the original data is tampered with,</i>

221
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,330
<i>they say specialists
can easily detect artificial alterations.</i>

222
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,666
But how did they acquire Mr. Hiyama's DNA?

223
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,569
If the prosecution conducted a DNA test,

224
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:57,276
it implies they already had Mr. Hiyama
provide them with a DNA sample.

225
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,312
I see.

226
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,449
After all, they're comparing the skin
found under the victim's nails

227
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,621
with the voluntarily provided
DNA sample from Mr. Hiyama.

228
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,159
In other words, the prosecution
possesses Mr. Hiyama's DNA,

229
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,561
which they obtained
for a legitimate purpose.

230
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,229
I see.

231
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,231
They likely took Mr. Hiyama's DNA,

232
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,769
mixed it with the sample supposedly
collected from under the victim's nails,

233
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,138
and had Professor Nakajima
conduct another test.

234
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,074
This was carried out
in utmost secrecy, of course.

235
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,310
If another test was conducted

236
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,914
and the data was submitted
within the detention period…

237
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,882
The second test would have occurred

238
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,451
sometime between…

239
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,022
February 9th and 15th.

240
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:49,862
If the second test occurred
sometime between February 9th and 15th…

241
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,631
Professor Nakajima lectures
at another university

242
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,768
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
and those weren't canceled.

243
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,204
So, he could've only come
to the Medical University

244
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,472
on Monday, Thursday, and Friday.

245
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,277
And the only day the testing room was
available on one of these three days…

246
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,580
was the 15th.

247
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,616
There's an odd gap here.

248
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,819
This is probably
when the second test was conducted.

249
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,188
That would be it.

250
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,559
This is the research building.

251
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,169
No security cameras here.

252
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,203
GENETIC TESTING ROOM

253
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,277
It won't open unless we know the passcode.

254
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,115
Oh my, hello!

255
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,550
Are you here for some tests?

256
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,753
Well, we thought we'd do some prep.

257
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,122
Being a student is tough, huh?

258
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,192
Good luck and work hard for Japan.

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,761
-Thank you.
-No problem.

260
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,297
We'll do our best.

261
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,333
That gave me a fright.

262
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,638
The look on your face
when that lady appeared was priceless.

263
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,507
I never knew you could make
that expression, Shinomiya.

264
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,541
Oh my!

265
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,809
Good day.

266
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,211
Good day.

267
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,680
Um…

268
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,350
Are tests typically conducted
by the professor alone?

269
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,685
-Huh?
-I mean…

270
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,855
There's preparation to do,

271
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,124
and it must be
a lot of work for just one person.

272
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,328
And to do it without anyone noticing
sounds quite tricky.

273
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,666
I'll ask some students
in the forensic medicine classroom.

274
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,780
What? Professor Nakajima's assistant?

275
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,948
Exactly!

276
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,117
I'm studying DNA testing
at my graduate school,

277
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,554
and I was hoping Professor Nakajima
might be recruiting assistants.

278
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,823
Tough luck.
He always works with the same person.

279
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,591
What, really? Who?

280
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,961
What's the name again?
The dull-looking one.

281
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,329
Mito, the assistant professor.

282
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,965
A Nakajima research graduate
aspiring to become a professor.

283
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,199
Interesting.

284
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,735
By the way, about this Mito person…

285
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,404
I never knew she could smile like that.

286
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,609
-Here you go.
-Let me see…

287
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,278
Mito…

288
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,279
Isn't that Mito?

289
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,715
I see.

290
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,817
Mito is a nickname for Kentaro Miura.

291
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,619
Let's see what he teaches.

292
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,122
"Introduction
to Forensic Medicine Part One."

293
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,557
Just one class, huh?

294
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,593
Being an assistant professor
is pretty tough, huh?

295
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,429
You need to write a ton of papers
and reach full professorship

296
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,964
to make ends meet, apparently.

297
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,834
-The class should be ending soon, right?
-Yes.

298
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,535
I'll go talk to him.

299
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,838
-I'll join you.
-No need.

300
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,611
Ms. Shinomiya is so cool.

301
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,148
-I see.
-Thank you.

302
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,517
If you want to win her,
you should be ready.

303
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,652
Her dad's a detective.

304
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,454
-A detective?
-Yeah.

305
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,458
So she's the daughter of a detective.

306
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,160
I see.

307
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,562
It's not like that.

308
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,266
<i>Death Education</i>, right?

309
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,334
That's right.

310
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,770
I need to write a report

311
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,706
on biological death
and social death in forensic medicine.

312
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,775
When I asked
Professor Nakajima for advice,

313
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,778
he mentioned that the book
<i>Death Education</i> would be helpful.

314
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,847
And he said I could borrow it
from his bookshelf.

315
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:29,782
I see.

316
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,652
Excuse me.

317
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,220
Excuse me.

318
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:46,231
<i>Death Education</i> should be around here.

319
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,001
Here you go.

320
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,002
Thank you so much.

321
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,571
There's another book.

322
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,475
<i>Modern Forensic Medicine:
Second Revised Edition.</i>

323
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,414
Excuse me.

324
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,190
Found it.

325
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:12,991
Here.

326
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,195
-Take this too.
-Thank you.

327
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,630
I hope your report goes well.

328
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,531
Me too.

329
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,572
Wait.

330
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,941
Anything else?

331
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:33,779
I'm actually researching for a paper
on the latest DNA testing methods.

332
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,648
And I want some real DNA test data.

333
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,485
Is it possible for me
to observe an actual test?

334
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,456
I've heard that you assist
Professor Nakajima during tests.

335
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,458
I regret to say this,

336
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,629
but that's pretty tricky, especially
since it's related to criminal cases.

337
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,498
Of course.

338
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,432
You're right.

339
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,735
What about the samples
you used for testing

340
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,505
or detailed records of tests
that I could examine?

341
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,106
We return the samples,

342
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,510
and the test results
are all documented in the test report.

343
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>But we always print out the data
and save it as a file.</i>

344
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,750
<i>And the DNA sequencer itself
should retain the raw data.</i>

345
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,653
The data file of the DNA test?

346
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,554
That's right.

347
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,289
Anyway,

348
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,959
you managed to win over Mr. Miura
quite cleverly, didn't you?

349
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,830
Mr. Akizumi sent me this.

350
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,103
When I asked Mr. Miura to lend me
these books, he believed I was a student.

351
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,871
Mr. Akizumi is as impressive as ever.

352
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,108
You look like a university student.

353
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,910
I'm so embarrassed.

354
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,852
You must've been working late.

355
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,587
Early this year,

356
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,357
there was a homicide at a factory
called Hanegi Seiko in Ota Ward.

357
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,859
You're familiar with it, right?

358
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm Akizumi,
the defense counsel for the case.

359
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,599
What do you want?

360
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,369
I've been looking into the DNA test
conducted by Professor Nakajima.

361
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,138
I wasn't involved in that at all.

362
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,441
I want to check the detailed records
of the DNA test on Mr. Hanegi

363
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,976
conducted on February 1st.

364
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,578
May I ask for your cooperation?

365
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,514
They've been submitted to the prosecution.

366
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,116
So you are involved, after all.

367
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,651
No, I'm not.

368
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,687
It was a logical assumption.

369
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,588
Excuse me.

370
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,855
One last question.

371
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,023
What is it?

372
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,028
Where were you from 1 to 6 p.m.
on February 15th?

373
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,167
I'm in a rush. Excuse me.

374
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,282
Are you sure Mr. Miura will show up?

375
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,217
<i>His friends were mentioning</i>

376
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,655
that he's quite unhappy about
being an assistant to Professor Nakajima.

377
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,390
When did he investigate that?

378
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,692
He seemed frightened throughout.

379
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,029
When people are nervous
or under extreme stress,

380
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,632
they sometimes fidget
with what they're wearing.

381
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,236
He's probably been carrying
a lot of anxiety and fear.

382
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,171
You met Mr. Miura?

383
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,040
I unsettled him a bit last night.

384
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,442
But it's still just speculation.

385
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,379
If he realizes
he's suspected of illegal activity,

386
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,980
it should make him feel uneasy.

387
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,751
Then, he will become concerned
about the raw data of the test results

388
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,153
<i>and try to take it outside.</i>

389
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,555
If he won't let us into the testing room,

390
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,425
we'll need to get him to bring it to us.

391
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,295
The testing room
is available only now for today.

392
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,195
Well then,

393
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,431
let us wait.

394
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,601
And so, it falls on me again.

395
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,149
He's here.

396
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,984
He's here.

397
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,500
I guess I can't tell the passcode.

398
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,775
DNA TEST RESULTS

399
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,548
Hello.

400
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,718
I'm Akamine from the Akizumi Law Office.

401
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,986
Mr. Miura,

402
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,456
no test was scheduled for today.

403
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,124
<i>Why are you here?</i>

404
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,328
Were you looking for something?

405
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,697
What are you talking about?

406
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,400
Please show me the contents of your bag.

407
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,602
Hey!

408
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,870
Wait a minute!

409
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,086
It's not here.

410
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,658
I just came back for my stuff.

411
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,626
How dare you!

412
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,533
You're from a law office, right?

413
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,836
I'll report this to my superiors.

414
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,506
Excuse me.

415
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,575
I should've gone instead.

416
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,378
But he already
knows your face, Ms. Shinomiya.

417
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,913
Well, it's too late now.

418
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,818
Mr. Akizumi,
did you suspect this might happen?

419
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,955
I sincerely apologize.

420
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,858
Mr. Akizumi,

421
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,194
this is unacceptable behavior
from an attorney.

422
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,462
My apologies.

423
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,431
I had no idea he'd commit such a blunder.

424
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,967
He's young, yes,
but he definitely crossed a line.

425
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,804
I'll give him a stern reprimand.

426
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,871
If you'll excuse us.

427
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,110
Do you think a simple apology
will let you off the hook?

428
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,445
Is there something else?

429
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,081
What this man did is an insult to me.

430
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,650
Excuse me?

431
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,019
You're quite brazen yourself.

432
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,690
Your actions have greatly diminished
trust and order among attorneys.

433
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,791
Wouldn't you agree?

434
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,693
Quite.

435
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,496
I'll be bringing this matter
to the disciplinary committee.

436
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,999
I've known Attorney Kawana,
the chairperson, for quite some time now.

437
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,569
-If I speak--
-I'm impressed, Professor Nakajima.

438
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,404
You wield quite the authority.

439
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,972
And it's not just him.

440
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,142
I'll also be holding you
responsible as his supervisor.

441
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,045
By all means.

442
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,181
Now, if you'll excuse us.

443
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,115
Let's go.

444
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,821
I almost forgot.

445
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,690
Do send my regards.

446
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,660
To Prosecutor Himeno.

447
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,453
That wasn't fair, Mr. Akizumi.

448
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,122
You just tried to pin all the blame on me.

449
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,790
Did I?

450
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,692
What's our next move?

451
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,593
What do you mean?

452
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,664
The raw data evidence
has likely been destroyed.

453
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,234
If so, we won't be able to uncover
the tampering of the test results anymore.

454
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,938
At this rate, we'll really face
disciplinary action.

455
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:40,839
Don't worry.

456
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,542
We simply have to expose them
before the trial.

457
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,442
Still…

458
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,412
Excuse me, I have a place to stop by.

459
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,748
Come on.

460
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,585
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

461
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,620
You still have a long life ahead of you.

462
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,156
I don't know…

463
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,728
Listen, we can't have you
feeling down like this.

464
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,132
Here. The old lady confessed to the theft.

465
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,969
Also, the food and drinks you had
at the racetrack won't count as expenses.

466
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,438
And guess what? There's more.

467
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,539
She's a taskmaster.

468
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,141
If an attorney throws in the towel,

469
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,444
who's the client supposed to turn to?

470
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,685
Mr. Akizumi hasn't given up yet.

471
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:52,043
DRY CLEANER

472
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,419
<i>Did you come here alone?</i>

473
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,694
The DNA found under the victim's nails
might have been tampered with.

474
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,030
Tampered with?

475
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,366
During the investigation
by the prosecution,

476
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,468
did you consent to giving a DNA sample?

477
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,704
Basically,

478
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,575
the prosecution can do
as they want with your DNA.

479
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,044
If they mixed it in

480
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,447
with the sample collected
from under the victim's nails…

481
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,450
That can't be…

482
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,887
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,891
I'm here because
I was encouraged not to give up.

484
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:41,960
But

485
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,664
we couldn't get evidence of the tampering.

486
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,001
Mr. Akizumi will do something, won't he?

487
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,779
Mr. Hiyama,

488
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,249
may I ask you a question?

489
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,354
You didn't…

490
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,159
kill Mr. Hanegi, right?

491
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,596
No.

492
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,237
I…

493
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,976
came to this law office
because I admired Mr. Akizumi.

494
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,715
Six months ago,
he handled a false accusation case.

495
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,286
Seeing him save an innocent person,

496
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,289
I was inspired to be like him.

497
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,461
I wanted to help people too.

498
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,370
This case is the same, isn't it?

499
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,375
We're doing all this

500
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,512
to prove your innocence, right?

501
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,691
I…

502
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,172
Are you two finished?

503
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,473
Mr. Akizumi.

504
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,741
Mr. Hiyama,

505
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,643
don't worry.

506
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,514
There's no reason for you to be convicted.

507
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,719
Akamine,

508
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,858
I'll show you how to win a trial.

509
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,601
Regarding the murder weapon,
yes, it has been found.

510
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,305
But there's no evidence linking
the accused to its use in the murder.

511
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,973
That is all I can say.

512
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,842
It doesn't matter.

513
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,045
It's up to the lay judges to decide.

514
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,880
Later today,

515
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,083
I will be examining the witness
Professor Nakajima,

516
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,718
who conducted the DNA tests.

517
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,454
I plan to ask a few questions
during that session.

518
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,131
The DNA from the skin flake
discovered under the victim's nails

519
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,234
is a complete match
to the DNA of the accused.

520
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:40,371
The presence of the accused's skin
under the victim's nails

521
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,042
suggests there was a tussle
between the two.

522
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,577
Thank you.

523
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,612
That is all from me.

524
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,083
Defense counsel,
you may begin your cross-examination.

525
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,410
Professor,

526
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,348
you've been involved
in many investigations

527
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:27,252
concerning causes of death
as an authority in forensic medicine.

528
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,055
Is it accurate to say that genetic testing
was conducted exclusively

529
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,758
in the genetic testing room
within the Faculty of Medicine?

530
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,059
That is correct.

531
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,830
In this room that adheres
to strict hygiene and security protocols?

532
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,266
As I said, that is correct.

533
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,034
There would be no way for anyone outside

534
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,536
to know the specifics
of what happens inside, correct?

535
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,438
Listen.

536
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,875
Test results indicate the date
and are accompanied by the test data.

537
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,944
His DNA was found.

538
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,279
That has been established.

539
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,982
Now, now, let's not get impatient.

540
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,285
We have plenty of time.

541
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,390
The DNA test of the victim
was conducted on February 1st,

542
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,593
as stated in the test report.
Is that correct?

543
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,494
That's correct.

544
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,695
Was it just that once?

545
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,831
What are you getting at?

546
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,434
Defense counsel,
clarify the intent behind your questions.

547
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,936
Apologies.

548
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,738
I will be straightforward.

549
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,076
Professor, did you conduct DNA testing

550
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,246
not just once, but twice?

551
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,116
To refresh his memory,

552
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:36,321
I'd like to present evidence number 42
as requested by the defense counsel.

553
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,723
Please examine this document.

554
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,630
It's a record of DNA tests conducted
in the testing room

555
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,667
during the week
of February 9th to the 15th.

556
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,502
-It's just your standard record.
-It is.

557
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,739
There is nothing unusual about it.

558
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,507
However, take note of this.

559
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,878
On February 15th, between 1 and 6 p.m.,

560
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,848
there's a blank in the usage log.

561
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:09,687
A second round of testing
may have occurred during this time.

562
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,057
Professor Nakajima,
any comments regarding this?

563
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,364
What do you expect me to say?

564
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,099
I'm not sure what this is all about.

565
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,368
Is that so?

566
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,708
I, Shinomiya, of the defense counsel,

567
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,378
would like to clarify
the premise for this questioning.

568
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,947
As previously mentioned,

569
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,751
the genetic testing room
maintains strict hygiene protocols.

570
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,221
<i>Individuals entering the room are required
to wear designated white coats.</i>

571
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:48,092
<i>And once used, these coats
are placed in a cart for weekly cleaning.</i>

572
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,996
Professor,
is my information correct so far?

573
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,032
It is.

574
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,833
In order to refresh his memory,

575
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,038
I will present evidence number 43
as requested by the defense counsel.

576
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,574
Take a look at this document.

577
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:09,480
The room was used 18 times
by a total of 33 individuals.

578
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:14,352
Therefore, there should be 33 coats
collected from the cart.

579
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,556
However, for some reason,
35 coats were collected.

580
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,824
COLLECTION RECORD

581
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,395
I directly confirmed this information
with the cleaning dealer responsible.

582
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,442
Wait a minute.

583
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,045
Are you suggesting I conducted
another test based solely on that?

584
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,149
There's no evidence we used
those two coats for another test.

585
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,653
Your Honor, are you going to allow this?

586
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,456
By the way,

587
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:56,294
what were you doing
between 1 and 6 p.m. on February 15th?

588
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,797
During that time on Thursday,

589
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,899
I had a meeting
with Assistant Professor Miura.

590
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,835
Is that so?

591
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,705
That came out quite smoothly,
almost as if you had rehearsed it.

592
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,374
Did you perhaps anticipate this question?

593
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,444
I have meetings with him
at this time every Thursday.

594
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,246
You'll see if you ask Miura yourself.

595
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,415
Well, I did.

596
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,517
I did ask him.

597
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,428
Now, I would like to request new evidence.

598
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,796
Wait a minute!

599
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,465
This hasn't been disclosed
to the prosecution in advance.

600
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,334
This cannot be acknowledged!

601
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,503
The prosecutor is right.

602
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,505
Introducing new evidence at this stage--

603
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,772
This is crucial evidence

604
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,810
that will completely overturn
Professor Nakajima's test results.

605
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,580
I apologize for the delayed request
as it was obtained at the last minute.

606
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:54,051
However, disregarding this evidence would
not only hinder the discovery of truth,

607
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,621
but also harm the integrity of this trial.

608
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,657
In order to prevent a false accusation,
I urge you to allow this.

609
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,591
That's sophistry!

610
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,560
Your Honor,

611
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,863
I ask you not to be misled by an attorney
with no respect for the rules.

612
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,432
Please render a fair judgment.

613
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,139
Prosecutor,

614
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,376
do you still have more to say?

615
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,647
Still more to say?

616
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,286
Preventing a false accusation
is the primary objective of a trial.

617
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,690
Your responsibility is to examine
the evidence and offer your opinion on it.

618
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,959
Is that understood?

619
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,269
Now, I will play the footage
of evidence number 48,

620
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,673
as requested by the defense counsel.

621
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,874
Please watch the video.

622
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:56,414
<i>Professor Nakajima asked you
to provide an alibi for him</i>

623
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,886
<i>by claiming that you were having
a meeting with him on February 15th.</i>

624
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,355
<i>Is this correct?</i>

625
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,457
<i>Mr. Miura?</i>

626
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,259
<i>Yes.</i>

627
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,528
<i>That's correct.</i>

628
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,865
<i>Was this request made</i>

629
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,302
<i>in order to conduct another DNA test
with the professor in secret?</i>

630
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,239
<i>That's right.</i>

631
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,375
<i>Considering your position,</i>

632
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,777
<i>you could not disobey the professor.</i>

633
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,447
<i>That's right.</i>

634
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,952
<i>Why did you choose
to come forward with the truth?</i>

635
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,756
<i>As someone involved in forensic medicine,</i>

636
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,226
<i>I couldn't remain silent.</i>

637
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,865
<i>Thank you for your courageous act
of whistle-blowing.</i>

638
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,339
Professor,

639
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,676
this is Mr. Miura's testimony
that you wanted.

640
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,877
Stop messing around!

641
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,348
You coerced him
into providing false testimony!

642
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,916
Bring him here!

643
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,252
He was intimidated
by your high-handed manner,

644
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,321
which is why
he provided a video testimony.

645
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,090
As a precaution,

646
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,827
I have also prepared a written statement
signed by Mr. Miura himself.

647
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,031
I will later request this as evidence
for the same reasons

648
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,966
as the footage just now.

649
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,168
Along with
a handwriting analysis certificate.

650
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,538
Order.

651
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,073
By the way,

652
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,008
the raw data of the test results

653
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,112
has already been suppressed
by Professor Nakajima.

654
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,581
However, evidence of tampering remains

655
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:42,687
as it has been personally duplicated
and stored by Mr. Miura.

656
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:48,626
As the defense counsel, I urge Your Honor
to verify this firsthand ex-officio.

657
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,296
Wouldn't you agree, Professor Nakajima?

658
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,666
As you can all discern by now,

659
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:01,305
the accused's DNA was never present
under the victim's nails to begin with.

660
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,108
However, through deliberate manipulation,

661
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,411
you made the accused's DNA appear
in a second round of testing.

662
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,082
I imagine you only did
as you were instructed.

663
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,986
Did you receive financial compensation
from the prosecution for this?

664
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,192
You were seeking instruction
on what to do just now.

665
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,693
N-No!

666
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,794
Prosecutor,

667
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,666
you failed to gather sufficient evidence
to indict the accused.

668
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,235
And so you resorted
to such underhanded tactics.

669
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,537
That is baseless speculation!

670
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,339
I might as well conjecture

671
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,109
that you've employed
similar methods in the past.

672
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,345
After all, this method can be used
as many times as you wish.

673
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:48,252
In Japan's criminal case trials,
the conviction rate stands at 99.9%,

674
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,888
a fact often depicted in dramas.

675
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,759
In other words, when a prosecutor
brings charges against someone,

676
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,528
their conviction is almost guaranteed.

677
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,532
However, the weight
of this statistic does not fall most

678
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,401
on us attorneys.

679
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,870
But on the prosecutors.

680
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,474
"Japan's investigative agencies
won't make a wrongful arrest."

681
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,512
People believe in their competency
and the trust cannot be destroyed.

682
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,882
Prosecutors feel compelled
to secure convictions.

683
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,453
They are burdened
by obligations that don't exist.

684
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,089
This pressure took a toll on this man,

685
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,626
leading to his unlawful actions.

686
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,232
Don't we all have such experiences?

687
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,871
Anyone belonging to an organization
must know what it's like to bend yourself

688
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,507
to conform to mindsets
established by the whole.

689
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,913
You suppress your own feelings
for your livelihoods and families.

690
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,117
It is difficult to oppose rules
that are already in place.

691
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,520
Mr. Hiyama didn't speak out
against power harassment,

692
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,657
and Mr. Ogata kept concealing
his hearing impairment.

693
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,227
They did so to survive.
It couldn't be helped.

694
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,364
Unfortunately, that is the reality
of Japan's current society.

695
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:14,705
However, we and all individuals involved
in the administration of justice,

696
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,708
must never forget for a moment
that they hold the power

697
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,376
to determine someone's fate.

698
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,350
A distorted perspective can unjustly rob
the life of an innocent person

699
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,853
who simply seeks a quiet life.

700
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,422
We must never let that happen!

701
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,593
Your Honor,

702
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,696
the same holds true for you.

703
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,866
You must not become consumed
with simply completing trials,

704
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,035
and neglect to question the evidence
presented by the prosecution

705
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,737
before rendering your judgments.

706
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,107
Otherwise, you won't be fulfilling
your duties.

707
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,881
This court is where people judge others,

708
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,084
and it should be a place
where fair judgments prevail.

709
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,653
That is my earnest wish.

710
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,270
Fair judgments.

711
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,540
32-YEAR-OLD MAN CONVICTED
IN INJURY CASE IN SHIBUYA WARD

712
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,707
MR. MATSUNAGA IS INNOCENT

713
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,875
REAL CULPRIT IS SHOICHIRO!!

714
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,411
Thank you all for today.

715
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,712
The court is now adjourned.

716
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,118
Mr. Akizumi,

717
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,320
how did you get Mr. Miura to cooperate?

718
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,831
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

719
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,466
<i>I wasn't involved in that at all.</i>

720
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,437
We will investigate the professor's
unlawful testing practices in court.

721
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,839
We're even considering
exposing this to the media.

722
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,174
If that happens,

723
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,078
you'll also be accused as an accomplice.

724
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:11,922
I read the latest paper on DNA profiling
employing haplotype analysis.

725
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,528
It was submitted
under Professor Nakajima's name,

726
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,431
but you're the actual author, aren't you?

727
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,068
How do you know?

728
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:28,205
Writing habits are evident in text,
and not just in handwriting.

729
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,410
A writer's habits appear in typed content
and even in English texts.

730
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,581
When using negative sentences,
Professor Nakajima uses words

731
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:42,052
like "can't" and "didn't"
and abbreviates them.

732
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,487
On the other hand…

733
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,957
you tend to write "can not."

734
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:51,629
You write "not" individually
to emphasize a strong negative.

735
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,530
As if to say

736
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,934
that this wasn't written
by Professor Nakajima.

737
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,671
This was written by you.

738
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,575
From this paper as well,

739
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,712
I can see well
that you're highly competent.

740
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,613
However,

741
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,783
the professor will never
acknowledge your talents.

742
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,121
He prefers to keep someone
as skilled as you under his control

743
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,690
and continue to take advantage of you.

744
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:25,796
It's often superiors like him who claim,
"I'm acting in your best interest."

745
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,433
What will you do?

746
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,405
Will you continue to be
the professor's accomplice?

747
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,575
If that is your decision,

748
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,911
I will pursue you both…

749
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,014
to the ends of the earth.

750
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,053
<i>Does that mean…</i>

751
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,723
<i>you anticipated his decision
to expose the professor?</i>

752
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,826
He simply chose his own future.

753
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,400
Mr. Akizumi, about this trial…

754
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,702
Please share your comments.

755
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,804
The prosecutor
may have fabricated evidence

756
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,972
in collaboration
with a forensic scientist.

757
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,777
This is a blatant affront
to the judicial system of our nation.

758
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,213
It's something that should never happen.

759
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,017
The prosecution will probably claim
that Mr. Himeno acted alone

760
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,520
and firmly deny any involvement.

761
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,690
But I wonder if others
were truly unaware of these actions.

762
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,358
Excuse me.

763
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,561
-Mr. Akizumi!
-Mr. Akizumi!

764
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,616
<i>I will now deliver the verdict.</i>

765
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,421
The decision.

766
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,022
The accused…

767
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,325
is found innocent.

768
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,029
Next, I will explain
the reasoning behind this verdict.

769
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,432
I ask the accused
to listen to this while seated.

770
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,803
The reasoning behind this verdict.

771
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,474
This incident took place
on January 30th, 2024, around 9:40 p.m.,

772
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,211
at 7-6-1 Omori-kita, Ota Ward, Tokyo,

773
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,847
at the residence of Asao Hanegi.

774
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,117
The accused worked
at Hanegi Seiko Corporation,

775
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:31,421
which was headed by Asao Hanegi,
54 years old at the time.

776
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,259
The accused allegedly struck him
from behind with the intent to murder…

777
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,673
Stop here!

778
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,842
-Stop here!
-Mr. Hiyama!

779
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,511
You're on your own from here.

780
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,046
Mr. Hiyama!

781
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,347
Mr. Akizumi,

782
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,950
as an attorney,
how do you see this verdict?

783
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,252
It was indeed a challenging case.

784
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,723
But I believe the court has reached
an appropriate judgment.

785
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,659
<i>Later investigations uncovered</i>

786
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,662
<i>a monetary transaction
between Prosecutor Himeno</i>

787
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,364
<i>and Professor Nakajima
of Metropolitan Medical University.</i>

788
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,733
<i>Mr. Yashiro, was Professor Nakajima</i>

789
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,071
<i>instructed by Prosecutor Himeno
to alter the test report?</i>

790
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,140
<i>This is quite unprecedented.</i>

791
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,242
<i>Fabricating evidence in a trial and…</i>

792
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,412
Things are really blowing up.

793
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,048
The prosecution will probably
appeal the verdict, though.

794
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,984
They'll want to convict Mr. Hiyama
by any means necessary.

795
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,388
This case is only the beginning.

796
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,257
Did I sound like him?

797
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,792
I've always wanted to try.

798
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,293
That was pretty good.

799
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
Right?

800
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,432
<i>I sincerely apologize.</i>

801
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,804
As his supervisor, Prosecutor Himeno's
conduct falls under my responsibility.

802
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,777
It's not your fault.

803
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,618
Once you start seeking power,
there's no turning back, is there?

804
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,622
It demands a significant commitment,

805
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,257
but it seems that Himeno…

806
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,592
lacked it a little.

807
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,527
It appears so.

808
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,464
Organizations are so terrifying.

809
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,767
"The prosecution must uphold justice."

810
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,003
"You must secure a conviction
no matter what."

811
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,841
I've never said
anything like that, though.

812
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,610
Do I come across as that frightening?

813
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,649
Regarding Attorney Akizumi,

814
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,351
you knew of him.

815
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,924
He's famous, after all.

816
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,392
He's good-looking too.

817
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,396
He's the type of person the media adores.

818
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,564
But…

819
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,133
he's a little…

820
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,567
<i>His acquittal--</i>

821
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,204
Annoying, isn't he?

822
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,360
Pull over here.

823
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,599
I'll leave my stuff here,
so wait a while for me.

824
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,701
Sure.

825
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,197
INDUSTRIAL WASTE

BRING YOUR WASTE

827
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,136
Mr. Hiyama!

828
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:45,976
Um,

829
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:47,811
is that…

830
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,265
You knew the truth from the start.

831
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,805
Mr. Hiyama committed a crime.

832
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,513
He committed murder!

833
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,084
Even though he was your client…

834
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,623
Did you have to go to such lengths
to secure an acquittal?

835
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,263
I struggle to understand

836
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,866
where your sense of justice lies.

837
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,136
Justice…

838
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:29,839
huh?

839
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:48,892
What if…

840
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,796
your precious family

841
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,632
had their lives threatened?

842
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,437
Imagine this.

843
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,206
A man with a knife…

844
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,012
is about to kill your precious family.

845
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,582
And you…

846
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,187
have a knife capable of killing him.

847
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,825
What would you do, Akamine?

848
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,895
Will you kill the man…

849
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,599
to protect your family?

850
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,271
Why do you ask?

851
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,207
Just curious.

852
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,882
I'll kill him.

853
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,289
Someone compelled to kill

854
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,792
in order to save a loved one.

855
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,795
Someone who attempted…

856
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,033
to kill another
with malicious intent but failed.

857
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,170
Whose crime carries greater weight?

858
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,241
I wonder,

859
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,977
what is justice?

860
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,862
I respect your decision.

861
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,832
You should do as you like.

862
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,437
However…

863
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:45,542
just as you will stick
to your sense of justice,

864
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,514
I will also follow my own path.

865
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,196
There's a letter for you.

866
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,664
Says he wants to pay a visit.

867
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,810

SAYA LOOKS CUTE IN THE PICTURE

00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,106
-Welcome back, Saya!
-Hey!

871
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:58,808
It's good to be back.

872
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,677
Let's go inside and play.

873
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,978
Sure!

Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

876
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,580
Your actions are no different
from those of a criminal.

877
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:14,083
They thrive on scandals
involving politicians and their children.

878
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,686
Are you doing this
to pin guilt on an innocent person?
