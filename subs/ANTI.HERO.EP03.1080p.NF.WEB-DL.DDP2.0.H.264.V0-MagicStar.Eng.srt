1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,805
The accused is found innocent.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>Mr. Hiyama committed a crime.</i>

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,011
<i>He committed murder!</i>

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,481
I struggle to understand
where your sense of justice lies.

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,150
<i>Seeing him save an innocent person,</i>

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,219
<i>I was inspired to be like him.</i>

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>I respect your decision.</i>

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,056
<i>However,</i>

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,993
just as you will stick
to your sense of justice,

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,463
I will also follow my own path.

11
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,005
-Um…
-Ms. Shiraki.

12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,175
Do you have the details regarding
the Shinagawa injury case?

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,309
Um,

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,478
you mean Shoichiro Tomita's case, right?

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,548
I've placed them
in the shared folder for the other two.

16
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,116
I'll send them over later.

17
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,351
I'll appreciate that.

18
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,223
CLIENT: SHOICHIRO TOMITA

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,133
I saw the news.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,536
You've been appearing on TV a lot lately.

21
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,938
It's a bit embarrassing for me, you know?

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,374
Could you at least shave cleanly?

23
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,375
Sorry about that.

24
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,014
NPO DOG SHELTER
WAN HAPPY

25
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,691
COURTHOUSE

26
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,828
As stated in the indictment,

27
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,432
this injury case took place on March 8th.

28
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,569
The location of the crime is the alley
beside CLUB 1000 in Shinagawa Ward.

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,041
<i>The victim, Mr. Hirokazu Kudo,
exited the club at 11:45 p.m.</i>

30
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,179
<i>Immediately afterward,
a man shoved him from behind</i>

31
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>and assaulted him.</i>

32
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,683
<i>The assailant was wearing a hoodie
and his face was concealed.</i>

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,286
<i>However, just before
Mr. Kudo lost consciousness,</i>

34
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,590
<i>he claims to have seen the face
of the accused, Shoichiro Tomita.</i>

35
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,895
The decision to indict the accused
is supported by three factors.

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,598
Firstly, the victim's testimony
claims he identified the accused.

37
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,633
Secondly,

38
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,236
<i>there is evidence of a heated argument
between the accused and Mr. Kudo.</i>

39
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,472
My bad. Don't be so upset.

40
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,207
You don't want to escalate this.

41
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,309
Especially for your daddy's sake.

42
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>Multiple testimonies from club customers
support this claim.</i>

43
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,681
We believe the accused's anger

44
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,450
toward the victim's behavior
motivated the assault.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,686
We have also verified that there have been

46
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,690
similar conflicts between the accused
and the victim in the past.

47
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,327
Finally, the third factor
is the testimony provided by Mr. A.

48
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,830
He was the first to arrive at the scene
and also witnessed their argument.

49
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,835
<i>Mr. A saw the accused
leaving shortly after Mr. Kudo did,</i>

50
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,938
<i>seemingly following Mr. Kudo.</i>

51
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,943
<i>About three minutes later,
when Mr. A left the club,</i>

52
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,379
<i>he saw the accused
heading toward the main street.</i>

53
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,583
<i>Suspecting that something
might have occurred between the two,</i>

54
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,018
<i>Mr. A headed in the direction
the accused had come from.</i>

55
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,788
<i>There, he found the victim
who had been assaulted.</i>

56
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,424
-Are you okay?
-<i>Mr. A promptly called for an ambulance.</i>

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,693
<i>And the victim
was transported to the hospital.</i>

58
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,130
<i>Mr. A's call was made at 11:48 p.m.</i>

59
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,733
This is documented
by the Fire Command Center.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,203
Therefore, we believe the accused
assaulted the victim

61
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,973
within this three-minute window.

62
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,609
This concludes
the prosecution's opening statement.

63
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,510
Next,

64
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,381
defense counsel,
present your opening statement.

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,154
I, Akizumi, of the defense counsel,
will deliver the opening statement.

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,760
The accused acknowledges there was
indeed an argument with the victim.

67
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:24,631
However, he maintains
his innocence in this case.

68
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,033
At the time of the incident…

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,970
<i>The accused received a call
from his friend, Mr. Tomoya Kida,</i>

70
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,741
<i>who had arrived to pick him up by car,
and so left the club.</i>

71
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,909
<i>He proceeded to the main street</i>

72
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,313
<i>and entered Mr. Kida's car
parked by the shoulder.</i>

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
<i>They then headed directly
to Mr. Kida's residence.</i>

74
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:49,155
Both of their smartphones have records
of a call at 11:45 p.m.

75
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,991
The club's security camera footage
also captures the accused

76
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,028
answering his phone
and engaging in conversation.

77
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,030
Mr. Kida has also testified

78
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,366
that Mr. Shoichiro entered his car
immediately after the call.

79
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,338
This concludes the proceedings
scheduled for today.

80
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,941
The focus will be on assessing
the credibility of each testimony.

81
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,177
Cross-examinations for each witness

82
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,212
will proceed as scheduled
in future trials.

83
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,016
<i>The son of Diet member Tomita, huh?</i>

84
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,218
The public must be in an uproar.

85
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,922
They thrive on scandals
involving politicians and their children.

86
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,059
But I disapprove of how the media

87
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,530
only seems to push
for power limitation during such episodes.

88
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,037
Can you handle Attorney Akizumi?

89
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,106
There's no need to worry.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,010
It's clear that Shoichiro Tomita
has committed a crime.

91
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,945
Besides,

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,082
I don't agree
with Attorney Akizumi's efforts.

93
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,220
To secure an acquittal for a murderer…

94
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,723
That's something…

95
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,361
that should never be allowed, right?

96
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,564
Yes.

97
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,133
DARK DONUT

98
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,074
Is this okay?

99
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,910
Here's your change and receipt.

100
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,746
-Thank you.
-<i>How's Mr. Akamine?</i>

101
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,348
<i>He seems conflicted about our policy.</i>

102
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,685
He must have come here
with his own agenda.

103
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,886
You're right.

104
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,323
I suppose we'll wait and see for now?

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,224
Yes.

106
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,129
<i>Tap your card.</i>

107
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,633
-Thank you.
-Mr. Matsunaga…

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,335
Next in line, please.

109
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,748
-How would you like to pay?
-By cash.

110
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,335
Mr. Kudo was shoved from behind
into this alley.

111
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,005
So, this is where he was assaulted.

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,074
He sustained
a compound fracture in his left arm.

113
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,576
Head injuries too.

114
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,778
My apologies.

115
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,449
I was occupied with another case
and only saw the details this morning.

116
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,684
Sorry, I didn't mean to sound accusing.

117
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,188
I'll be heading inside first.

118
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,088
Right.

119
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,033
As mentioned in the report,
there are no cameras outside.

120
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,436
Mr. Kida's car was parked over there
after a right turn.

121
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,639
There were no cameras capturing
vehicles on that street either.

122
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,976
Can you believe there are still cars
without dashcams?

123
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,379
Can I see the cameras
at Mr. Kida's apartment?

124
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,282
Here.

125
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,419
This is it.

126
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:12,225
It's clear that Mr. Shoichiro and Mr. Kida
passed through the lobby at midnight.

127
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,296
It's about a 15-minute drive
to the apartment from here.

128
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,032
If they left at 11:48 p.m.,
they'd have 12 minutes.

129
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,835
They could compensate
for the three minutes by rushing.

130
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,736
You know…

131
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,704
Yes?

132
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,606
Mr. Shoichiro is the client.

133
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,459
People who get to hang out here
must be living it up.

134
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,793
Are you jealous?

135
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,728
No.

136
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,197
That's a stereotype.

137
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,234
It's like assuming
all attorneys are intelligent,

138
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,636
which isn't accurate.

139
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,472
People might appear
to be enjoying themselves.

140
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,774
But they could be concealing
enough stress to snap

141
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,910
and beat someone to death at any moment.

142
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,511
That's just how humans are.

143
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,047
My apologies for the delay.

144
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,415
Thank you for your time.

145
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,951
I'm Mikami, the manager.

146
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,254
What brings you here today?

147
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,826
The victim Mr. Kudo?

148
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,727
Yes.

149
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,097
We've heard he was verbally abusing
Mr. Shoichiro Tomita.

150
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,868
Do you know if Mr. Kudo has been
treating others in a similar manner?

151
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,237
He has.

152
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,705
To be frank,

153
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,275
maybe because he runs his own company,
he's quite proud.

154
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,411
It's not a large company though.

155
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,913
Whenever he meets someone
seemingly more important…

156
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,486
I'll try to collect
more negative gossip about Mr. Kudo.

157
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,756
It could help undermine the credibility
of motives and testimonies.

158
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:51,657
Right.

159
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,727
Let's begin interviewing
the regulars tomorrow.

160
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,628
Mr. Akamine?

161
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,396
Um… right.

162
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,003
Here's the information I've collected
about Mr. Kudo over the past few days.

163
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,541
He's regarded by many
CLUB 1000 customers as a troublemaker.

164
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,409
They've testified that his verbal abuse

165
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:14,013
and boastful remarks
are a daily occurrence.

166
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,252
There may be more than one person
who holds a grudge against him.

167
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,424
Akamine, do you have something to say?

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,894
No.

169
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,398
I'll look into the crime scene further
before the next trial.

170
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,668
If we can find information
on the real culprit,

171
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,937
it should greatly aid
in solving this case.

172
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,939
Right.

173
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:40,873
You do that.

174
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,575
I will.

175
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,182
The assault took place here…

176
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,256
And Shoichiro got into the car here.

177
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,290
But…

178
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,362
HARAGUROYA

179
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,532
Lucky them.

180
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,180
This is the car.

181
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,987
It really doesn't have a dashcam.

182
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,790
Maybe it was removed after the incident.

183
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,495
Who are you?

184
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,897
Well…

185
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,399
I was just admiring the car.

186
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,702
Excuse me.

187
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,344
You're still here.

188
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,081
I have to prepare
for the defense team meeting next week

189
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,916
regarding the food poisoning case.

190
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,918
You have a lot on your plate.

191
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,521
So, any compelling evidence?

192
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,257
No.

193
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,760
I couldn't find any.

194
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,666
Mr. Akizumi and the prosecution
have conducted investigations already.

195
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,868
-It's only natural that--
-Ms. Shinomiya…

196
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,273
Who do you think is the real culprit

197
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,342
in this incident?

198
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,946
We have the victim and Mr. A
as two eyewitnesses.

199
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,014
Are you saying Mr. Shoichiro did it?

200
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,384
I'm saying simply exposing
Mr. Kudo's personality

201
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,719
isn't substantial evidence.

202
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,522
This is Mr. Akizumi. He must have a plan.

203
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,557
Ms. Shinomiya,

204
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,694
why are you so obedient to him?

205
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,198
Because I want to understand
his viewpoint better.

206
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,541
THE SECOND PUBLIC TRIAL

207
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,842
On the day of the incident,

208
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,679
Mr. Shoichiro Tomita, the accused,
claimed he was insulted by you.

209
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,947
Is this true?

210
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:02,848
No.

211
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,751
The manager and regulars of CLUB 1000

212
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,823
have testified that you have previously
caused disturbances with other customers.

213
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,158
Is this correct?

214
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,426
I've been involved in some disagreements,

215
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,262
but I've never caused any big trouble.

216
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,998
A brief investigation revealed
at least four incidents

217
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,299
in the past two months.

218
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,301
I don't recall.

219
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,537
You don't? Even though you caused them?

220
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,971
Your Honor.

221
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,041
The intent
behind his questions is unclear.

222
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,977
Defense counsel,
clarify the intent behind your questions.

223
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,915
You claim not to recall events
from the past two months.

224
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,819
How then can you give a clear account
of the incident from a month ago?

225
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,054
I was assaulted.

226
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,256
It's natural that I remember that clearly.

227
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,125
The incident took place late at night.

228
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,693
Wasn't it dark?

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,361
There was light from the club.

230
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,698
And this light allowed you
to see your assailant's face clearly?

231
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,599
That's right.

232
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,500
Where was this light?

233
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,602
In the alley beside the club.

234
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,339
I see.

235
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,310
Your Honor, to clarify
the witness' statement,

236
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,147
I would like to present a video
taken at the crime scene.

237
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,283
But the evidence
hasn't been examined yet, right?

238
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,384
What is it?

239
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:17,022
I received permission from Mr. Mikami,
the manager of CLUB 1000,

240
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,026
to recreate the situation
of the crime scene at the time.

241
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,461
Prosecutor, your stance?

242
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,965
I will examine it,
then provide my opinion.

243
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,647
We filmed this at the same hour
as when the incident occurred

244
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,916
and recreated the situation.

245
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,620
The camera replicates the perspective
of Mr. Kudo, the victim.

246
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,927
Mr. Kudo, after leaving the club,

247
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,062
you walked toward the alley,
is that correct?

248
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,297
Yes.

249
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,287
You claimed you saw
the accused's face at this moment.

250
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,187
Wait.

251
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,623
It wasn't this dark when I was assaulted.

252
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,891
There was a light!

253
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,428
There was indeed
a motion sensor light at the crime scene.

254
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,264
However,
according to Mr. Mikami, the manager,

255
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:37,169
on the night of the incident,
the light was broken and didn't work.

256
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,237
That's impossible!

257
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,606
It was clearly noted
on the fixture list as well.

258
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,842
Three days after the incident,
the sensor light was replaced.

259
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,778
That's too convenient…

260
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,679
A moment, please.

261
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,950
It may not have been as dark
when the incident took place.

262
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,352
But you can't prove
it was brighter either, can you?

263
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,087
I saw what I saw!

264
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,189
This man assaulted me!

265
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,226
By the way, what color is the hoodie
worn by the man playing the culprit?

266
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,161
Huh?

267
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,662
It's black.

268
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,030
Are you sure?

269
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,348
Our perception can be deceiving.

270
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,085
And memories are shaped
by bias and preconceptions.

271
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,687
If we're not careful,

272
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,957
we could invent a culprit
who's actually innocent.

273
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,408
We're back.

274
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,010
-We're back.
-Welcome back.

275
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,481
If you had told me,
I could've assisted as well.

276
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,618
Mr. Akizumi wanted to let you
focus on your other case.

277
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,754
-And let Mr. Akamine investigate too.
-No.

278
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,794
Mr. Akizumi…

279
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,731
Will you secure
another acquittal for a criminal?

280
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,336
You didn't tell us

281
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,005
about that video in advance.

282
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,576
That's because Mr. Mikami was bribed
to testify in your favor, right?

283
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,578
When the crime took place,

284
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,947
the light should've been working fine.

285
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,650
But…

286
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,521
Seiji Tomita paid him off

287
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,891
to testify in our favor, didn't he?

288
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,660
Seiji Tomita?

289
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,829
You mean Mr. Shoichiro's father?

290
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,831
And to conceal that,

291
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,700
you kept the video from us.

292
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,036
The fixture list too.

293
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,209
Shoichiro probably bribed him
to make their stories match.

294
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,079
Even the car had a dashcam,

295
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,914
but you told him to remove it!

296
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,881
Hmm.

297
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,984
That's a good theory,
fitting for an attorney.

298
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,622
And…

299
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,691
what's your basis?

300
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,563
It resembles the previous incident.

301
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,765
Previous?

302
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,903
Before joining this office…

303
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,343
I was assigned
to Shoichiro Tomita's injury case.

304
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,246
But even then,

305
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,684
his father, a member of the Diet,
used money to cover up his son's crime.

306
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,492
<i>It was a case of injury,
much like this one.</i>

307
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,559
Stop it!

308
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,461
You're going too far!

309
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,730
<i>I tried desperately to stop him!</i>

310
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,133
It wasn't me.

311
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,834
It was Shoichiro!

312
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,105
<i>The next day,
the police showed up at my home</i>

313
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,074
<i>and suddenly arrested me.</i>

314
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,877
Everyone who was there said I did it!

315
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,546
<i>Later, one of his friends told me</i>

316
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,983
that Shoichiro's father
was throwing money around

317
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,286
to make the people involved
change their testimonies.

318
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,690
But the friend was too scared
to come forward and testify.

319
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,225
That's why…

320
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,227
No. Try to get a lesser sentence.

321
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,228
Why?

322
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,564
Because we're dealing
with the son of a politician?

323
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,299
Shoichiro is the one who did it!

324
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,302
<i>The office I worked at
was put under pressure,</i>

325
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,271
<i>and I was removed from the case.</i>

326
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,939
The decision.

327
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,875
The accused is sentenced
to two years in prison.

328
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,412
The execution of the sentence
will be suspended for five years

329
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,980
from the day it becomes final.

330
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,015
Wait!

331
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,050
Mr. Matsunaga is innocent!

332
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,285
Spectator, quiet down.

333
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,253
Your Honor, please review this document.

334
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,688
I order him to leave!

335
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,525
They'll use money to cover up
anything inconvenient to them.

336
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,260
That's what politicians do.

337
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,365
Shoichiro is using his father
and laughing about it as we speak.

338
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,837
You're aware that Seiji Tomita
is making people change their testimonies,

339
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,839
and yet you took on this case.

340
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,509
What's your purpose?

341
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,379
That's why you started the investigation

342
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,149
with doubts about the client,
Mr. Shoichiro.

343
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,651
I understand your point.

344
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,088
But that's not a theory.
It's just wild fancy.

345
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,758
Baseless fancy
doesn't hold up in the legal world.

346
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,928
Do you have evidence that Seiji Tomita
was distributing money?

347
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,763
Or that Mr. Mikami accepted the money

348
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,533
and altered his testimony
to fit the narrative?

349
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,401
Well…

350
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,505
If you can't substantiate your claims
with evidence, it's just baloney.

351
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,210
The fact that Mr. Matsunaga was convicted

352
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,580
isn't the fault of Japan's justice system,
your law office, the court,

353
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,816
or even Diet member Tomita.

354
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,752
It's on you as the defense counsel.

355
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,191
The outcome of a trial
decides the fate of the client.

356
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,596
That's why we attorneys
must dedicate our lives to winning them.

357
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,867
You simply lacked
the commitment and skills necessary.

358
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,804
Mr. Matsunaga was condemned
to bear guilt because of you.

359
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,840
No matter how much you may regret it,

360
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,477
the fact that he was labeled
a criminal will never fade away.

361
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,115
If you can't come to terms with this case,

362
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,784
you're free to step away.

363
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,726
I won't.

364
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,498
If I uncover clear evidence
of Shoichiro's crime

365
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,832
before the trial concludes,

366
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,568
what will happen then?

367
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,472
Interesting.

368
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,445
It's against an attorney's regulations
to knowingly collaborate with a client

369
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,747
who provides
a highly illegal false testimony.

370
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,984
If you can uncover
that Mr. Shoichiro was lying,

371
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,186
I would also appreciate that.

372
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,688
However…

373
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,525
only if such evidence exists.

374
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,602
They probably collaborated
with the club to work behind the scenes.

375
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,072
It's an affront to a fair trial.

376
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,073
Who knows?

377
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,241
But let's refrain from speculating.

378
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,045
What matters is presenting evidence.

379
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,716
Should I look into what's happening
with Manager Mikami?

380
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,384
No.

381
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,087
Reinvestigate the testimonies
of the customers instead.

382
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,288
Excuse me.

383
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,890
There was an injury case
in that alley on March 8th.

384
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,325
Do you recall anything?

385
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,361
Please, at least take the flyer!

386
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,864
There was an injury case in that alley
late at night on March 8th…

387
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,671
HIROMACHI RIVER

388
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,511
HARAGUROYA

389
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,752
It's bad enough
that my son has been indicted.

390
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,887
And if he ends up being convicted too…

391
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,590
All I've asked of him
is to stay out of trouble,

392
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,160
saying I'd have his older brother
take over my activities.

393
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,528
But did he listen?

394
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,665
The naughtier the child,
the dearer they become, they say.

395
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
Here.

396
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:28,173
I shelled out a hefty sum on his education
from elementary to university.

397
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,610
Maybe I should've been tougher on him.

398
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,178
He's such a handful.

399
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,016
But there's no issue with this case.

400
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,253
Your son is innocent, after all.

401
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,422
Can we trust you on that?

402
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,434
We've pretty much demolished
the victim's eyewitness testimony.

403
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,937
We just have to handle the other witness,
but we'll get it done.

404
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,408
Well,

405
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,911
I made the right call in hiring you.

406
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,412
Thank you.

407
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,184
However,

408
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,186
I'm concerned about something.

409
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,288
What about?

410
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,959
It's not a big deal, but…

411
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,595
HIROMACHI RIVERSIDE
SHINAGAWA WARD

412
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,338
Planning to stay longer?

413
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,439
Yeah.

414
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,740
I'll make sure to lock up.

415
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,442
Thanks.

416
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,643
Good night.

417
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,616
HARAGUROYA

418
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,214
He was here until late last night again.

419
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,450
I wonder what he's up to.

420
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,687
Piping work
at fifth street Naka-shinagawa?

421
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,890
Yes. On the night of March 8th,

422
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,027
there was this truck at the site.
I'm trying to find it.

423
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,999
That's our vehicle.

424
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,402
-Could you come with me?
-Sure.

425
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,375
It seems there was a faulty pipe,
and they rushed over to address it.

426
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,943
How long did it stay there?

427
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,013
According to the records,

428
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,215
it came back at 6:30 a.m.
the following morning.

429
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,484
So I assume it was there the entire night.

430
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,286
I see.

431
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,421
Does the vehicle have a dashcam?

432
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,956
Of course, it does.

433
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:03,261
There's footage in that camera that
could provide crucial evidence for a case.

434
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,331
Could you please show me this data?

435
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,166
ATTORNEY SHUTO AKAMINE

436
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,200
The data?

437
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,040
You're back. How did your search go?

438
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,508
Huh? What's up with him?

439
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,379
You concealed the evidence.

440
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,350
There must be footage of Shoichiro
getting into Kida's car.

441
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,718
On the day of the incident,

442
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,655
the main street where Kida parked his car
was undergoing piping work.

443
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,826
However, there was a faulty equipment,
and this truck was sent there.

444
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,163
Don't you have the data?

445
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,399
I already handed it over
to the other attorney.

446
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,401
ATTORNEY MASAKI AKIZUMI

447
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,775
I'm impressed you figured it out.

448
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,512
Please show me the footage.

449
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,850
Is there a reason you can't?

450
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,722
The footage should show Shoichiro
entering Kida's car at 11:48 p.m.,

451
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,558
three minutes after he left the club.

452
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,561
If this gets out,

453
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,863
you'll lose the trial, won't you?

454
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,034
Fine.

455
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,203
I'll show you.

456
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,011
Let me fast forward a bit.

457
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,686
That's Kida's car, right?

458
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,021
Right.

459
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,759
This is the time the crime occurred,

460
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,394
at 11:45 p.m.

461
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:05,817
See?

462
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,286
He's not showing up.

463
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,587
He came.

464
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,592
As he testified, at 11:45 p.m.,

465
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,327
Mr. Shoichiro arrived.

466
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,535
Do you have any issues with the footage?

467
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,972
What about…

468
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,743
Mr. A's testimony
of seeing Shoichiro leave the club?

469
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,811
That would be false.

470
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,846
Why?

471
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,448
Hiroshi Yamanobe.

472
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,484
That's the name of the man
known as witness Mr. A.

473
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,489
That day, Yamanobe witnessed an argument
between the two inside the club.

474
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,157
<i>He saw this as an opportunity</i>

475
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,862
because he was among those
who held a grudge against the victim.

476
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,533
<i>Upon seeing the victim
and Mr. Shoichiro leave the club,</i>

477
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,071
<i>he immediately followed them
to frame Mr. Shoichiro.</i>

478
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,873
<i>He then assaulted Mr. Kudo.</i>

479
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,443
<i>Hold on a moment.</i>

480
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,212
But he left three minutes after they did.

481
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,747
That would also be false.

482
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:13,017
The camera should show
Yamanobe leaving right after the two.

483
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,619
But…

484
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:19,390
Well, the prosecution tends to ignore
evidence that's inconvenient to them.

485
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,129
After Yamanobe assaulted Mr. Kudo,

486
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,565
he played innocent and pretended
to be the first person at the scene,

487
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,167
then called an ambulance.

488
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,236
At least,

489
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,671
that's the narrative I've constructed.

490
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,742
Did you ever stop
to consider this possibility?

491
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,012
Maybe it's due to your previous trial,

492
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,249
but you're fixated
on this individual, Shoichiro Tomita.

493
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,784
Because of personal resentment,

494
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,653
you're unquestionably accepting
the prosecution's narrative.

495
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,388
You're overlooking objective facts

496
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,024
and attempting to convict this person.

497
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:57,028
Your actions are no different
from those of a criminal.

498
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,630
In fact,

499
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,499
your knowledge of the law
makes your actions even worse.

500
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,802
Deep-seated prejudices

501
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,638
and a half-hearted commitment to justice
lead to flawed judgments.

502
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,675
People like you end up
making false accusations.

503
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,950
THE THIRD PUBLIC TRIAL

504
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,686
I, Prosecutor Midorikawa,
will ask some questions.

505
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,256
According to evidence number 8,
as requested by the defense counsel,

506
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:30,161
you picked up the accused
in your car at 11:45 p.m.

507
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,130
Is that correct?

508
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,199
Yes.

509
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,267
Could it have been…

510
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,369
after the assault took place?

511
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,571
That's impossible.

512
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,106
I made the call at 11:45 p.m.,

513
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,008
and Shoichiro arrived right after that.

514
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,211
The call records
have been presented as well.

515
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,548
Are you sure it was immediately afterward?

516
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,384
Is it possible you're mistaken?

517
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,786
No.

518
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,787
Objection.

519
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,557
Repetitive questioning.

520
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,559
Objection sustained.

521
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,796
Prosecutor,
please pose a different inquiry.

522
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,697
Your Honor,

523
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,899
to refresh the witness' memory,

524
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,336
I would like to present new evidence
and pose questions.

525
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,770
May I proceed?

526
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:17,442
I was unable to disclose it in advance
as it was acquired late.

527
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,376
However,

528
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,913
this footage is pivotal to the trial.

529
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,148
I ask that you permit this.

530
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,984
What is the content of this footage?

531
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,786
It captures the location

532
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,323
where Mr. Kida's car was parked

533
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,726
on the day of the incident.

534
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,061
Very well.

535
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,664
Defense counsel, your stance?

536
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,103
I defer to your judgment, Your Honor.

537
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,655
On the day of the incident,

538
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:07,458
at the main street where the witness
claimed to have picked up the accused,

539
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,427
there was ongoing piping work.

540
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,664
This footage is from the dashcam
of the truck stationed at that site.

541
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,735
Mr. Kida, can you confirm
that this is indeed your car?

542
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,671
Yes, it is.

543
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,685
It's 11:45 p.m.,
the time stated by the witness.

544
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,254
However, the accused has not yet arrived.

545
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,102
It's now 11:48 p.m.

546
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,704
This aligns with Mr. A's statement

547
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,675
that he exited the club at 11:48 p.m.
and saw Mr. Shoichiro.

548
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,211
Moments ago, you asserted

549
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,149
that you picked up
the accused at 11:45 p.m.

550
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,086
How do you explain this, Mr. Kida?

551
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,422
Perhaps the accused…

552
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,327
requested you
to provide a false testimony?

553
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,097
That's not true.

554
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:53,998
Objection.

555
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,403
The prosecutor's statement
is merely speculative.

556
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,737
Objection sustained.

557
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,341
Your Honor, there is a crucial issue
that I would like to discuss

558
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,443
with the defense counsel and the court.

559
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,778
What is it about?

560
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,747
It pertains to the false testimony
mentioned just now.

561
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,983
I would like to discuss
whether it's feasible…

562
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,154
to disclose this matter
during this session.

563
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,259
I will now play
the recently added evidence,

564
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:26,364
evidence number 20,
as requested by the prosecution.

565
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:30,001
This was provided by Mr. Gamo
from the pipe manufacturing company,

566
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,137
who also supplied
the video I previously presented.

567
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,006
Please watch the video.

568
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,679
<i>-Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.</i>

569
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,680
<i>Here.</i>

570
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,784
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

571
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,588
<i>This is your reward for providing us
with the dashcam footage.</i>

572
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>But I can't--</i>

573
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,890
<i>There's no need to fret.</i>

574
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,126
<i>Even if the prosecution comes knocking,</i>

575
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,663
<i>all you have to do is tell them
you didn't keep any records.</i>

576
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,201
<i>The truth is, this has happened before.</i>

577
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,403
<i>But if you accept this,</i>

578
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,938
<i>everything will fall into place.</i>

579
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,708
<i>Mr. Tomita can also orchestrate things
in your business's favor.</i>

580
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,047
<i>I trust you'll--</i>

581
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,250
The visitor is
the chief publicly paid secretary

582
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,086
to Mr. Seiji Tomita,
a member of the House of Representatives.

583
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,621
Mr. Kazuaki Kosugi.

584
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:33,998
From this,

585
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,069
we can see Mr. Seiji Tomita's attempt
to support his son's false testimony.

586
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,072
This serves as proof that he requested

587
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,208
the concealment of evidence
through his secretary.

588
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,513
Defense counsel,

589
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,649
do you have any rebuttal to offer?

590
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
After viewing the footage,

591
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,334
I was utterly shocked.

592
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,707
I had no idea that the accused…

593
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,477
had conspired with his father

594
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,979
to conceal his crime!

595
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,885
Regarding this matter,

596
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,556
I will conduct further interviews.

597
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,424
And even consider…

598
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,929
resigning from the defense
depending on the situation.

599
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,646
I'll handle the media, so I'll go ahead.

600
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,683
Mr. Akizumi.

601
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,719
That footage--

602
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,821
You exposed my client's false testimony.

603
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,523
Thank you.

604
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,733
I don't understand.

605
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,436
When I saw the footage,

606
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,205
<i>Shoichiro got into the car at 11:45 p.m.</i>

607
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,841
<i>The footage we were shown yesterday…</i>

608
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,078
was edited and false.

609
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,846
There we go.

610
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,684
Why do such a thing?

611
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,221
I'm surprised he went
to such lengths for you.

612
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,828
Hello?

613
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,096
<i>Explain yourself, Akizumi!</i>

614
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,767
<i>It became clear you attempted
to conceal your son's crime.</i>

615
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,935
That is all.

616
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,705
I can't continue defending a client
who provides false testimony.

617
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,941
But you instructed me to!

618
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,710
However, I'm concerned about something.

619
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,145
What about?

620
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,347
It's not a big deal, but…

621
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:10,054
It appears that Mr. Kida's car,
which picked up Mr. Shoichiro,

622
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,157
was recorded by a dashcam
at the construction site.

623
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,461
It seems a truck belonging
to a piping dealer was stationed there.

624
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,996
The prosecution isn't stupid.

625
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,667
I believe it's only a matter of time
before they uncover that footage.

626
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,802
Which dealer is it?

627
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,871
Tanimachi Pipes.

628
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,240
That's what you said!

629
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,841
<i>That's why I instructed Kosugi!</i>

630
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,076
Do you have any proof?

631
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,811
What?

632
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,748
Why would I instruct you
to buy the footage from them?

633
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,319
You're the one who also made them
record that footage!

634
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,154
I don't know what you're talking about.

635
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,223
I'm pressed for time, so please excuse me.

636
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,993
Hey! Akizumi!

637
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,596
-Mr. Tomita!
-Mr. Tomita!

638
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,998
-Mr. Tomita!
-Mr. Tomita!

639
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,636
<i>Is my dad all right?</i>

640
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,540
Are you worried about him?

641
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,609
He's still my father.

642
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,546
The parent-child bond is just a facade.

643
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,051
Children don't get
to choose their parents.

644
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,922
But you can choose…

645
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,592
what you do with your own life.

646
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,436
<i>In the trial for the injury case
involving the accused Shoichiro Tomita,</i>

647
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,073
<i>he has now admitted to his involvement,
which he had previously denied.</i>

648
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,744
<i>The prosecution is also emphasizing
that his father, Diet member Seiji Tomita,</i>

649
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,579
<i>directed the concealment of evidence.</i>

650
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,847
Please review these.

651
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,916
It's all about Tomita, isn't it?

652
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,986
After all, he was the candidate
for the next Minister of Justice.

653
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,989
I just can't wrap my head around it.

654
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,627
Why did Mr. Akizumi…

655
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,630
show me the edited footage?

656
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,001
Last time, you were shouting
from the gallery.

657
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,703
The gallery?

658
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,605
Your Honor, please review this document!

659
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,873
I order him to leave!

660
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,142
<i>During Mr. Matsunaga's trial,</i>

661
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,177
<i>we were present too.</i>

662
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,215
Mr. Akizumi was present?

663
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,020
Hold on, did Mr. Akizumi take on this case

664
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,288
to seek revenge for him?

665
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,123
Who can say?

666
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,193
But I imagine he wanted to make a point.

667
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,397
To not confuse the truth
with personal biases alone.

668
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,103
Where's Mr. Akizumi?

669
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,608
You've taken down not only the son,
but also his father.

670
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,912
I made the right call
entrusting this to you.

671
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,113
Thank you.

672
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,117
The downfall of Tomita,
who belonged to the Takemoto faction,

673
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,754
will likely please Mr. Kazaki
from the Okuda faction.

674
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,990
Power struggles are scary, aren't they?

675
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,863
It's been a while, Judge Seko.

676
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,499
Chief Prosecutor Datehara,

677
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,601
it's unusual to see you here.

678
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,638
Prosecutor Midorikawa,
you handled this case commendably.

679
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,942
It's just like you
to expose a politician's misdeeds.

680
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,610
Thank you.

681
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,413
I imagine you're both busy,
but I wish you the best of luck.

682
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,883
Thank you.

683
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:27,885
Excuse me.

684
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,136
I apologize.

685
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,879
You were aware
of Mr. Matsunaga and Shoichiro

686
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,748
from the beginning.

687
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,286
You were right.

688
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,357
I'd been looking at things
assuming Shoichiro was guilty.

689
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:11,061
It was inappropriate conduct
for an attorney.

690
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,631
Well, he ended up being guilty, though.

691
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,366
Regarding Mr. Matsunaga's case…

692
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,570
I haven't given up yet.

693
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,341
I'll find incriminating evidence
on Shoichiro no matter what

694
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,911
and pursue a retrial.

695
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,813
That's why you came to this office, right?

696
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:34,885
Yes.

697
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,923
I heard you took on Shoichiro's defense,

698
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,591
which is why I joined this office.

699
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,694
I wanted to learn your methods

700
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,896
and help Mr. Matsunaga.

701
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,533
But…

702
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,036
there are some things
I struggle to accept.

703
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:58,242
So I'll stay here and continue
to confirm things for myself.

704
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,146
To understand…

705
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,951
why you secure acquittals for criminals.

706
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,394
I told you.

707
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,531
Follow your own path.

708
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,491
2021, 2020, 2019…

709
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,263
Ms. Shiraki,
aren't there any records before this?

710
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,133
Why the interest in past case files?

711
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,235
I just…

712
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,271
wanted to learn
what makes Mr. Akizumi so skilled.

713
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,943
You're quite enthusiastic.

714
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,845
But this is all we have.

715
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,481
This office was established
only five years ago.

716
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,183
And Mr. Akizumi
wasn't an attorney before that.

717
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,420
Really? What was he doing?

718
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,255
He was a prosecutor.

719
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,204
Mr. Shimizu, it's time.

720
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,114
Right.

721
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,861
Mr. Shimizu.

722
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,766
It's a pleasure…

723
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,535
to finally meet you.

724
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,245
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

725
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,415
Now, who should we bring down first?

726
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,783
Do you have an appointment?

727
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,420
It's difficult to speak out
against sex crimes.

728
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,454
It wasn't me.

729
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,557
Is he planning another dramatic move?

730
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,259
It seems he's beginning to realize.

731
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,262
You must pluck the tasty fruit yourself.

732
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,365
Maybe he has a purpose this time as well.

733
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,667
-Impossible.
-Mr. Akizumi is trying to use me.
