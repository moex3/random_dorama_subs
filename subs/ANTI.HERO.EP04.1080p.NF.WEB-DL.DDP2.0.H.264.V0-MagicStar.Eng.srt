00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:08,541
VISITING ROOM ENTRANCE
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

2
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,890
It's been a long time.

3
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,470
Every month…

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,409
you've been writing me letters.

5
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:45,845
I have.

6
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,784
Please stop.

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,860
I want…

8
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,398
to die quietly.

9
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,419
We're done here.

10
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,739
Excuse me.

11
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,409
There was an error
in the visiting request form

12
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,845
submitted by Akizumi
from our office earlier.

13
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,614
He asked me to fix it up for him.
Mind if I do that?

14
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,317
Mr. Akizumi?

15
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,287
He was here to see Mr. Yusaku Shimizu?

16
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,123
That's right. To see Mr. Shimizu.

17
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,157
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

18
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,093
Since the visit's already over,
there's no need for corrections.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,262
I see. Thank you.

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:16,736
Yusaku Shimizu…

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,171
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

22
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it too hot?

23
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,069
Well? Do you like this?

24
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,108
There are currently 64 dogs here
at the facility.

25
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,112
Do you know why these dogs were abandoned?

26
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,915
Their owners found them
to be too much work,

27
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,318
couldn't take them along to new homes,
or their kids got bored of them.

28
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,188
All for people's selfish reasons.

29
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,729
In Japan, about 14,000 dogs and cats
are euthanized every year.

30
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,698
That many?

31
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,869
Just like humans,
they don't get to pick their parents.

32
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,405
True.

33
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,410
This place has actually been around
for quite a while.

34
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,513
We've been working hard
for quite some time now.

35
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,751
This girl…

36
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,289
That's Saya. She's over there.

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,225
Good, Mame.

38
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,728
By the way, this Golden Retriever, Cocoa,

39
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,598
is the mother of Mame over there.

40
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,800
Nice, Mame.

41
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,968
Then…

42
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,170
who's this woman?

43
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,339
That's Ms. Momose.

44
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,674
Where is she right now?

45
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,678
She passed away a long time ago.

46
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,558
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

47
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,533
YUSAKU SHIMIZU SENTENCED TO DEATH
FOR ITOI FAMILY MURDERS

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,104
Sentenced to death for murders…

49
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,241
<i>The incident took place in 2012,</i>

50
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,011
<i>twelve years ago from now,</i>

51
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,681
<i>in a residential area in Hanamigawa Ward,
Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture.</i>

52
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,517
<i>Makoto Itoi, a 42-year-old office worker,</i>

53
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>his 38-year-old wife Eriko,</i>

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,556
<i>and their 9-year-old daughter Natsu
were murdered in their home.</i>

55
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,425
<i>No money or valuables were taken,</i>

56
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,428
<i>leading the police to investigate it
as an act of revenge.</i>

57
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,464
<i>And Yusaku Shimizu,
Itoi's colleague, was arrested.</i>

58
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,366
It really wasn't me.

59
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>Itoi and Shimizu had been colluding
to embezzle company funds.</i>

60
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,806
<i>They had a dispute over this money,</i>

61
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,908
<i>resulting in Shimizu murdering Itoi.</i>

62
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,545
<i>Initially, Shimizu denied
committing the crime,</i>

63
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,547
<i>but he later confessed his guilt.</i>

64
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,718
<i>He then received a death sentence
in the first trial.</i>

65
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,187
<i>The defense counsel
chose not to appeal the verdict,</i>

66
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,789
<i>and the trial came to a close.</i>

67
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,827
<i>This office was established
only five years ago.</i>

68
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,196
And Mr. Akizumi
wasn't an attorney before that.

69
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,631
What was he doing?

70
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,699
He was a prosecutor.

71
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,101
Twelve years ago…

72
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,138
Mr. Akizumi would've
still been a prosecutor.

73
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,976
Why did he visit a death row inmate?

74
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,117
Isn't that him?

75
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,922
Masato Uno is a charismatic attorney.

76
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,534
Do all attorneys stay
at such luxury hotels?

77
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,969
Are you jealous?

78
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,479
Curiously, he makes frequent trips
to a hotel for "business reasons."

79
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,614
USES IT FOR "BUSINESS"

80
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,219
<i>Maybe I should've gone too.</i>

81
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,589
Don't worry. Mr. Akizumi trusts them too.

82
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,730
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

83
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,300
I left something in the lobby!

84
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,169
Seriously? Let's head back then.

85
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,317
So, that woman back there isn't involved?

86
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,154
Oh, crap.

87
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,434
What are you--

88
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,556
If they don't come out
for over an hour, we'll know for sure.

89
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,457
Yes.

90
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,427
But I'll hit you in five seconds.

91
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,361
Sorry!

92
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,732
That's a pretty good angle.

93
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,633
Well done.

94
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,534
Thanks.

95
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,270
Good work.

96
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,738
Ms. Shiraki, the rundown, please.

97
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,639
Right.

98
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,743
There's been a series of rape
in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture.

99
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,246
The first victim is Ms. Sena Moriya.

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,483
<i>Late one night, when she returned
to her home where she lived alone,</i>

101
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,186
<i>a man trailing her
threatened her with a knife.</i>

102
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,824
<i>The man was wearing a balaclava,
so she couldn't see his face.</i>

103
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,861
The second victim is Ms. Kasumi Toyama.

104
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,898
She was targeted in the same way.

105
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:56,536
Both reported the incidents
to the police after some time had passed.

106
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,373
Consequently, there's no evidence linking
to the culprit, like DNA.

107
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,476
With no eyewitness accounts
or physical evidence,

108
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,111
the investigation has been difficult.

109
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,013
And on February 21st,

110
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,848
the third incident occurred.

111
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,751
The third victim is Ms. Eri Sendo.

112
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,691
<i>She was also threatened
with a knife in the same way</i>

113
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,526
<i>and nearly pulled into her apartment.</i>

114
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,101
Please stop!

115
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,071
<i>She fought back desperately,
causing the man's mask to come off.</i>

116
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,975
<i>Panicked, the man fled the scene.</i>

117
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,317
The prosecution suspected Mr. Reiji Kurusu
of being the man and indicted him.

118
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,955
Kurusu was arrested on suspicion
of sexually assaulting three women

119
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,489
within Chiba City.

120
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,490
Chiba…

121
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,359
Why this case?

122
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,794
A high-profile case like this

123
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,263
is the perfect chance
to get your name out there.

124
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,565
By the way, Kurusu was found guilty

125
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,268
of committing an indecent act
without consent a year ago.

126
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,971
But in this case,
the only conclusive evidence

127
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,440
is the eyewitness account
of the third incident.

128
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,944
Upon questioning, he confessed
to the first and second incidents.

129
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:12,979
He confessed?

130
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,014
But he hasn't admitted to the third.

131
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,415
I assume…

132
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,485
this was on Attorney Uno's advice.

133
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:21,988
So,

134
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,925
you wanted to snatch this case
from Attorney Uno. That's why…

135
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,064
If you see a tasty fruit,
you have to go and pluck it yourself.

136
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,201
I'm happy for you.

137
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,269
What should we have for lunch?

138
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,871
I want <i>omurice</i>!

139
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,006
-<i>Omurice</i>?
-Let's see.

140
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,508
-What else?
-What about this one?

141
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,254
Here you go.

142
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,395
It won't fly away anymore.

143
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,496
Thanks!

144
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,364
-I'm so sorry.
-No worries.

145
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,303
So cool!

146
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,743
Thanks.

147
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:23,916
What's on yours?

148
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,485
Nothing.

149
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,387
It's been a while, Mr. Uno.

150
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,157
Mind if we have a little chat?

151
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,960
What's this about?

152
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,863
Do you want me to spell it out?

153
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,371
So, you're the Akizumi.

154
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,407
I don't know what this is about,
but not today.

155
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,411
I understand Yua is enrolling
in a private elementary school next year.

156
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,447
How do you know that?

157
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,850
I have a very simple deal for you.

158
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,385
If you accept it,

159
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,021
you can protect both your job
and your family.

160
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,329
Seriously, you attorneys are so willful.

161
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,732
You say you'll do something,
then change your mind.

162
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,534
Everyone's got
their own circumstances, after all.

163
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,637
But still, you're lucky.

164
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,175
I'll be handling your defense now,

165
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,244
and I want to confirm something again.

166
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,281
You were maintaining your innocence,

167
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,118
so why did you confess?

168
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,421
Because that attorney told me to.

169
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,656
"If the interrogation drags on,
it'll work against us."

170
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,525
"You can tell the truth in court."

171
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,229
I see.

172
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,498
Just to confirm,

173
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,603
when the third incident occurred,
where were you?

174
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,174
I went to my regular bar after work
and then headed straight home to sleep.

175
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,542
Anything to prove that?

176
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,211
The last time I got arrested,
it was such a pain,

177
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,913
so I turn off my phone when moving.

178
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,115
Say,

179
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,584
they don't have much evidence against me.

180
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,720
Is it true
I'll be found innocent in the trial?

181
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,155
Of course.

182
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,794
I promise to secure an acquittal for you.

183
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,566
Getting a confession from him
only to overturn it later.

184
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,135
What was Attorney Uno's strategy?

185
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,203
He is the guard, Osawa.

186
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,371
I'm Osawa.

187
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,140
-Here are Mr. Kurata and Mr. Onishi.
-Ms. Shinomiya?

188
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,041
This way, please.

189
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,044
Are they the prefectural police?

190
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,879
Why are they here?

191
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,496
Has there been any change in the accused?

192
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,698
None. He's carrying on without any issue.

193
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,500
As you're probably aware,

194
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,070
once we arrive at the investigation room,
we'll move the accused.

195
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,505
Have a seat while you wait.

196
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,376
Mobile phones aren't permitted for use.

197
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,412
-So I'll hold onto them.
-Right.

198
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,330
I still don't understand
Mr. Uno's intention.

199
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,866
Why did he make Kurusu
confess to the crime?

200
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,568
If Kurusu was claiming innocence,
Mr. Uno could've told him

201
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,470
to deny the accusation or remain silent.

202
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,572
Defending him
would've been simpler that way.

203
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,843
It's quite a stretch to have him say,
"I confessed, but it was a lie."

204
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,246
It's also odd Mr. Uno didn't make him
confess to the third incident.

205
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,883
If only Kurusu had his phone turned on,
he'd have had a straightforward alibi.

206
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,518
Anyway, the eyewitness account
for the third incident,

207
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:51,390
which is the conclusive evidence,
conflicts with Mr. Kurusu's account.

208
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,997
Wait, where's Mr. Akizumi?

209
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,203
Do you have an appointment?

210
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,941
Despite facing that ordeal,

211
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,410
you're still fulfilling your duties.

212
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,480
Your resilience is remarkable.

213
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,848
I'm impressed.

214
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,885
Who are you?

215
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,054
Mr. Kurusu…

216
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,324
and I have been acquainted for some time.

217
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,826
Could I speak with you later?

218
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,198
My shift ends at 7 p.m.

219
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,843
I'm heading home.

220
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,345
-Good night.
-Good night.

221
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,800
I've been waiting for you.

222
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,706
You finished work an hour early.

223
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,911
I've told the police everything.

224
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,080
Ask them for details.

225
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,848
My apologies.

226
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,352
You see, a few aspects
of your testimony trouble me.

227
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,521
-Who are you?
-May I ask a few questions?

228
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,525
Keep it brief.

229
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,295
On the day of the incident,

230
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,864
<i>you were threatened with a knife.</i>

231
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,233
<i>You fought back desperately,</i>

232
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,102
<i>and saw the man's face.</i>

233
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,206
<i>The man panicked and fled the scene.</i>

234
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,109
I hear that is your testimony.

235
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,910
Is this correct?

236
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,212
What about it?

237
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,381
Were you acquainted with Mr. Kurusu?

238
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,749
Ask him yourself.

239
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,851
It's a minor detail,

240
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:04,022
but there's a convenience store
just 13 steps from the crime scene.

241
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,306
<i>When you were threatened with a knife</i>

242
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,943
<i>in front of your apartment,
why didn't you rush into the store?</i>

243
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,948
I was overwhelmed with panic
and couldn't think clearly.

244
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,618
If you had shouted,
surely someone would have noticed.

245
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,355
But no one has come forward
with such testimony yet.

246
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,161
Two days later, you went to the police

247
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,896
to submit a victim's report.

248
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:48,067
Why didn't you report the crime
to the police right after it happened?

249
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:50,936
Because--

250
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,806
It's difficult to speak out
against sex crimes.

251
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,575
You wouldn't understand.

252
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,843
Can I go now?

253
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,819
It appears Uno really did resign
from Kurusu's defense.

254
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,855
Akizumi…

255
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,391
Were you aware?

256
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,028
It's fine.

257
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,996
Kurusu has already confessed to the crime.

258
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,365
Nothing will change now.

259
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,003
Anyway, about the incident in Funabashi--

260
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,884
Why make him confess?

261
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,253
SERIES OF RAPE IN CHIBA

262
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,088
ITOI FAMILY MURDERS
CHIBA PREFECTURE

263
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,895
The Itoi family murders
happened in Chiba as well.

264
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,535
<i>Up until now,</i>

265
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,439
<i>Mr. Akizumi has never chosen cases
solely for the client's defense.</i>

266
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,143
<i>In many cases, including those
involving Mr. Hiyama and Shoichiro,</i>

267
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,078
<i>he's remained steadfast in his beliefs.</i>

268
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,180
<i>With this case,</i>

269
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,350
<i>he went as far as threatening
another attorney to secure it.</i>

270
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,952
<i>Is he planning something again?</i>

271
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,191
Still working?

272
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,092
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

273
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,631
I've been looking into what I can do
until Mr. Matsunaga's retrial.

274
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,533
I see. Good luck.

275
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,433
Thanks.

276
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,315
My own path, huh?

277
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,219
<i>It seems…</i>

278
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,155
Mr. Akamine is beginning to catch on.

279
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,457
But it's not time yet, right?

280
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,626
No.

281
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,329
This case might be the crisis.

282
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,398
Right.

283
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,433
So keep pretending

284
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,302
like you're oblivious to everything.

285
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,039
Understood.

286
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,297
Mr. Matsunaga.

287
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,568
Just a little longer.

288
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,638
Please wait a little longer.

289
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,708
I will…

290
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,150
prove…

291
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,519
your innocence.

292
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,157
That day, he was drinking
until 1 a.m. as usual.

293
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,460
How do you feel about Mr. Kurusu's arrest?

294
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,530
The way he looked at women was creepy.

295
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,566
It looked like
he only saw them as objects of desire.

296
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,072
"All women fall in love with me."

297
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,740
He was completely misguided.

298
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,410
Disgusting.

299
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,880
He could actually be quite kind.

300
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,315
When taking out the trash,

301
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,885
he'd help out the elderly woman downstairs
by taking out hers too.

302
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,355
Good day.

303
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,389
Good day.

304
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,524
Thank you.

305
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,661
People have different sides to them
depending on the situation.

306
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,332
It's not about one
being the real Mr. Kurusu.

307
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,334
Both versions are probably the real him.

308
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,069
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

309
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,137
-A noodle refill, firm, please.
-Sure thing.

310
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,411
Um…

311
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,381
Can I share a hypothetical scenario?

312
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,887
What if… I mean, it's a big what if…

313
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,591
Mr. Akizumi has a motive again
for taking on this case?

314
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,196
I mean, it's odd for him
to actively pursue a case in Chiba.

315
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,366
Especially considering the client
didn't approach him.

316
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,667
He took the case by force.

317
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,235
Here you are.

318
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,073
It's like his past cases.

319
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,843
<i>Hiyama had committed a crime.</i>

320
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,047
<i>But in exchange
for securing Hiyama's acquittal,</i>

321
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,449
<i>he exposed the prosecution's corruption.</i>

322
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,687
In the following case, he didn't secure
another acquittal as expected.

323
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,991
<i>But instead, he exposed
the corruption of politicians.</i>

324
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,728
In both instances, he exposed
the people behind the incidents,

325
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,466
condemning those who sought to gain
an advantage through unlawful means.

326
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,105
Maybe he has another motive.

327
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,743
For instance,
if Kurusu confesses to his crime,

328
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,081
it would benefit the police, who have
struggled to arrest the culprit until now.

329
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,888
I think Mr. Akizumi is selecting
these cases deliberately.

330
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,997
If the police…

331
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,534
DAD

332
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:58,737
Huh?

333
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,139
Don't you have to get that?

334
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,809
It's fine.

335
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,552
I got a message.

336
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,456
The next public trial
will take place in the same courthouse.

337
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,590
All rise.

338
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,369
Ayuka, I never thought
you were on Mr. Datehara's team.

339
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,706
It must be tough working under him.

340
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,908
Not at all. I learn a great deal from him.

341
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,943
Really?

342
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,045
That's what a good subordinate says.

343
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm just being honest.

344
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,517
Ms. Seko, you and Mr. Datehara
have quite a history, right?

345
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,319
We're just stuck together.

346
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,689
Prosecutors and judges
have an inextricable link, after all.

347
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,690
True.

348
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,727
Anyway, he's risen to the position
of Chief Prosecutor.

349
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,995
Quite impressive.

350
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,332
I've heard rumors about you
becoming a Supreme Court Justice soon.

351
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,567
Oh, please. Who told you that?

352
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,035
Bye.

353
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,537
Good day.

354
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,042
<i>He snatched the case?</i>

355
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,812
Yes, the serial rape case in Chiba.

356
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,217
Is Mr. Akizumi planning
another dramatic move?

357
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,559
ISAO KURATA

358
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,897
I see.

359
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,769
Hey, you.

360
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,804
Yes?

361
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,506
Could I…

362
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,209
ask you a favor?

363
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,845
Excuse me.

364
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:47,746
Hey.

365
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,514
You recalled something about Ms. Eri?

366
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,783
Actually, that gentleman over there…

367
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,888
How about you join me
for a drink for once?

368
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,590
Hello.

369
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,597
So, in a nutshell…

370
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,867
she's a romantic.

371
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,202
A romantic?

372
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,904
-Cheers.
-Thanks.

373
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:19,244
She can't sit still unless she's in love.

374
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,014
Anyway, she falls for people quickly
and even says she spends money on them.

375
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,383
I see.

376
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,553
Based on your appearance,
you're a detective, right?

377
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,622
You're looking into
Ms. Eri's twisted habit.

378
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,724
-Habit?
-Her stalking habit.

379
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,762
Any clue who she's fixated on?

380
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,033
She brought me here saying
there was a guy she's interested in.

381
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,103
Then he started flirting with me.

382
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,106
That made her really upset.

383
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,943
Um, do you have a picture?

384
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,944
You want to see it?

385
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,580
I can show you
if you go on a date with me.

386
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,247
Huh? Does that mean
she gave false testimony?

387
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,181
That's right.

388
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,585
The incident involving Ms. Eri Sendo,
the third victim, was fabricated.

389
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,056
But that's too…

390
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,324
In this case,

391
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,060
there were two
consecutive instances of harm.

392
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,462
However, it took time
to catch the perpetrator,

393
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,131
and media coverage intensified.

394
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,500
The Chiba Police,
facing ongoing criticism,

395
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,502
must have been feeling quite nervous.

396
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,704
And then, the third incident occurred.

397
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,074
Ms. Eri Sendo provided
an eyewitness testimony as the victim,

398
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,444
prompting the police
to finally arrest Mr. Kurusu.

399
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,981
There's a big difference between
the first two incidents and the third.

400
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:03,882
What is it?

401
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,919
Mr. Kurusu confessed
to the first two but not the third.

402
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,987
Right. Anything else?

403
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:13,191
In the third incident,
the victim was stalking Mr. Kurusu.

404
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,027
She was following him everywhere,
it was really terrible.

405
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,131
How did Ms. Eri get acquainted
with Mr. Kurusu in the first place?

406
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,032
I think this is how.

407
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,807
He sure is handsome, isn't he?

408
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,343
Ms. Eri saw photos of Mr. Kurusu
and fell for him instantly.

409
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,014
Then, according to her colleague,
she began frequenting this bar.

410
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,551
She pursued him relentlessly,
even ambushing him every day.

411
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,154
Due to Mr. Kurusu's
prior criminal record for a sexual offense

412
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,223
and resemblance
to the suspect's description,

413
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,593
the Chiba Police suspected him
and began surveilling him.

414
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,264
So, it wasn't hard for the police officer
investigating the case

415
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,868
to encounter Ms. Eri at the bar,
who was stalking Mr. Kurusu.

416
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:03,241
Then, Ms. Eri discovered that
Mr. Kurusu was a rape suspect.

417
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,577
It must have been a shock for her…

418
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:11,549
to learn that the man she loved had
a liking for other women besides herself.

419
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,120
Ms. Eri was infatuated
with him enough to stalk him.

420
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:19,557
It's not surprising if she felt betrayed
and wanted to make him experience hell.

421
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,628
So, did Ms. Eri invent the story
and report it to the police?

422
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,398
Who knows whether it was the police
or Ms. Eri who came up with the idea?

423
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,400
It's just one possibility.

424
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,869
As for the police,

425
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,373
they could arrest Mr. Kurusu,
whom they were convinced was the culprit.

426
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,342
Once arrested,

427
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,545
they could question him extensively
about the previous two incidents.

428
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,915
And if they could get a confession,
it wouldn't be a mistaken arrest.

429
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:48,319
As for Ms. Eri, she could punish
the man who had hurt her.

430
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,188
It's not a bad deal for either party.

431
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:55,093
There's another thing
that could be explained.

432
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,096
Here's Attorney Uno's
defense record thus far.

433
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,331
He's famous for highlighting

434
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,802
mitigating circumstances and defending
the human rights of the accused.

435
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,336
In other words,

436
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:09,641
he has secured a guilty verdict
in every case he's handled.

437
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,044
What if there was a deal
with the police behind this?

438
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,183
I've been hearing bad rumors
about Attorney Uno for some time.

439
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,386
Upon investigation,
I confirmed his frequent contact

440
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,555
with Onishi from the Chiba Police.

441
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,124
That's the detective
who arrested Mr. Kurusu.

442
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,594
The police and Attorney Uno
were colluding in secret

443
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,429
to convict Mr. Kurusu?

444
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,300
So, if we expose this Detective Onishi…

445
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,036
No, this is where it gets tricky.

446
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,572
-Mr. Aoyama.
-Right.

447
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,144
That's Ms. Eri's apartment.

448
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,912
He is Isao Kurata.

449
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,480
It is significant

450
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,951
that the Chief of Criminal Investigations
personally visited the victim's home.

451
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,653
Was he aware of Ms. Eri's false testimony?

452
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,256
He likely visited her to strategize

453
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,192
<i>after hearing about the change
in defense attorneys.</i>

454
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,629
But this picture alone
won't prove anything.

455
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,066
Chief Kurata entered Ms. Eri's apartment.

456
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,734
That is the crucial point.

457
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,271
Now…

458
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,774
who should we bring down first?

459
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:35,293
Thank you so much for coming all this way.

460
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,933
Please don't be so guarded.

461
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,603
Now and in the past,
the police and prosecution

462
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,405
have always been friends.

463
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,474
Please relax and take a seat.

464
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,411
Why did you want to see me today?

465
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,082
Is your daughter doing well?

466
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,691
My daughter is 12 now,
in her first year of junior high.

467
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,660
Take a look at this.

468
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,628
See?

469
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,363
Isn't she cute?

470
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,334
The thing is…

471
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,105
Lately, it seems this attorney
called Akizumi or something

472
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,609
is causing quite a stir.

473
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,244
And…

474
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:31,849
I happened to hear
that he might be involved in your case.

475
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,384
Are you aware of this?

476
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,155
Yes.

477
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,756
I'm relieved to hear that.

478
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,859
Well, I knew that you,
as the Chief of Criminal Investigations,

479
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,895
wouldn't let your guard down.

480
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:48,900
We will never cause any trouble for you,
Chief Prosecutor.

481
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,301
Oh, please.

482
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,204
Don't misunderstand.
I'm not concerned at all.

483
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,406
In fact…

484
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,209
I trust you.

485
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,650
If you make a face like that,
your daughter will dislike you.

486
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,985
Don't you agree?

487
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,923
<i>It's Chief Kurata, isn't it?</i>

488
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,959
That's who Mr. Akizumi
wants to bring down.

489
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:19,530
I don't think he's targeting
Ms. Eri or Attorney Uno.

490
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,867
I think he was after
Chief Kurata from the start.

491
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,106
Ms. Shinomiya…

492
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,675
I…

493
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,812
I believe…

494
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,850
that if someone has committed a crime,
even if they're our client,

495
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,719
they should repent and serve time.

496
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,721
That's why…

497
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,591
I still can't accept Hiyama's case.

498
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,296
But that's also why I believe
Mr. Akizumi has acted with a motive

499
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,566
in the cases
involving Hiyama and Shoichiro,

500
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,835
as well as in this current case.

501
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,439
I--

502
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,673
Yusaku Shimizu.

503
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,842
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

504
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,379
That's the name of the culprit
in the Itoi family murders 12 years ago

505
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,715
in Hanamigawa Ward, Chiba City,
Chiba Prefecture.

506
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,384
Twelve years ago?

507
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,688
Mr. Akizumi went to see this man.

508
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,323
YUSAKU SHIMIZU SENTENCED TO DEATH
FOR ITOI FAMILY MURDERS

509
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,194
This case was also
within the Chiba Police's jurisdiction.

510
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,798
It occurred when Mr. Akizumi
was still a prosecutor,

511
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,533
before becoming an attorney.

512
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,037
-Um--
-Could it be a complete coincidence?

513
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,855
CHIBA PREFECTURAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS

514
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,931
Excuse me!

515
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:00,832
Yes?

516
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,002
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

517
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,205
Is something the matter?

518
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,143
May I have a moment?

519
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:13,811
Right.

520
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,614
What is it?

521
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,117
It looks like Attorney Akizumi's staff
is watching outside.

522
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,585
I see.

523
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,854
It's safer to leave from the back,
just in case.

524
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,021
Right.

525
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,811
I have something to discuss with you.

526
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,380
Well, I don't.

527
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,548
Reiji Kurusu.

528
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,852
It's about the man
who was indicted on suspicion of rape.

529
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,055
You're aware of this case, right?

530
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,025
You're in the way. Move aside.

531
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,193
Please wait.

532
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,130
Wait!

533
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,166
Right.

534
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,136
I understand.

535
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:46,938
Excuse me.

536
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,315
I had no idea

537
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,849
that Chief Kurata is your…

538
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,425
Do the others know about this?

539
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,072
I think Mr. Akizumi…

540
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,078
was targeting my father from the start.

541
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,791
If you're willing…

542
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,495
could you tell me

543
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,932
about you and your father?

544
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,577
My father…

545
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,514
was also my role model.

546
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,218
<i>He was kind,</i>

547
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,087
<i>family-oriented,</i>

548
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,990
<i>and had a strong sense of justice.</i>

549
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,195
<i>I wanted to be just like him.</i>

550
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,034
But my father stopped smiling.

551
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,940
After a certain point 12 years ago.

552
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,245
Twelve years ago?

553
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,147
Do you mean…

554
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,419
It was around the same time
as the Itoi family murders.

555
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,989
Back then, my father…

556
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,293
was in the First Investigation Division
of the Chiba Police.

557
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,362
I'm really busy right now.

558
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,198
<i>He began devoting himself
even more to work.</i>

559
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,436
<i>And he started fighting constantly
with my mother.</i>

560
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,071
Are you stupid?

561
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,672
<i>A few years later, they divorced.</i>

562
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,074
You think this is okay?

563
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,511
Why did my father suddenly change?

564
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,851
Back then, I had no way of knowing.

565
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,522
Still…

566
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,560
I respected my father.

567
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,099
So, I talked to him a lot
about me becoming an attorney.

568
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,236
But…

569
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,538
six years ago…

570
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,409
<i>On the day I graduated university…</i>

571
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,251
<i>A man was visiting my father.</i>

572
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,156
<i>I couldn't tell clearly
what they were discussing.</i>

573
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,524
<i>But…</i>

574
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,761
<i>I remember the man's face.</i>

575
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,700
It was Mr. Akizumi?

576
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,541
Go away.

577
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,977
Answer me, Mr. Kurata.

578
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:17,581
You unlawfully
covered that up, didn't you?

579
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,520
Covered up.

580
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,292
Those words…

581
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,095
they're etched in my memory.

582
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,466
My father didn't say anything back.

583
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,938
I don't know what happened after that

584
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,442
because I wasn't living with my father.

585
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,311
But…

586
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,315
after I passed the bar examination,

587
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:55,653
I suddenly received an official job offer
from the Akizumi Law Office.

588
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,191
When I saw Mr. Akizumi…

589
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,162
I instantly recognized him
as the same man.

590
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,172
<i>So, you joined this office?</i>

591
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,608
I figured if I stayed with Mr. Akizumi…

592
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,279
I might learn more about my father.

593
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,616
Have you questioned
Mr. Akizumi about this?

594
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,456
But when you mentioned that Mr. Akizumi

595
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,927
had been meeting Yusaku Shimizu,
the culprit of the Itoi family murders…

596
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,531
everything fell into place.

597
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,037
So, 12 years ago,

598
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,508
Chief Kurata was handling this case…

599
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,212
And he might have
unlawfully covered something up.

600
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,549
Just as I suspected…

601
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:04,788
Mr. Akizumi is using Ms. Eri's case
to bring down Chief Kurata.

602
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,860
Perhaps to reveal the injustice
in Yusaku Shimizu's case?

603
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,898
Mr. Shimizu…

604
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,235
was falsely accused.

605
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,440
<i>I want…</i>

606
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,043
<i>to die quietly.</i>

607
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,351
We're done here.

608
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,159
Mr. Shimizu!

609
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,970
I promise…

610
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,677
to secure an acquittal for you.

611
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,916
<i>Right from the start,</i>

612
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,186
Mr. Akizumi knew I was Kurata's daughter.

613
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,789
That's why he invited me here.

614
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,192
Impossible.

615
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,761
<i>Being my father's daughter…</i>

616
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,765
<i>makes me a vulnerability for him.</i>

617
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,368
<i>To expose Kurata's unlawful dealings,</i>

618
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,903
Mr. Akizumi is trying to use me.

619
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,394
<i>Excuse me.</i>

620
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,822
Welcome!

621
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,275
It's from my father.

622
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,447
He wants to meet and talk to me.

623
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,425
I hear you've been doing pretty well.

624
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,596
Not as much as you, Mr. Datehara.

625
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,008
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

626
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,543
What did you cover up?

627
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,314
One lie connected three parties
that shouldn't have been linked.

628
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,917
Are you saying
we need to break their ties?

629
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,855
The hero of justice
who clears a false accusation…

630
00:45:58,622 --> 00:45:59,790
Is that your aim?

631
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,059
From now on, it's in your hands, Akamine.

632
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,129
I'll reveal this fact in court.

633
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,164
Shall we get started soon?

634
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,465
Dad!
