1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,574
It's been a while.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,276
When was the last time we met?

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,913
I think it was around the time
you resigned as a prosecutor--

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,316
Why did you want to see me today?

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,955
Now, now, no need to rush.

6
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,094
No, thank you.

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,065
Our relationship isn’t one
for drinking sake

8
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,134
and getting lost
in memories together, is it?

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,336
I see.

10
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,840
I guess your admiration for me
is a thing of the past now.

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,542
How sad.

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,083
Organizations are so terrifying.

13
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,852
Even when you think

14
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,122
you've created one where everyone
is straightened out and aligned,

15
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,827
there's always someone
who steps out of line.

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,699
I'm talking about Prosecutor Himeno.

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,134
Who else?

18
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,104
I'm grateful to you.

19
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,772
Thanks to you,

20
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,742
we were able to get rid of the rot
in the organization.

21
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,677
I hope…

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,180
you'll continue to be relentless.

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,049
That's my intention.

24
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,322
How promising.

25
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,460
By the way…

26
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,531
I heard you're handling the case in Chiba.

27
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,736
Chief Kurata, huh?

28
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,843
Who are you talking about?

29
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,579
DAD:
LET'S MEET AND TALK

30
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,880
It's from my father.

31
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,749
He wants to meet and talk to me.

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,285
Will you?

33
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,121
Mr. Akizumi…

34
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,791
is trying to use my relationship
with my father.

35
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,497
Then I'll use that as well.

36
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,841
I heard you visited Yusaku Shimizu.

37
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,277
What about it?

38
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,214
It's moving.

39
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:34,387
An innocent person has been living
in fear of death for 12 years.

40
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,957
And a hero of justice
clears his false accusation…

41
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,660
Is that your aim?

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,298
He's guilty.

43
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,604
Yusaku Shimizu has admitted to his crime,

44
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:58,111
the court has convicted him of murder,
and the case is closed.

45
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,917
You agreed with the decision too,
didn't you?

46
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,387
You remember, right?

47
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,923
After all,

48
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,560
you're the one who put him on death row…

49
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,497
As the prosecutor of justice!

50
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,374
A friendly word of advice…

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:37,050
Don't expect everything to go your way.

52
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,137
Mr. Akizumi,

53
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,809
you were aware
that I was Kurata's daughter, right?

54
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,379
I was.

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,449
Then, please tell me.

56
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,851
Six years ago,

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,622
you showed up in front of my father.

58
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:17,991
What?

59
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,561
<i>Answer me, Mr. Kurata.</i>

60
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,698
You unlawfully
covered that up, didn't you?

61
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,969
My father unlawfully covered something up.

62
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,771
I heard you accuse him of that.

63
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
It's…

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,980
related to the Itoi family murders
12 years ago, isn't it?

65
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,184
Regarding that case,

66
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,620
it appears Akamine is also interested.

67
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,521
Huh?

68
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,526
If you're going to tail someone,
do it better.

69
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,943
This time, you caught onto the possibility
that the Chiba Police were colluding

70
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,047
with Attorney Uno and Ms. Eri Sendo
behind the scenes.

71
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,015
And so, you took over this case.

72
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,216
Because…

73
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,621
Isao Kurata, the Chief
of Criminal Investigations, is behind it.

74
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,624
You invited me to this office

75
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,627
because I'm Kurata's daughter, right?

76
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,737
I did.

77
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,409
Please tell me.

78
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,512
What…

79
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,683
did my father cover up?

80
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,721
Was he always engaging
in such unlawful activities?

81
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,658
Ms. Shinomiya…

82
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,430
I believe you're aware that I'm using you.

83
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,402
What you want to know
and what I want to know…

84
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,339
might lie in the same place.

85
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,977
<i>If there's use in you,</i>

86
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,279
<i>we might uncover something.</i>

87
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,317
<i>The truth we both seek.</i>

88
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,821
We share a mutual interest.

89
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,657
So, let's work together.

90
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,728
<i>Very well.</i>

91
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,766
<i>What should I do?</i>

92
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,648
<i>Regarding this case
of three consecutive instances of rape…</i>

93
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,184
<i>The Chiba Police decided</i>

94
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,120
to arrest Mr. Reiji Kurusu
based on the eyewitness testimony

95
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,923
of Ms. Eri Sendo, the third victim.

96
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,627
However, Ms. Eri Sendo's testimony
raised several doubts.

97
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:12,698
Furthermore, it was found
that she had been stalking Mr. Kurusu.

98
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,568
We've learned that
the Chiba Police and Ms. Eri

99
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,771
might have been using each other
to fabricate this incident.

100
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,339
And Attorney Uno,

101
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,277
who has a history of connection
with the police, is also involved.

102
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,112
He pretended to assist Mr. Kurusu,

103
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,681
only to make him confess
and wrap everything up.

104
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,849
Exactly.

105
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,453
One lie connected three parties
that shouldn't have been linked.

106
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,421
And in a delicate balance at that.

107
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,791
So, if we can find evidence
to expose their relationship…

108
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,359
Such evidence doesn't exist.

109
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,463
The Chief of Criminal Investigations
would never leave any evidence.

110
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,399
However,

111
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,702
if their relationship
only stands on a delicate balance…

112
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,905
Are you saying
we should sever their connections?

113
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,006
Correct.

114
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,174
First…

115
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,211
<i>We'll use Attorney Uno.</i>

116
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,580
-Okay. Can you get in?
-Yeah.

117
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,949
Daddy! It's the man with the magic tricks!

118
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,490
Akizumi…

119
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,193
Yua is really cute, isn't she?

120
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:18,397
I heard you lost your consulting position
at that big trading company.

121
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,603
I imagine stepping down
from Mr. Kurusu's case

122
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,505
has pushed you into a tight spot.

123
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,576
And meeting with the police after that
must have been awkward too.

124
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,578
What are you getting at?

125
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,315
Ms. Eri Sendo's story…

126
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,785
The police filled you in on that, right?

127
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,687
I don't know what you're on about.

128
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,190
I don't know anything.

129
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,660
If you want to expose my affair, go ahead.

130
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,697
But if I did that,
you'd really lose everything.

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,167
You see, I have this feeling…

132
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,771
that you aren't to blame for most of this.

133
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,077
You can play dumb and wiggle out of this.

134
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,115
You took on Mr. Kurusu's case,

135
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,485
and he just happened to confess.

136
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,020
That's all.

137
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,457
What are you thinking of?

138
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,395
<i>So,</i>

139
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,631
are we going to get Attorney Uno
to blow the whistle on the invention?

140
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,532
No.

141
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,302
In order to upset this balance…

142
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,273
all we need
is a little cooperation from him.

143
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,245
What's going on? Hey!

144
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,516
He's one of my staff.
He's capturing us together.

145
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,186
What are you planning?

146
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,921
It's simple.

147
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,390
For your precious family,

148
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,193
you can't afford to lose your job, right?

149
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,029
<i>Next…</i>

150
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,100
we chip away at the weakest link.

151
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,020
Thank you.

152
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,093
Huh?

153
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,062
Sorry.

154
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,832
I come here often for business.

155
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,801
And I've always appreciated
your welcoming smile.

156
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,538
I'm sorry I don't remember you.

157
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,506
Well,

158
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,775
I do look rather plain.

159
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,244
No, not at all!

160
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,145
Um,

161
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,948
if you're up for it,
how about some tea once you're off?

162
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,283
Really?

163
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,786
<i>Me?</i>

164
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,421
She's wary of me.

165
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,790
From now on, it's in your hands.

166
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,825
Handle it smoothly.

167
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,298
So, Mr. Akamine, you're an attorney?

168
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,199
Yes.

169
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,368
But I'm still kind of in training.

170
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,871
I work under a tough boss, you see.

171
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,609
This here's Akizumi, my boss.

172
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,879
He's a real piece of work
and a real taskmaster.

173
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,885
We're working on the defense

174
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,387
for Mr. Reiji Kurusu.

175
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,562
What do you want?

176
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,001
You recognize this man, right?

177
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,903
I can't say.

178
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,206
This is Attorney Uno, the man
initially handling Mr. Kurusu's defense.

179
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,809
Aren't you curious about
what they were discussing?

180
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,484
Here's the recording.

181
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,520
<i>The third incident.</i>

182
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,056
<i>Wasn't that story cooked up</i>

183
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,827
<i>by the police and Ms. Eri
to fit their agenda?</i>

184
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,497
And you knew about it
when you took on the case.

185
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,232
Isn't that right?

186
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,835
"Don't be absurd."

187
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,470
"Do you have proof?"

188
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,572
Right here.

189
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,007
"That's…"

190
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,543
<i>Will you keep making excuses?</i>

191
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,412
<i>With this evidence,</i>

192
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,381
<i>I won't let you play ignorant
to the fact that it was a setup.</i>

193
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,083
"I had nothing to do with it!"

194
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,418
"Why should I care?"

195
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,758
What on earth?

196
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,361
You and the police
invented the third incident.

197
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,696
We've got proof.

198
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,398
What's the evidence?

199
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,534
We can't tell you that.

200
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,974
I really am a victim.

201
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,509
I'm leaving.

202
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,643
Lastly,

203
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,945
can I give you a glimpse of your future?

204
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,447
What?

205
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,651
In upcoming trials,

206
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,155
we'll bring forth evidence
of your dishonesty and that of the police.

207
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,558
You'll face charges
of false accusation, perjury,

208
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,027
and fraud if you accept settlement money,

209
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,296
with a prison sentence of up to ten years.

210
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,332
Even if you receive a suspended sentence,

211
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,102
this case is receiving
much media attention.

212
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,606
If it becomes known that a victim lied,
you'll become their prime target.

213
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,609
Your face and name will remain online,

214
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,212
leaving a digital footprint
that will stay with you forever.

215
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,482
This will make it difficult
to find a new job.

216
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,718
Even if you find someone you love,

217
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,188
they'll eventually learn about this.

218
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,427
I wasn't lying.

219
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,328
Listen,

220
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,898
this is just one potential future
that can still be changed.

221
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,603
You might as well finish your order.

222
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,271
It's quite delicious.

223
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,559
How did I do?

224
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,760
Splendidly.

225
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,728
The photo?

226
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,896
I sent it.

227
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,232
Now, it's in Ms. Shinomiya's hands

228
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,601
and how she decides
to confront her father.

229
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,938
KURATA

230
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,390
Welcome back.

231
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,698
Sorry, I only have random stuff.

232
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,233
Will tea do?

233
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,168
Sure.

234
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,253
Here's Asuka.
She's turned eight years old.

235
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,355
What do you want to be when you grow up?

236
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,790
Um…

237
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,991
a police officer!

238
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,361
Then, when you're all grown,
do you want to work with Daddy?

239
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
Yeah!

240
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,402
When was the last time you've been here?

241
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,973
The day I graduated from university.

242
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,576
It's been that long, huh?

243
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,247
I haven't come here
since I became an attorney.

244
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,692
What did you want to talk about?

245
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,767
You actually don't want to talk,

246
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,303
you want to ask me something.

247
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,708
About Mr. Akizumi.

248
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,911
Does he know…

249
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,612
about us?

250
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,383
He invited me to his office
knowing all along.

251
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,490
This string of rape cases…

252
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,495
You know why Mr. Akizumi
took over the defense for it, right?

253
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,679
Mr. Akizumi suspects the third incident
involving Ms. Eri Sendo was fabricated.

254
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,151
He thinks too little of the police.

255
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,420
If he brings that up in court,

256
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,956
he'll be the one facing public backlash.

257
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,557
Not if we've got evidence.

258
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,165
There's no way there's any evidence.

259
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,603
Are you here to rattle me
on Akizumi's orders?

260
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,750
You never know what might become proof.

261
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,653
So, an attorney should always
record conversations.

262
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,322
That's what Mr. Akizumi taught me.

263
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,026
But…

264
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,196
it makes me careful with my words.

265
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,165
RECORDING

266
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,733
RECORDING PAUSED

267
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,109
I've always looked up to you.

268
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,017
But now, I'm not so sure…

269
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,090
if I was right.

270
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,596
The Itoi family murders 12 years ago.

271
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,034
It was after that incident…

272
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,438
that you stopped smiling.

273
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,979
I was there.

274
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,351
The day I graduated from university,

275
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,555
Mr. Akizumi was pushing you
for answers about that incident.

276
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,527
You…

277
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,066
covered something up
about the Itoi family murders.

278
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,869
You've been regretting it
ever since, right?

279
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,508
Tell me.

280
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,984
Are you still the hero of justice…

281
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,324
whom I looked up to?

282
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,796
Please.

283
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,767
Tell me.

284
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,273
Is Mr. Yusaku Shimizu behind bars
due to a false accusation?

285
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,575
What did you do?

286
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,494
Working under an eccentric attorney

287
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,531
warps even your perspective, doesn't it?

288
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,203
The police work

289
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,974
tirelessly day and night
to ensure citizens can live in peace.

290
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,543
A false accusation?

291
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,612
Cover up?

292
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,814
Absurd.

293
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,151
You're terribly mistaken.

294
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
Fine.

295
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,563
We'll reveal the truth in the courtroom.

296
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,841
We do have evidence.

297
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,648
Sorry. I just got concerned.

298
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,951
You were here the whole time?

299
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,389
I've got a ton of work to catch up on,
so Ms. Shiraki will be mad at me.

300
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,631
It's hard, isn't it?

301
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,134
Lying to a parent.

302
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,341
I've been prepared for this

303
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,311
from the beginning.

304
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,249
I'm fine.

305
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,322
Do you want a donut?

306
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,425
No, thank you.

307
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,133
Wait, so you're not into sweets?

308
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,569
How about salty stuff?

309
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,904
I prefer salty foods.

310
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,805
Salty, huh?

311
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,380
Will this upset the balance?

312
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,885
Thanks to both of you,
a crack has formed among the three.

313
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,556
People carrying guilt in their hearts

314
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,659
are bound to feel increasingly anxious.

315
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:55,540
<i>The number you are trying to call
is currently unreachable.</i>

316
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,177
ATTORNEY UNO

317
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,817
Excuse me.

318
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,656
We've rechecked the security cameras
at the station and the surrounding area,

319
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,126
but found nothing
to contradict the testimony.

320
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,596
Just as we initially thought,
this case should be airtight.

321
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,733
As we suspected,
Akizumi's goal is to shake us up.

322
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,034
Don't let it get to you.

323
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,703
Right…

324
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,975
Kurusu has a history of sexual offenses.

325
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,178
He deserves to be punished.

326
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,159
Um, are you sure everything is okay?

327
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,861
<i>Can you avoid contacting me
unless necessary?</i>

328
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,899
-But--
-<i>If something comes up, I'll call you.</i>

329
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,867
Don't worry.

330
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,602
You are a victim.

331
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,772
That's why we took action
and arrested Kurusu.

332
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,707
<i>Put your mind at rest.</i>

333
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,209
But…

334
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,177
<i>Excuse me.</i>

335
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,789
CHIEF PROSECUTOR DATEHARA

336
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,193
<i>This is Kurata.</i>

337
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,361
Oops, my bad.

338
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,965
It seems I called you by mistake.

339
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,867
<i>No worries.</i>

340
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,871
But since I have you on the phone,
I might as well ask.

341
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,508
Everything's good, right?

342
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,643
Yes.

343
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,579
There are no issues at all.

344
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,681
I'm glad to hear that.

345
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>Um, it seems Akizumi is looking into
that incident from 12 years ago.</i>

346
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,455
That incident?

347
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,824
What do you mean?

348
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,093
<i>By the way,</i>

349
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>your daughter's become an attorney, huh?</i>

350
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:04,769
<i>I heard she's working
at Akizumi Law Office now.</i>

351
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,374
Parents always want what they think
is best for their kids,

352
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,912
but kids just can't help
but rebel, can they?

353
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,450
<i>Anyway, you wouldn't want
your dear daughter…</i>

354
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:25,690
to witness you in a sorry state,
would you?

355
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,399
So, that woman was lying?

356
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,369
Seems like she's got
some serious resentment toward you.

357
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,838
Screw her!

358
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,507
First, she pestered me relentlessly,
and now this?

359
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,043
"You were only good for your looks."

360
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,412
Maybe she came to that conclusion.

361
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,313
Huh?

362
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,982
Are you looking for a fight?

363
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,050
Not at all.

364
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,553
You're going to expose her lies, right?

365
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,487
Yes.

366
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,988
Then, the first two cases--

367
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,123
Mr. Kurusu.

368
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,027
You confessed to those

369
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,897
because you were coerced
by your previous attorney, right?

370
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,837
But now, I'm the one on your defense.

371
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,378
All right.

372
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,913
Well then.

373
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,316
Ms. Sendo.

374
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,984
I was asked to give this to you.

375
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,290
I had no clue you knew that hottie.

376
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,425
Hottie?

377
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,660
Excuse me.

378
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,965
What should I do
about this person's exit record?

379
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,066
-Just a minute.
-Yes.

380
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,606
These are?

381
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,007
No idea.

382
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,743
These were sent to my workplace
by that attorney!

383
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,211
That attorney?

384
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,013
Do you mean Akizumi?

385
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,583
Forcing me to see pictures
of Kurusu with other women…

386
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,852
Do I have to endure
this harassment forever?

387
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,922
They're trying to mess with your head.

388
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,858
Once we win the trial, it'll all stop.

389
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,030
Fine. In that case…

390
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,934
Can we use this in the trial?

391
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,069
VOICE MEMO

392
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,274
COURTHOUSE

393
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,476
Next, we're moving on

394
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,912
to the witness examination
requested by the prosecutor.

395
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,981
Prosecutor, please get ready.

396
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:30,882
Right.

397
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,217
Set them up, please.

398
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,679
Um…

399
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,216
I don't need the partitions.

400
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,655
I want to handle this fair and square.

401
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,530
Well then, prosecutor, you may begin.

402
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,331
In terms of privacy protection,

403
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,168
we sometimes keep
the victim's name confidential.

404
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,638
However, in this instance,
we have the victim's consent.

405
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,774
Could you please state your name?

406
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,077
I'm Eri Sendo.

407
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,611
As outlined in the indictment,

408
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,548
on February 21st, in Chiba Prefecture…

409
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,122
Are you feeling unwell?

410
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm okay.

411
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,528
I'm just…

412
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,531
terrified.

413
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,334
Is it because the accused is so close?

414
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,470
No.

415
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,339
The attorney…

416
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,908
questioned me relentlessly.

417
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,914
This is what you mentioned
before the trial.

418
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,583
That's right.

419
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:12,851
Your Honor,

420
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,287
we've discovered that the defense
contacted the victim

421
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,157
and was using intimidation tactics.

422
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,159
Could you clarify?

423
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,094
I've obtained an audio recording from her

424
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,363
and I request an investigation
into this evidence.

425
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,397
Defense counsel,

426
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,733
I won't let you get away
by pleading ignorance.

427
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,536
You wouldn't object to this, would you?

428
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,708
In that case,
can we use this in the trial?

429
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,412
I was intimidated.

430
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,684
<i>In upcoming trials,</i>

431
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,155
<i>we'll bring forth evidence
of your dishonesty and that of the police.</i>

432
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,725
<i>You'll face charges
of false accusation, perjury,</i>

433
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,194
<i>and fraud if you accept settlement money,</i>

434
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,163
<i>with a prison sentence of up to ten years.</i>

435
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,331
You recorded this?

436
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,633
I did.

437
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,434
<i>…that will stay with you forever.</i>

438
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,005
<i>Even if you find someone you love,</i>

439
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,007
<i>they'll eventually learn about this.</i>

440
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,375
That wraps up the recording.

441
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,812
Based on this, I'd like to continue
the questioning. May I?

442
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,446
You may continue.

443
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,382
Witness,

444
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,786
is this the voice of Attorney Akamine,
seated over there?

445
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,788
Yes, it is.

446
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,191
Not only did the defense
reach out to the victim,

447
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,593
they also intimidated her
with non-existent evidence

448
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,929
and tried to get her
to retract her testimony.

449
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,667
They pressured you to distort the truth.

450
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,801
Is that correct?

451
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,306
Witness?

452
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,007
What's the matter?

453
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,244
Are you feeling unwell?

454
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,314
If there's anything--

455
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,248
That's not true.

456
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,687
It wasn't intimidation.

457
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,158
I begged Attorney Akamine
to give me advice.

458
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,560
What do you mean?

459
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,554
I have something to share
about the evidence you were interested in.

460
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,656
What exactly does this prove?

461
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,095
It shows that Mr. Kurusu was acquainted
with many women other than you.

462
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,264
That's not what I came here for!

463
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,666
At the time of your assault,

464
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,602
Mr. Kurusu didn't have an alibi.

465
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,137
That's what you thought, right?

466
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,906
Actually,

467
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:52,243
there's a location record for Mr. Kurusu
at the time of the incident.

468
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,646
You're lying.

469
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,648
Kurusu said his phone was turned off.

470
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:01,419
This woman had secretly placed
a GPS tracker in Mr. Kurusu's bag

471
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,890
to find out who
he was playing around with.

472
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,795
That can't be.

473
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,431
We will reveal this truth in court.

474
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,469
You collaborated with the police
to fabricate charges for a false incident.

475
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,738
This is totally a crime.

476
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,775
However…

477
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,212
If you were simply
manipulated by the police…

478
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,018
and had no choice but to cooperate
in fabricating the incident,

479
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,520
it's a different story.

480
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,089
You're a victim.

481
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:39,958
A victim?

482
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,858
Yes.

483
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,329
If you admit that you were threatened
by the police

484
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,965
and still complied with them
despite your conscience,

485
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,201
the blame will be directed at the police.

486
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:54,138
All you need to do is testify
that you were intimidated.

487
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,944
You wanted to bring Mr. Kurusu down.

488
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,045
Isn't that right?

489
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,615
We won't let him go unpunished.

490
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,484
You have our word.

491
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,152
You have two options.

492
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,888
If we present this evidence,

493
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,158
you'll be seen as accomplices
with the police.

494
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,730
You'll be arrested on charges
of false accusation and perjury,

495
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,699
while Kurusu will go free.

496
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,401
You can accept this outcome,

497
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,737
or you can cooperate with us.

498
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,707
You can send Kurusu,
who caused you pain, to hell.

499
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,210
Do you want this outcome?

500
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,114
Consider very carefully.

501
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,490
What should I do?

502
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,299
I…

503
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,071
I hated Mr. Kurusu,

504
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,107
and lied about him harming me.

505
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,443
However,

506
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,578
after speaking with the attorneys,

507
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,481
I've come to realize the gravity
of the crime I've committed.

508
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,917
No matter how much I hated him,

509
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,720
it was thoughtless of me to be used
for his unlawful arrest.

510
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,657
I'm truly sorry.

511
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,461
Prosecutor.

512
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,265
What’s going on here?

513
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:32,770
You accused even our quest
for truth as intimidation

514
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,773
and tried to fabricate
a crime out of thin air.

515
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,975
Well…

516
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,145
What are you looking at?

517
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,046
Nothing.

518
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:50,488
Surely, you won't suggest
this was orchestrated by the police too.

519
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:56,794
Don't tell me you presented
this recording without even verifying it.

520
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,496
No, I--

521
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,397
Never mind.

522
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,500
The truth will come out.

523
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,102
Isn't that right,

524
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,471
Chief Kurata?

525
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,143
Order in the court.

526
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,245
We will conclude today's trial.

527
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,447
We will review the situation

528
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,550
and decide how to proceed
with future trials.

529
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,121
Prosecutor and defense counsel,

530
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,124
please come to the chambers
immediately after adjournment.

531
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,725
The court is adjourned.

532
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,439
How serious will my crime be?

533
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,041
That depends on your attorney.

534
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,878
Can I ask you to represent me?

535
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,513
Relax.

536
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,815
We're partners, after all.

537
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,586
The GPS tracker in Kurusu's bag.

538
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,954
You lied about it, right?

539
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,025
Maybe.

540
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:02,994
It doesn't matter.

541
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,963
You'll handle Kurusu, won't you?

542
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,331
I will.

543
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,107
You even expected Ms. Eri
to see through it?

544
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,041
Perhaps.

545
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,545
Kurusu is actually guilty
of the first and second cases, right?

546
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,346
What will you do next?

547
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,129
Good grief!

548
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,565
The police are such a disappointment.

549
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,000
They can't make an arrest
without inventing evidence!

550
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,240
My bad.

551
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,577
I've been complaining a lot lately.

552
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,412
Maybe it's my old age.

553
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,082
Come to think of it,

554
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:05,156
your ex-husband is a UTokyo graduate
and a police official, right?

555
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,258
Yes.

556
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,063
Could I ask you a little favor?

557
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,201
<i>So, Mr. Yashiro,</i>

558
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,805
<i>the third incident was fabricated
by the police, correct?</i>

559
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,341
<i>This is quite unprecedented.</i>

560
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,211
<i>The police fabricating an incident
is utterly disgraceful behavior.</i>

561
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,115
<i>What about the woman who testified
she was threatened by the police?</i>

562
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,350
<i>What will happen to her?</i>

563
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,886
<i>If the police coerced
her testimony through intimidation,</i>

564
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,089
<i>she shouldn't be charged
with a serious crime.</i>

565
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,625
Ms. Eri will face
a difficult time after this.

566
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,394
Um…

567
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,798
Were you in on everything, Mr. Aoyama?

568
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,700
Who knows?

569
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,036
It's time.

570
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,340
<i>Attorney Akizumi, please go ahead.</i>

571
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,278
<i>The police's unlawful conduct in this case
was incredibly sloppy</i>

572
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,214
and undermines Japan's justice system.

573
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,117
As an attorney,

574
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,488
<i>I feel it's crucial
to investigate past cases as well.</i>

575
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,857
<i>On the other hand,</i>

576
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,526
I uncovered something
while defending this case.

577
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,828
Mr. Kurusu, my client,

578
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,699
was also found to be making a false claim.

579
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,737
I believe an attorney should act
as a guardian for their client,

580
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,572
but I must stick to my principles.

581
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,241
Therefore,

582
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,277
I've stepped down
from Mr. Kurusu's defense earlier.

583
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,848
I'd like to hand the case
back to Attorney Uno,

584
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,986
who led the client to confess
and encouraged him to repent.

585
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,526
Daddy, what's wrong?

586
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,428
Nothing.

587
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,338
Daddy will work hard for you, Yua.

588
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,111
<i>He's handing the case
back to Attorney Uno?</i>

589
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,548
He'll have to make a fresh start
for the sake of his wife and daughter.

590
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:15,553
Even the lowest of the low wouldn't want
to let down his beloved daughter.

591
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,056
Well then…

592
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,298
Are you moving?

593
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,634
I'll be investigated internally.

594
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,237
I'll either face disciplinary action

595
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,272
or be kept on the payroll
with no real work.

596
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,643
Either way,
I can't continue living here anymore.

597
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,358
Asuka…

598
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,404
Dad.

599
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,908
In this case,
First Investigation Division Chief Onishi

600
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,010
was forced
to take responsibility and resign.

601
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,047
Were you trying to protect him
by any chance?

602
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,853
Were you protecting something
back then too?

603
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,455
Answer me, Mr. Kurata.

604
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,192
You unlawfully
covered that up, didn't you?

605
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,528
I don't know what you're talking about.

606
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,864
Please leave.

607
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,240
What are you trying to protect
even at the cost of breaking the law?

608
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,712
I just…

609
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,052
want you to smile like you used to.

610
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,332
Asuka…

611
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,068
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,008
Mr. Kurata, you're home, aren't you?

613
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,844
It's the police.

614
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,078
Please open the door.

615
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,089
You're Mr. Isao Kurata, correct?

616
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
This is the Chiba Police
Second Investigation Division.

617
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,527
We have an arrest warrant for you

618
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,663
for aiding a false accusation and
violating the National Public Service Act.

619
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,500
We will take you to the department.

620
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,935
Additionally, we have a search
and seizure warrant,

621
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,972
and other officials will conduct
a search of your home.

622
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,307
Right.

623
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,211
Asuka…

624
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,715
Forget about me.

625
00:41:58,949 --> 00:41:59,817
Wait.

626
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,153
Wait, Dad!

627
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,488
Dad!

628
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,072
I see.

629
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,275
Thank you.

630
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,185
Sorry.

631
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,194
He might have been silenced.

632
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,997
<i>What do you mean?</i>

633
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,467
<i>Was his arrest unlawful too?</i>

634
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:51,802
No.

635
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,471
They acted awfully quickly,

636
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,941
but there was nothing unlawful
about Kurata's arrest.

637
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,476
<i>I suppose not…</i>

638
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,981
So…

639
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,519
what should I do now?

640
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,124
<i>You can either continue
to see him as your father,</i>

641
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,993
<i>despite his crime…</i>

642
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,797
<i>or reject him.</i>

643
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,566
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

644
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,783
You have a clear mind of your own.

645
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,122
Act on it.

646
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,392
Both as an attorney

647
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,961
and as a daughter.

648
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,002
Thank you.

649
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,939
<i>Take care and come back.</i>

650
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,266
Sorry to keep you waiting.

651
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,371
He just went in.

652
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,041
I believe he went to see Akizumi.

653
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,612
Is that so?

654
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,447
I suspected as much.

655
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,784
So, it's connected to that incident.

656
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,425
So…

657
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,064
Can you get your hands on that thing?

658
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:10,641
Yes.

659
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,512
Well then…

660
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,284
shall we begin?

661
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,294

662
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,597
Maybe Mr. Akizumi got an acquittal
for Hiyama for a reason.

663
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,032
The evidence speaks for itself.

664
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,101
As if begging to be arrested.

665
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,104
She's maintaining her innocence,
insisting she was framed by someone.

666
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,506
If all these cases are connected…

667
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,142
I want to uncover
what my father is hiding too.

668
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,145
Please join me in this fight again.

669
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,581
I've been eagerly awaiting you.

670
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,316
None of the evidence was accepted?

671
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,885
This made their connection clear.

672
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,488
Now that I know, I can't back down.

673
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,723
You anticipated this, didn't you?

674
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,326
Akizumi is relentless.

675
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,362
Don't let him catch you out.

676
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,265
I'll expose their corruption.
