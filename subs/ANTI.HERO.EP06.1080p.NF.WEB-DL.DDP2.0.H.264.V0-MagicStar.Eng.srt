1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,372
<i>So…</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,975
Can you get your hands on that thing?

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,346
Yes.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,048
<i>Well then…</i>

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>shall we begin?</i>

6
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,768
After checking the history
on the old phone,

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,936
I managed to get in touch with someone.

8
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,072
Someone who used to work for Egoshi.

9
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,473
That's great.

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,043
Let's keep digging.

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,145
Next,

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,582
I want to find out if that thing
from 12 years ago is still around.

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,451
They should have it close by.

14
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,987
Egoshi exploits people's weaknesses
to manipulate them.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,423
That's the kind of person they are.

16
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,024
Can I…

17
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,160
trust you on this?

18
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:01,795
Yes.

19
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,533
Excuse me.

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,316
Welcome back.

21
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,726
You didn't have to wait outside, you know.

22
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,730
I could see that Mr. Hiyama was in.

23
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,300
We were discussing the second instance.

24
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,403
What about you?

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,737
What are you up to so late?

26
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,240
I remembered something urgent
I had to take care of.

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,642
About a hit-and-run incident.

28
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,211
I need to fax it by tonight.

29
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,246
Is that so?

30
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,021
Mr. Kurata.

31
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,493
Your charges include
aiding a false accusation

32
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,862
and violating
the National Public Service Act.

33
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,663
However…

34
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,001
you should be able to challenge
the detention requirement.

35
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,271
And even argue for a rejection
of the detention request.

36
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,640
I…

37
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,810
will work on your defense.

38
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:27,847
Asuka.

39
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,183
I'm not saying this as your daughter.

40
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,754
I'm saying this as an attorney.

41
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,027
I don't need one.

42
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,930
I agree to this arrest.

43
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,399
I admit my crime

44
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,668
and will pay for it.

45
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,071
You agree?

46
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,909
Are you going to pay
for all your crimes, then?

47
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,414
Including the false accusation
against Mr. Shimizu?

48
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,253
Attorney Shinomiya,

49
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,590
I have nothing more to say to you.

50
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,760
We're done here.

51
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,452
Did you know…

52
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,788
Attorney Shinomiya?

53
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,493
Even the best doctors

54
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,397
find it hard
to operate on their own family.

55
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,902
When faced with an illness
that afflicts their family,

56
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,972
they're forced to confront…

57
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,609
their own powerlessness.

58
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,013
If you want to help your father,

59
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,616
you should let…

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,953
a cool-headed third party
handle his defense.

61
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,925
A lot of things
must have come as a shock to you.

62
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,660
You have…

63
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,696
my sympathies.

64
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,937
<i>Chief Prosecutor Datehara?</i>

65
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,006
He's acquainted with Chief Kurata?

66
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,207
I'm not sure.

67
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,310
But he seemed to know about me.

68
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:43,216
My father confessed
to fabricating this incident.

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,183
But…

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,589
he still won't say anything
about Mr. Shimizu's case.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,295
Just maybe…

72
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,898
Hiyama is involved
in Mr. Shimizu's case as well.

73
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,433
Mr. Hiyama?

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,334
Last night,

75
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,603
Hiyama was actually at the office.

76
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,939
Mr. Akizumi said they were discussing
the second instance,

77
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,275
but their conversation
was completely unrelated.

78
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,511
It seems Mr. Akizumi

79
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,081
is getting Hiyama to locate someone.

80
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,651
"If that thing
from 12 years ago is still around."

81
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,586
That's what I heard him say.

82
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,857
If Mr. Shimizu…

83
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,427
is truly falsely accused,

84
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,364
now that I know, I can't back down.

85
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,634
<i>I've been witnessing an innocent person</i>

86
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,503
<i>endure unimaginable suffering…</i>

87
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,706
<i>for so long.</i>

88
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,909
<i>I want to uncover
what my father is hiding.</i>

89
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,914
If there are people being harmed
because of him…

90
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,984
I share the responsibility too.

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,558
<i>The decision.</i>

92
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,728
The accused is sentenced
to one year in prison.

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,431
The execution of the sentence
will be suspended for two years

94
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,967
from the day it becomes final.

95
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,702
I cannot accept this.

96
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,937
I was set up!

97
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,038
I'll appeal this case.

98
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,806
I want the process started now.

99
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,041
About that…

100
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,582
Ms. Maki Sawahara?

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,484
Yes?

102
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,922
I will secure an acquittal for you.

103
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,838
My name is Maki Sawahara.

104
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,976
I used to be the vice editor-in-chief
of <i>Taiyo Weekly</i> at Taiyo Publishing.

105
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,246
Remember the information leak incident
at Taiyo Publishing?

106
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,581
It caused quite a commotion.

107
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,818
There was awful slander
on social media about it.

108
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,421
As I recall, the culprit was
the vice editor-in-chief…

109
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,324
Yes, that's the incident.

110
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,094
Last December, after inquiries
by the group's employees,

111
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,998
suspicions arose that the employees'
private information was being leaked.

112
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,269
Investigations revealed that
300,000 pieces of data had been leaked,

113
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,038
including the company's
confidential and client information,

114
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,841
as well as the personal information
of all group employees.

115
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,843
Based on circumstantial evidence,

116
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,779
the police focused their investigation
on an active employee,

117
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,015
leading to Ms. Sawahara's arrest.

118
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,684
But I really didn't do it.

119
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,619
I'm absolutely innocent.

120
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,621
So we're defending a second instance.

121
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,091
Two key points
led to the decision in the first instance.

122
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,861
First, during the investigation
into the information leak route,

123
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,863
they found
Ms. Sawahara's ID was being used.

124
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,667
I lost my company ID last year.

125
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:52,138
<i>I keep it in my bag's inside pocket,
but I couldn't find it on my way home.</i>

126
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,943
So, it's likely the real culprit
stole your ID and misused it.

127
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,112
Apparently, the time the ID was used
to access the information

128
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,450
was around 8 p.m. on December 5th,
the same time my card was likely stolen.

129
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,387
And the second point
that led to the guilty verdict is this.

130
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,324
STARLIST, the list broker
that the information was leaked to,

131
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,828
deposited over 3 million yen
to Ms. Sawahara's account.

132
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,330
I never knew this company,

133
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,700
and I didn't even notice this deposit
until the police pointed it out.

134
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,503
This also worked against you
in the first instance.

135
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,606
If you had realized the deposit right away
and inquired about it,

136
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,908
the circumstances may have been different.

137
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,310
What was STARLIST's response
regarding the deposit?

138
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,814
According to Hiroki Tamura,
STARLIST's former representative director,

139
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,018
the leaked information was placed
on a USB drive and sent to them by mail.

140
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,086
So basically,

141
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:44,457
the real culprit stole Ms. Sawahara's ID
to extract inside information

142
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,158
<i>and sent it to STARLIST.</i>

143
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,062
<i>Then, they arranged for the reward
to go to Ms. Sawahara's account.</i>

144
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:50,963
That's right.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,400
And according to forensics,
the envelope and USB that were sent

146
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,236
had Ms. Sawahara's fingerprints on them.

147
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,138
They were quite meticulous.

148
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,543
But why did the real culprit
try to pin the blame on you?

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,379
They wanted to bring her down.

150
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,316
It has to be someone within the company.

151
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,084
Do you have any idea who it might be?

152
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,320
I can't say for certain,

153
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,890
but I had a subordinate named Ueda
who used to be my supervisor.

154
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,726
A subordinate
who was your former supervisor?

155
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:26,966
I was promoted to vice editor-in-chief,
ahead of Ueda, who was a copy editor.

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:27,900
That's amazing.

157
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,402
Not really.

158
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,838
If I weren't a woman,
this transfer wouldn't have happened.

159
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,107
Was it part of a push to promote women?

160
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,008
Yes.

161
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,277
During the personnel transfers
in July last year,

162
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,413
many women got promoted.

163
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,483
When your positions are reversed,
it does make things awkward.

164
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,488
Ms. Sawahara,
do you suspect Mr. Ueda is the culprit?

165
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,857
I don't have any evidence, but yes.

166
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,429
<i>The country is promoting
women's appointments,</i>

167
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,930
but some suffer because of it.

168
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,732
Isn't that irresponsible?

169
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,767
Not all companies are like that.

170
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,103
But media companies are lagging behind,

171
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,073
leading to incidents like this one.

172
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,543
I get it might be unpleasant
to have a subordinate promoted over you.

173
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
But is that enough motive to do this?

174
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,980
True.

175
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,250
Internal information leaks
have a limited pool of suspects.

176
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,986
Would he risk so much to do this?

177
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,290
All the evidence points to Ms. Sawahara,

178
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,726
to an unnatural degree.

179
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,663
Usually, culprits try to hide their tracks
to avoid suspicion.

180
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,200
And yet, her name, address,
and deposit account were all out there.

181
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,936
As if begging to be arrested.

182
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,308
So, someone clearly framed Ms. Sawahara.

183
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,580
In a recent incident,
the police presented false testimony.

184
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,117
There was a case where the prosecution
replaced a test result as well.

185
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,253
What do you believe motivates
these acts of misconduct?

186
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,490
For those of us in the judicial system,

187
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,825
trials are a part of our job and lives.

188
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,729
However, a trial holds the power
to determine someone's fate.

189
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,632
We must never forget this simple fact.

190
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,269
Therefore, through my work as an attorney,

191
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,572
I aim to keep
many judicial officials on their toes.

192
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,775
That interview was truly meaningful.

193
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,045
Your perspective exposed
the misconduct of the Chiba Police.

194
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,713
I was especially impressed by that.

195
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,148
I hope my story was adequate.

196
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,551
Given the nature of your story,
I'm sure it will elicit a strong response.

197
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,619
That's good.

198
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,322
Mr. Akizumi, I need to use the bathroom.

199
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,590
Go ahead. It's over there.

200
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,526
-Excuse me as well.
-Of course.

201
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,330
May I take a look at your workspace?

202
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,231
Of course.

203
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,437
By the way, I heard a trial the other day
resulted in a guilty verdict.

204
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,707
Wasn't the accused
the former vice editor-in-chief here?

205
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,310
I'm sorry for any disturbance that caused.

206
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,278
It's all right.

207
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm just curious
because of my line of work.

208
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,383
Could you tell me more about it?

209
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,685
What kind of person was she?

210
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,721
I'm sorry!

211
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,422
No worries.

212
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,423
Thank you.

213
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,526
Well…

214
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,263
She was very hardworking and competent.

215
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,134
She'd do anything for a scoop.

216
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,537
But if she was so dedicated,

217
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,041
what could have motivated her
to leak information?

218
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,477
Especially after the struggles
to become vice editor-in-chief.

219
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,079
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

220
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,516
I wonder if she was unhappy
with her workplace.

221
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,454
To be honest, it seemed like she didn't
get along with her subordinates.

222
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,891
I tried to intervene and offer advice,

223
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,027
but once a relationship goes sour,
it's hard to repair.

224
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,395
I see.

225
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,565
But with her arrest,

226
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,101
you ended up becoming
the vice editor-in-chief.

227
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,604
Weren't you secretly pleased?

228
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,905
What? No.

229
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,574
Ms. Sawahara is claiming innocence.

230
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,678
If what she says is true,

231
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,881
it implies the culprit is someone else.

232
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,549
What?

233
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,318
I'm her attorney, you see.

234
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,722
I'll see you again.

235
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,692
<i>Ms. Sawahara, huh?</i>

236
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,661
She was promoted to vice editor-in-chief,

237
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,164
but couldn't deliver much,
so her demotion was decided.

238
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,533
They say she leaked
the information out of spite.

239
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:21,967
I see.

240
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,169
<i>Mr. Ueda is a good man.</i>

241
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,371
Ms. Sawahara was the one snapping at him.

242
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,338
Yeah.

243
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,140
When she was working under Mr. Ueda,

244
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,110
no matter how many times
he'd tell her to drop something,

245
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,179
she'd never obey him.

246
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,480
I see.

247
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,648
Thank you.

248
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,082
-Good work.
-Good work.

249
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,719
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

250
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,824
May I see the entry log
for December 5th of last year?

251
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,359
No, I'm afraid that's not possible.

252
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,028
We can't share that with outsiders.

253
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,763
Is that so? Well then,

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,899
I'll report your conduct during work.

255
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:54,800
Huh?

256
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,937
Smoking isn't allowed anywhere
on the premises, correct?

257
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,177
Every time you use your ID card,
your entries and exits are recorded.

258
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,780
What if someone loses their ID?

259
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,016
We ask for another form of ID,
contact their department head,

260
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,885
and upon approval, grant entry.

261
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,687
Would you view that record as well?

262
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,921
Yes, please.

263
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,697
TAIYO WEEKLY

264
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,311
At the time of the incident,

265
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,381
there were a total of 79 people
inside the building.

266
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,251
Of which only two were from
the <i>Taiyo Weekly</i> editorial department.

267
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,219
Ms. Sawahara and Mr. Ueda.

268
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:48,921
-Excuse me.
-Whoa.

269
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,489
What's with all the stuff?

270
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,191
Could you take a look at these?

271
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,664
These were issued before
Ms. Sawahara became vice editor-in-chief.

272
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,834
These were issued
after she assumed the position.

273
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,937
And these were issued
following Ms. Sawahara's arrest

274
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,907
and Mr. Ueda's promotion
to vice editor-in-chief.

275
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,077
During the five months Ms. Sawahara
was vice editor-in-chief,

276
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,246
there was a series of special features.

277
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,614
Do you mean this?

278
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,417
An exposé article on Tatsuya Kazaki,
a Mineito Party Diet member.

279
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,220
"Suspected of having affairs
with multiple women."

280
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,322
And this one says,

281
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,792
"Partying with a major company head
for several consecutive days."

282
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,127
How foolish.

283
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,429
Isn't Kazaki
the State Minister of Justice?

284
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,465
Yes, he's a Diet member
from the opposing faction of Seiji Tomita.

285
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,635
One of the two was speculated
to be the next Minister of Justice.

286
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,506
But after Tomita's downfall,
Kazaki is the only real candidate.

287
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,408
Factions still exist, huh?

288
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,209
Some things never change.

289
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,213
It seems Ms. Sawahara
had been investigating Kazaki for years,

290
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,051
but Mr. Ueda kept rejecting her articles.

291
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:57,589
When she became the vice editor-in-chief,
she finally managed to publish them.

292
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,158
But…

293
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,460
After her arrest,

294
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,396
articles about Kazaki stopped completely.

295
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,199
Kazaki's pieces
received a lot of attention,

296
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,369
and the number of copies sold
was increasing during that period.

297
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,572
But Mr. Ueda adamantly refused
to publish them.

298
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,475
Aren't you curious about the reason?

299
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,611
You think Ueda and Kazaki are connected?

300
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,213
Yes.

301
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,017
If you already know that much,
it makes things easier.

302
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,487
Here you go.

303
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,588
It's already set up.

304
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Huh?

305
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,925
Taiyo Publishing?

306
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,159
I'm sorry!

307
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,828
No worries.

308
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,365
She was very hardworking and competent.

309
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,333
A GPS tracker?

310
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,602
You want me to follow Mr. Ueda with this?

311
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,238
You're catching on.

312
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,375
Ueda has always been a political reporter,

313
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,511
covering many Diet members' scandals.

314
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,446
But his stories have something in common.

315
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,615
I notice many exposés
on the Takemoto faction.

316
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,419
The Takemoto faction
is the opposing faction of Kazaki.

317
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,757
Scandals involving the Takemoto faction,
which benefit Kazaki…

318
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,192
were published at just the right times.

319
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,964
So, is Kazaki Mr. Ueda's source?

320
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,035
So in this incident,
Ms. Sawahara was an obstacle

321
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,404
for both Kazaki and Mr. Ueda.

322
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,641
The reason someone could leak information,
even at the risk of getting caught,

323
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,413
is most likely because they had
a politician backing them.

324
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,282
I also…

325
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,052
have a task for you, Ms. Shinomiya.

326
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,425
Like I said, the police took
the USB that was sent here

327
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,627
and seized all the company's computers.

328
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,797
What about that one?

329
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,934
That's my personal laptop.

330
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,870
May I borrow it?

331
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,939
Are you kidding? Give me a break.

332
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,179
You're evading a hefty amount of taxes.

333
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,182
If I send this to someone I know
at the National Tax Agency,

334
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,550
he'll be thrilled.

335
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,452
He's a rising star there.

336
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,488
The other day, there was a tax evasion
involving Kamehara Constructions.

337
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,923
He handled that one too.

338
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,257
Found it.

339
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,761
They ended up paying hundreds of millions
in additional taxes…

340
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,097
-Hello?
-Hey! W-Wait a minute!

341
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,500
I'll ask you again.

342
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,468
May I…

343
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,736
borrow that?

344
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,305
YUMEMIRAI FESTIVAL

345
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,973
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

346
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,411
Good for you!

347
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,412
Oh, yeah?

348
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,847
Eat up!

349
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,215
Here. It's good.

350
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,783
You're welcome.

351
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,852
Thank you so much!

352
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,254
You always come
despite your busy schedule.

353
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,189
I need to thank you as well.

354
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,059
My heart feels cleansed when I come here.

355
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,129
Spending so much time in the courtroom
can be so depressing.

356
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,830
I'm glad to hear you say that.

357
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,066
Director, the children are calling you!

358
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,701
Coming! Excuse me.

359
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,003
I'll take that.

360
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,710
Good work, everyone!

361
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,211
You haven't eaten yet, right?

362
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,246
Here.

363
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,914
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

364
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,583
Would you like one too?

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,735
Well, well.

366
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,446
You know who's handling
the second instance, right?

367
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,650
You shouldn't make contact
with me before the trial.

368
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,718
Make contact?

369
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,354
I just happened to be here.

370
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,622
At a children's home?

371
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,124
Yes.

372
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,960
I've taken an interest
in volunteer work lately.

373
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,528
Is that so?

374
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,332
Well, if you say so.

375
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,936
What about you, Judge Seko?

376
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,137
Why do volunteer work?

377
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,807
I face sad incidents every day.

378
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:14,213
And behind them,
there are suffering children.

379
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,682
I want to be of some help to them.

380
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,121
No.

381
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,591
That was just me being grandiose.

382
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,360
I come here for myself.

383
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,663
Spending time with innocent children

384
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,966
helps me dispel
the negative energy I accumulate.

385
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,834
Impressive.

386
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,104
No wonder you're rumored
to be the future Supreme Court Justice.

387
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,839
Very funny.

388
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,345
I want to help Ms. Maki Sawahara.

389
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,683
She's maintaining her innocence,

390
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,519
insisting she was framed by someone.

391
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,026
I read the documents
from her first instance.

392
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,363
I sympathize with her.

393
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,432
It feels like seeing my past self.

394
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,170
While the circumstances
are very different now,

395
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,274
it's still a difficult world
for women to live in.

396
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,246
We have a lead
on who might have set her up.

397
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,382
Is that so?

398
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,084
We're currently investigating this man.

399
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,354
We should obtain
the evidence we need soon.

400
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,257
Judge!

401
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,893
The mayor has come to greet you.

402
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,532
Settle the score…

403
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,102
for her.

404
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,984
You can stop coming.

405
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,889
I know you're not to blame.

406
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,895
Shoichiro's arrest
made me feel a little better.

407
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,229
Shoichiro…

408
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,967
was only arrested for a different case.

409
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,905
Nothing has changed yet.

410
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,374
You…

411
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,444
are innocent.

412
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,718
I'll never give up.

413
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,888
I don't want you to endure
any more frustration.

414
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,725
So, please.

415
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,127
Join me…

416
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,629
in this fight again.

417
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,642
You're really stubborn.

418
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,312
I read in a book.

419
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,050
Unless you have substantial new evidence,

420
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,018
it's hard to get a retrial.

421
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,757
I'll find one.

422
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,160
I promise…

423
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,331
to prove your innocence!

424
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:25,804
I'll come again.

425
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,384
This one, huh?

426
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,452
Yes.

427
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,287
When I asked Ms. Sawahara,

428
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,589
she said this man was
Kazaki's chief secretary.

429
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,793
Apparently, the two meet
at a bar called Luna's Bar.

430
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,096
According to the bar staff,
Kazaki himself shows up sometimes.

431
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,899
Just as I suspected.

432
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:54,800
And you?

433
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,700
Right.

434
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,103
After the arrest,
Tamura shut down STARLIST

435
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,572
and deleted all accounts
under the company's name.

436
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,874
Email, social media accounts, everything.

437
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,044
But fortunately, even though
they were removed from the internet,

438
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,213
the data still remained on his laptop.

439
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,850
And after having all the data
restored by an expert…

440
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,485
Are you familiar with this?

441
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,887
It's a social networking site
called SCRE. CHAT.

442
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,591
I know. It's an overseas platform
known for its strong privacy measures.

443
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,959
Users are untrackable.

444
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:21,860
Right.

445
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,764
Using SCRE. CHAT, Tamura
was involved in many backdoor deals.

446
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,033
So I focused on the period
before December 5th,

447
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,001
the day the information supposedly leaked.

448
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,337
And I got an expert to identify the users

449
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,439
behind every account
that contacted STARLIST.

450
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,107
One of them turned out to be…

451
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,311
a Taiyo Publishing employee.

452
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,679
Ueda?

453
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,280
Two months before the incident,

454
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,884
Ueda was making
several inquiries to STARLIST.

455
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,087
Feelers like
how much information could be sold for,

456
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,324
and whether any evidence would remain.

457
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,826
He did his research using social media.

458
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,662
And to make the actual crime
look like Ms. Sawahara's doing,

459
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,532
he used an old-fashioned way
by sending USB by mail.

460
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,433
It seems so.

461
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,268
We can use this as evidence, right?

462
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,503
We can.

463
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,571
As you know, in the second instance,

464
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,941
new evidence isn't typically admitted
unless there's a justifiable reason

465
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,044
that it couldn't be presented
in the first instance.

466
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,581
However, if it's crucial evidence
that contributes to uncovering the truth,

467
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,885
the court may accept it ex officio.

468
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,153
In this trial,

469
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,526
whether the judge will accept
new evidence will play a key part.

470
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,729
Judge Narumi Seko
of the Third Criminal Department

471
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,297
will preside over the second instance.

472
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,201
So, in this case, we need compelling
and persuasive evidence

473
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,504
that Judge Seko
will have no choice but to accept.

474
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,054
Morio!

475
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,491
Shinomiya.

476
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,526
-Heading to the courtroom?
-Yeah.

477
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,162
The witness examination for
the food poisoning case starts at 10 a.m.

478
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,498
Oh, that one.

479
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,733
Hey, do you have a moment after that?

480
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,268
Sure.

481
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,771
All rise.

482
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,280
The court is now in session.

483
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,851
Evidence number 17

484
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,555
consists of STARLIST's every email
and social media exchange.

485
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,626
This proves that there were
no inquiries from the accused.

486
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,262
But that Mr. Ueda,
the former subordinate of the accused,

487
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,732
had been sending inquiries to STARLIST.

488
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,672
Furthermore, evidence number 18 and 19
include a photo showing Mr. Ueda

489
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,010
meeting Diet member Tatsuya Kazaki's
chief secretary at Luna's Bar

490
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,179
and a testimony by the staff,
respectively.

491
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,283
It shows that Mr. Kazaki
has been providing information

492
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,185
to Mr. Ueda for a few years.

493
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,087
Lastly, there's personal evidence.

494
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,757
It became clear that Mr. Ueda
had been rejecting the accused's articles

495
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,827
about Mr. Kazaki
each time they were presented.

496
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,330
I'd like to back this up with testimony
from a Taiyo Publishing employee,

497
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,766
as per the request
for examination of the evidence.

498
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,503
Through these pieces of evidence,
the defense counsel aims

499
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,241
to shed light on the accused's
workplace dynamics and relationships.

500
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,377
Bearing on that, firstly,

501
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:29,080
we seek to establish that the accused
is not responsible for the crime.

502
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,850
Secondly, we aim to demonstrate

503
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:36,454
that she was framed to appear
as if she deliberately leaked information.

504
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,891
We would like to prove these two points.

505
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,028
Your Honor,

506
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:47,732
these pieces of evidence are new facts,
not uncovered during the first instance.

507
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,001
According to Article 382-2
of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

508
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,103
these reasons are
due to unavoidable circumstances.

509
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,307
Moreover, this evidence is pivotal
in proving the accused's innocence.

510
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,943
For the pursuit of truth,

511
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,880
I implore you
to make a judicious decision.

512
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,114
I see.

513
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,784
Prosecutor, what is your opinion?

514
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,987
Any of these pieces of evidence

515
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,890
could have been requested
during the first instance.

516
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,259
I believe they cannot be accepted.

517
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,661
You have a point.

518
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,132
Given the timing of their acquisition
and the particulars to be examined,

519
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,302
the request for examination
of the evidence itself may be accepted.

520
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,804
What do you think?

521
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,473
I agree on that front.

522
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,041
Instead,

523
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,712
I wish to show the significant illegality
of the defense counsel's evidence.

524
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:39,050
I request permission
to summon Mr. Kiichi Ueda,

525
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,454
the former subordinate of the accused,
as a witness ahead of schedule.

526
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:52,997
You answered earlier that Attorney Akizumi
visited your workplace the other day.

527
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,600
Can you elaborate on this encounter?

528
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:00,705
That day, we invited Attorney Akizumi
to our company for an interview.

529
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,374
However, after the interview,

530
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,578
he began grilling me about the accused.

531
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,915
It felt as though
he was treating me as the culprit,

532
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,584
and it greatly troubled me.

533
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,286
Did you notice anything after that?

534
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,254
Yes.

535
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,823
That night when I got home,

536
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,393
I found something unfamiliar in my bag.

537
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,795
What was it?

538
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,530
It was small

539
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,567
and seemed to be a plastic object.

540
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,902
To clarify his statement,

541
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,239
I will present evidence number 36
as requested by the prosecution.

542
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,607
Proceed.

543
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,812
Is this that plastic object?

544
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,715
That's right.

545
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,350
When I examined it,

546
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,453
I discovered it was a small GPS tracker.

547
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,189
And then what did you do?

548
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,326
I deliberately acted
as if I hadn't noticed it.

549
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,795
And what was the outcome?

550
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:02,367
I observed that I was being followed
by a man I recognized.

551
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,468
Followed?

552
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,070
And who was this man?

553
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,373
The man over there,

554
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,375
Attorney Akamine.

555
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,413
Your Honor, to clarify his statement,

556
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,751
I would like to present evidence number 37
as requested by the prosecution.

557
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,752
Proceed.

558
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,031
It's hard to believe this is the conduct
of one involved in the law.

559
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,132
Objection.

560
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,868
This is all mere speculation.

561
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,503
True.

562
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,804
Prosecutor,

563
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:44,142
shouldn't you first present evidence that
this is the work of the defense counsel?

564
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,376
But Your Honor,

565
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,713
you are aware of the illegality
of conducting a GPS-based investigation.

566
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,382
Even if carried out
by the defense counsel,

567
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,919
it could constitute
a serious violation of rights.

568
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,056
Therefore, I cannot agree
to admit this series of evidence.

569
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,333
Defense counsel, how do you respond
to the prosecutor's assertion?

570
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,074
It is true that the photo
in evidence number 18

571
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,109
were obtained through shadowing Mr. Ueda.

572
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,979
Your Honor, there is no need
for me to present evidence.

573
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,581
The defense counsel
has openly admitted to it.

574
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,084
Such actions are unforgivable.

575
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,388
However, a GPS-based pursuit,
shadowing, and capturing on camera

576
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,892
by an ordinary citizen,
rather than by the authorities,

577
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,528
cannot be immediately deemed illegal.

578
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,598
As long as they were part
of a reasonable defense activity.

579
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,233
Moreover, Your Honor,

580
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,168
I urge you to understand this.

581
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,506
The pieces of evidence requested
by the defense counsel in this trial

582
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,143
are essential in proving
the innocence of the accused.

583
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,113
Ms. Maki Sawahara is innocent.

584
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,315
And to establish this fact,

585
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:02,320
we insist that these pieces of evidence
are crucial and worthy of acceptance.

586
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,188
That is enough.

587
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,625
I understand
the arguments from both sides.

588
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,330
Now, I shall deliver
the court's final decision.

589
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,234
All pieces of evidence requested
by the defense counsel in this trial…

590
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,037
will not be accepted.

591
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,441
Your Honor, but these are--

592
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:28,947
Although they may be crucial
as the defense counsel has claimed,

593
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,017
they were obtained through a breach
of personal rights,

594
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,119
resembling criminal activity.

595
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,522
Therefore, they cannot
be accepted as evidence.

596
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,892
Accepting such evidence
would set a precedent

597
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,829
enabling the general public
to freely deploy GPS trackers

598
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,533
and engage in shadowing
and secretly capturing people on camera.

599
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,169
This will pose a threat
to people's privacy.

600
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,705
As a courtroom judge,
it is my responsibility

601
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,342
to weigh the potential impact
on all Japanese citizens.

602
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,446
Therefore, these pieces of evidence
cannot be accepted.

603
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,116
I direct the defense counsel
to adhere to trial procedures

604
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,686
and present evidence obtained
through lawful means.

605
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,888
Is that clear?

606
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,690
-But Ms. Sawahara is--
-Even…

607
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,060
in defense of the accused,

608
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:21,399
one must not resort to shameful conduct
as a legal professional.

609
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,901
Today's trial is adjourned.

610
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,970
All rise.

611
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,117
<i>During Maki Sawahara's second instance,</i>

612
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,753
it seems the defense's
pieces of evidence were dismissed.

613
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,290
Ueda caught on to being followed
and turned the tables, huh?

614
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,160
Quite impressive.

615
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,096
Who gave him that idea?

616
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,066
I didn't do anything.

617
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,903
I believe Judge Seko made a just ruling.

618
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,140
Indeed.

619
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,642
This is Judge Seko we're talking about.

620
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:09,947
She's the epitome
of a fair judge, after all.

621
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:10,982
She is.

622
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,452
By the way…

623
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,088
Do you admire her or something?

624
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,959
Actually, we've been
on friendly terms for a while now.

625
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,396
Oh, is that so?

626
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,267
Speaking of which, she mentioned you.

627
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,668
Did she?

628
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,606
I can't imagine she said anything nice.
She's not exactly fond of me.

629
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,542
Not at all.

630
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:42,046
It's always beneficial
to have a good relationship with a judge.

631
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,984
Just one thing, Midorikawa.

632
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,821
A word of caution.

633
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,726
Don't surpass me.

634
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
<i>Mr. Datehara, huh?</i>

635
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,737
From where I stand,
he's on a completely different level.

636
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,906
The accomplished prosecutor

637
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,109
who rose to the top
at an extraordinary pace.

638
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,009
Extraordinary?

639
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,413
I mean, he's already
the Chief Prosecutor at his age.

640
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,582
Compared to others his age,
he's unmatched.

641
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,952
He used to handle
high-profile cases left and right.

642
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:21,986
It's legendary now.

643
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,021
High-profile cases? Like what?

644
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,258
Remember the embezzlement case
involving Nishi Chiba Construction?

645
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,161
We were still in school then,
but it was all over the news.

646
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,730
Mr. Datehara handled that too?

647
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,664
Yup.

648
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,533
He used to be in the Chiba office.

649
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,536
The company's management
was using underlings

650
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,805
to embezzle a ton of money.

651
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,876
And I think there were murders
related to that.

652
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,344
The Itoi family murders?

653
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,979
Yeah, that one.

654
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,715
The Chief Prosecutor
led the investigation and cracked it.

655
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,220
But the name of the prosecutor
on record was different.

656
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,123
It's not unusual for the name
that's made public to differ.

657
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,460
But Mr. Datehara
was the one really in charge.

658
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,665
<i>None of the evidence was accepted?</i>

659
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,566
<i>No.</i>

660
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,569
The judge mentioned something about
the impact on all citizens.

661
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,873
It really is difficult to introduce
new evidence during the second instance.

662
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,141
What did Mr. Akizumi say?

663
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,709
About that…

664
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,144
What's our next move?

665
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,446
We need more evidence
before the next trial.

666
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,015
That's unnecessary.

667
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,384
<i>Unnecessary?</i>

668
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,785
Why?

669
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,920
I don't know.

670
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,924
But his demeanor suggested
he has something in mind.

671
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,667
I'm still trying to figure out
Mr. Akizumi's strategy.

672
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,403
Maybe I need to broaden my perspective.

673
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,675
YUSAKU SHIMIZU

674
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,887
In the case with Hiyama,

675
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,257
he uncovered illicit dealings between
Prosecutor Himeno and Professor Nakajima.

676
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,760
Then, with Shoichiro,
he revealed Tomita's corruption.

677
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,364
And in Kurusu's series of rape cases,

678
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,565
he exposed Chief Kurata.

679
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,301
Given Mr. Akizumi's track record,

680
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,737
his goal this time

681
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,908
might be exposing
Mr. Ueda and Kazaki's corruption.

682
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,543
That seems certain.

683
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,247
But there could be more to it.

684
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,786
Today, I had a chat with someone
I studied law with.

685
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,824
It turns out that
Chief Prosecutor Datehara was heading

686
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,461
the Nishi Chiba Construction
embezzlement case 12 years ago.

687
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,631
He handled
the Itoi family murders as well.

688
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,501
After that, he rose to the top
at an extraordinary pace.

689
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,004
Just as I suspected…

690
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,241
Chief Prosecutor Datehara
was involved as well.

691
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,943
And one more thing.

692
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,980
<i>Mr. Akizumi
frequently visits a dog shelter.</i>

693
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,883
<i>There's a dog named Mame there
that looks just like Mill.</i>

694
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,252
<i>And a girl too.</i>

695
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,787
A girl?

696
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,522
Her name is Saya Makino.

697
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,057
She's 17 years old.

698
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,359
Saya?

699
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,894
SAYA

700
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,166
It seems she doesn't talk
in front of people she doesn't know.

701
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,069
But she seemed happy
when talking to Mr. Akizumi.

702
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,173
They must have known each other
for quite some time.

703
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:35,346
It took me a while to figure out
who she was.

704
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,282
But I finally connected the dots.

705
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,584
Take a look at this.

706
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,988
Mr. Shimizu had an only daughter.

707
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,123
Her name was kept anonymous
in the article,

708
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,491
but she was five at the time.

709
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,960
She'd be 17 now.

710
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,729
You mean…

711
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,599
Ms. Saya is Mr. Shimizu's daughter?

712
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,034
It's highly likely.

713
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,006
I don't know what the connection is
between Mr. Akizumi and Mr. Shimizu.

714
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:06,644
But Chief Prosecutor Datehara,
my father, and Mr. Hiyama…

715
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,614
They're all connected
to the incident 12 years ago.

716
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,149
This isn't a coincidence.

717
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:16,620
Mr. Akizumi's actions seem to
revolve around Mr. Shimizu's case.

718
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:19,724
But…

719
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,894
I don't see the connection
to the second case with Shoichiro

720
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,596
and this case yet.

721
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,201
SHOICHIRO TOMITA

722
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,602
MAKI SAWAHARA

723
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,078
Wait a minute…

724
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,254
ITOI FAMILY MURDERS

725
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,828
FORMER COLLEAGUE GETS
DEATH SENTENCE IN FAMILY MURDER CASE

726
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,840
Mr. Akizumi.

727
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,676
You were still here?

728
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,615
I've been thinking.

729
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,252
Why did you…

730
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,655
take on this case?

731
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,794
To secure an acquittal for Ms. Sawahara.

732
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,298
I thought your motive behind this

733
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,602
was taking down
the politician Tatsuya Kazaki.

734
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,673
But that's not it.

735
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,510
I finally understand…

736
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,581
<i>what you're trying to do.</i>

737
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,554
<i>I know…</i>

738
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,757
<i>who you're targeting in this case.</i>

739
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,994
It's…

740
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,933
<i>the person who sentenced
Mr. Shimizu to death 12 years ago.</i>

741
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,568
Welcome.

742
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,869
Your companion is waiting for you.

743
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,571
<i>Your aim…</i>

744
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,509
<i>was Judge Seko.</i>

745
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,382
JUDGE NARUMI SEKO

746
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:31,121
There is one person connected to this case
and the one with Shoichiro.

747
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,326
Judge Seko also delivered
the guilty verdict

748
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,595
<i>in Mr. Matsunaga's trial
linked to Shoichiro.</i>

749
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,564
The accused is sentenced
to two years in prison.

750
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,667
Wait!

751
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,503
Mr. Matsunaga is innocent!

752
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,338
I order him to leave!

753
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,640
<i>Mr. Akizumi,</i>

754
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,110
<i>you've been targeting
Judge Seko all this time.</i>

755
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,213
That's why you observed
Mr. Matsunaga's trial from the gallery.

756
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:01,218
And that's why you used Shoichiro's trial
to expose Tomita's corruption.

757
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,754
All to reach Judge Seko.

758
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,660
If my theory is correct,

759
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,397
it means Judge Seko is corrupt
and needs to be exposed.

760
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,037
Was she already bribed by Tomita then?

761
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,339
<i>Is that why
she found Mr. Matsunaga guilty?</i>

762
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,444
In this trial,

763
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:32,249
Judge Seko didn't accept new evidence
that could have acquitted Ms. Sawahara.

764
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,417
Once again,

765
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,120
the ruling is about
to be unfairly manipulated.

766
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:44,562
Judge Seko never intended to acquit
Ms. Sawahara, who's a hindrance to Kazaki.

767
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,831
Am I wrong, Mr. Akizumi?

768
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,676
Seko's ambition is to become
the Supreme Court Justice.

769
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,579
To secure this position,

770
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,048
she seeks connections
with big political figures.

771
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,719
After all, it's the Cabinet
that appoints the Supreme Court Justice.

772
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,089
Following Tomita's downfall,

773
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,891
her new ally is Kazaki.

774
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,760
Just as I thought,
Seko presided over the second instance,

775
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:21,065
likely orchestrated by Kazaki
to prevent further scrutiny.

776
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,535
What about the GPS tracker?

777
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,204
Before the trial, I went to see Seko.

778
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,707
And I hinted
at my investigation into Ueda.

779
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,744
We have a lead
on who might have set her up.

780
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,014
We're currently investigating this man.

781
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,516
We should obtain
the evidence we need soon.

782
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,885
Ueda was probably oblivious to the tracker

783
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,855
until Seko reached out through Kazaki.

784
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,390
I knew it.

785
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,327
You intentionally made him notice.

786
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,964
As a result, Ueda used
your shadowing to his advantage,

787
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,601
and Seko rejected all pieces of evidence.

788
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,171
"In this trial,

789
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,744
whether the judge will accept
new evidence will play a key part."

790
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,713
This made their connection evident.

791
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,051
<i>That attorney…</i>

792
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,454
He must have been getting away with a lot
of unreasonable behavior until now.

793
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:21,158
Just a few days before the public trial,
he made contact with me.

794
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,895
I could've filed a complaint
with the Bar Association.

795
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,364
Well,

796
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:31,268
you certainly should have done that.

797
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,271
How unusual.

798
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,807
You seem very cautious of him.

799
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,175
Well…

800
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,947
I've seen many people fall prey to him,
one after another,

801
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,483
when caught off guard.

802
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,821
Do you know…

803
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,025
how much hardship I've endured
to reach this position?

804
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,331
Your firm words reassure me.

805
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,803
However,

806
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,006
Akizumi is relentless.

807
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,344
Don't let him catch you out.

808
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,747
<i>In other words,</i>

809
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,417
our only chance of winning this trial
is by taking down Seko.

810
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,888
Seko is the target.

811
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,125
<i>I'll expose…</i>

812
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,097
her corruption.

813
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,100
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

814
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,936
You're the only one who can help her!

815
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,039
I'll tell you everything
that happened 12 years ago.

816
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,407
I have Egoshi's whereabouts.

817
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,942
I won't let you get away now.

818
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,478
A world built
on money and lust is fragile.

819
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,313
Let's be flexible.

820
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,583
I promise to win your acquittal this time.

821
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,784
Let's go.

822
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,853
You met Chief Prosecutor Datehara, right?

823
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,488
What did you discuss?

824
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,323
Tell me everything.

825
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,993
I will make Seko get what she deserves.

826
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,661
An impeachment trial.

827
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,463
Strike first before they do.

828
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,432
Even if it means risking everything.
