1
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,516
I've been waiting for you.

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,187
Don't be so wary of me.

3
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,257
The thing is,

4
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,861
I want to help you.

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,164
Why wouldn't I?

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,468
After all, you're innocent.

7
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,672
I understand that Akizumi is targeting me.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,744
But what is there for him
to catch in the first place?

9
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,349
I had almost forgotten.

10
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,951
It was unnecessary for me
to worry about you,

11
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,520
the fair and strict Judge Seko.

12
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,587
I beg your pardon.

13
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,024
I've come today to thank you.

14
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,530
This is about
Diet member Tomita, isn't it?

15
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,166
Naturally, as the prosecution,

16
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,937
we were hoping he'd confess
with a little more pressure.

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,674
But you held back.

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,944
I owe you for that.

19
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,614
However…

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,087
Wouldn't it have been
more convenient for you…

21
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,624
if you could get rid of Tomita?

22
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:33,760
What do you mean?

23
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,263
If you put in the wrong kind of effort,

24
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,067
you might find yourself in trouble.

25
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,808
It must be tough for you…

26
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,978
trying to please everyone.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,517
Tatsuya Kazaki
is the current State Minister of Justice.

28
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,420
For Seko, who's eyeing
the position of Supreme Court Justice,

29
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,589
Kazaki would be a valuable ally.

30
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,023
As I've mentioned before,

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,262
Tomita and Kazaki belong to rival factions
within the same Mineito Party.

32
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,733
However, with Tomita out of the picture,
Kazaki faces no opposition.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,669
The next Minister of Justice
is almost certain to be him.

34
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,571
Consequently, to Kazaki,

35
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,542
Ms. Sawahara became a nuisance
for covering many of his scandals.

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,146
So, he instructed Ueda
to pin the information leak on her.

37
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,115
With his influence
over the higher-ups in the justice system,

38
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,353
Kazaki swayed the presiding judge
to ensure Ms. Sawahara's conviction.

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,288
Namely, Judge Seko.

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,790
It's frightening

41
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,960
to think individuals like them
are politicians and judges.

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,462
This is so wrong.

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,598
Those who gain twisted power

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,702
lose themselves
in their desperation to cling to it.

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,674
They fail to recognize what they're doing
is morally wrong as humans.

46
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,077
Wait, when did you two
find out about Seko?

47
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,979
Am I the only one who was in the dark?

48
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,650
As we were digging,
we pieced together Mr. Akizumi's plan.

49
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,422
Well, either way, if we want to secure
an acquittal for Ms. Sawahara,

50
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,126
we have no choice but to uncover the ties
between Judge Seko and politicians.

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,296
This will also pave the way
for winning a retrial for Mr. Matsunaga.

52
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,365
And…

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,503
I will make Seko get what she deserves.

54
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,672
What she deserves?

55
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,107
An impeachment trial.

56
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,677
An impeachment trial?

57
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,780
<i>You mean the one where
you can remove a judge from office?</i>

58
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,215
<i>It would mean a judge,</i>

59
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,451
<i>who usually passes judgment on others,
faces judgment themselves.</i>

60
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,752
<i>True. If we pursue this,</i>

61
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,056
we can legally remove Seko
from her position as a judge.

62
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,493
But only a few judges
have ever been impeached.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,128
It must be a difficult process.

64
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,166
Naturally, evidence is crucial.
That's the law in our legal system.

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,071
We need proof that Seko and Kazaki
are unlawfully connected.

66
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,138
NARUMI SEKO
TATSUYA KAZAKI

67
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,575
A world built
on money and lust is fragile.

68
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,144
Like a paper tiger,

69
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,381
it will collapse…

70
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,052
with one small puncture.

71
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,136
When you're the guest speaker,
State Minister of Justice Kazaki,

72
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,438
it's no surprise people gather.

73
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,440
So, what did you want to discuss?

74
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,743
There's this bothersome attorney.

75
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,113
He's handling
Maki Sawahara's defense and--

76
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,648
You mean Akizumi?

77
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,017
Ueda has briefed me.

78
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,121
He's also the one
who took down Diet member Tomita.

79
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,592
JAPAN ECONOMICS AND LAW FORUM
EARLY SUMMER GATHERING

80
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,895
<i>Now, we'll have today's guest speaker,</i>

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,899
<i>Mr. Tatsuya Kazaki,
the State Minister of Justice,</i>

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,235
<i>to deliver his speech.</i>

83
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,438
<i>State Minister Kazaki,
please take the stage.</i>

84
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,542
It seems it's starting.

85
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,647
<i>As introduced just now,</i>

86
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,784
<i>I am Tatsuya Kazaki,
the State Minister of Justice.</i>

87
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,056
Hey, do you think Seko had
political backing 12 years ago?

88
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,292
No, at that time, Seko was just
an ordinary judge in the Chiba office.

89
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,127
She wasn't on a fast-track career path.

90
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,395
In that case,

91
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,666
maybe Seko began to rise to success
after that incident 12 years ago.

92
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,771
Some time ago, I had the chance
to review Mr. Akizumi's past case files.

93
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,109
<i>But they were all unrelated
to the incident from 12 years ago.</i>

94
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,145
Suddenly,
Mr. Akizumi started to take action…

95
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,314
I wonder what prompted him.

96
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,188
He's here!

97
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,096
Mr. Akizumi, he's here.

98
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,498
<i>He's heading your way.</i>

99
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,433
Right. Good work.

100
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,442
Now, shall we begin soon?

101
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,680
As Japan's economic society
becomes globalized,

102
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,150
free competition is advancing…

103
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,818
What a coincidence, Judge Seko.

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,489
What are you up to?

105
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,257
What do you mean?

106
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,558
As I've said before,

107
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,928
you shouldn't deliberately
engage with the presiding judge.

108
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,530
It's extremely inappropriate.

109
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,733
I'm simply attending this event
as a legal professional

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,237
who is concerned
about the future of our judicial system.

111
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,973
What about you?

112
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,676
Is it appropriate
for an active judge to appear at an event

113
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,312
clearly endorsing a politician?

114
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm here to greet a Ministry of Justice
acquaintance who has helped me before.

115
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,519
You have no right to criticize me.

116
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,686
Leave immediately.

117
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,690
This isn't a courtroom,

118
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,960
and you have no right
to order me to leave.

119
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,763
…that is my sincere wish.

120
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,699
Thank you very much, everyone!

121
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,971
Sir, please stop!

122
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,206
Shut up!

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,841
Let go of me!

124
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,576
Sir, please--

125
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,477
Seko!

126
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,245
Where the hell is Seko?

127
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,580
Why?

128
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,516
Tomita?

129
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,486
He's been arrested, so why is he here?

130
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,855
It appears he was released the other day.

131
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,424
He's a nuisance. Get rid of him.

132
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,358
Right away.

133
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,461
-Seko!
-Sir!

134
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,196
Sir!

135
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,130
Seko!

136
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,700
So it's true!

137
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,207
After all I've done for you…

138
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,778
you repay my kindness with evil.

139
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,747
What is this about? I don't understand--

140
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,182
Don't pretend you don't know!

141
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,450
What's this about?

142
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,552
Let's discuss this outside. Come.

143
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,554
You stay out of this.

144
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,323
Mr. Tomita, let's speak over there.

145
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,357
It's all right.

146
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,326
-Everything is under control.
-This way.

147
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,227
Let's go.

148
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,930
Everything is all right.
Please don't worry.

149
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,669
What is going on? What did I do to you?

150
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,973
You're the one who set me up.

151
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,908
What are you talking about?

152
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,311
You wanted to drive me out of politics
because I became a hindrance.

153
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,480
You colluded with that corrupt attorney.

154
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,951
You set me and Shoichiro up together!

155
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,586
That's not true!

156
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,857
You're already here to curry favor
with the next Minister of Justice.

157
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,325
You misunderstand me.

158
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,832
Have you forgotten the lengths I went
to secure your release?

159
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,001
Even that…

160
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,204
seems doubtful now.

161
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,975
I'm at this event as an individual
for social reasons,

162
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,511
not because I wanted to be here.

163
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,015
The only one
truly fit to be Minister of Justice…

164
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,250
is you,

165
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,486
Mr. Tomita.

166
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,590
You're not the kind of person to end here.

167
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,126
I believe that.

168
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,462
That's why I pulled strings
within the prosecution

169
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,298
to get the indictment withdrawn.

170
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,404
<i>I intend to do everything I can
to ensure your return.</i>

171
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,775
It's just as we thought.

172
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,344
Seko was involved in Tomita's release.

173
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,581
To Seko, her connection
with Tomita is now a blemish.

174
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,784
Yet, there's a reason
she can't simply discard him.

175
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,021
There's something she can't risk
Tomita exposing about her.

176
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,490
To Seko, Tomita is a ticking bomb.

177
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,327
But how did you trick Tomita?

178
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,429
The best way
to make someone believe a lie…

179
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,835
is to use the person
they believe is most loyal to them.

180
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,670
DETAINED

181
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,472
Why wouldn't I?

182
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,042
After all, you're innocent.

183
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,046
You want to help me?

184
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,816
What a joke.

185
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,319
It's all your fault that Mr. Tomita was--

186
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,388
Have you heard that Tomita was released?

187
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,325
He must've used every connection he had.

188
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,495
It might be a matter of time
before the charges are dropped.

189
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,065
But what about you?

190
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:39,238
Why didn't Tomita get you released
along with him?

191
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,340
There's only one reason.

192
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,310
It's a trick politicians often use.

193
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,380
"My secretary acted alone."

194
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,315
That one.

195
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,853
<i>I'm truly sorry.</i>

196
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,424
I caused a scene at your important event.

197
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,160
Tomita is the one to blame.

198
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,762
You just had some bad luck.

199
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,930
I never expected him
to be resentful toward me.

200
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,399
Good grief.

201
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,136
He was only going to embarrass himself
by marching into enemy territory.

202
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,872
I wonder how he managed to get in.

203
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,773
Indeed.

204
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,343
<i>You wanted to drive me out of politics
because I became a hindrance.</i>

205
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,146
You colluded with that corrupt attorney.

206
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,787
There's no question
that there was bribery…

207
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,456
between Tomita and Seko.

208
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,392
But Tomita must have been
careful about this.

209
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,962
He didn't let us secretaries get involved.

210
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,865
So, you don't have
any evidence to prove it.

211
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,267
Is that right?

212
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,702
Yes.

213
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,936
Well then, Mr. Kosugi.

214
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,241
Do you know something about this case?

215
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,544
Six months ago,

216
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,480
Mr. Masato Matsunaga
was convicted in a trial.

217
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,484
One of his friends confessed

218
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,221
that Diet member Tomita
was bribing people to alter testimonies.

219
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,523
You're aware of this, aren't you?

220
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,360
Please tell us the truth.

221
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
Don't worry.

222
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,700
Tomita instructed me, and…

223
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,206
I distributed the money.

224
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,347
Could you…

225
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,816
testify to that?

226
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,085
-I can't--
-Mr. Kosugi.

227
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,724
Think very carefully…

228
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,762
about who can protect you right now.

229
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,699
Very well.

230
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,435
I'll testify.

231
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,645
Good day.

232
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,981
Are you sure…

233
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,583
everything is all right?

234
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,853
If you let me handle everything,
you have nothing to worry about.

235
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,122
All right then.

236
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,571
Mr. Matsunaga!

237
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,643
It seems we can petition…

238
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,545
for your retrial.

239
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,881
Every testimony at your trial

240
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,784
was dishonestly manipulated by Tomita.

241
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,487
We've found someone
who will testify to that.

242
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,990
This time for sure…

243
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,593
I'll secure your acquittal.

244
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,200
Please do.

245
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,503
I will.

246
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:14,086
As I suspected, Akizumi was
behind the secretary's release.

247
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,756
All right. You may go.

248
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,598
What will you do now?

249
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,734
<i>What else is there to do?</i>

250
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,637
<i>Right?</i>

251
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,585
This is the Akizumi Law Office.

252
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:50,923
Mr. Akizumi.

253
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,362
This is Akizumi. What's the matter?

254
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,529
<i>Um…</i>

255
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,399
The other day, I said I'd testify for you.

256
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,467
Yes.

257
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,636
<i>I want you…</i>

258
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,138
to forget I said that.

259
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,806
What?

260
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,109
<i>I take back everything I said.</i>

261
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,712
Also, I don't need you
to defend me anymore.

262
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,514
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,016
This isn't what you agreed to.

264
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,652
Anyway, that's what I've decided.

265
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,786
-<i>Mr. Kosugi!</i>
-Well then.

266
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,940
It seems Kosugi has joined
the Kazaki camp as a secretary.

267
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,311
Kosugi couldn't hope for a better
opportunity than joining the Kazaki camp,

268
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,012
the most powerful faction right now.

269
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,948
It's pointless to try to persuade him.

270
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,349
But why the sudden change?

271
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,986
Perhaps our actions were leaked to them.

272
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,989
It's possible Seko pulled some strings.

273
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,895
Ms. Sawahara.

274
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,432
I need you to do something for us.

275
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,009
Damn it!

276
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,812
Mr. Kosugi won't answer.

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,948
What are you here for?

278
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,117
To assist you.

279
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,285
Huh?

280
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,687
You must realize by now

281
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,190
who your true enemies are.

282
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,764
Seko and Kosugi.

283
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,600
They were planning to set you up
from the beginning.

284
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,672
Seko already intended
to wash her hands of you and join Kazaki.

285
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,576
That's why she used Mr. Shoichiro's trial.

286
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,077
Shoichiro's trial?

287
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,481
The footage that incriminated you
is the evidence.

288
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,417
You remember who it showed, don't you?

289
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,755
<i>This is your reward for providing us
with the dashcam footage.</i>

290
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,655
<i>But I can't--</i>

291
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,724
…orchestrate things
in your business's favor.

292
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,661
I trust you'll work with us.

293
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,598
<i>Kosugi intentionally
recorded that footage.</i>

294
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,733
<i>As a result, he was arrested too.</i>

295
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,403
However, his plan
was to pin all the blame on you,

296
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,172
and to have Seko exonerate him.

297
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,541
But Seko secured my release…

298
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,578
Her decision to release you was merely
a tactic to lower your defenses.

299
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,948
Now, it seems she's pulling strings
within the prosecution

300
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,551
to have you rearrested.

301
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,852
Rearrested?

302
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,820
Impossible.

303
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,723
How could you have that information?

304
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,326
You see, one of my clients is a reporter.

305
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,566
This is Ms. Sawahara, the former
vice editor-in-chief of Taiyo Weekly.

306
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,468
She specializes in politics.

307
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,137
According to my source,

308
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,208
the authorities will come
to search your house within a few days.

309
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,910
Like that's possible…

310
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,446
You've committed many other crimes.

311
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,449
And Seko has covered them up.

312
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,384
Is that what you thought?

313
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,021
But Seko has a connection
with the prosecution's head.

314
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,056
If they wished,

315
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,826
they could issue an arrest warrant
for you at any time.

316
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,730
They're trying to bring you down again
with what they have on you.

317
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,133
For what?

318
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,868
Isn't it obvious?

319
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,604
To solidify Kazaki's position.

320
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,707
You stand to lose everything,

321
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,010
while they continue to profit at leisure.

322
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,115
Even your son, Mr. Shoichiro, is caught
in the crossfire of this power struggle.

323
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,484
Will you let this continue?

324
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,453
You can still prevent this.

325
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,755
Strike first before they do.

326
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,657
Even if it means risking everything.

327
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,562
You possess the means to do so.

328
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,334
<i>People make mistakes.</i>

329
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,105
But they're also capable
of correcting their mistakes.

330
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,309
I hope you'll face your errors, repent,

331
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,079
and become the latter.

332
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,784
I was listening to your ruling today.

333
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,989
You seemed genuinely concerned
about the accused.

334
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,124
It's nothing so grandiose.

335
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,327
By the way…

336
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,798
you met Chief Prosecutor Datehara
the other day, right?

337
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,771
As his aide, you don't miss much, do you?

338
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,439
What did you discuss?

339
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,347
It's rude to pry into a conversation
between a man and a woman.

340
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,227
I've come…

341
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,996
to confirm something one last time.

342
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,498
One last time?

343
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,934
Won't you come clean about everything?

344
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,803
About your crimes?

345
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,239
Ridiculous.

346
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,008
You volunteer at that children's home.

347
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,684
The children admire you.

348
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,723
You're just, kind…

349
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,659
and compassionate.

350
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,331
They see you as a judge worthy of respect.

351
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,534
Can you face them…

352
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,072
with your head held high?

353
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,042
"People make mistakes."

354
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,180
"But they're also capable
of correcting their mistakes."

355
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,149
That's what you said earlier.

356
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,429
I am a judge.

357
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,634
I may pass judgment on crimes,

358
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,604
but I never commit them myself.

359
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,414
Is that so?

360
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,062
<i>I bribed Judge Seko.</i>

361
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,464
<i>The total was over 20 million yen.</i>

362
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,901
<i>She covered up my son's crimes</i>

363
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,104
<i>and did other favors for me.</i>

364
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,006
<i>In return,</i>

365
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,244
<i>we agreed that I would support her
to become the Supreme Court Justice.</i>

366
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
<i>How did you transfer the money?</i>

367
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,548
<i>I handed it to her personally in cash.</i>

368
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,685
<i>Compare this
with the contents of Seko's safe.</i>

369
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,753
<i>Everything is recorded here.</i>

370
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,723
Wow.

371
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,326
He confessed everything,

372
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,262
even how he bribed her
and the total amount.

373
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,731
I'm surprised he took such a big risk.

374
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,133
Mr. Akizumi,

375
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,337
you pushed Tomita into a corner
so that he would do this.

376
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,606
His secretary betraying him
was also part of the plan.

377
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,078
Actually, there's been a man
hanging around the office lately.

378
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,913
He's Prosecutor Kikuchi,

379
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,315
a subordinate
of Chief Prosecutor Datehara.

380
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,651
Chief Prosecutor Datehara?

381
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,655
Everything Kikuchi reports
also reaches Seko through Datehara.

382
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,224
Is that why you called Kosugi
to our office?

383
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,125
<i>All right then.</i>

384
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:45,630
<i>You deliberately wanted to demonstrate
your connection with Kosugi.</i>

385
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,534
Upon hearing Kikuchi's report,
Seko must have felt uneasy…

386
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,140
<i>knowing that someone aware of her secrets
was within my reach, of all people.</i>

387
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,210
<i>I could expose them at any moment.</i>

388
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,980
<i>This is why Seko turned to Kazaki,</i>

389
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,615
and brought Kosugi around.

390
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,517
And that's why Tomita…

391
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:10,288
When people feel isolated and suspicious,
they often reveal their vulnerabilities.

392
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,423
Everything…

393
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,825
was done to bring down Seko.

394
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,265
The indictment request

395
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,768
for your impeachment trial
has been accepted.

396
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,804
The Committee will review it soon.

397
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,907
Who initiated this?

398
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,475
The request was submitted…

399
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:31,910
by Seiji Tomita.

400
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,446
<i>The agent…</i>

401
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,415
<i>is Masaki Akizumi.</i>

402
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,520
MR. KAZAKI

403
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,129
<i>A cornered animal is a dangerous foe.</i>

404
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,899
This situation seems to be exactly that.

405
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,902
You have influence even over Diet members.

406
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,337
Make them drop this indictment request.

407
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,609
What?

408
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,012
Right now…

409
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,849
I'm in deep shock.

410
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,420
You were supposed to be
the epitome of a fair judge.

411
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,390
Instead, you were blinded
by position and money.

412
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:25,464
And you were convicting innocent people
to further your own career.

413
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,734
What are you saying?

414
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,907
You dragged me down this path!

415
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,445
You introduced me to politicians.

416
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,082
And pushed me to accept bribes.

417
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,388
Did I?

418
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,890
Don't play games.

419
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,927
I never wanted to gain this position
using such methods, not in the slightest!

420
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,197
You never wanted it?

421
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,100
How strange.

422
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,036
You disregarded my advice

423
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,373
and took steps
to safeguard your current position.

424
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,408
That's how it appeared to me.

425
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,477
It seems…

426
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,047
there's nothing more I can do for you.

427
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,518
I see.

428
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,053
So, you're not concerned?

429
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,559
I might reveal everything at my trial.

430
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,964
Including what happened 12 years ago.

431
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,771
I wonder how many people

432
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,941
will believe your words now?

433
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,346
It's a lonely thought.

434
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,782
To think…

435
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,185
I'll never see you in the courtroom again.

436
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,774
There's no longer a place for you there.

437
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,513
How dare you.

438
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,716
You've brought this upon yourself.

439
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,420
You've just destroyed

440
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,690
everything I've worked so hard to build.

441
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,025
What you've built
isn't a legacy of achievements,

442
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,495
but stacks of bills
tainted with corruption.

443
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,434
I needed power.

444
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:47,038
Overwhelming power
that would silence all dissent!

445
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,744
A man like yourself
could never understand.

446
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,048
The frustration of never being
acknowledged solely for your skills

447
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,883
simply because you're a woman.

448
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,952
Nor the humiliation
of being underestimated

449
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,787
by less competent men.

450
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,726
In the Diet, the Cabinet,
and even within the realm of judges,

451
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,162
there are far too few women
represented in this country.

452
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,232
I needed to climb to the top
and deliver results!

453
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,235
I have a mission.

454
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,871
I only did what was necessary

455
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,841
to bring about change in this country.

456
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,276
You might have a point.

457
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,046
Currently, in this country…

458
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,583
many women are having
their dignity crushed

459
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,319
and enduring humiliation.

460
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,490
That includes Ms. Maki Sawahara.

461
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,629
She tried to do
what was right as a journalist.

462
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,933
However, because of men
who saw her as an obstacle,

463
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:53,772
she was framed as a criminal
despite her innocence.

464
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:59,244
You were supposed to understand her
better than anyone else.

465
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,712
Yet, instead of aiding her,

466
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,747
you attempted to bring her down,

467
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,583
just like those men.

468
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,088
You only desired power.

469
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,992
Perhaps initially, you acted on a whim.

470
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,828
But people become accustomed to it.

471
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,865
They descend down a dark path,

472
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,736
and as they immerse themselves
in its tepid comfort,

473
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,205
their senses grow dull.

474
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:33,211
To the point
where they irrationally believe

475
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,315
that it's acceptable to convict
an innocent person.

476
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,455
The men who have trampled upon your pride
and yourself at this moment…

477
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,225
Who is worse, I wonder.

478
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,698
<i>Yata no Kagami</i>.

479
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:58,636
The mirror that reflects
clear, unclouded truth.

480
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,309
Your conscience has been clouded
by selfish desires.

481
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,278
You no longer have the right
to wear that badge.

482
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,718
I offered you a final warning
the other day.

483
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,221
Perhaps I wanted to believe.

484
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,758
"Behind sad incidents,
there are suffering children."

485
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,761
"I want to be of some help to them."

486
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,665
I wanted to believe
that at least you meant those words.

487
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,370
That when you said them
and looked toward the children…

488
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,275
your eyes weren't clouded.

489
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,481
It seems I was mistaken.

490
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,817
I'm disappointed.

491
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,084
<i>So, in addition to suppressing evidence
and hiding criminals,</i>

492
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,888
<i>you're also admitting
to bribing Judge Seko?</i>

493
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,456
<i>Absolutely.</i>

494
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,861
<i>I want to apologize
to the citizens I've betrayed</i>

495
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,832
<i>and to my son whom I've implicated.</i>

496
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:39,971
Thanks to Tomita admitting his corruption,
public opinion has shifted significantly.

497
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,506
Yes.

498
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,875
That's why Judge Seko's impeachment trial

499
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,412
<i>is moving forward
with unprecedented speed.</i>

500
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,013
…and your date of birth.

501
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,617
Are they correct as stated
in the grounds for indictment?

502
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,590
Ms. Sawahara's second instance…

503
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,858
This is the decision.

504
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,993
<i>…was delayed because of Seko's indictment.</i>

505
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,094
The accused…

506
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,865
<i>I'm glad she was found innocent.</i>

507
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,036
Yes.

508
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,711
Next…

509
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,786
Mr. Akamine.

510
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,056
Let's go.

511
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,902
Now, defense counsel.

512
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,173
Please deliver your final argument.

513
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,449
Mr. Matsunaga…

514
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,085
is a victim.

515
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,490
A sloppy investigation
by the police and prosecution,

516
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,695
negligence and abdication
of responsibility by the defense counsel,

517
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,863
and unlawful dealings by the judge.

518
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,168
Many people contributed
to Mr. Matsunaga's wrongful conviction.

519
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,039
Mr. Matsunaga's dignity

520
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,376
was deeply harmed by these individuals.

521
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,714
The evidence speaks for itself.

522
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,749
But I urge…

523
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,153
everyone involved in the law
to take this opportunity

524
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,823
to reflect on their own ethics.

525
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,460
We are the ones…

526
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,130
who robbed the light
from Mr. Matsunaga's life.

527
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,667
It is his natural right…

528
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,271
to walk with his head held high.

529
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,742
And it is our duty to protect that right.

530
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,745
This is for Mr. Matsunaga,

531
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,047
and to prevent…

532
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,319
others from suffering as he did.

533
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,621
I am determined…

534
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,258
to overturn this ruling…

535
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,629
with responsibility and resolve.

536
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,705
Mr. Matsunaga is innocent.

537
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,709
That is all.

538
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,999
I will now deliver the verdict

539
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,770
on the accused, Masato Matsunaga,
regarding the injury case.

540
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,706
The decision.

541
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,009
The accused…

542
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,912
is found innocent.

543
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,666
<i>I'm…</i>

544
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,469
<i>truly sorry.</i>

545
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,375
If only I had more skill…

546
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,312
It took…

547
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,284
It took so long.

548
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm so sorry.

549
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,790
For so long…

550
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,994
I thought my life was over.

551
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,099
I had given up,
thinking I could never trust anyone.

552
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,770
But you made me believe
that I could trust someone again.

553
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,041
Thank you.

554
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,817
<i>I see.</i>

555
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,585
So, you're reporting for Tokyo Chuo?

556
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,486
Yes.

557
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,054
Thanks to you.

558
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,122
No.

559
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,324
Without your help,

560
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,094
we couldn't have secured
Mr. Matsunaga's acquittal.

561
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,228
This experience

562
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,165
has made me realize the issues
of Japan's justice system firsthand.

563
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,800
I want to shed light on them in my own way

564
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,570
for other victims of false accusations.

565
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,405
Is that so?

566
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,009
In that case,

567
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,545
I have some information for you.

568
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,883
Hey, put them away.

569
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,984
Honestly.

FALSE ACCUSATION
IN ITOI FAMILY MURDERS?

<i>Judge Seko has handed down
a death sentence in a trial</i>

573
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,603
<i>concerning the Itoi family murders
12 years ago.</i>

574

<i>The condemned criminal, Yusaku Shimizu,

Thanks.

583

It's finally moving forward.

584
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,768
Mr. Akizumi must've asked Ms. Sawahara.

585
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,539
He's trying to secure a retrial
for Mr. Shimizu using the mass media.

586
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,242
All the cases following Shoichiro's

587
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,211
are connected to the false accusation
against Mr. Shimizu.

588
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,014
There's just one thing.

589
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,750

FALSE ACCUSATION
IN ITOI FAMILY MURDERS?

591
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,092
You're behind this article, aren't you?

592
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,628
Yes.

593
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,964
I told you I didn't want a retrial.

594
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,800
Why not?

595
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,704
I've made up my mind

596
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,107
to die quietly without causing trouble.

597
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,909
Is that for your daughter?

598
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,514
The last time you saw her…

599
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,250
was before the incident.

600
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,819
When Ms. Saya was five years old.

601
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,691
Stop it.

602
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,093
She's now 17.

603
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,763
She's very sweet and smart.

604
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,664
Stop!

605
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
I have no right…

606
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,802
to hear about her.

607
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,282
Put it away.

608
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,452
-Now!
-Look at her.

609
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,621
This is your daughter who's grown.

610
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,522
Stop!

611
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,192
Because if you see it,
your desire to see her will be too strong?

612
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,697
You must've imagined
what kind of woman Ms. Saya has become,

613
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,599
who she's living with,
what expression she wears.

614
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,036
These 12 years,
you must've imagined it all this time,

615
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,571
again and again!

616
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,174
You must want to know.
You must want to see her.

617
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,310
You must want to see her right now
and hold her!

618
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,080
Because you're her father!

619
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,317
And Ms. Saya must be feeling the same way.

620
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,352
No!

621
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,292
There's no way she wants
to see her father who's on death row!

622
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,033
I've committed a crime.

623
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,536
A very terrible crime.

624
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,541
Stop coming.

625
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,612
You might die tomorrow.

626
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,384
Once the sentence is carried out,

627
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,486
Ms. Saya won't ever see you again.

628
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,123
She won't be able to touch you
or hear your voice.

629
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,324
But that's not all.

630
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,194
She won't ever know your innocence.

631
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,196
She'll have to go on living

632
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,900
as the daughter of a murderer!

633
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,302
And that might even be

634
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,440
a crueler fate than your death sentence.

635
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,979
You're the only one who can protect her!

636
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,851
I know I'm asking for much.

637
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,219
But please,

638
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,555
think about it.

639
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,360
I promise…

640
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,364
to secure an acquittal for you.

641
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,071
I'm calling it a day.

642
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,206
See you.

ITOI FAMILY MURDERS CASE

654
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,515
TO AKIZUMI

655
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,419
You saw the news, didn't you?

656
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,391
TO AKIZUMI

657
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,095
What are you doing?

658
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,207
I've come…

659
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,044
to apologize to you.

660
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,388
Everything that happened…

661
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,292
is my fault.

662
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,931
I'll tell you everything.

663
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,802
Everything that happened…

664
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,306
12 years ago.

665
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,800
Who's Egoshi?

666
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,208
This person is connected
to Mr. Shimizu's case, right?

667
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,648
And you're trying to locate this person…

668
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,485
in exchange for getting an acquittal.

669
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,392
Tell me everything.

670
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,357
HIYAMA

671
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,862
I won't let you get away again.

673
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,514
I've been looking for you for so long.

674
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,916
Do you remember
what happened 12 years ago?

675
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,651
Mr. Shimizu was wrongly accused.

676
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,920
I didn't do it.

677
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,989
I killed the boss.

678
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,091
Ms. Saya!

679
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,826
Mr. Akizumi will accept it.

680
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,262
I'm truly sorry.

681
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,464
Mr. Akizumi.

682
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,701
Let me prove your innocence.
