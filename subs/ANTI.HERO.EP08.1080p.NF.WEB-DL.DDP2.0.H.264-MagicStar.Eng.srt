1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,510
HIYAMA

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,114
I won't let you get away again.

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,118
How?

4
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:07,500
This will be enough evidence
to prove you killed Mr. Hanegi.

5
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,938
I wanted to find out.

6
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,074
Why Mr. Akizumi…

7
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,110
got an acquittal for you.

8
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,746
You're also connected…

9
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,316
to the Itoi family murders
from 12 years ago.

10
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,153
In exchange
for getting acquitted of the murder,

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,756
you do whatever Mr. Akizumi asks.

12
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,926
Isn't that right?

13
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,730
Please answer me.

14
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,572
Come in.

15
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,785
I'll clean them up right now.

16
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,556
That file…

17
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,359
documents what happened 12 years ago.

18
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,864
It was left by Ms. Reiko Momose,

19
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,366
Mr. Akizumi's former colleague.

20
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,401
Momose?

21
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,471
You want to learn…

22
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,641
about Mr. Yusaku Shimizu, don't you?

23
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,046
What do you mean…

24
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,616
you've come to apologize?

25
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,420
Mr. Akizumi?

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,031
Your father…

27
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,773
Mr. Yusaku Shimizu…

28
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,343
is innocent.

29
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,051
Are these all the documents she compiled
about the Itoi family murders?

30
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,886
Thank you.

31
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,055
Ms. Momose was the first to suspect

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,990
that Mr. Shimizu was wrongly accused.

33
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:17,130
But Mr. Shimizu had a compelling motive
for committing murder.

34
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,132
Embezzlement, right?

35
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,033
Right.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,871
The Chiba Police suspected
Mr. Shimizu and Mr. Itoi's involvement.

37
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,807
But they couldn't find
conclusive evidence.

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,778
Then Mr. Itoi was murdered by someone.

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,348
And suspicion fell on Mr. Shimizu.

40
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,817
The prefectural police found evidence

41
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,987
of both their involvement
in embezzlement at Mr. Itoi's house.

42
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,490
The prosecution
began questioning Mr. Shimizu.

43
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,392
A prosecutor was assigned to the task,

44
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,162
who was assisting at the time
from the Saitama office.

45
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,164
<i>That prosecutor was Mr. Akizumi.</i>

46
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,201
I was assigned…

47
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,074
to question Mr. Shimizu.

48
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,710
Mr. Shimizu…

49
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,679
consistently denied committing the murder.

50
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,584
At the time of the incident,
he claimed he was at a park

51
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,154
<i>searching for his daughter's
stuffed bunny at her request.</i>

52
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,627
But…

53
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,962
at the time…

54
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,100
I blindly trusted
the prosecution's fairness.

55
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,138
And I didn't doubt
that he was the culprit.

56
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,042
I didn't do it.

57
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,712
I was searching for a stuffed toy
at a park during that time!

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,681
A stuffed toy?

59
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,284
You've said that dozens of times already.

60
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,019
Believe me.

61
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,153
It's true.

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,055
I was really looking for it!

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,623
You weren't looking for it.

64
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,924
You were killing people!

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,163
You had a dispute with the victim
over the embezzlement.

66
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,698
No.

67
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,833
Your wife at least thinks you did it.

68
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,707
A reporter gave me this picture.

69
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,543
Apparently, she left the house
with your daughter.

70
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,412
It seems she's preparing for a divorce.

71
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,981
With a five-year-old child,

72
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,051
being hounded by the media
day in and day out…

73
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,019
The poor thing.

74
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,790
I hope this doesn't
emotionally scar your daughter.

75
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,258
S-Saya…

76
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,094
Whose fault do you think this is?!

77
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,331
Are you going
to keep causing pain to your family?!

78
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,870
I heard about your wife.

79
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,274
It was a traffic accident.

80
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,212
Your daughter…

81
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,451
has been taken in by a children's home.

82
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,489
After moving, going through a divorce,

83
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,093
and finding a job…

84
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,497
Just when they were starting over.

85
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,336
They deserved…

86
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,506
a different life.

87
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,756
I did this…

88
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,462
I did this…

89
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,233
Could you say that again, clearly?

90
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,069
Who…

91
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,872
killed Mr. Itoi?

92
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,609
I…

93
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,383
did it.

94
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,960
<i>I compelled your father
to confess to the crime.</i>

95
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,166
Given these reasons,
I will now deliver the verdict.

96
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,268
The decision.

97
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,570
The accused…

98
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,507
is sentenced to death.

99
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,279
If you are dissatisfied with this verdict,

100
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,081
file an appeal with this courthouse
within 14 days from tomorrow,

101
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,984
addressing it to the Tokyo High Court…

102
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,724
I'm the one who put your father…

103
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,597
on death row.

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,110
I'm truly sorry.

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,756
It was six years after the trial…

106
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,261
that I realized my mistake.

107
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,067
The one who informed me…

108
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,303
was someone you also knew well.

109
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,108
Momose told me.

110
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,611
That you…

111
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,647
were at a dog shelter.

112
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,118
<i>That day,</i>

113
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,021
<i>when I met you and Cocoa.</i>

114
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,358
<i>I realized that I had taken away…</i>

115
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,697
a beloved father from someone so young.

116
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,614
Ms. Momose became aware that Mr. Shimizu
might have been falsely accused

117
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,516
and was continuing her investigations.

118
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,520
However, she discovered she was ill
and was unable to achieve her goal.

119
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,922
<i>That's Ms. Momose.</i>

120
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,090
She passed away a long time ago.

121
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,861
In the file that Ms. Momose
entrusted to Mr. Akizumi,

122
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,929
she wrote this.

123
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,098
"An officer
from the Chiba Police at the time,

124
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:30,570
had found video footage
proving Mr. Shimizu's alibi."

125
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,676
And the one who covered it up was…

126
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,710
Answer me.

127
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,781
You unlawfully
covered that up, didn't you?

128
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,317
Was it…

129
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,485
my father?

130
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,387
Your father…

131
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,489
and Mr. Datehara.

132
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,293
Carrying on Ms. Momose's wish,

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,529
Mr. Akizumi attempted
to look into the footage.

134
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,599
However, despite having an ongoing case,

135
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,335
he was abruptly ordered
to transfer to the countryside.

136
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,605
Mr. Datehara must have intervened.

137
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,743
So, Mr. Akizumi is currently searching
for this footage?

138
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,084
One year ago,

139
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,720
my mother back home passed away.

140
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,423
When I was in middle school, my dad died.

141
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,426
After that, she raised me all by herself.

142
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,795
Your mom's in critical condition?

143
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,697
Whatever. Why don't you go, then?

144
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,798
Thank you.

145
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,333
You'll be fired, though.

146
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,370
We don't need irresponsible people

147
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,038
who abandon their duties.

148
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,643
<i>Looking back,
I should've ignored him and gone anyway.</i>

149
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,113
<i>But I was afraid of losing this job
that I had finally secured</i>

150
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,848
<i>as a regular employee.</i>

151
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,251
That's why, despite the cruel treatment,

152
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,820
I gritted my teeth and kept working.

153
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,724
But…

154
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,192
<i>Are you really talking back?</i>

155
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,728
How rude.

156
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,263
Is this how you were raised?

157
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,766
Did your mother not teach you anything?

158
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,700
Well?

159
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,036
Bring your mom sometime.

160
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,170
Oh, my bad.

161
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,638
She died, didn't she?

162
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,141
Good thing she died, huh?

163
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,344
Now, you can keep working here forever.

164
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,149
Take it back!

165
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,050
Huh?

166
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,385
How dare you insult my mom's death!

167
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,453
Take it back!

168
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,355
Let go of me!

169
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,761
What the hell is this?

170
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,864
You'd better clean that up.

171
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,332
It'll get in the way of work.

172
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,872
<i>To celebrate me
landing a job after college,</i>

173
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,176
my mom bought this for me
with the money she saved up.

174
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,511
Despite her poor health, she kept working.

175
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,914
She pushed herself hard
to send me to college.

176
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,352
Because she believed it would give me
better job opportunities.

177
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,359
That's why I couldn't tell her
about my failed job hunt.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,364
When I lied and said I found a job,

179
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,701
Mom was overjoyed.

180
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:18,971
But…

181
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
Her feelings were trampled upon.

182
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,613
I'll kill him.

183
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,485
<i>Next thing I realized,
I was out of control.</i>

184
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,692
I committed murder.

185
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,696
<i>I can't go back to being honest anymore.</i>

186
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,965
<i>I could die right then and there.</i>

187
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,000
<i>That's what I thought when…</i>

188
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,503
You have a visitor.

189
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,705
-Get ready to come out.
-Right.

190
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,782
Who's the visitor?

191
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,450
An attorney.

192
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,290
Um…

193
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,826
Are you eating properly?

194
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,029
Mr. Keita Hiyama.

195
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,267
I've been looking for you for so long.

196
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,871
Do you remember
what happened 12 years ago?

197
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,040
Perhaps I should clarify.

198
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,712
It's about the time
you were taking jobs from Spilldoor.

199
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,149
I'm looking for a certain video.

200
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,222
I've come here because I figured
you might know where to find it.

201
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,892
What's this about?

202
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,230
You used to live in Hanamigawa Ward,
Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture 12 years ago.

203
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,967
At a nearby park called Hishimi Park,

204
00:13:55,034 --> 00:14:00,339
a video secretly filming a woman
was uploaded to the illegal site.

205
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,544
Does this ring any bells?

206
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,414
<i>The illegal site?</i>

207
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,883
After lying to my mom about getting a job,

208
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,786
I didn't want to add
to her financial stress.

209
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
That's when…

210
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,891
I was introduced.

211
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,493
To a guy named Egoshi.

212
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,932
<i>There were tons of anonymous job listings
on the illegal site.</i>

213
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,901
<i>Like being a receiver for fraud</i>

214
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,803
<i>and handling illegal drugs.</i>

215
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,772
<i>There were even postings
for disposing of a dead body</i>

216
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,107
<i>and other things as well.</i>

217
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,408
Don't worry.

218
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,410
The tasks are simple.

219
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,147
<i>I'd heard there were
some dangerous people behind Egoshi, but…</i>

220
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,149
<i>I was stupid.</i>

221
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,085
One of the tasks…

222
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,054
involved secretly taking videos.

223
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,623
And…

224
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,426
when I was filming
at a nearby park, I captured…

225
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,795
<i>Mr. Yusaku Shimizu.</i>

226
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,567
He's a condemned criminal
convicted in the Itoi family murders.

227
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:10,175
The video was taken
on March 4th, 2012, at around 7:30 p.m.

228
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,714
Around the same time
as the Itoi family murders.

229
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,718
This implies that Mr. Shimizu
was at an entirely different location

230
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,255
at the time he was supposed
to be committing murder at the Itoi home.

231
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,228
This video will be crucial evidence

232
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,897
in proving Mr. Shimizu's innocence.

233
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,601
Do you mean…

234
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,571
It seems the video used to be
on the illegal site.

235
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,078
It was found that the video
was taken by a user called Kei.

236
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,647
And this user was…

237
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,085
I'm "Kei."

238
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,921
I filmed the video.

239
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,562
But I can't help you.

240
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,634
Once I send Egoshi
the videos I've taken, they're gone.

241
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,970
I don't have them anymore.

242
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,839
Who's Egoshi?

243
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,577
Is he the administrator?

244
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,478
Yes.

245
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,614
But I only met him once at the beginning.

246
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,986
I haven't been in touch
with him since I quit.

247
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,022
Can you find this Egoshi?

248
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,060
Huh?

249
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,296
I can't do that.

250
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,299
I've been arrested, you know.

251
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,044
Very well.

252
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,048
From here on,

253
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,019
think very carefully before you answer.

254
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,767
Mr. Hiyama.

255
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,571
Did you…

256
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,841
commit murder?

257
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,514
I'll ask again.

258
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,785
Did you…

259
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,854
commit murder?

260
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,703
Mr. Akizumi secured
your acquittal as he promised.

261
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,705
Is that why you're doing as he says?

262
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,606
No.

263
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,210
Once I locate the video…

264
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,213
I intend to turn myself in.

265
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,384
I've taken a life,

266
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,321
and I can never make amends for that.

267
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,091
But…

268
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,927
If I don't take action…

269
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,097
Mr. Shimizu might die any day.

270
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,466
Despite what I've done…

271
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,669
if I can still help someone,

272
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,238
I want to do what I can.

273
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,453
So, they both know everything too?

274
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,656
Yes.

275
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,993
It all began with Hiyama.

276
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,996
You found a lead
to secure a retrial for Mr. Shimizu.

277
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,631
So, you started taking action.

278
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,969
You exposed the corruption
of those connected to the incident,

279
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,837
like Judge Seko and my father.

280
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,941
To make them admit that they…

281
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,111
took part in falsely accusing Mr. Shimizu.

282
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,382
I'll assist as well.

283
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,383
And I'll…

284
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,119
also do everything I can.

285
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,755
But please promise me.

286
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,590
That after this is over…

287
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,394
you'll make Hiyama confess his crime.

288
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,532
Of course.

289
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,007
I'll…

290
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,377
entrust this to you.

291
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,517
All right.

292
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,519
So,

293
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,923
does Mr. Shimizu want a retrial?

294
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,359
Despite insisting on his innocence,

295
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,495
he was coerced into
making a false confession.

296
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,199
It's no wonder
he finds it hard to trust me.

297
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,467
What about Ms. Saya?

298
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,572
<i>I've told her the truth.</i>

299
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,241
<i>But she didn't say anything.</i>

300
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,547
I can never atone

301
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,150
for what I've done to both of them.

302
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,018
Even so…

303
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,456
I'll reunite Mr. Shimizu with Saya,

304
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,758
no matter what.

305
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,595
TSUBASA KAMOI

306
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,464
Tsubasa Kamoi, huh?

307
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,574
<i>Egoshi's contact information
was no longer in use.</i>

308
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,609
However,

309
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,145
when I reached out to the mailing list
that was used during my illegal job days,

310
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,282
<i>I managed to connect
with someone who knew Egoshi.</i>

311
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,988
<i>It seems
he's still operating in the shadows,</i>

312
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,290
and is now involved in investment fraud.

313
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,428
Our priority now
is to uncover Egoshi's true identity.

314
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,332
But would he still have
a video from 12 years ago?

315
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,902
He could use it as leverage to say,
"You're an accomplice. Don't betray me."

316
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,473
So, I'm sure he's still
holding onto the original data.

317
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,344
<i>I've set up a trap for Egoshi.</i>

318
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,715
<i>I've informed an acquaintance of his
about an easy target keen on investments.</i>

319
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,485
<i>Egoshi should take the bait.</i>

320
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,987
Mr. Kamoi?

321
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,993
Yeah.

322
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,797
Give me your ID.

323
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,667
This better be a safe investment.

324
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,101
No worries.

325
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,737
I won't misuse it.

326
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,107
Let me jump right into the job details.

327
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,243
Do you know about equity investment?

328
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
Yeah.

329
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,780
I'm familiar with it.

330
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,782
Put simply…

331
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,653
That's Egoshi. I'm certain of it.

332
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,628
No worries.

333
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,597
Follow my instructions,
and I'll make things go well for you.

334
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,166
Right.

335
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,067
Bye then.

336
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,836
No worries.

337
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,237
Right.

338
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,972
I'll begin following him.

339
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,275
This investigation will take a few days.

340
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,016
Huh? What's the matter?

341
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,318
Are you hungry?

342
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,187
What's wrong?

343
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,391
Were you informed
about Mr. Shimizu's case from the start?

344
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,927
Well, I knew the basic details.

345
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:45,263
It's what motivated Mr. Akizumi
to become an attorney, after all.

346
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,767
Ms. Shiraki, what made you
join this office?

347
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,441
I think Mr. Akizumi
has forgotten the reason too.

348
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,288
Ms. Saya, right?

349
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,625
Come in.

350
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,327
Mr. Akizumi will be here soon.

351
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,967
After that…

352
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,137
I gave it a lot of thought.

353
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,443
To the point of driving myself crazy.

354
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,351
Why did you remain silent for so long?

355
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,088
You came to visit Cocoa.

356
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,993
You cared for her until she passed away.

357
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,028
Whenever I faced difficulties…

358
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,799
you were always there for me.

359
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,004
Were you only nice to me…

360
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,275
because…

361
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,645
you felt guilty?

362
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,120
I see.

363
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,690
You're right, Saya.

364
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,229
This guilt will never fade away.

365
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,833
I was kind to you…

366
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,339
because of the guilt I had in my heart.

367
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,679
But…

368
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,723
If there's anything I can do for you…

369
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,228
I want to do it.

370
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,300
Honestly…

371
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,471
I don't know how to feel about you.

372
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,976
But…

373
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,786
You're sure you can get
an acquittal for him, right?

374
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,726
I'm sure.

375
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,832
Let me see Dad.

376
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,110
You should honestly ask him
what you want to know.

377
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,112
Yeah.

378
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,278
Saya.

379
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,597
Please sit.

380
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,804
Ms. Saya…

381
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,474
has a question for you.

382
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,250
You've grown.

383
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,224
Dad…

384
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,596
You didn't…

385
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,001
kill anyone?

386
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,036
I didn't.

387
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,275
I…

388
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,513
never killed anyone.

389
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,319
I did something wrong.

390
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,089
I wrongly…

391
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,093
stole company funds.

392
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,369
It's shameful that
such a bad person is your father.

393
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,974
I thought…

394
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,647
you'd be happier without a father like me.

395
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,686
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,056
Because of my actions,
you had a tough time.

397
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,595
You've held on so well…

398
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,532
all alone, for so long.

399
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,640
Are you serious?

400
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,647
How could you say that?

401
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,384
That's such a foolish thing to say.

402
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,557
I'll decide what brings me happiness!

403
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,930
Why did you leave me?

404
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,836
I never stopped believing you.

405
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,073
Because you confessed to the crime…

406
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,814
It was more than tough for me!

407
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,084
You left…

408
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,257
And Mom and Cocoa passed away too.

409
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,227
I…

410
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,430
was all alone…

411
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,401
I was all alone all this time!

412
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,341
The truth is…

413
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,112
I didn't care if you were a criminal.

414
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,352
I just wanted to be with you!

415
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,765
Saya,

416
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,433
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,139
Mr. Akizumi promised me

418
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,441
he'd secure an acquittal for you.

419
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:13,912
It's okay.

420
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,715
I know he'll help you.

421
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,984
It's going to be okay.

422
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,090
Mr. Akizumi.

423
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,160
I…

424
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,465
I want to be with Saya and…

425
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,937
Mr. Shimizu.

426
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,907
Let me…

427
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,377
prove…

428
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,481
your innocence.

429
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,230
I uncovered Egoshi's identity
during my recent investigation.

430
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:09,167
He lives in a high-rise apartment
in Minato Ward with his wife and two sons.

431
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,769
He's employed at Windom System.

432
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:12,937
Egoshi is an alias.

433
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,040
His real name is Shuichi Goto,
a 43-year-old UTokyo graduate.

434
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,377
His public persona
could work to our advantage.

435
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,113
If we threaten to expose his illegal
business to his family or company…

436
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,715
But first…

437
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,583
Look at this.

438
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,519
That's where I live?

439
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,455
This was taken yesterday.

440
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,490
Prosecutor Kikuchi?

441
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,158
His presence there suggests…

442
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,029
They've uncovered the link
between Mr. Hiyama and Mr. Shimizu?

443
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,063
No doubt about it.

444
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,733
Have they also learned about Egoshi?

445
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,936
No, I didn't see
Prosecutor Kikuchi near Egoshi.

446
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,472
The fact that he's still
monitoring Mr. Hiyama

447
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,807
implies he hasn't gotten to Egoshi yet.

448
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,744
So, Mr. Hiyama and Akamine,

449
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,147
I want you to keep Kikuchi's eyes on you.

450
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,690
Come in.

451
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,836
<i>A visitor?</i>

452
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,972
I don't have an appointment.

453
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,473
<i>He's an attorney.</i>

454
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,875
An attorney?

455
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,079
<i>He said it concerns Egoshi's investment,
and that you'd understand.</i>

456
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,348
If you're occupied,

457
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:34,118
he mentioned he'll be waiting on the sofa
at Imperial Tokyo at 8 p.m. tonight.

458
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,119
At 8 p.m…

459
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,690
Let him know I'll be there.

460
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,996
<i>He confirms he'll be present.</i>

461
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,030
<i>Thank you.</i>

462
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,728
There's no movement.

463
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,301
<i>He's here.</i>

464
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,054
Mr. Shuichi Goto.

465
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,891
Or…

466
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,027
should I call you Mr. Egoshi?

467
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,201
How do you know about the investment?

468
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,537
I'm Akizumi, an attorney.

469
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,808
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Keita Hiyama.

470
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,144
Keita Hiyama?

471
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,479
I'll cut to the chase.

472
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,049
I want you to hand over

473
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:16,154
every video Mr. Hiyama
filmed 12 years ago.

474
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,823
I don't quite follow.

475
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,992
I've heard everything from Mr. Hiyama.

476
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,230
That he was secretly filming videos
under your instructions.

477
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,768
Do you want to walk away?

478
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,438
What do you want?

479
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,444
I simply wish
to negotiate a deal with you.

480
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,212
That's all.

481
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,724
I'm not sure,

482
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,361
but isn't the prescriptive period
for secret filming three years?

483
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,697
I'm impressed. You're well-informed.

484
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,766
It's just knowledge. I have never--

485
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,868
Of course. I understand.

486
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,038
You have your position to consider.

487
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,774
I have no intention
of acting against you personally.

488
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,977
I just want to make a deal with you.

489
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,613
Mr. Hiyama is afraid.

490
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,016
That you might use his past crimes

491
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,487
to blackmail him.

492
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,123
That's why I'm asking you

493
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:29,594
to hand over every trace of Mr. Hiyama's
past secret filming activities.

494
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,430
If you comply,

495
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,133
we'll offer you fair compensation.

496
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,100
Huh?

497
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,035
Why would you do that?

498
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,573
In the world, there are matters
that the law cannot resolve,

499
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,376
and attorneys understand that.

500
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,914
Negotiating civil matters
is just part of the business.

501
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,583
If I possessed these videos,

502
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,052
I could make money
simply by handing them over to you.

503
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,722
And since you're resorting
to illegal methods,

504
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,258
there's no risk of you reporting me.

505
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,759
You really are a smart man.

506
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,960
You catch on quickly.

507
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,965
I believe this deal offers
no downsides for you.

508
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,875
And if I decline?

509
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,012
You'll simply be ruined.

510
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,319
Not bad.

511
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,691
And yet…

512
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,262
In business, speed is everything.

513
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,767
I had a visitor before you,

514
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,536
and I no longer possess that video.

515
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,837
Excuse me.

516
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,141
Yes.

517
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,877
Unfortunately,
he didn't resort to intimidation.

518
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,412
What should I do?

519
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,136
Thank you for your cooperation.

520
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,137
Sure.

521
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:25,876
They anticipated that you'd resort
to intimidation to obtain the video, but…

522
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,479
Shall we go?

523
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,147
Huh? Are we finished already?

524
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,517
If he didn't use intimidation,
we can't have him arrested here.

525
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,087
Thank you, everyone.

526
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,595
Too bad.

527
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,164
I was hoping to see something fun.

528
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,747
I see.

529
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:07,752
Well, of course, he isn't that foolish.

530
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,653
Good job.

531
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,493
So, where were we?

532
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,829
I've brought the public trial records
from last week's rulings.

533
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,532
Could you give them your approval?

534
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,001
Do it for me, would you?

535
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,304
What are you looking at?

536
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,205
Me?

537
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,676
Just some footage seized
in connection to a case long ago.

538
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,589
Secret filming, how unforgivable!

539
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,294
There are many people in the world
who engage in such acts.

540
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,633
No matter how many you arrest,

541
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,203
they still pop up like maggots.

542
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,539
FORMATTING

543
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,575
FORMAT COMPLETE

544
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,446
However…

545
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,315
Heaven…

546
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,887
sides with the righteous.

547
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,324
How about getting something sweet to eat?

548
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,928
<i>Just as we feared,
Chief Prosecutor Datehara</i>

549
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,798
located Egoshi before we could.

550
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,934
Perhaps he acquired the video footage

551
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,771
in exchange for overlooking
Egoshi's previous offenses.

552
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,007
<i>He's here.</i>

553
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,576
The attorney you mentioned.

554
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,611
Yes.

555
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,147
Imperial Tokyo lounge at 8 p.m.

556
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,215
<i>Very well.</i>

557
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,018
<i>I'll dispatch
plain-clothed officers right away,</i>

558
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:21,952
<i>and you as well.</i>

559
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,256
<i>We were acting to divert
Kikuchi's focus from Egoshi.</i>

560
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,393
But in reality,
Datehara was playing us like fiddles.

561
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,329
The video has likely been erased.

562
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,733
We're up against the Chief Prosecutor,
who holds information on criminals.

563
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,369
While digging into
Mr. Shimizu and Mr. Hiyama,

564
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,670
he must have learned that--

565
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,207
Huh? What's the matter, Mill?

566
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,893
You keep this place quite tidy.

567
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,097
Sorry about the sudden visit.

568
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:12,670
I just realized
I hadn't given any gift to celebrate

569
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,941
when my former subordinate
opened his law office.

570
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,776
So, I decided to drop by.

571
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,611
Here you go.

572
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,584
Why, thank you.

573
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,958
By the way,

574
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:38,729
I heard you were pursuing a criminal
who was secretly filming.

575
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,502
Why bother with something
that won't even profit you?

576
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,905
You ask, but are you really interested?

577
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,574
Good question.

578
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:56,013
But you should be cautious
about whom you choose to defend.

579
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,952
Otherwise, your office might shut down.

580
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:10,394
It must be challenging
for the rest of you to follow this man.

581
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,295
How about…

582
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,498
switching to the prosecution?

583
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:20,170
You'll sweat for the country
and its people and be thanked for it.

584
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,241
Your lives would be stable, so you
wouldn't have to worry about the future.

585
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,977
It's a good job.

586
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,214
You're quite bold
in your recruitment efforts.

587
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,051
But I have no intention
of handing them over.

588
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,586
I ask you to leave.

589
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,856
I understand.

590
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,958
I'm busy too.

591
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,961
Well then, excuse me,

592
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,696
Attorney Akizumi.

593
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:54,305
I hope this won't be the last time
I address you as such,

594
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,675
Attorney Akizumi.

595
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,552
He had a talent for being a prosecutor.

596
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:48,025
He was a man who would do everything
within his power

597
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,930
to secure the correct verdict,
unafraid of making mistakes.

598
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:09,179
<i>Akizumi was somewhat similar to me.</i>

599
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,551
That's why I can guess what he's thinking

600
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,655
as if reading a book.

601
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:27,164
He isn't cut out
to be an attorney of justice.

602
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,002
Now,

603
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,505
the retrial for Mr. Shimizu will…

604
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,078
You'll get to see him soon too, Mame.

605
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:20,117
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

606
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,187
You have every right
to experience more happiness!

607
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,123
Let's put an end to this for their sake.

608
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,525
How dare you. She's my daughter!

609
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,928
I'm alive right now.

610
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,663
Momose must have known.

611
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,832
You'll be brought down soon too.

612
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,067
Give me a little more time.

613
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,202
Don't mess with me!

614
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,337
We bear the same cross.

615
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,741
Akizumi, save Mr. Shimizu.
