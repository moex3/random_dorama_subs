1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,906
As you all know,

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,808
when it comes to criminal cases,

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:13,380
Japan is often considered to be
behind other countries.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,449
For instance, in many countries,

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,486
the suspect has the right

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,523
to have an attorney present
during questioning.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,558
This is not the case in Japan.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,762
If the suspect denies the crime,
their detention is extended.

9
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,265
If they admit to the crime,
they are granted bail.

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:36,903
Some refer to this system
as "hostage justice," and criticize it.

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,940
It sounds as if
the suspect is held hostage

12
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,878
and coerced into confessing.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,181
Absurd!

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,586
Also, it is most regrettable

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,222
that due to the unlawful actions
of one prosecutor,

16
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,559
trust in the prosecution
has been significantly shaken.

17
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,995
This is truly disappointing.

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,531
My sincere apologies.

19
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,101
My sincere apologies.

20
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,571
Now, what will we do?

21
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,443
Here today, I want to strongly declare

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:23,016
that we should not be cowed
and that we should remain confident!

23
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,885
We, the prosecution, obey the law,

24
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,322
are faithful to our duties,
and do what must be done.

25
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,390
In the first place,

26
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:36,262
<i>the people want
guilty individuals to be punished.</i>

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,834
<i>We have taken their will seriously</i>

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,269
<i>and have been seeking the truth.</i>

29
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,140
<i>That is precisely how we've maintained</i>

30
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:53,046
a conviction rate of 99.9%,
a rarity even globally!

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,016
Now is the time to restore
the authority of the prosecution…

32
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,421
and show the world

33
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:06,993
that we, the prosecution,
represent justice!

34
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,146
I'm truly sorry!

35
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,615
But I won't let it end here.

36
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,584
We're working on finding a way

37
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,586
to get a retrial as soon as--

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,787
Thank you.

39
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,927
I don't blame my situation on you.

40
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,397
My dabbling in embezzlement

41
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,267
and my false confession…

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,470
They were all due to my own weakness.

43
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,608
There's no reason for you to apologize.

44
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:02,148
You're the one who sacrificed
so much of your life for me and Saya.

45
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,452
It must've felt so long.

46
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,756
Thanks to you…

47
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,593
I was able to see Saya again.

48
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,164
Even yesterday, she showed me a picture.

49
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,635
Here are Mill and Mame.

50
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,170
Don't they look just like Cocoa?

51
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,173
I can't wait to show them to you.

52
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,482
My hands…

53
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,752
are warm.

54
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm…

55
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,893
alive right now.

56
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,597
I was able to feel that again.

57
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,170
And that’s truly enough for me.

58
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,705
Mr. Shimizu!

59
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,140
You have every right…

60
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,577
to experience more happiness!

61
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,083
I promised to secure an acquittal for you.

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,552
Please give me

63
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,120
just a little more…

64
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,459
a little more time.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,700
ITOI FAMILY MURDERS CASE
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

66
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,905
Mr. Akizumi isn't coming out today either.

67
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,774
It seems he isn't even going home.

68
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,177
He's reviewing the case files
he has already reviewed many times.

69
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,880
By the way, did you meet
the reporter acquainted with Ms. Sawahara?

70
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,716
I learned a lot about
the circumstances from 12 years ago,

71
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,985
but nothing decisive
that would lead to a retrial.

72
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,553
I shouldn't be surprised.

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,989
Finding new evidence isn't so easy.

74
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,159
After all, it took five years
to find that alibi footage.

75
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,494
I'm back.

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,395
Hey.

77
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,729
How did it go with your dad?

78
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,331
He refused to see me.

79
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,932
But I'll keep going

80
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,201
until he agrees
to testify about the footage.

81
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,336
Please do.

82
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,538
We don't have
any other options at the moment.

83
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,210
What's the matter, youngster?

84
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,613
How about we sort things out once?

85
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,323
<i>On March 5th, 2012,
at Mr. Makoto Itoi's home</i>

86
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,926
<i>in Hanamigawa Ward,
Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture,</i>

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,796
<i>his whole family was found dead.</i>

88
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,899
<i>The night before,
the family had consulted a doctor,</i>

89
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,035
<i>citing symptoms
such as vomiting and diarrhea.</i>

90
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,571
<i>But they passed away before dawn.</i>

91
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,740
<i>After the on-site investigation,</i>

92
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,142
<i>a high concentration
of thallium was detected,</i>

93
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,211
<i>leading to the conclusion of poisoning.</i>

94
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,947
<i>According to neighbors,</i>

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,416
<i>around 7:30 p.m. on the night
before their deaths,</i>

96
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,686
<i>the Itoi family hosted
a dinner party with a guest.</i>

97
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,655
<i>The police investigated</i>

98
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,292
<i>under the assumption
that this guest brought in the poison.</i>

99
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:07,333
<i>No hair, sebum, skin, or any other trace
of the culprit was found at the scene.</i>

100
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,837
<i>Everyone related to Mr. Itoi
was thoroughly investigated,</i>

101
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:16,342
<i>resulting in the arrest of Mr. Shimizu,
who was close to the family.</i>

102
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,010
However, on the night in question,

103
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,547
Mr. Shimizu was actually searching
for Saya's stuffed animal in Hishimi Park.

104
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,116
According to Ms. Momose's file,

105
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:27,320
<i>Mr. Shimizu was seen on covert footage
captured by Mr. Hiyama at 7:41 p.m.</i>

106
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,994
On the other hand, the suspected culprit
visited the Itoi home around 7:30 p.m.

107
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,995
Given the distance,

108
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,365
it was impossible for Mr. Shimizu
to be at Mr. Itoi's home at that time.

109
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,836
However, no one was aware of the existence
of the footage at that point.

110
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,740
And only Saya knew
that Mr. Shimizu had gone to a park.

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,875
The police believed

112
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,111
Mr. Shimizu had coached
his 5-year-old daughter to say things.

113
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,814
Additionally, evidence
of his embezzlement of company funds

114
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,216
and his conflicts
with Mr. Itoi were uncovered,

115
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,218
further intensifying
suspicion against him.

116
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,556
I suggest you all go through this as well.

117
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,594
ITOI FAMILY MURDERS CASE

118
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,798
I wonder what Ms. Momose was like.

119
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,399
She was quite accomplished.

120
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,001
What?

121
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,669
Mr. Aoyama, you knew her too?

122
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,538
She was my junior at university.

123
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,340
I also aspired to become an attorney
back then, you know.

124
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,510
Is that when you got acquainted
with Mr. Akizumi, then?

125
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,545
Yes.

126
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,181
I tried the bar exam
four times, but failed.

127
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,051
Despite how he may seem,
he can get extremely nervous.

128
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,055
When my wife became pregnant,
I gave up and took a job as a salesperson.

129
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,758
But I reconnected
with Mr. Akizumi five years ago.

130
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,464
That's when I learned
about Ms. Momose's passing.

131
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,867
When I see your notebooks, Mr. Akamine,

132
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,702
they remind me of Ms. Momose.

133
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,271
She used to take notes just like you.

134
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,759
Quite a while ago,

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,397
I handed things I thought might be related
to the incident over to Mr. Akizumi.

136
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,900
But as I was organizing,
I found some more.

137
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,002
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,538
Come in.

139
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,210
She was investigating Mr. Shimizu's case…

140
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,680
the entire time she was in the hospital.

141
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:40,486
She questioned the doctors about poisons
and gave them a hard time.

142
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:42,922
Go ahead.

143
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,343
This is the diary Reiko kept
until she passed away.

144
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,012
I couldn't…

145
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,716
I'm already grateful that Mr. Akizumi
is carrying on Reiko's wish.

146
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,989
And now, with another ally like you…

147
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,692
she must be pleased.

148
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,365
Since she was insistent…

149
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,603
I'm sure Mr. Shimizu is innocent.

150
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,372
Please help save Mr. Shimizu.

151
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,514
<i>I'm back.</i>

152
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,715
Welcome back.

153
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,884
Are those Ms. Momose's?

154
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,288
Look at all these labels!

155
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,357
I thought her notes might contain clues.

156
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,392
Was her mother well?

157
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,594
Yes.

158
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,629
Here.

159
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,532
It's Ms. Momose's diary.

160
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,418
<i>April 1st.</i>

161
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,355
<i>I've been assigned
to work under the Mr. Datehara!</i>

162
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,193
<i>He's the prosecutor
everyone in prosecution looks up to.</i>

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,628
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

164
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,764
<i>June 10th.</i>

165
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,334
<i>I heard something troubling
about Mr. Datehara.</i>

166
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,172
<i>In the Itoi family murders case in Chiba,</i>

167
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,709
<i>he supposedly suppressed evidence
that could have proven Shimizu's alibi.</i>

168
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,112
Here's the report
on the theft case in Shinjuku.

169
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,613
<i>Because of that incident…</i>

170
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,514
Good work.

171
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>Mr. Datehara was promoted
to Deputy Chief Prosecutor.</i>

172
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,120
Is something wrong?

173
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,955
Nothing.

174
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,189
Excuse me.

175
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,258
<i>It's difficult to believe.</i>

176
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,493
<i>But…</i>

177
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,495
<i>if true, it's terrible.</i>

178
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,932
<i>June 21st.</i>

179
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,135
<i>I discussed this with a colleague.</i>

180
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,639
<i>I heard that Akizumi was brought in
to assist back then.</i>

181
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,275
After some digging,
things really are strange.

182
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,246
Shimizu readily confessed
to the embezzlement charges,

183
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,648
but he consistently denied the murders.

184
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,618
Even his detention period…

185
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,020
totaled 65 days.

186
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,090
It was extended
for fabricated reasons, wasn't it?

187
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,627
I'm starting to think he might have been
coerced into confessing.

188
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,496
Akizumi, do you know anything--

189
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,397
Any evidence?

190
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,601
Evidence that Mr. Datehara covered it up.

191
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:43,936
I don't--

192
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,472
If it's just rumors,
it's not worth verifying.

193
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,974
As a prosecutor,
you should have better things to do.

194
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,644
We already have
enough criminals to deal with.

195
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,781
<i>I later learned</i>

196
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,785
<i>that it was Akizumi
who coerced Mr. Shimizu into confessing.</i>

197
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,956
<i>It was a mistake to seek his advice.</i>

198
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,494
<i>September 6th.</i>

199
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,162
<i>I met Detective Fukazawa.</i>

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>It seems that rumors about Mr. Datehara
were started because of what he let slip.</i>

201
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,203
A woman came to us
because she was harassed

202
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,939
by someone who sent her
a secretly taken video.

203
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,708
When she showed it to me…

204
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,011
-You saw Mr. Shimizu in it.
-Yes.

205
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,015
<i>He admitted that the video really existed.</i>

206
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,786
So, I reported it to Mr. Kurata, who was
the chief of investigations on this case.

207
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,387
What did Mr. Kurata say?

208
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,791
He said he wanted to examine it carefully
and asked me to hand it over.

209
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,025
So, I did.

210
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,297
Later, I was informed that the man
in the video wasn't Shimizu.

211
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,066
But looking back…

212
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,769
Could you testify to this?

213
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,937
No, of course not.

214
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,406
And keep what I've just told you
to yourself as well.

215
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,574
If you'll excuse me.

216
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,742
Mr. Fukazawa!

217
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,147
<i>Mr. Shimizu was definitely
wrongly accused.</i>

218
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,315
<i>This is a big step forward.</i>

219
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,220
-Could you please ask him again?
<i>-October 26th.</i>

220
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,990
<i>Mr. Shimizu still refuses to meet with me.</i>

221
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,760
<i>I hope he reads my letter.</i>

222
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>March 12th.</i>

223
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,033
<i>I learned that Mr. Shimizu's daughter
has been frequenting this dog shelter.</i>

224
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,102
You're Saya, right?

225
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,870
<i>Saya Makino.</i>

226
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,641
<i>I hope to gradually grow closer to her.</i>

227
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,010
<i>May 8th.</i>

228
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:35,047
<i>Cocoa, Saya's dog,
finally warmed up to me!</i>

229
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,786
<i>Saya is starting to smile more around me.</i>

230
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,022
Get ready, everyone!

231
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,290
Ms. Momose, hurry!

232
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,591
Right.

233
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,364
Oh, it worked.

234
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,334
<i>October 2nd.</i>

235
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,803
<i>I was transferred
to the Utsunomiya office.</i>

236
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,407
<i>It's uncommon for transfers
to occur at this time of year.</i>

237
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,779
<i>Perhaps this is evidence
that I'm getting closer to the truth.</i>

238
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,683
<i>March 27th.</i>

239
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,985
<i>I'm swamped with work.</i>

240
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,156
<i>I wish I could go to Chiba
on the weekend at least</i>

241
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,124
<i>to continue investigating the case.</i>

242
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,497
<i>I don't feel very well.</i>

243
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,033
<i>It might be fatigue.</i>

244
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,338
<i>April 7th.</i>

245
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,873
<i>I was diagnosed with an illness.</i>

246
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,308
<i>I feel helpless.</i>

247
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,112
<i>I don't have time to be hospitalized.</i>

248
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,391
<i>September 16th.</i>

249
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,526
<i>Hospitalized again.</i>

250
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,830
<i>Time is running out.</i>

251
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,766
<i>I called Akizumi.</i>

252
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,005
This…

253
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,340
is for you, Akizumi.

254
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,049
ITOI FAMILY MURDERS CASE

255
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,587
You were still investigating it?

256
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,322
Yeah.

257
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,394
You're already busy,

258
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,430
yet you traveled
between Tochigi and Chiba.

259
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,000
And you neglected your regular checkups.

260
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,338
You want to say I was foolish, right?

261
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,374
Well, you're right.

262
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,645
Now, look what's happened to me.

263
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,255
Mr. Shimizu was definitely
falsely accused.

264
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,559
If you read the file, you'll see.

265
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,163
Akizumi…

266
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,635
You bear responsibility
for coercing Mr. Shimizu into confessing.

267
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,039
Just once…

268
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,810
please review the file.

269
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,716
<i>To Akizumi.</i>

270
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,964
<i>Save Mr. Shimizu.</i>

271
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,301
<i>Now that I'm in this condition,
I understand.</i>

272
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,905
<i>Life is limited</i>

273
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,740
<i>and precious.</i>

274
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,209
<i>I wish…</i>

275
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,514
<i>I could have lived longer.</i>

276
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:32,985
<i>But…</i>

277
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,588
<i>there's a life that can still be saved.</i>

278
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,758
<i>I wish that no one's life</i>

279
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,963
<i>is taken away due to false accusations.</i>

280
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,500
<i>Their lives should never be taken</i>

281
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,971
<i>because of the arrogance
of the justice authorities.</i>

282
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,808
<i>I strongly believe this…</i>

283
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,645
<i>as one prosecutor.</i>

284
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,914
<i>It is…</i>

285
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,316
<i>my sincere hope…</i>

286
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:11,190
<i>that we can restore trust and pride
in the justice system.</i>

287
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,247
<i>I wanted to see this future</i>

288
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,052
<i>with my own eyes too.</i>

289
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,891
<i>Alongside Akizumi.</i>

290
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,042
Me too…

291
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,582
Momose.

292
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,858
Here.

293
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,493
It's from Ms. Momose's mother.

294
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,906
I've gone through it all,

295
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,409
but I didn't find any clues
beyond what was already in the file.

296
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,477
I see.

297
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,685
I'm sure Momose
must be grateful for your efforts.

298
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,320
Right.

299
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,431
"Similar?"

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,369
It must've fallen out of one of the books.

301
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:19,184
SIMILAR?

302
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,026
Aren't you going in?

303
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,200
Well, even if you did, you'd probably
only be met with cold stares.

304
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,635
Right now, anyway.

305
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,940
I heard you're staying silent
during your impeachment trial.

306
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,613
I think you'd feel better
if you opened up…

307
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,718
about Datehara being the one
who led you down the path of corruption.

308
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,956
Spoken like a former prosecutor.

309
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,125
Are you planning to interrogate me?

310
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,727
No, I'm not.

311
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,162
I've come to make a request.

312
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,067
Won't you reveal everything at the trial?

313
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,438
When you delivered that verdict,

314
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,907
you didn't know anything.

315
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,911
You trusted the evidence
presented by the prosecution.

316
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,913
And after careful consideration,

317
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,584
you decided that Mr. Shimizu
deserved the death sentence.

318
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,691
You only learned about the possibility
of him being falsely accused

319
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,493
when Prosecutor Momose visited you.

320
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,161
What do you mean?

321
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:40,165
There was a video that proved
Mr. Yusaku Shimizu's alibi.

322
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,869
But Prosecutor Datehara covered it up.

323
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,304
Impossible.

324
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,738
Mr. Shimizu…

325
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,641
is innocent.

326
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,312
<i>You were clearly shaken.</i>

327
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,048
<i>That's what was noted in Momose's records.</i>

328
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,618
You realized your error

329
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,354
and have been regretting it
ever since, right?

330
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,759
That's why you've been donating
and volunteering at the children's home

331
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,861
where Saya Shimizu lives.

332
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,764
To at least do something to make amends.

333
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,070
But that's like putting a bandage
on a fatal wound.

334
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,440
If you continue to ignore this wound,

335
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,142
it can cost a life.

336
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,446
Before it's too late,

337
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,315
won't you speak out?

338
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,718
It's useless.

339
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,520
I don't know anything.

340
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,292
Datehara…

341
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,597
He never tolerates anyone
who strays from his rules.

342
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,503
You'll be crushed soon too.

343
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,004
I don't care.

344
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,810
When you have nothing to lose,
you can do anything.

345
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,813
Am I wrong,

346
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,281
Judge Seko?

347
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,768
I'm home.

348
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,668
Hey.

349
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,803
Seriously, Yuna!

350
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,204
Welcome back.

351
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,573
What happened?

352
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,811
She said she'd study, but she was
secretly watching videos again.

353
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,712
What?

354
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,013
What's the big deal?

355
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,616
I was among the top
in the mock exams the other day.

356
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,917
Yuna.

357
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,585
I know you're working hard.

358
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,320
But…

359
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,590
it's not okay to break the rules.

360
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,861
People who break the rules get punished.

361
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,167
And it's your father's job
to administer these punishments.

362
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,135
Forget it.

363
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,403
Yuna…

364
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,308
Do I need to punish you too?

365
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,610
Fine. I'm sorry.

366
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:08,980
Good girl.

367
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,684
<i>Check these out.</i>

368
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,486
Here are the weeklies issued today.

369
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,787
What the…

370
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,323
Datehara is manipulating
information through the media.

371
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,327
"Attorney Akizumi has successfully
secured many acquittals for the accused."

372
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,728
"But he has been unmasked."

373
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,833
"In defending Mr. Keita Hiyama,
who faces a second instance for murder,

374
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,401
it is whispered that Akizumi

375
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,603
unlawfully covered up evidence
and suppressed the crime."

376
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,905
This one mentions Mr. Shimizu's case.

377
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,442
"Regarding his claims that
Shimizu was falsely accused,

378
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,910
they lack sufficient evidence."

379
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,147
"Attorney Akizumi has been
in contact with Shimizu's daughter."

380
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,852
"It appears his claims
may be driven by personal emotions."

381
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,721
How awful to mention Saya as well.

382
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,558
Do they think they can ruin people's lives
just to boost sales?

383
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,628
The media might also go to Mr. Hiyama.

384
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,796
Akamine.

385
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,730
On it.

386
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,234
What about the jacket?

387
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,368
It's kept in the office.

388
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,203
Don't worry about it.

389
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,104
Go ahead.

390
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
<i>Dad…</i>

391
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,241
He is going to be okay, right?

392
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,576
Yes.

393
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,478
<i>Then I'm fine.</i>

394
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,447
<i>I'll trust you and wait.</i>

395
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,152
<i>We have the media's attention right now.</i>

396
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,990
So, if Akizumi comes here,
it could cause issues for Ms. Saya.

397
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,093
Thank you so much…

398
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,562
for everything.

399
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,265
And for pushing for the retrial.

400
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,301
Thank you for doing your best
despite the lost footage.

401
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,936
Right now,

402
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:43,108
we're all desperately searching
for evidence that can secure your retrial.

403
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,079
But truthfully, it's not that easy…

404
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,984
So, I've come today to ask you something.

405
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,254
Could you please recount

406
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,491
what happened back then
once more, in detail?

407
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,429
I understand it may be painful
for you to remember.

408
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,431
But…

409
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,000
any trivial information will help.

410
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:10,936
Please.

411
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,473
Actually…

412
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,781
Please handle this.

413
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,449
All right.

414
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,347
How did it go?

415
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,048
No luck again today.

416
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,617
I see.

417
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:01,987
What's that?

418
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,256
Mr. Shimizu lent it to me.

419
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,059
It contains his notes from back then.

420
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,296
Did you find any clues?

421
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,265
No.

422
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,934
It's just that…

423
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,638
going through it is quite painful.

424
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,109
May I?

425
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,112
Sure.

426
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,160
<i>Five days since my arrest.</i>

427
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,528
You did it, didn't you?

428
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,230
<i>I was interrogated about my alibi.</i>

429
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,231
Please let me go.

430
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,332
<i>Despite my denials,</i>

431
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,534
<i>they detained me for 10 hours.</i>

432
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,671
<i>Ten days since my arrest.</i>

433
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,607
<i>I was interrogated
about the circumstances of the crime.</i>

434
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,209
<i>The interrogation went on for 11 hours.</i>

435
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,112
<i>No food or drink provided.</i>

436
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,047
Your daughter is still--

437
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,548
As I said, I was--

438
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,316
Vomiting, diarrhea,

439
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,552
ptosis, and flaccid paralysis.

440
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,889
These symptoms were already showing
when you left, right?

441
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,024
Did you enjoy seeing them?

442
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,993
How could I enjoy…

443
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,028
such a cruel sight?!

444
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,998
I have a daughter too!

445
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,299
Haven't you had enough?

446
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,734
Let me out of here!

447
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,002
Let me see Saya!

448
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,370
Please!

449
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,372
Please let me out!

450
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,473
Please!

451
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,809
<i>Twenty-five days since my arrest.</i>

452
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,244
<i>I was interrogated
about the circumstances of the crime.</i>

453
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,613
<i>The interrogation went on for 11 hours.</i>

454
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,450
<i>No food or drink provided.</i>

455
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,384
Listen.

456
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,453
We'll write down that you confessed.

457
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,426
No.

458
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,630
<i>I've lost even the will to respond.</i>

459
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:57,302
<i>What can I possibly say
to someone who won't listen?</i>

460
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,408
<i>Fifty-two days since my arrest.</i>

461
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,277
How do you think your daughter
will continue living?

462
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,815
"The daughter of a murderer."

463
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,452
She'll have no choice
but to live hiding that fact.

464
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,490
<i>Is Saya the daughter of a murderer?</i>

465
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,858
You've embezzled funds

466
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,025
and killed people.

467
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,796
And you continue to lie.

468
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,399
I wonder what your daughter
will think of such a father.

469
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,902
<i>I want to see Saya.</i>

470
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,840
I heard about your wife.

471
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,309
It was a traffic accident.

472
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,812
Your daughter…

473
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,249
has been taken in by a children's home.

474
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,122
<i>I want to see Saya.</i>

475
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,494
<i>I want to see Saya.</i>

476
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,397
<i>I want to see her.</i>

477
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,266
I WANT TO SEE SAYA

478
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,902
It leaves you…

479
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,471
speechless.

480
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,310
Mr. Akizumi has been carrying
the regret all this time.

481
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,754
Is something the matter?

482
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,791
The detective mentioned
ptosis and flaccid paralysis.

483
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,226
What about it?

484
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,029
I'm currently handling
a mass food poisoning case

485
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,464
and researching various poisons.

486
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,234
I don't think thallium could cause such…

487
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,571
Just as I thought!

488
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,907
Vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea,
and other digestive symptoms.

489
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,876
Additionally, neurological symptoms

490
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:49,948
such as somnolence, coma, convulsions,
blindness, and facial nerve paralysis.

491
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,253
Nowhere does it mention ptosis…

492
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,455
and flaccid paralysis.

493
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,058
Those terms are absent
from the prosecution's report too.

494
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,560
What could this mean?

495
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,562
Either the detective made a mistake or…

496
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,332
Mr. Shimizu remembered it incorrectly.

497
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:08,800
Or…

498
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:10,835
Maybe…

499
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,875
Every discovery
and invention in the world…

500
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,978
Every discovery
and invention in the world…

501
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,615
…are built on speculation and theories.

502
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,091
According to the prosecution's report,

503
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,561
the drug and poison test was carried out
at the Chiba Police crime lab.

504
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,232
The test results indicated
that the poison used was thallium.

505
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,870
Mr. Shimizu could have obtained this
from the company's warehouse.

506
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,538
What about it?

507
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:51,342
The detective who questioned Mr. Shimizu
on the 10th day of his arrest stated this.

508
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,013
"The Itoi family showed

509
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,751
symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea,
ptosis, and flaccid paralysis."

510
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:05,390
However, thallium does not cause symptoms
such as ptosis and flaccid paralysis.

511
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,126
By the time of the interrogation,

512
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,562
the results indicating thallium poisoning
should have been available.

513
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,865
So, why did the detective
mention these symptoms?

514
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,935
It's possible it was just a mistake.

515
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,738
But terms like
ptosis and flaccid paralysis

516
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,809
are not commonly used unless referenced
from specific documents.

517
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,879
What if this wasn't merely a mistake?

518
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,582
Perhaps someone intentionally altered
the poison test results.

519
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,117
Yes.

520
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,954
Testing poisons is complex
and identifying them takes time.

521
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,524
Thallium sulfate,
easily accessible to Mr. Shimizu,

522
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,960
would've been
compelling material for his indictment.

523
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,630
Mr. Akizumi, you were called in
from the Saitama office

524
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,999
during the final period
of Mr. Shimizu's detention.

525
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,234
By then, the results
had already been altered,

526
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,170
leaving you no room for doubt.

527
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,239
This is just the story we--

528
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,109
If I were to add to your story,
it would go like this.

529
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,446
Datehara was feeling frustrated.

530
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,148
Despite having Mr. Shimizu in detention,

531
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,451
<i>there wasn't
enough evidence to indict him.</i>

532
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>…such a cruel sight?!</i>

533
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:12,390
At this rate, he risked losing Shimizu
due to insufficient evidence.

534
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,491
<i>Let me see Saya!</i>

535
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,460
<i>This would set him back in uncovering </i>

536
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,596
<i>the truth about the Nishi Chiba
Construction embezzlement too.</i>

537
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,532
<i>For Datehara, this outcome
was absolutely unacceptable.</i>

538
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,704
<i>"In that case, I'll fabricate evidence
that incriminates Shimizu," he thought.</i>

539
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,940
With this in mind,

540
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,411
<i>he instructed the head of the crime lab
to alter the test results</i>

541
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:38,416
to indicate a poison that would cause
symptoms similar to the one used.

542
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,020
Similar?

543
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,790
I see.

544
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,961
SIMILAR?

545
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,998
Momose had realized.

546
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,333
I see.

547
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,869
By "similar," she meant the poison?

548
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,505
There were a few books on poison, right?

549
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,440
-Yes.
-Let's pull them all out.

550
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,943
Let's list everything that shows
symptoms of ptosis and flaccid paralysis,

551
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,512
and find one similar to thallium.

552
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,115
Poliovirus.

553
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,719
The timing for the onset
of symptoms doesn't match.

554
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,654
Enterovirus.

555
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,623
This also doesn't fit the situation.

556
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,326
Next is botulinum toxin.

557
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,195
Botulinum toxin.

558
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,432
Early symptoms include vomiting,
diarrhea, and other digestive issues.

559
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:31,202
Later symptoms include ptosis,
blurred vision, difficulty swallowing…

560
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,671
and flaccid paralysis.

561
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,039
It's similar.

562
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,808
This must be it, right?

563
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,515
This is it.

564
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,217
So Momose had realized.

565
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,623
"Doctor."

566
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,858
"Tampered"?

567
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,293
"Tampered"?

568
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,327
Perhaps this means…

569
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,831
Momose realized something
after consulting with a doctor.

570
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,900
I've heard from Ms. Momose's mother
that even while hospitalized,

571
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,571
Momose kept investigating the case
and consulted doctors about poisons.

572
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,141
She discovered the possible tampering
and intended to investigate it further.

573
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,277
Mr. Aoyama, do you know
who conducted the poison test?

574
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,080
Satoshi Hiratsuka.
He resigned and now lives in Nerima Ward.

575
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,548
I'll go talk to him right away.

576
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,749
Do so.

577
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,284
Also…

578
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,687
Ms. Shinomiya…

579
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,195
You've finally agreed to see us.

580
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,165
I've come to say something to you.

581
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,200
Stop involving my daughter!

582
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,135
Dad!

583
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,404
Unfortunately,
I have no intention of letting her go.

584
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,307
Your daughter is still valuable to me.

585
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,275
How dare you!

586
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,776
What do you take my daughter for?!

587
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:49,046
She's an exceptionally skilled
and useful subordinate.

588
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,016
She's particularly effective
at shaking you up.

589
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,621
I'm here today
because I need to ask you something.

590
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,925
It's about the Itoi family murders.

591
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,429
I won't tell you anything.

592
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,998
Is that for your daughter?

593
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,502
Datehara is quite ruthless, isn't he?

594
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,305
He's taken your daughter as hostage.

595
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,477
If you're not careful with your words,
your daughter's future could be ruined.

596
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,379
You may not care if you're arrested,

597
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,848
but you'll protect your daughter.

598
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,785
What a beautiful display of paternal love.

599
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,122
What does that mean?

600
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,361
So you've kept silent all this time…

601
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,033
for my sake?

602
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,238
Just go already.

603
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,040
Give me a break!

604
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,743
So what about my future?

605
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,914
I couldn't care less about it!

606
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,186
Mr. Shimizu was falsely accused
and has no idea when he'll be executed!

607
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:09,126
What future could possibly outweigh
someone's life?

608
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,398
And you realize, don't you?

609
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:19,403
That if Mr. Shimizu didn't do it,
the real culprit is still out there!

610
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,006
And yet…

611
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,042
you've turned a blind eye for years.

612
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,177
How can you…

613
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,281
call yourself a police officer?

614
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,255
In Mr. Shimizu's notebook…

615
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,993
the latter half is all about Saya.

616
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,929
"I want to see her."

617
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,030
I WANT TO SEE HER

618
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,999
Can you even imagine…

619
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,400
I WANT TO SEE SAYA BEFORE I DIE

620
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,303
…how Mr. Shimizu must have felt?

621
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,340
Come on.

622
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,676
Answer me, Dad!

623
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,623
I have imagined it.

624
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,625
Countless times.

625
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,229
Over and over!

626
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,800
When I saw that footage,

627
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,170
honestly, I thought
I should make it public immediately.

628
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,172
But…

629
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,608
<i>By then…</i>

630
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,611
<i>Shimizu's trial had already started.</i>

631
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,783
I'll only say this once.

632
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,086
The police…

633
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,090
never found this footage.

634
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,660
-But…
-No buts!

635
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,065
You're telling me now that he's innocent?

636
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,666
Get real!

637
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,203
Imagine making this public!

638
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,973
This won't just be
your responsibility or mine!

639
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:09,480
Resigning and abandoning our duties
is out of the question!

640
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,549
That won't absolve us in any way!

641
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,485
Shimizu's family has been torn apart,

642
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,920
and his wife has passed away.

643
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:21,559
The media will accuse us
of causing her death,

644
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,896
saying, "They deserve the same fate."
"Murderers."

645
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:31,402
The public's harsh scrutiny
will mercilessly fall on our families!

646
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,770
Even on your daughter!

647
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,241
This…

648
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,378
isn't a threat.

649
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,749
I'm going to have a child soon…

650
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,454
after waiting for so long!

651
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,361
I will bear…

652
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,565
the same cross as you.

653
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,441
<i>I feel…</i>

654
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,878
very sorry…

655
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,114
for Mr. Shimizu.

656
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,850
But now…

657
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,052
it can't…

658
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,822
be undone.

659
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,756
"You murderer!"

660
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,629
To escape that accusation…

661
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,232
you're going to let a person die,
is that it?

662
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,803
As you've said,

663
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,973
even if you regret it now,
the past can never be undone.

664
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,411
But the future is different.

665
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:52,716
You can still save Mr. Shimizu's life.

666
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,489
Tell me, Mr. Kurata.

667
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,727
The poison used
in the Itoi family murders,

668
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,597
it wasn't really thallium sulfate, was it?

669
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,369
The poison test results were altered!

670
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,273
Dad…

671
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,644
It's possible.

672
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,347
Early in the investigation,

673
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,383
there was confusion regarding the poison.

674
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,288
<i>But then, someone
from the crime lab came with a report.</i>

675
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,726
<i>He said that thallium sulfate
was detected on the table,</i>

676
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,529
<i>and the same substance
was found on the bodies.</i>

677
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,999
I understand
identifying poisons is tricky.

678
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,003
It often requires a great amount of time.

679
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:48,973
So…

680
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,142
I didn't think
it was particularly unusual.

681
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,513
Can you confirm
that the person from the crime lab…

682
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,782
was Satoshi Hiratsuka?

683
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,018
I can.

684
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:03,854
But…

685
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,496
<i>I see.</i>

686
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,430
<i>Yes.</i>

687
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,100
He passed away
three years ago due to illness.

688
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,670
Find Hiratsuka's former assistant.

689
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,805
<i>Right.</i>

690
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,654
I've made a list of people
who were Hiratsuka's assistants.

691
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,956
I think I can meet
with some of them this week.

692
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,591
Akamine…

693
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,160
thank you for your help.

694
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,197
I hope we can uncover even a small clue.

695
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:57,841
Hey!

696
00:42:58,842 --> 00:42:59,677
What's this about?

697
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,611
We're the police.

698
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,413
Is Mr. Masaki Akizumi here?

699
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,547
Why do you want him?

700
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,850
-Hey.
-Hey, hold on!

701
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,952
-Hey!
-You can't!

702
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,219
-Wait!
-Hey!

703
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:10,721
It's the police.

704
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,190
Are you Mr. Masaki Akizumi?

705
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,094
We have an arrest warrant for you

706
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,264
for covering up evidence in the murder
of Hanegi Seiko's president.

707
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,932
Come on, stand up.

708
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,901
Arrest?

709
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,703
Let's go.

710
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,074
Begin searching.

711
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,308
-Right.
-Right.

712
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,685
-Come in.
-Excuse me.

713
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,889
It appears Akizumi was arrested earlier.

714
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,258
Was he now?

715
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,794
Poor guy.

716
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,862
Do you think so?

717
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,334
I think it's only what he deserves.

718
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,172
But are you sure?

719
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,410
You were somewhat in his debt,
weren't you?

720
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,314
HIYAMA

721
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,715
Not really.

722
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:15,653
After a skilled attorney joined,
he didn't need me anymore.

723
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:23,327
Should I work on Akizumi's trial?

724
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,129
No.

725
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,431
I'll handle it.

726
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,836
For Akizumi's sake as well,

727
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:36,473
let's put an end to this.

728
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,626
Mr. Akizumi!

729
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,065
I'll leave the rest to you.

730
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,319
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

731
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:27,224
I've dreamed of seeing you
like this for a long time.

732
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,293
How could he conceal evidence of murder?

733
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,194
I killed him.

734
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,695
He must have left something.

735
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,896
I have something to say.

736
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,331
A precious life is at stake.

737
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,399
I couldn't believe her.

738
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,468
-Shimizu is a criminal!
-Objection!

739
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,969
There's something only I can do.

740
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,237
We will bear the responsibility.

741
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,440
People compete and take from each other.
That's just how the world works.

742
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,677
Together, let's go to hell.
