1
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,625
Thank you.

2
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,801
Hello.

3
00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:07,359
A MAN

4
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:14,492
<i>"Seibundo Stationery Store"</i>

5
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,644
Hello.

6
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,768
Thank you.

7
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,358
2,030 yen.

8
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,365
2,030 yen exactly.

9
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,510
Where's the breaker?

10
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,306
Those lights are on.

11
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,115
Sorry.

12
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,829
It's... Sorry, it's there.

13
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,549
Thank you.

14
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,472
Thank you.

15
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,877
'Morning.

16
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,087
'Morning.

17
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:03,721
Yuto, could you take that
lotus root in for me?

18
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,648
Mom, breakfast.

19
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,573
We're gonna eat.

20
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,873
This lotus root's good.

21
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,666
Want pickles?

22
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,720
Wait up!

23
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,889
Too slow, Yuto!

24
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,234
Yuto!

25
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,924
I've been thinking lately.

26
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,552
My husband went to Heaven before me,

27
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:30,265
so little Ryo won't get lonely there.

28
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:37,106
Masahiro was so selfless.
He always put his grandchild first.

29
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,198
I'm home!

30
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:47,991
Hey there Yuto.

31
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,493
Yuto, hey there.

32
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,705
Mrs. Okumura brought us
cakes from Taiseido.

33
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,582
Strawberry, and Mont Blanc.

34
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,042
No way!

35
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,546
In the fridge.

36
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,885
Mom.

37
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,598
You've got Yuto.
Better toughen up, Hatsue.

38
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,644
It's hardest on Rie, you know.

39
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,939
She came back from Yokohama single.

40
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,693
Thank you.

41
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,030
This is 1,785 yen, and...

42
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,200
Mister, you paint for a hobby?

43
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:38,208
One of my customers saw you,
on the grass near Kiyose River.

44
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,253
Show me sometime!

45
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,213
It's not worth it.

46
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,716
Rie, don't you wanna see?

47
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,721
Mrs. Okumura,
mind your business.

48
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,768
Hatsue, the other day...

49
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,357
Daisuke.

50
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,196
Its balance tells you
where to land it.

51
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:13,076
This tree'll fall easiest there.
Got it?

52
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,746
See its balance?

53
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,290
It's on a lean.

54
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:24,087
So, cut a notch facing
where you want it to fall.

55
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,257
Kuroki! Quit waffling already!

56
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,218
Shut your trap!

57
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,929
Telling him ain't gonna help.

58
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,305
Watch me.

59
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,477
Daisuke.

60
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,479
Try it.

61
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,151
<i>Where's that Daisuke Taniguchi from?</i>

62
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:35,450
Ikaho Onsen in Gunma. He's the
second son of an innkeeper there.

63
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,954
A grand old inn.

64
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,208
So why's a guy like him
out here working the forests?

65
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,919
Doesn't it sound fishy to you?

66
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,424
I'll admit,
it doesn't sound normal.

67
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:55,846
But nobody lives their life
without picking up a few scars.

68
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,931
Is he an ex-con?

69
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:03,437
Can't have him starting trouble.
Seems kinda like a downer.

70
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,399
He's not a downer.
He's just quiet.

71
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,027
A fast learner too.

72
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,031
Much more useful than your brother.

73
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,533
Leave Takeshi out of it.

74
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,037
Anyway, he's a good kid.

75
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,414
I like Daisuke.

76
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,152
Hello.

77
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,132
Thank you.
That'll be 200 yen.

78
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,427
Do you need a bag?

79
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,887
I'm fine.

80
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,101
1,000 yen received.

81
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,480
Need a receipt?

82
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,940
I don't.

83
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,320
Here, 800 yen change.

84
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,114
Um...

85
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,953
These are...my paintings.

86
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,124
You brought them for me?

87
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,918
They're not great though.

88
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,629
May I?

89
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,238
You obviously love painting.

90
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,992
This is great.

91
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,500
This kinda looks like Yuto.

92
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,046
My son plays there a lot.

93
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,263
Is he the boy I saw here before?

94
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,641
I-I think that might actually be him.

95
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,187
Oh, really?
I guess it must be.

96
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,023
That's kinda cool.

97
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,360
Really great...

98
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,405
If it's okay,
could we be friends?

99
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,998
Of course not.
You're married. I'm sorry.

100
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,711
Well, I'm not married.
I...

101
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,215
...have a son,
but I'm divorced.

102
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,219
Oh, is that right...

103
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,721
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

104
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,602
If you knew,
that'd be freaky.

105
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,607
Oh yes. You're right.
That would be.

106
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,276
Thank you.

107
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,321
Er, what's your name?

108
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,534
Taniguchi.

109
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,835
Sorry it's crumpled.
I'm Daisuke Taniguchi.

110
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,765
Sorry, I don't have a card.
I'm Rie Takemoto.

111
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,101
Rie.

112
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,357
Come anytime,
and show me your paintings.

113
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,156
No need to buy anything.

114
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,716
Done it before?

115
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,218
Yuto had a younger brother.

116
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,809
But he died when he was 2.

117
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,649
Mind if I tell you?

118
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,825
A brain disease.

119
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,746
I thought he'd get over it...

120
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,503
...but it turned out to be malignant.

121
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,685
Was that...the reason?

122
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,317
You broke up with your husband.

123
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,456
We disagreed over treatment.

124
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:04,381
From then on,
nothing went our way.

125
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,560
If I'd known nothing would work...

126
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,232
I would've let him eat what he wanted,

127
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:29,239
taken him to his favorite zoo,
as much as he wanted...

128
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,414
At the very least...

129
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,418
At the very least...

130
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,922
...I wanted him to
feel glad that he lived.

131
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,357
The radiation treatment
was so hard on him...

132
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,946
I'd put him through so much pain...

133
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,250
But...

134
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,548
When I realized it was for nothing...

135
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,470
I felt so...

136
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,946
Your son...
What was his name?

137
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,291
Ryo.

138
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,586
Ryo.

139
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,924
Little Ryo.

140
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,059
Little Ryo.

141
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,942
Here goes.

142
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,744
You're good.

143
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,873
Over here. Go!

144
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,544
Pass to your mom.

145
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,588
To me?

146
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,561
Run!
Run, run! Run!

147
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,024
Hurry! Hurry!

148
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,912
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay!

149
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,664
There there.

150
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,710
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

151
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,905
Finished?

152
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,242
Looks cute!

153
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,205
Did we forget anything?
All okay?

154
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,041
Can you do it?

155
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,679
Look, you got food on you.

156
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,888
Yum.

157
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,895
Eat nicely!

158
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,030
Hey, don't play with food!

159
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,789
You're late for school!

160
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,293
He is.
Go on, get moving.

161
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,590
You didn't eat this?
Want more?

162
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,924
Hey, Dad.

163
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,093
Can I go?

164
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,596
Huh? What?

165
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,931
What? Say that again.

166
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,558
To the mountains.

167
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,809
Huh? What?

168
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,894
The mountains...

169
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,270
Like hell you can.

170
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,022
Sports day training.

171
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,607
So what?

172
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,275
It's no big deal.

173
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,944
- Hana, say "No way."
- No way!

174
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,780
See? Hana said so.

175
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,656
Hana, say it again.

176
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,701
What did you say?
"No way."

177
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,952
No way!

178
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,204
You're so late.

179
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,750
Come on!
Come on, go already!

180
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,629
Take care!

181
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,718
Daisuke.

182
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,639
Oh. Sorry, sorry.

183
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:13,935
Thanks.

184
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,314
Thanks.

185
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,107
See you.

186
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,108
Bye.

187
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,609
Take care.

188
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,673
Get in.

189
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,175
What about school?

190
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,635
Come on.

191
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,070
Busy day today.
Let's do this.

192
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,411
Dad Dad Dad!
Which one?

193
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,164
- Daisuke!
- This one?

194
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:21,043
We're going further in.
You can finish up here for us.

195
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,007
Work hard, kid.

196
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,887
Yuto, what do you wanna do today?

197
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,263
Make a slingshot.

198
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,223
That again?

199
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,919
Daisuke?

200
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,754
You okay?

201
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,756
Daisuke?

202
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,052
Hey... Hey...
Daisuke?

203
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,137
Hey Daisuke!

204
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,267
Hey! Somebody!
Call the office!

205
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:04,105
Hey! Daisuke!
Daisuke! Hey!

206
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,898
Ambulance!

207
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,985
Call an ambulance!
Quickly!

208
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,737
Hey! Daisuke!

209
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,784
<i>One year later</i>

210
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,748
<i>First anniversary of Daisuke's death</i>

211
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,905
I'll leave you now.

212
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,037
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

213
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,837
My name's Taniguchi.

214
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,092
Kyoichi Taniguchi.

215
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,844
Thank you for coming so far.

216
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,056
My younger brother caused you trouble.

217
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:07,186
Not at all. I'm sorry for
not inviting you to the funeral.

218
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,357
I bet he told you not to.
I get it.

219
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,402
Well, actually...

220
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:20,074
I know we need to discuss
where he'll be interred, so...

221
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,369
Daisuke spoke badly of me,
I presume?

222
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:31,043
He didn't talk about his past,
but he said he and his family...

223
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,213
No need to say it.
I know.

224
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,887
He caused trouble for so many,
right till the end...

225
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,017
Why was living right so hard for him?

226
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:53,941
Dying under a tree in this backwater...
An undutiful son to the end.

227
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,113
Oh, incense. May I?

228
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,365
Sure, of course.

229
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,455
Hey, invoice me for
funeral and grave costs.

230
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,165
No, there's no need...

231
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,208
Count on me to pay.

232
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,610
You haven't...
put a photo of him here?

233
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,282
A photo.
Of the deceased.

234
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,450
Sorry?

235
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,579
I have, right there.

236
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,333
Where?

237
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,126
Er, there.

238
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,669
Where?

239
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,382
Excuse me.

240
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,016
That's not him.

241
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,480
That's not Daisuke.

242
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,315
Yes, it is...

243
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,775
No, it's not him.

244
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,653
- It's Daisuke.
- It's not Daisuke.

245
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
It's not Daisuke.

246
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,537
Did he change that much?

247
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:33,999
It's not that.
He's totally different.

248
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,543
I see...

249
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,378
It's a different guy.

250
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,675
It's Daisuke.

251
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,678
It's not Daisuke.

252
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:51,976
It is. From Ikaho Onsen.
The inn. Tamaki.

253
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,063
It's not Daisuke.

254
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,198
Then, this man...

255
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,078
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

256
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,212
<i>Sorry to interrupt your rest.</i>

257
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:26,719
<i>We'll be landing at Miyazaki Airport</i>
in approximately 35 minutes.

258
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,514
<i>As the captain mentioned earlier,</i>

259
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,475
<i>in roughly 15 minutes time...</i>

260
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,128
It's been seven years?

261
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:05,758
Oh, I guess you're right.
Since the divorce proceedings.

262
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,553
Thanks for all you did.

263
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,515
Your son must be big now.

264
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,769
My oldest started junior high.

265
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,395
Your oldest?

266
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:23,275
Yes, I remarried,
and had a daughter.

267
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:27,738
Oh, is that so?
How old is she?

268
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,782
She's 4.

269
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,201
Same as mine.

270
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,828
What?
Oh, you too, Mr. Kido?

271
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,122
Me too. I got married.

272
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,416
Oh, is that right...

273
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,753
You've got a daughter?

274
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,129
A son.

275
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,466
Oh, really...

276
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,184
<i>His life insurance...</i>

277
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,853
Repayment is unnecessary.

278
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,194
These forms bear the name
"Daisuke Taniguchi,"

279
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,323
but the subject
of the contract is "Mr. X."

280
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:16,203
Mr. X kept up with his premiums,
so you can keep the money.

281
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,288
Thank you.

282
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,625
No, it's your undeniable right.

283
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:26,880
More pressingly, Mr. Taniguchi's death
needs to be retracted.

284
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:31,176
The deceased is Mr. X,
not Daisuke Taniguchi.

285
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:38,726
Then, what about
the real Daisuke Taniguchi?

286
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,561
What happens to him?

287
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:45,149
Well, he'll be regarded as alive.

288
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,609
We need to find the truth.

289
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,820
Thank you for waiting.

290
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,780
Eel on rice for two.

291
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,891
Yuto?

292
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,645
Will stubble from his shaver do?

293
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,397
It'll be fine.

294
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,607
You're home.

295
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,819
Remember Mr. Kido,
from Yokohama?

296
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,242
He's grown up.

297
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:42,664
Also, I found a hair on his clothes.

298
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,669
And this is his toothbrush.

299
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:52,925
And...inside these nail clippers,
a nail...

300
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,972
That should be plenty.

301
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,934
How much should I give it?

302
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,270
I'll cover all expenses for now.

303
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,939
I meant, how long?

304
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:12,361
Oh, how long. Well,
we should give it about a month.

305
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,779
A month?

306
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,876
Would those paintings
provide some kind of lead?

307
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,588
Well, that's hard to say.

308
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,593
They're good. As if done by
a man with a boy's heart.

309
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:45,269
That's exactly the kind of man he was.

310
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:11,920
Do you think...he was involved
in some kind of crime?

311
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:28,353
From March 31 to May 1st of 2002,
prior to disappearing, Mr. Sakazaki

312
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,940
worked 190.18 hours of overtime
in 30 days,

313
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:36,987
over twice the 80-hour
overwork death line. On May 2nd,

314
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,533
he requested leave and
became uncontactable. On the 3rd,

315
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:45,495
he supposedly committed suicide
in Takanezawa, Tochigi.

316
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,708
"I'm deeply sorry for
my abrupt decision.

317
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,589
"I'm worn out, body and soul,
and this was my only option.

318
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,676
"Mom, I caused you nothing but pain.

319
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,431
"Please forgive me for causing you
more pain than ever.

320
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,767
But you see..."

321
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,898
Oh, Mr. Kido sir!
Thank you so much.

322
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,693
Now our Masaru can rest in peace.

323
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,781
We're fortunate you're
such a humane lawyer, sir.

324
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,824
No, I simply did my job.

325
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,534
This isn't much, but...

326
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,955
Oh, you're too kind!
He'll gladly accept it.

327
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,666
Sir, we can't thank you enough...

328
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,753
No need. Ma'am, lift your head.
Please, really.

329
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,130
Hey. Show some appreciation.

330
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,715
Lawyers, huh...

331
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,093
We must be going.

332
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,511
Thank you so much.

333
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,137
Thank you.

334
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,847
Thank you so much.

335
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,799
Kaori, that was great.

336
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,176
A better paella than hers.

337
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,095
Well excuse me!

338
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,723
Sota, are you full already?

339
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,726
Don't overfeed them.

340
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,690
Aren't overwork deaths
actually suicides?

341
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,192
Compensation's still paid?

342
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,530
If a job's that hard,
why not ditch it?

343
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:49,745
Making logical decisions becomes
impossible under such pressure.

344
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,081
This country
uses tax money all wrong.

345
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,586
Doling out welfare
to people who can still work.

346
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,881
What do they spend it on?
Pachinko.

347
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,842
The system itself's absurd.

348
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,096
Like they say,
real Japanese don't rely on it.

349
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,892
No more free money for
Koreans and their ilk.

350
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,774
Oh, I didn't mean you, Akira.

351
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:24,196
Akira is third generation.
After that long, he's Japanese.

352
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,825
You know,
I watch nothing but Korean dramas.

353
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,078
Still, Mom?

354
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,913
Pour some for me.

355
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,289
More?

356
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,568
Look. Dad's connections
will get us a super good deal.

357
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,154
Maybe with the deposit too.

358
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,325
Isn't here enough?

359
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,205
I want another child.

360
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,916
What about this place?

361
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,170
We could rent it out.
It'd still be ours.

362
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:33,014
Hey, was your Miyazaki trip
really for business?

363
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,726
Yeah. Why?

364
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,025
Silly. Wanna see my ticket?

365
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,696
No.

366
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,575
I'm going to bed.
Good night.

367
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:52,993
Good night.

368
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,656
Oh, you made it.
It's about Daisuke?

369
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:39,331
What do you think is the face
of a hot spring inn?

370
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:41,791
Its hot spring?

371
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:47,088
Exactly. Its face is something
you dare not change.

372
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:53,345
Our spring's quality is indisputable.
Messing with it is a no-no.

373
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:59,351
When I took over from my father,
reservations shot up.

374
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,270
That was beyond my brother.

375
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:09,778
I've heard you and Daisuke clashed
regarding who would take over.

376
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,447
No, there was no clash.

377
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,076
Daisuke just thought there was.

378
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,918
This is the real Daisuke Taniguchi?

379
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,381
Before lumberjacking in Miyazaki,
he was in Osaka.

380
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,424
Really? I'll go there.

381
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,385
Oh, I already went.

382
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:37,764
This is our signature dish.
Try it.

383
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:49,067
I showed that photo to
his landlord in Kita Ward,

384
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:51,861
who recognized him.

385
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,989
The real Daisuke?

386
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:58,493
He didn't recognize a photo
of the fake Daisuke though.

387
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,874
So, in Osaka,
they hadn't switched places yet.

388
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,004
What do you say?

389
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,505
Well, it's too early...

390
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,215
Tasty, right?

391
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,385
Oh... Yes.

392
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:23,184
Anyway, do you think
Daisuke's still alive?

393
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:29,983
I mean, well, surely
the other guy killed him?

394
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,071
If the wife is on the level,
she's a victim,

395
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:42,829
but she got his life insurance,
so I think it should be investigated.

396
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,168
Okay, good luck.

397
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,011
Hello!

398
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,095
Hello!

399
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:02,015
Kyu! Hello there!

400
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,354
Uh-oh, she's mad.
She won't take to me.

401
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,855
Sorry about that.

402
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,357
See you, Kyu.

403
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,533
Hi boss.

404
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,952
Oh, Misuzu.

405
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,427
This guy passed himself off
as Daisuke?

406
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,054
That's right.

407
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:45,392
We don't know his name,
so we call him "Mr. X."

408
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,560
That's funny.

409
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:56,069
Their faces and their heights
are probably different.

410
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,238
Never seen him?

411
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,908
When did you meet Daisuke?

412
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,245
When I was in high school.

413
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,290
We hooked up and broke up,
over and over.

414
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,336
When did you last see him?

415
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,089
When was it...

416
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:25,265
His father had died, so he
went to the funeral... Around then.

417
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,309
This is Daisuke.

418
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,147
These are pretty old.

419
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,985
At this time, were you...

420
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,195
We were together.

421
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,115
But around that time...

422
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,951
The last time...

423
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:50,582
He never talked about breaking up.
He was just suddenly gone.

424
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,500
No calls or messages?

425
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,503
Not at all.
I couldn't get through.

426
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,302
But why did that guy
want Daisuke's past?

427
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,140
His background was nothing special.

428
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,144
An inheritance?

429
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,230
I don't know.

430
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,487
Maybe he got abducted by North Korea.

431
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:28,077
I've heard about that. They steal
family registers and assume identities.

432
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:35,210
Mr. X worked in forestry
in a small town in Miyazaki.

433
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:41,674
Well, there are still plenty of
North Korean agents around, yeah?

434
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,552
Not that conspiracy crap again.

435
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:49,474
He thinks the Tohoku quake
was man-made.

436
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,101
Wait a minute, that was...

437
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,229
This is a real manhunt.

438
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:22,006
Sorry for springing this on you.
Let me know if you...

439
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,767
Sorry.

440
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,398
Daisuke...

441
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,693
What a dumbass.

442
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,531
Such a dumbass.

443
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,163
I thought I'd found him,
but this is...

444
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,460
Sorry I blurted that out.

445
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,092
Bye.

446
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:32,410
<i>The DNA test confirmed that</i>
Mr. X wasn't Daisuke Taniguchi.

447
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,539
I see...

448
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:44,297
<i>That means you're</i>
neither married, nor a widow.

449
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,428
<i>Rie?</i>

450
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,476
<i>Are you alright?</i>

451
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:12,659
I wonder,
whose life was I living with?

452
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,167
"Whose life was I living with?"

453
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:29,509
I didn't have the faintest idea
how to answer her.

454
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:36,766
That X guy wanted to
hide his criminal past, no?

455
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,686
A majorly nasty one at that.

456
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,523
These sweets kick ass.

457
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:44,774
I know.

458
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,325
Nothing's riskier than
drawing the law's attention, no?

459
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,371
That's a natural assumption.

460
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,707
What's that?

461
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,167
Brand fraud.

462
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:08,756
Some shysters slap vintage stickers
on cheap-ass wines.

463
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:14,721
Buyers don't want to look clueless,
so they keep quiet.

464
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,556
That's ingenious.

465
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,315
Interesting.

466
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:33,823
Brand fraud reminds me,
I handled an impersonation case once.

467
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,408
Impersonation?

468
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:42,415
A 55-year-old man switched identities
with a 67-year-old and took his pension.

469
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,543
Got a guilty charge and it went civil.

470
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,505
The switch was pulled off by a broker.

471
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,720
Wait, when was that?

472
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,308
2000 and...what?

473
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:04,395
<i>"Osaka pension fraud broker..."</i>

474
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,935
Here it is. 2013.

475
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:07,273
Around the time X came to Miyazaki.

476
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:12,779
Seems the broker got paid
pulling off a load of deals.

477
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,532
"Norio Omiura"?

478
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:22,455
He's in Osaka Prison now.

479
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:28,419
He was in Osaka when
Daisuke Taniguchi was there too.

480
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:08,000
Wow, handsome mister lawyer
has come to see little old me.

481
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,339
I'm ugly, ain't I?

482
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,468
No wonder I'm a twisted bastard.

483
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:25,017
Well, thank you for meeting me.

484
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,437
As I told you, I'm Kido...

485
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,940
You're a Japan-born Korean.

486
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:33,901
Ain't ya?

487
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:41,450
Do I have to tell you?

488
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,078
I knew soon as I saw your face.

489
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,627
I'm a naturalized Japanese now.

490
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,674
So, today, as I wrote in my letter,
five years ago...

491
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,384
Mister lawyer.

492
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:04,891
Some people out there
actually live for 300 years, you know?

493
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:11,689
I'm sure you've heard
that 300-year-olds are real.

494
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,735
I've never heard that.

495
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:21,616
Maybe they don't exist in
the world you live in, mister lawyer.

496
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:27,079
On the down-low, there was one
in here. He got released though.

497
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:39,884
That's fascinating, but I'm here
about a five-year-old case.

498
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,641
Do you know Daisuke Taniguchi?

499
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,895
A man who went by that name is dead.

500
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,774
However, he wasn't the real
Daisuke Taniguchi.

501
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,613
Mr. Omiura, you brokered
identity document switches, correct?

502
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,950
Know anything about this man?

503
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,829
The second son of the
Ikaho Onsen innkeeper?

504
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,667
Yes! That's right.
You knew him?

505
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,003
I think we're done here today.

506
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:19,507
I want to know who he switched with.

507
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,178
It wasn't a switch,
it was identity laundering.

508
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:31,811
Just like dirty money, plenty of folks
want to wash their pasts clean.

509
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:39,610
Mister lawyer, I bet you hated
being Korean and wanted to switch.

510
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:50,538
You're Korean but you don't
come across as Korean. In a nutshell,

511
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:54,125
that's what you
Japan-born Koreans are.

512
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,628

Yeah. That one, right?

Branches out, like this.

Yeah, this one. And,

that one is Hana's.
And,

yours is there. You said
you liked that one, didn't you?

You didn't make a grave for him
on his deathday this year either.

534
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,271
Will my name change again?

535
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:07,985
I was born a Yoneda.
After the divorce, Takemoto.

536
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,779
Then Taniguchi, like Dad.

00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,201
Who should I become next?

538
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,215
Yuto...

539
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:43,270
There's something I've been
keeping a secret from you.

540
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,361
Your stepdad...

541
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:56,408
His name wasn't really
Daisuke Taniguchi.

542
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,456
Even I didn't know that.

543
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:10,005
After he died...I found out
it wasn't his real name.

544
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,719
So who was he?

545
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,896
Someone's looking into that now.

546
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,860
He used another man's name,

547
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:37,950
so I've been talking to
a lawyer about it,

548
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:41,704
who's trying to find out all he can.

549
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,748
So? So who was he?

550
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,920
I don't know yet.

551
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:14,695
Because I don't know yet,
I can't make a grave for him.

552
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:20,326
We can't put
"Daisuke Taniguchi" on it.

Then...

My name, Yuto Taniguchi...
What about that?

555
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:44,308
The...Taniguchi part of your name...

556
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,148
...belongs to someone we don't know.

Oh, I'll take it.

Yes, with this.

I never thought about

Art by criminals is...
How can I put it?

576
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:42,259
I had a vague image of it
as a kind of excuse,

577

but I was so wrong.

578
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:53,312
They're not trying to claim innocence.

579
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,279
They're screaming out,

But a death row art exhibition
as a date spot?

If you take the stance that
people are incapable of change,

01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,314
you validate capital punishment.

600
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:05,444
But we don't do that. We take
the stance that people can change,

601
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:11,491
and have held these art exhibitions
year after year.

602

"Those who commit crimes
are unable to be reformed."

603
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:23,754
This nation claims that emphatically,
and executes death sentences.

604
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:29,885
However, it's possible
to take a different view, that

605
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:34,598
people can change, no matter
what crimes they commit.

606
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:41,438
If we don't adopt that belief,
our society will never be at peace...

But X got crushed by a tree

617
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:31,506

Makoto Hara. He ended up
using his mother's surname.

623
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,401
Raised in an orphanage in Maebashi,

624
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,821
and became a pro boxer.

625

Then who the hell's
that Sonezaki dude?

626
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:11,713
Anyway, if X really was
that death row inmate's son,

627
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,675
he might've been on the run
from some crime.

Why?

We've seen that as lawyers.

640
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,354
You know him?

01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,525
Well, my memory's fuzzy.

642
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,446
You acted as his broker too?

643
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,823
For what?

644
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,915
Daisuke Taniguchi ran away
from his family to Osaka.

645
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:15,795
You helped him switch identities
with an executed criminal's son.

646
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:21,927
I don't follow you,
but it ain't nothing to do with me.

647
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,389
It seems he was a pro boxer.

648
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:28,892
Who was?

649
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:38,485
What I can't figure out is,
who was "Yoshihiko Sonezaki"?

650

Mister lawyer, you really don't
know shit about shit, do ya?

651
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,036
You think so?

Your dick's flapping in the wind.
Ain't you ashamed to be alive?

653
01:10:55,210 --> 01:11:00,298
You're Korean trash,
but you look down on me?

654
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:08,515
You think I'm just a fraudster.
You don't believe a word I say.

655
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:16,356
You think I'm a bigot,
but it's you who's prejudiced.

656
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:22,153
Prejudiced about what?
You're locked up for fraud!

657
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:31,538
Want me to fill you in on
what's stupidest about you?

658
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:39,838
How do you know I'm
really Norio Omiura?

659
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:44,718
Has my face got "Norio Omiura"
written all over it?

660
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:52,392
Even tattooists don't tattoo others
till they tattoo themselves.

661
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:59,941
You think I ain't ever changed
my identity? You're dumb as shit.

662
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:06,781
Since you're dumb as shit,
I'll teach you one last thing.

663
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:35,268
<i>The man you're so eager</i>
to find out about

664
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,146
ain't worth shit.

665
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,691
You're getting your hopes up,

666
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:48,323
but kids born to murderers
amount to nothing.

667
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:09,594
Yasushi!
Let's play baseball!

668
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,480
Dad...

669
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,862
Oh, Makoto.

670
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:36,538
Here. Buy whatever you want.

671
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,541
Go on.

672
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:37,932
Boss.

673
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,642
Boss!

674
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,790
Makoto came here in spring of 2001.

675
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,961
He seemed kinda creepy at first.

676
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,634
Morose, and scary.
Honestly, he made me uneasy.

677
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:17,597
Why do you think he took up boxing?

678
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:22,227
He started out on a whim,
apparently.

679
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:27,315
He often peered in
through the front windows.

680
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:32,779
<i>"Kosuge Boxing Gym"</i>

681
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,237
<i>After a while,</i>
he wandered inside.

682
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:35,823
Then, he showed promise?

683
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:41,412
He didn't know a thing about boxing,

684
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,459
but he was athletic,
and a quick learner.

685
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:11,734
Down!

686
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,993
Okay, use the ring to shadow box.

687
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:25,373
Makoto! Makoto!
Shadow box! Shadow box!

688
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,686
<i>"Mr. Makoto Hara"</i>

689
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:51,232
<i>"Sender : Kenkichi Kobayashi"</i>

690
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,157
<i>A ring name?</i>

691
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:02,327
Am I not ready?

692
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:07,457
Why not? Your pro debut's set.
Give yourself a flashy name.

693
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:10,418
No, something low-key.

694
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,337
Why?

695
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,466
How about "Ogata"?
Like Ken Ogata, the actor.

696
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,051
Ogata...

697
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:21,387
Ogata, huh?

698
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,140
Right, like that...

699
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:28,936
Akane. How does "Ogata" sound?
His ring name.

700
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:32,023
Ogata...

701
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:39,113
First name "Katsutoshi"?
The characters for "victory."

702
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,282
I don't know about that.

703
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,533
- Why?
- It's lame.

704
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:44,202
No, it's cool.

705
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,579
Nah, it's lame. Right?

706
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,207
No... I like it.

707
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,917
You like it?!

708
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,461
Katsutoshi Ogata.

709
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:56,255
It sounds like a regular name.

710
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,256
It's "Victory."

711
01:17:57,423 --> 01:18:00,176
"Victory"?
Akane, come on.

712
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,138
If he wins, it'll be
"Victory Ogata's victory."

713
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,598
Oh, true.

714
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:09,102
- But it's cool.
- Rethink. Rethink.

715
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,353
Uncool. Uncool.

716
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:24,325
You got him!

717
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,328
Good, good.
Mouthpiece! Good.

718
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,330
Good, okay.

719
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:32,625
Good, good.
You got this. You got this.

720
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,044
Watch for headbutts.

721
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,091
Go end this!

722
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,676
Way to go! Way to go!

723
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:27,054
You did it!
You did it, kid!

724
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:30,475
Victory Ogata's victory!

725
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,478
You did it!

726
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:43,488
He's gonna be great,
but his hands are a worry.

727
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:46,199
He hits so damn hard.

728
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:50,745
That counterpunch was deliberate?

729
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,750
Combining hooks with straights
was the boss's strategy.

730
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,376
That hook was nice.

731
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:59,629
It was phenomenal.

732
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:03,216
Top Rookie is up next.
Any thoughts?

733
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,638
Making the boss and the team happy
would please me most.

734
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:10,556
One last question...

735
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,226
Sorry, can we wrap this up?

736
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:16,687
Thank you. Congratulations.

737
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,732
We're rooting for you. Bye.

738
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,361
Finished? Got a minute?

739
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:34,664
<i>He takes after his dad after all.</i>

740
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:38,477
<i>Did you know,</i>
about Makoto Hara's father?

741
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:44,358
Well, it came as a surprise,

742
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:50,364
but parents and kids...
walk different paths, right?

743
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:57,830
We found out before Makoto was set
to fight for Top Rookie.

744
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:02,335
He said he wanted to pull out. Yeah.

745
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,712
He told me that too.

746
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:08,758
So, the boss asked him why.

747
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,511
Then he opened up about his father.

748
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:23,522
I'm not sure I should be...
out in the spotlight like that.

749
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:30,821
You won your way there,
on sheer ability alone.

750
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:37,244
To be honest, I don't care
about winning or losing.

751
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:43,209
I started boxing...
so I could get hit.

752
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:53,678
When I wake up,
I look in the mirror.

753
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,392
When I do...

754
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,396
...my father's there.

755
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,319
I'm his spitting image.

756
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:19,870
It feels like my father...
is inside me, and...

757
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:28,713
...I want to rip away at myself...
and tear off my skin.

758
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:36,637
So...for me, boxing is about
torturing my body.

759
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:42,393
My body.
That's all I care about.

760
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:51,318
So kid. Tell me.

761
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:57,992
If you feel pain, will that bring
the murder victims back to life?

762
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:07,418
Will they come back to life?!
Answer me!

763
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,463
Fine,

764
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,798
I'll hit you then.

765
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,764
Why, Boss?!

766
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,432
Hey punk!

767
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:25,895
Some guys only want
to become Top Rookie!

768
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:30,357
They live for that!
Ever thought how they feel?!

769
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:13,859
You know, the boss
rates your ability highly.

770
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,782
I'm sorry.

771
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:31,085
We're your family now,
ain't we?

772
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:32,706
<i>Today at 8:15,</i>
Kenkichi Kobayashi was executed.

773
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:37,836
<i>If you wish to claim his body,</i>
as his only kin, and son...

774
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,421
<i>I won't.</i>

775
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,550
<i>I won't claim anything of this.</i>

776
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:49,390
<i>From now on, don't contact me</i>
about this again.

777
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,463
Hey, what's wrong?

778
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:54,181
Soon after that,
he had an accident.

779
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:56,850
An accident?

780
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,900
<i>Fell from a building.</i>
A mall by the station.

781
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,905
He said it was just a careless slip...

782
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:13,867
...but off a building?

783
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,876
How is your boss?

784
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:27,631
It all came as a shock.

785
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:35,848
He's over it now, but he was
depressed for a long time.

786
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,227
He stepped out before, right?

787
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:46,024
It's too hard for him.
Remembering.

788
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:56,994
Hey... Can I ask you something?

789
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,412
Sure.

790
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:07,671
Was it suicide?
Makoto's death.

791
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:14,219
As far as I'm aware,
that's unlikely.

792
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,057
Good.

793
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:25,189
He didn't stick with boxing,
did he?

794
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,193
It seems he didn't.

795
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,992
There's so much...

796
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:40,913
...I want to talk to him about.

797
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:54,843
<i>Foreigners, get out of Japan!</i>

798
01:31:56,053 --> 01:31:57,930
<i>Go to Hell!</i>

799
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:03,936
<i>Racial and ethnic</i>
prejudice and discrimination.

800
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:09,858
<i>Right now, fierce hatred</i>
is being spread through society.

801
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:10,692
<i>"Hate speech"</i>

802
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,695
<i>Filthy rats!</i>

803
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:14,988
<i>Cockroaches!</i>

804
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,200
<i>They don't deserve welfare!</i>

805
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,830
Sota, keep it down.

806
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:25,207
I'm home.

807
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:33,340
<i>Why do we have to have</i>
our livelihoods threatened?

808
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,510
<i>It's infuriating.</i>

809
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:53,986
Knock it off!

810
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:57,406
What's going on?

811
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,286
What happened?

812
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:07,416
Let's go.

813
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:45,037
I'm sorry.

814
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,294
You're not yourself lately.

815
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:57,758
You're too caught up in your manhunt.

816
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:03,805
I wish you wouldn't
bring that home with you.

817
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:16,193
What does that man's life
have to do with yours?

818
01:34:20,364 --> 01:34:21,990
I don't know.

819
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:29,164
It just...helps take my mind
off things, for some reason.

820
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,167
Chasing another man's life.

821
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,421
The son of an executed criminal?

822
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,925
I don't understand you.

823
01:34:40,509 --> 01:34:42,511
I don't either.

824
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:46,348
Running from reality?

825
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,185
That's low.

826
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,395
Is it?

827
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:53,522
Am I to blame?

828
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,193
You're running from me?

829
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:04,074
Of course not.

830
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:15,544
Just end it soon,
and go back to your old self.

831
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:33,371
<i>Sorry to take your time.</i>

832
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,458
Come on in.

833
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,502
Good to see you.

834
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:43,715
"Makoto Hara"?

835
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:50,514
Cutting to the chase,
the man you married

836
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:54,518
was a good man
who never committed a crime.

837
01:36:57,062 --> 01:37:00,482
Stealing somebody's identity
isn't a crime?

838
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,403
He wanted our inheritance.

839
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:12,661
Why switch with
an executed criminal's son?

840
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:19,960
How is your brother any different?

841
01:37:24,214 --> 01:37:29,427
He was given the gift of life,
but he didn't want his.

842
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:36,393
He was desperate to abandon
his identity and become a new man.

843
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,688
Isn't that how Mr. Taniguchi felt?

844
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:44,025
"Become a new man"?

845
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:49,197
He never stopped being
an executed criminal's son.

846
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:05,005
I'm sure Mr. Hara gave his all
for a second chance at life.

847
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:12,220
Some people have to go to extremes
to start over.

848
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,027
Daisuke might not be
alive anymore either.

849
01:38:48,173 --> 01:38:49,341
Hi.

850
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,177
Hi.

851
01:38:58,725 --> 01:38:59,768
What's up?

852
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:18,578
Now you're starting to think about
things that are beyond me.

853
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:40,392
Our family name...

854
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:50,485
We have to change it back
to Takemoto.

855
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:57,659
I'm sorry.

856
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:04,708
We can't be a burden on
the real Taniguchis.

857
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,345
You know...

858
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:25,395
I was sad when Dad died...

859
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:28,148
...but not anymore.

860
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,532
I just...

861
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,754
I miss him.

862
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:59,554
There's so much
I want to tell him, every day...

863
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:07,520
I know.

864
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:20,200
You really loved your dad,
didn't you?

865
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:39,761
You really loved him.

866
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:56,945
I'm sorry.

867
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:21,386
<i>"Akira Kido"</i>

868
01:42:43,575 --> 01:42:47,787

01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:27,619
Want zunda cakes?
Just got back from Sendai.

873
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:31,748
Tea...

874
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,586
I found the real Daisuke Taniguchi.

875
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:43,468
So, Sonezaki sent a message
to the fake account?

876
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:47,555
Omiura was telling me the truth.

877
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:48,806
The truth?

878
01:43:48,932 --> 01:43:51,643
Makoto Hara changed names twice.

879
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:58,983
First, he switched identities
with Yoshihiko Sonezaki.

880
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:04,030
Later, he switched names again
with Daisuke Taniguchi.

881
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:09,285
And this guy went to Miyazaki
as Daisuke Taniguchi?

882
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:13,665
Rewriting his past,
till it became unreadable.

883
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:20,755
So, where's this dude now?

884
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:30,223
<i>Nagoya</i>

885
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:41,919
Daisuke.

886
01:45:58,186 --> 01:45:59,812
You dumbass!

887
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,224
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:22,311
<i>"Investigation Report"</i>

889
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:29,360
For Makoto Hara,

890
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,990
three years and nine months with you

891
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:37,743
surely meant everything to him.

892
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:42,665
He wasn't with you long,

893
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:46,127
but I'm sure he was truly happy.

894
01:47:49,422 --> 01:47:51,257
I hope so.

895
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:06,105
It might be 20/20 hindsight, but...

896
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:18,910
...I get the feeling now that maybe,
I never needed to know the truth.

897
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:28,794
I mean, we met in this town,
fell in love...

898
01:48:31,339 --> 01:48:33,090
...became a family...

899
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:37,136
...had Hana...

900
01:48:47,939 --> 01:48:50,816
Those truths are crystal clear.

901
01:49:20,972 --> 01:49:22,098
Read it?

902
01:49:23,224 --> 01:49:24,308
Yeah.

903
01:49:25,643 --> 01:49:26,852
You okay?

904
01:49:44,412 --> 01:49:49,875
Now I know...
why Dad was so kind, I think.

905
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:00,511
Why?

906
01:50:03,014 --> 01:50:08,144
The things he wanted his father
to do for him, he did for me.

907
01:50:13,566 --> 01:50:15,234
I guess so.

908
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:25,494
But that's not all.

909
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:31,167
More than anything,
he loved you.

910
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:39,884
Will you tell Hana?

911
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,188
What do you think?

912
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,320
I'll tell her.

913
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:07,995
I'll tell Hana sometime,
about what kind of father he was.

914
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:23,654
Rei isn't eating at all.

915
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:29,326
No Dad. That one's Roa.
This one's Rei.

916
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:32,621
Huh? Isn't that one Rei?

917
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:35,207
This is the real Rei.

918
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:38,169
Yeah? Are you sure?

919
01:52:38,544 --> 01:52:42,298
You're so forgetful,
you forgot!

920
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:43,382
Did I?

921
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:44,592
I'm home.

922
01:52:44,717 --> 01:52:46,343
Hi Mommy!

923
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:48,095
Hi there.

924
01:52:48,387 --> 01:52:50,097
The party dragged on.

925
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:51,557
Bath's still warm.

926
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:52,725
Thanks.

927
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,560
Been busy today?

928
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:58,397
Daddy knocked over all of those.

929
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,524
Daddy did? Oh no.

930
01:53:00,608 --> 01:53:03,569
Actually, I did it with that car.

931
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:09,033
And they were so weak,
they all fell down.

932
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:12,203
Okay, let's tidy up later.

933
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:15,247
Get ready for bed.

934
01:53:19,168 --> 01:53:20,211
What's up?

935
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:23,547
Nothing.

936
01:53:29,053 --> 01:53:31,180
My manhunt's over now.

937
01:53:33,224 --> 01:53:34,350
It is?

938
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:37,645
That's great.

939
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:45,152
Oh, I told Dad
we won't buy that house.

940
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:49,156
We'll look if
it gets too cramped here.

941
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:07,675
Hey, don't do that, it's cold!

942
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:09,552
Try this. It's good.

943
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,095
- It's good.
- It is.

944
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:12,972
Mommy, that game.

945
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:15,432
That game? Which one?

946
01:54:16,225 --> 01:54:17,309
Racer.

947
01:54:19,395 --> 01:54:23,065
You can play,
but only till your food comes.

948
01:54:24,066 --> 01:54:25,317
I lost.

949
01:54:26,235 --> 01:54:27,736
Restroom.

950
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,786
A car! Yay!

951
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:40,165
Daddy, the screen's weird.

952
01:54:42,126 --> 01:54:44,837
Oh, you must've touched something.

953
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:56,390
<i>"Thanks for last night! I'm glad</i>
we met. You're unforgettable..."

954
01:55:01,645 --> 01:55:03,272
Mom's not back.

955
01:55:06,108 --> 01:55:09,320
Thank you for waiting.
One kids' meal.

956
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:11,614
Oh, the food's here.

957
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:16,368
Get me a spoon. A spoon
and a fork. Get them.

958
01:55:16,452 --> 01:55:18,454
Wow, it's quite fancy.

959
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:19,705
It's not fancy.

960
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:20,706
It is fancy!

961
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:36,347
Enjoy.

962
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:43,312
How old are the trees?

963
01:55:45,189 --> 01:55:49,193
They cut them down
after about 50 years.

964
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:56,867
And once they become wood,
it lasts for another 50.

965
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:02,122
50 years in the mountains,
50 years with humans.

966
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:05,709
No kidding...

967
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:13,550
So, you can't cut down
what you've planted.

968
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:18,263
I guess...
I liked the sound of it.

969
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:20,724
Of things being passed on.

970
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:25,729
What fathers plant,
their sons cut down.

971
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:29,817
Oh, you have children?

972
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:31,402
I do.

973
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:33,153
Grown up?

974
01:56:33,237 --> 01:56:36,699
One's 4,
and the other's 13.

975
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:38,826
Two.

976
01:56:43,205 --> 01:56:45,749
You're from a different prefecture?

977
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,376
Yeah.

978
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:53,757
From Gunma originally.
You know, Ikaho Onsen?

979
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:56,218
Oh yeah, it's famous.

980
01:56:56,343 --> 01:56:58,262
My family runs an inn.

981
01:57:00,514 --> 01:57:05,185
But my big brother took over,
so I left.

982
01:57:08,147 --> 01:57:13,861
I would've stayed.
I mean, hot spring baths every day?

983
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:20,659
Well, my family and I
never got along anyway,

984
01:57:20,784 --> 01:57:24,163
and it brought me together
with my wife.

985
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:27,916
Living your own way is best.

986
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:31,670
It's nobody's life but your own.

987
01:57:33,005 --> 01:57:35,340
That's so true.

988
01:57:36,633 --> 01:57:41,263
I never want to let go
of the life I have now...

989
01:57:47,186 --> 01:57:48,520
I'd better go.

990
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:50,773
Hey, check please.

991
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:54,276
We talked so much,
for strangers.

992
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:56,320
I really enjoyed it.

993
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:57,488
Let's swap cards.

994
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:11,668
I'm Suzuki.

995
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:14,671
Sorry, I'm out of cards.

996
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:15,839
No problem.

997
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,299
I'm...
