1
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,483
Just look at this!

2
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,320
We've just spotted him
among this huge crowd of fans.

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,656
The ace of Japan's
national soccer team, Junya Kono,

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,191
has made a dashing entrance.

5
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,029
The scoring champion
three years running for Kamakura Regulus,

6
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,799
Junya has transferred to
the famous Italian club, Piedmont FC.

7
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,769
-Thank you.
-He's just returned to Japan.

8
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,104
Junya!

9
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,374
You traitor!

10
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,277
You left Japan just for the money!

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,851
You can have this back.

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,559
Stand back.

13
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,895
-Hey!
-Hey, Junya!

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,103
Let's go.

15
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,464
Okay, go ahead.

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,568
Sorry. Please take a detour.
There's construction going on.

17
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,635
Sorry.

18
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,370
Thanks. Sorry.

19
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,210
CLOSED TO TRAFFIC

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,213
-Dang, it's cold.
-It's rough tonight.

21
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,318
Here, have one.

22
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,153
I brought extras.

23
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,087
-You sure?
-Yes.

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,693
You sure are used to this.
Have you been doing guard work for long?

25
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,863
Well, about six years.

26
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,064
Really?

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,565
For a guy like me on a pension,

28
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,902
it's a good way to make some extra money.

29
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,071
But it must be boring for a young guy.

30
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,672
I'm not young.

31
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,608
You're younger than me.

32
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,543
I didn't notice.

33
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,714
Excuse me!

34
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,050
Excuse me!

35
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,953
Hold on! Excuse me!

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,335
There's construction going on.
Please take a detour.

37
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,404
We're in a hurry. Let us through.

38
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,241
Sorry, but nobody's allowed through.

39
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,690
Can you please help us?

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,631
Well, I can't let an accident happen here.

41
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,278
Sorry.

42
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,081
There's construction going on. Sorry!

43
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,250
-Sorry!
-Hey!

44
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,685
What about that car just now?

45
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,120
It went without permission.

46
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,623
Are you kidding?
Aren't you supposed to keep people out?

47
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,425
-Do your job!
-Calm down!

48
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,962
Arguing with the guard
won't change anything. Right?

49
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,398
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

50
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,501
She got away, darn it!

51
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,539
Can you believe this?

52
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:05,778
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI, TRAFFIC GUARD DIVISION,
HINODE SECURITY SERVICE

53
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,887
WILL THE GAFFE MINISTER,
AIKO TACHIHARA, STEP DOWN?

54
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,694
<i>I heard.</i>

55
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,998
You let a car through an off-limits area.

56
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,733
I'm very sorry.

57
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,438
That was a big help.
You kept it from becoming an issue.

58
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,408
That client is very sensitive.

59
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,577
Thank you.

60
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,414
Actually, I called you here
about something else.

61
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,986
We'll be starting
a Personal Security Division.

62
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,025
<i>We'll be needing bodyguards.</i>

63
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,493
PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

64
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,295
When we think of bodyguards in Japan,

65
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,131
we think they're used by
celebrities and rich people.

66
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,868
But these days,
anyone could get caught up in a crime.

67
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,905
People are beginning to believe
that security comes only at a price.

68
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,242
Experience is crucial
for private security companies.

69
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,813
It would be very reassuring
if you joined the division.

70
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:14,881
Well...

71
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,085
I really appreciate that you
helped me get back on my feet.

72
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,456
But Mr. President, I'm sure you must know,

73
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,825
in the bodyguard profession,

74
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,295
anyone who has failed at his job
cannot return to it.

75
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,903
There's no reason for anyone to know.

76
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,042
I have no intention of telling anyone
about what happened six years ago.

77
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,813
You'll be like everyone else on the team.

78
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,749
You'll be assigned to
the Personal Security Division

79
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,950
as a novice bodyguard.

80
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,386
Novice?

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,359
But a long period of inactivity
can be fatal to a bodyguard.

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
I've aged a lot too.

83
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
I'm sure my senses have dulled.

84
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,333
Is this really what you want?

85
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,737
Shimazaki...

86
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,342
I want you to make
a magnificent comeback for me.

87
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,048
I'm sure you can do that.

88
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,333
It hurts!

89
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,006
<i>I want you to start training.</i>

90
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,612
<i>Personal security can't be done alone.
It requires teamwork.</i>

91
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,521
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI
CRISIS MANAGEMENT

92
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,522
I found it.

93
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,827
<i>I've already gotten people
from other departments.</i>

94
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,262
MASAYA TAKANASHI
CASH TRANSPORT SECURITY

95
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,695
MAYU SUGANUMA
STORE SECURITY DIVISION

96
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,064
<i>I'm expecting that it'll be a great team.</i>

97
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,158
GORO MURATA
BUILDING SECURITY DIVISION

98
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,962
Stand back! You want to die?

99
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,768
-You left yourself wide open.
-That hurt.

100
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,505
He has a knife. I'm unarmed.

101
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,539
You learned what to do.

102
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,674
Unlike the Security Police,

103
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:33,079
private bodyguards aren't allowed
to carry guns since they're too deadly.

104
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,281
But does the practice have to be
so realistic?

105
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,583
This is our final training.

106
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,319
That's why I want you
to go at it for real.

107
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,590
Watch it! I'll kill this woman!

108
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,527
That hurts! Help me!

109
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,565
Go ahead.

110
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,415
Well done.

111
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:11,951
Sorry.

112
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,022
What? Was that just luck?

113
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,190
How did that happen?

114
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,527
Let's do it again.

115
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm impressed by how
you're always training.

116
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,268
What do you want?

117
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,536
OSAMU HIKAWA
CHIEF OF SECURITY, MPD

118
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,573
Minister Aiko has received a package.

119
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,041
YOSHIAKI OCHIAI
SECURITY BUREAU (SP), MPD

120
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,176
<i>MPD to bomb disposal captain.</i>

121
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,878
<i>Describe the object.</i>

122
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,948
<i>The object is a brown paper bag.</i>

123
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>It's addressed to
the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare,</i>

124
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,319
<i>Aiko Tachihara.</i>

125
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,422
<i>Sender unknown.
We'll be doing an x-ray next.</i>

126
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,757
When did the package arrive?

127
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,027
Around 3:00 p.m.
It was mixed in with other packages.

128
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,631
I wonder if it isn't really
a present from a fan.

129
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,235
When I was a news anchor,
I got fan mail every day.

130
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,938
It must be about my gaffes.

131
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,177
There are old batteries inside.

132
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,546
Batteries?

133
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,383
<i>X-ray inspection complete.
The object is not a bomb.</i>

134
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,952
<i>We'll open and examine the contents now.</i>

135
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:28,988
Here it is.

136
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,899
"Pride is man's biggest enemy."

137
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,868
"Resign, or the starting gun
will signal your death."

138
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,204
"From your ex-fan."

139
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,240
This is awfully malicious for a prank.

140
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,712
I've received lots of requests
for my resignation,

141
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,880
but this is the first threat.

142
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,449
What do they mean by "starting gun"?

143
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,384
Do you have any idea what it means?

144
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,252
No.

145
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,827
Could they be referring to
the Sumida River Marathon?

146
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,063
It's a marathon that takes place
in her electoral district.

147
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,468
The Minister will be acting as
the starter for the race.

148
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,038
This could be a warning
that if the Minister doesn't resign,

149
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,706
they'll go after her there.

150
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,143
Please don't attend.

151
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,879
Okay. I'll notify them
that she can't attend.

152
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,780
Wait.

153
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,784
I don't want to give in to this threat.

154
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,621
I'll have SP guarding you
around the clock.

155
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,790
-Have this examined.
-Yes, sir.

156
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,693
-Increase the guards.
-Yes, sir.

157
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,330
Kiyota, report to Section 4
and inform Nakamura and Tanaka.

158
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,231
Yes, sir.

159
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,536
<i>I'm at the Diet Members'
Office Building in Nagatacho.</i>

160
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,172
<i>Yesterday, at around 3:00 p.m.,</i>

161
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,342
<i>the police were called to report
that Minister Aiko Tachihara</i>

162
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,544
<i>had received a mysterious package.</i>

163
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,448
<i>After receiving the call,
the riot police squad...</i>

164
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,750
Hurry up and eat or you'll be late.

165
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,053
I know.

166
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,992
<i>As you can see, the police line
has been removed...</i>

167
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,827
What about your school?

168
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,068
If you're not going back home,
then transfer to a closer school.

169
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,173
Do you want me to go back to Mom?

170
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,074
That's not what I mean.

171
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,046
If you want to live here, Shun,
then that's fine.

172
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,482
I'm not here
because I want to be with you.

173
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,318
Mom just got married.
I don't want to get in her way.

174
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,854
I want her to be happy this time.

175
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,625
I see.

176
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,861
How considerate.

177
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>This morning at 7:30 a.m.,</i>

178
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:55,234
<i>Minister Tachihara appeared
at the Diet Members' Office Building,</i>

179
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,238
<i>but quickly entered
without speaking to the press.</i>

180
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,373
That's...

181
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,711
She's your type, isn't she?

182
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,980
Okay, that's enough.

183
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,716
Lock up when you leave.

184
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,553
<i>Government sources say the incident
was only to be expected,</i>

185
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,823
<i>and that there will be more calls
for her to step down.</i>

186
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,625
<i>That's all. Back to you.</i>

187
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,571
Be careful on your way to school.

188
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,425
You're so handsome!

189
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,794
You're all bodyguards, right?

190
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,564
You look just like that Eastwood guy.

191
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,166
And you're like...

192
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,469
that Kevin-something guy.

193
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,442
You're like Nicholas.
Oh, and you're like Whitney.

194
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,977
She was being guarded.

195
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,913
That was before my time.

196
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,447
Excuse me. Who are you?

197
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,118
Isn't it obvious?
I'm here because you need insurance.

198
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,589
This is a dangerous job,
so you need to be prepared.

199
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,424
The company has insurance.

200
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,993
I don't have money to spend on this.

201
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,830
Just between us,
your president is a cheapskate.

202
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,367
He makes sure the client is well-insured,
but not the employees.

203
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,972
Here, Kevin.
You must have three children, right?

204
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,241
You need to leave your lovely wife
with 500,000...

205
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,776
No, I don't need that.

206
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,778
You're not even close anyway.

207
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,447
You could get shot, you know?

208
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,016
Don't jinx us by talking like that.

209
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,685
Oh, it's the manager!

210
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,421
I've prepared a special plan for you.

211
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,158
I'll look it over carefully later.
We just have an urgent job.

212
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,795
Hey! Wait! Making exits is my specialty.

213
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,297
Wait! I...

214
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,198
Goodbye.

215
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,700
Hey, wait!

216
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,804
Okay.

217
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,038
PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

218
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,440
That was no lie.

219
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,979
Congratulations on completing
your difficult training.

220
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,250
We have our first job.

221
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,823
First, have a look at this.

222
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,859
FIRST TIME ASSUMING OFFICE
HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE MINISTRY

223
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,663
<i>Yesterday at 3:00 p.m.,
a package from a former fan arrived</i>

224
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,733
<i>at the office of the Health, Labor,
and Welfare Minister, Aiko Tachihara.</i>

225
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,869
<i>Though it only contained old batteries,
and nobody was injured,</i>

226
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,604
<i>it included a threatening letter.</i>

227
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:50,075
<i>It's believed to be a reaction
to the gaffe she made the other day.</i>

228
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,711
<i>Employment is definitely on the rise.</i>

229
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,483
<i>To be perfectly clear,
jobs aren't just handed out.</i>

230
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>The unemployed must take
some of the responsibility.</i>

231
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Take responsibility?
What do you mean by that?</i>

232
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,091
<i>What do you mean by "take responsibility"?</i>

233
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,695
-Any comment for the perpetrator?
-Is your gaffe the cause?

234
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,331
Minister Tachihara!

235
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,600
People want to hear from you!

236
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,403
I've known this reporter for a long time.

237
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,072
I'll give you a three-minute interview.

238
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,041
What? No way!

239
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,443
Hey! Minister!

240
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
Thank you.

241
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,616
-What's going on?
-Why the special treatment?

242
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,985
-Hey!
-Stand back!

243
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,319
WEEKLY OPINION

244
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,121
Thank you, Minister.

245
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,490
I'm glad you're giving me
an exclusive interview.

246
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,062
Mr. Inukai, you're not like
those gossip reporters.

247
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,030
You're a journalist.

248
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,801
Let's begin.

249
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,573
Do you think your gaffe
is the cause of this threat?

250
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,041
Yes.

251
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,479
However, I don't believe
what I said was a gaffe.

252
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,584
Everyone is interpreting my use
of "responsibility" in a bad way.

253
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,923
It also means having self-respect,
and not taking handouts.

254
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,260
So you have no intention of stepping down.

255
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,029
Of course not.

256
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,866
I will also attend
the Sumida River Marathon as planned.

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,503
I won't run away.

258
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:30,209
The client is the chairman
of Sasuke Foods, Sasuke Okubo, age 71.

259
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,644
They sponsor the Sumida River Marathon.

260
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,047
He's an old acquaintance of our president.

261
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,950
He has asked us to guard him
during the awards ceremony.

262
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,620
So we're not protecting
Minister Tachihara?

263
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,825
What a disappointment. If it were
a politician, we'd get better pay.

264
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,862
The MPD's Security Police
guard politicians just fine.

265
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,797
They would never ask for private help.

266
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,133
What a jerk.

267
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,069
Chairman Okubo is worried that
he'll end up as collateral damage

268
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,271
if Minister Tachihara gets attacked.

269
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,939
That was just a prank, right?

270
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,075
If you're not serious, you'll get hurt.

271
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,409
They were only batteries.

272
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,246
The BG for this assignment is...

273
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,582
Allow me to do it.

274
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,786
BG isn't just an abbreviation
for bodyguard.

275
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,456
It's the person who sticks
closest to the client,

276
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,458
and who gives orders to the team.

277
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,927
Any mistake could be fatal.

278
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,897
-Oh, such a strong sense of duty.
-Yours is too weak!

279
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,032
-Who asked you?
-Now, now.

280
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,969
-All right. You're in charge, Takanashi.
-Yes, sir.

281
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,006
Shimazaki, you assist Takanashi,
and deal with the MPD.

282
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,008
Yes, sir.

283
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,044
Suganuma and Sawaguchi,
check out the venue and schedule.

284
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:39,945
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,116
<i>I'm Takanashi from Personal Security
at Hinode Security Service.</i>

286
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,418
I'll be handling your security.

287
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,819
Likewise, I'm Shimazaki.

288
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,023
I'm counting on you.
I'll pay you whatever it takes.

289
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm not letting myself
get incidentally killed!

290
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,529
Please, sit down.

291
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,164
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

292
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,969
Do you know the seating arrangement?

293
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,870
Please.

294
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,673
-This is it.
-Thank you.

295
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,509
18TH SUMIDA RIVER MARATHON VIP SEATING
CONFIDENTIAL

296
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,978
You're sitting far from the Minister, sir.

297
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,047
Just because I'm far away,
doesn't mean I'm safe!

298
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,482
If she's attacked by
a machine gun or a bomb,

299
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,618
I could become collateral damage.

300
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,787
The MPD will also be at the event.

301
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,256
All attendees will be carefully checked.

302
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,458
Just between us,

303
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,329
I secretly received
the contents of the threatening letter

304
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,965
from Aiko Tachihara's secretary.

305
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,236
I really doubt this was simply a prank.

306
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,105
Even so, the police didn't take
my request seriously.

307
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,208
But they'll use dozens of people
to protect a politician.

308
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:49,248
Just how much in taxes do they think
this company pays to the country?

309
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,949
Don't worry.

310
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,720
Even if the worst happens,
I'll shield you.

311
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,956
I don't want to die!

312
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,960
You'll sacrifice yourself for me, right?

313
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:02,894
That's right.

314
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,364
Mr. Chairman,

315
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,534
I hate to be rude,
but have you thought about

316
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,336
not even going to the venue?

317
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,773
-What?
-You said you don't want to die.

318
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,211
If you don't go, there's no chance
you'll get killed by accident.

319
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
I must go!

320
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,251
The Sumida River Marathon commemorates
the success of our new ramen,

321
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,954
and was the first event we sponsored.

322
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,757
I sponsored it

323
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,561
because I wanted our success
to last long like a marathon.

324
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,030
It has been nearly 20 years.

325
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,633
I've sponsored it during
both good times and bad.

326
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,072
For me and my employees,
the Sumida River Marathon is

327
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,041
a source of moral support.

328
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,944
I understand.

329
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,213
We'll do everything to protect you.

330
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,320
Are you afraid?

331
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,254
What?

332
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,191
Yes, I guess so.

333
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,628
If even this scares you,
then you're unfit to be a bodyguard.

334
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,131
-You think so?
-If you're not ready to die,

335
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,067
then you can't shield the client.

336
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,470
But if the shield dies,
that's not good either.

337
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,971
Don't get smart.

338
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,407
You could get injured if you try too hard.

339
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,909
That's the kind of job this is.

340
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,813
I'm not trying to be smart.
If we bodyguards get hurt,

341
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,082
the client is unprotected.

342
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,417
Isn't that...

343
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,457
the same as running away from a job?

344
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,864
I mean, if we're going to protect
the client, we can't get hurt--

345
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,299
I won't get hurt.

346
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,603
Wow, you have such confidence.

347
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:53,939
That's dangerous.

348
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,942
You're just trying to justify
your cowardice.

349
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,379
No, attackers have a huge advantage
over the protectors.

350
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,383
If a guy points a gun at us,
we're unarmed and totally useless.

351
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,317
Isn't that scary?

352
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,757
What's so funny?

353
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,158
You look good in that pose.

354
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,961
Then be afraid. What do I care?

355
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,829
I'll handle everything.

356
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,166
I can protect him all by myself. Bye.

357
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,370
You're the one who's unfit for this job.

358
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,575
If I'm afraid, therefore,

359
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,045
I'll work out strategies
to avoid any danger.

360
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,481
If you're not afraid,

361
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,619
you could do something desperate.

362
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,523
You see...

363
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,126
I'm afraid to work with someone
who's not afraid.

364
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,502
Hey!

365
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,743
Six of us SP officers
will guard Minister Tachihara.

366
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,146
Venue security will be handled
by the local security bureau,

367
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,049
and 180 Riot Police officers.

368
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,652
This isn't an official function
for the Minister.

369
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,923
Dispatching 180 men
because of a prank? What a joke!

370
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,926
However, no fingerprints were found
on the threatening letter.

371
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,930
It's dangerous to brush this off
as a simple prank.

372
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,533
Let's just go with it.

373
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,839
If the Civil Party owes us a favor,
then it'll make our bosses happy.

374
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,908
Isn't that right, Ochiai?

375
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,710
But if something goes wrong,

376
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,946
we'll all be ruined.

377
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,482
So I'll do my best.

378
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,820
<i>Situation normal.</i>

379
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,022
<i>This has become a real problem.</i>

380
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,659
There's been criticism of
the party leaders as well.

381
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,163
They want us to make you step down
as soon as possible.

382
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,166
Can you go on standby for a while?

383
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,202
We'll be waiting outside.

384
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,746
I'm terribly sorry. I'll settle this soon.

385
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,216
Make sure it's handled
before the next Diet session.

386
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,489
You were a monotone newscaster,
but I backed your political career!

387
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,124
You've put my position in jeopardy!

388
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,629
I understand that this is my last chance.

389
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,497
I've set things in motion.

390
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,903
This is your own responsibility, you know.

391
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,919
<i>I'm Shimazaki
from Hinode Security Service.</i>

392
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,454
<i>This is our security plan
for the Sumida River Marathon.</i>

393
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,355
<i>Let me have a look.</i>

394
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,459
We're guarding the chairman
of the sponsor, Sasuke Foods.

395
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,861
I see.

396
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,604
I'm Ochiai. I'll be in charge of security.

397
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,206
-Let me have a look.
-Yes, sir.

398
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,447
Oh, you're Minister Tachihara's bodyguard.

399
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,450
Have we met before?

400
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,820
Pardon me. I've seen you before.

401
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,758
This isn't your final plan, is it?

402
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,126
No, it is.

403
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,635
Sorry, but could you tell me
what's wrong with it?

404
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,203
Figure it out yourself.

405
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,040
To avoid leaks,
I can't cooperate with private security.

406
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,044
I will say this though.

407
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,448
You do realize you'll be unarmed, right?

408
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,252
Pardon the expression,

409
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,022
but private security is
no better than <i>yojimbo</i> thugs.

410
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:23,642
SUMIDA SPORTS STADIUM

411
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,044
SUMIDA SPORTS STADIUM
GATE CLOSED

412
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,280
SECURITY ROOM

413
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,615
There's nobody here.

414
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,300
Afternoon.

415
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,107
You left it open.

416
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,607
MINISTER'S SEAT

417
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,175
The client's position.

418
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,777
CLIENT POSITION

419
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,112
The meet-up point.

420
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,047
MEET-UP POINT

421
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,448
Gunshots.

422
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,918
<i>If she's attacked by
a machine gun or a bomb,</i>

423
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,820
<i>I could become collateral damage.</i>

424
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,300
GUNMAN
60-DEGREE ANGLE

425
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:33,037
6.6 METERS

426
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,775
11.8 METERS

427
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,877
Less than 12 meters.

428
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,250
In a bombing scenario...

429
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,026
the elevator probably wouldn't work.

430
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,995
BOMB, SERIOUS INJURY, MINOR INJURY

431
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,399
6.6 METERS

432
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,469
A maximum of 20,000 spectators.

433
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,004
8.2 METERS, EXIT

434
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,842
Secure an escape route...

435
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,483
Intruder!

436
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,718
No, I'm not!

437
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm not. Really!

438
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,192
You must realize it's illegal entry
if you don't get permission.

439
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,960
We're in the same business.

440
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,964
But we did mess up
our security procedures as well.

441
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,034
Sorry. I wanted to scout for security.

442
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,735
Just in case, let's see your ID.

443
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,937
I'm really sorry.

444
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,872
-Hurry up.
-Okay. That hurts.

445
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,542
Sorry.

446
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,046
Hey!

447
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,216
Why is this broken?

448
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,386
You poor thing.

449
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,088
It's not funny.

450
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,557
It wasn't easy to scout that place out.

451
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,326
I know. Good work.

452
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,528
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

453
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,066
I'll share this with Takanashi.

454
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,401
Actually...

455
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,539
Takanashi said he wanted to quit.

456
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,907
Quit?

457
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,345
<i>Just this BG assignment, right?</i>

458
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,714
No, the Personal Security Division.

459
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,149
He wants to return
to the Cash Transport Division.

460
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,317
That was sudden.

461
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,921
I tried to persuade him not to.
Not sure if it helped though.

462
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:35,026
Can you be the leader
for this one, Shimazaki?

463
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,195
Okay.

464
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,833
Even after passing that tough training,

465
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,334
he sure...

466
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,337
gave up easily.

467
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,941
He used to be a member
of the Self-Defense Forces.

468
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,277
<i>He had the knowledge and talent.</i>

469
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,046
<i>He was fired up about leading everyone,</i>

470
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,148
<i>but I guess it wasn't what he expected.</i>

471
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,385
<i>Bodyguards seem flashy and cool.</i>

472
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,420
But it's actually quite dull.

473
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,256
There are lots of odd clients too.

474
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,296
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
This is what he wants.

475
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,702
So what did you used to do, Shimazaki?

476
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:18,703
What?

477
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,039
Everyone in our company
used to work elsewhere.

478
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,676
Oh, I should tell you about myself first.

479
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:25,610
It's okay.

480
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,312
I used to be a police officer.

481
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,813
Are you sure it's okay to tell me?

482
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,748
I was a terrible officer.

483
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,718
I was always a burden,
so it became hard to stick around.

484
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,155
My skills were worthless elsewhere,
so I ended up at a security company.

485
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,426
Now, I'm the boss of
the Personal Security Division.

486
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:47,065
When it comes right down to it,
I guess I enjoy protecting people.

487
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,201
-Here.
-Thanks.

488
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,904
I...

489
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,711
used to be a guard
at a different security company.

490
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,281
You seem unusually composed,

491
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,750
so I wondered what you did.

492
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,155
I can tell you used to be a cop.

493
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,091
I feel like I'm being questioned.

494
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,028
I told you,
I was a terrible police officer.

495
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,833
NEW EMAIL FROM SATORU INUKAI
WEEKLY OPINION REPORTER

496
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,037
Thank you. Goodbye.

497
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,605
Goodbye.

498
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:30,742
Here you go.

499
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,111
I'll be waiting outside.

500
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,814
MINISTER AIKO TACHIHARA WILL FIGHT!
(I WON'T RUN AWAY)

501
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,053
I RESPECT AIKO. WELL SAID.
DON'T GIVE IN TO THREATS!

502
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,355
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?
WHAT A JOKE.

503
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,824
<i>Yes.</i>

504
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,192
IS THE THREAT
REALLY DUE TO THE GAFFE?

505
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,796
<i>However, I don't believe
what I said was a gaffe.</i>

506
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,335
<i>Everyone is interpreting my use
of "responsibility" in a bad way.</i>

507
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,270
Hello?

508
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,408
That's quite an impartial article.

509
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,044
I'm glad I trusted you.

510
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,045
But I hope you're all right.

511
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,416
If this provokes the perpetrator
and he attacks you,

512
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,484
then we're partly responsible.

513
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,219
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

514
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,121
That was only a prank.

515
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,024
Can you be so certain?

516
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,025
Yes.

517
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,729
The fact that they used a quote
from Shakespeare

518
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,564
<i>means that they're not serious.</i>

519
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,500
Shakespeare?

520
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,271
You mean the threatening letter?

521
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,541
<i>Since you've been so impartial,
I'll tell you, Mr. Inukai.</i>

522
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,812
It said, "Pride is man's biggest enemy."

523
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,114
<i>What rubbish.</i>

524
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,988
EVENT DAY
JANUARY 21, SUNDAY

525
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,134
Here are the radio codes.

526
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,237
The starting point,
the staff entrance, is P1.

527
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,406
Corridor is P2, backyard is P3.

528
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,274
Memorize the rest.

529
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,911
Shimazaki, the BG, is 01. I'll be 02.

530
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,680
-Okay, I'm 03.
-I'm 04.

531
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,153
Well then...

532
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,957
the estimated attendance
for today's event,

533
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,493
including event coordinators,
is 16,000 people.

534
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,797
Focus on your duty,
and put the client first!

535
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,066
Are you nervous?

536
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,001
-Extremely.
-You're kidding.

537
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,070
That was only a threat.
They'll never attack.

538
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,439
The client is just a rich coward.

539
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,440
Sawaguchi!

540
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,278
What did you learn about what happens
when you assume you're safe in a crisis?

541
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,981
-Normalcy bias.
-That's right!

542
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,750
You could misjudge the danger you face.

543
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,921
-Remember that.
-Okay.

544
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,657
A little nervousness is just right,
within bounds.

545
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,591
Yes, sir.

546
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,329
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

547
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,398
-Synchronized.
-Do your best out there.

548
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:26,217
I'm at the Sumida Sports Park Track.

549
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,654
Minister Tachihara has received threats
regarding her gaffe,

550
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,856
but she's opening the race here today.

551
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,859
The event operators announced

552
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,995
that security would be
greater than at past events.

553
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,499
As you can see, strict checks
of all bags are being conducted.

554
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,903
We all hope that the event ends
without incident.

555
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,405
1. HANDBAG SEARCH
2. METAL DETECTORS

556
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,274
-I have an armband.
-Thank you.

557
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,510
I'll do it myself.

558
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:53,945
Thank you.

559
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,484
Point 6, situation normal.

560
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,853
After the Minister arrives,
we'll let the media in.

561
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,188
Isn't that her?

562
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,357
Here she comes!

563
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,925
You're right!

564
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,032
That's not her.

565
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,867
What a letdown.

566
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,305
You already checked before. Hurry up!

567
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,075
Ishida, there's no point
in arguing with the security.

568
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:30,915
Please.

569
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,250
Is it all right?

570
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,451
Yes.

571
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,422
The chairman has arrived at P1.

572
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,124
Entering Area 2.

573
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,759
<i>This is 02, copy.</i>

574
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,594
This is 03, copy.

575
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,662
I'm counting on you.

576
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,632
-You're sure it's all right?
-Yes.

577
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,866
Are you sure?

578
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,702
We're professionals after all.
Please trust us.

579
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,438
Then you'll block any bullets
from hitting me?

580
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,473
Block bullets?

581
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,775
Being a shield is
a bodyguard's duty, right?

582
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,410
I'm paying you enough!

583
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,315
Mr. Chairman, he's pretty slim,
so the bullets might go through.

584
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,584
Why don't you trust me?

585
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,587
Now that's guts.

586
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,292
No matter what happens, protect me.

587
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,228
We'll keep you alive, Mr. Chairman.
This way.

588
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,130
You lead.

589
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,307
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

590
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,114
We've arrived.

591
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,759
-Is that the Minister?
-It's the Minister!

592
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,263
Why is she waving?

593
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,632
She has no idea what people think of her.

594
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,267
Look at that flashy outfit.

595
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,344
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

596
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,212
No need to bother.

597
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,314
Even with all the uproar,

598
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,483
I appreciate being given
this special task.

599
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,388
Oh, my!

600
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,525
You do this kind of security too?

601
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,527
Do you remember me?

602
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,729
Yes, I remember.

603
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,764
-Thank you for the other day.
-Minister.

604
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,606
We're from Hinode Security Service.

605
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,408
Good to work with you.

606
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,610
Mura.

607
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,278
It's been a while.

608
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,916
Let's work together, even though
you're police and I'm private security.

609
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:48,919
Work together?

610
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,757
I have no intention of
reliving old times here.

611
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,293
Murata used to be an SP.

612
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,163
Only the most talented can become SPs.

613
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,484
What's wrong?

614
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,832
Hello?

615
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,901
It's me, Takanashi.

616
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,536
<i>I'm on guard duty now!</i>

617
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,540
If you're going to make excuses
for dropping out, forget it.

618
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,508
I don't intend to apologize to you.

619
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,146
I've found a disturbing comment
regarding Minister Tachihara.

620
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,481
<i>A comment?</i>

621
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,616
"Aiko Tachihara is a liar."

622
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:57,087
"I'll prove to you that
pride is man's biggest enemy."

623
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,757
What do they mean by "liar"?

624
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,158
<i>I don't know.</i>

625
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,128
<i>The police didn't release
the contents of the threatening letter.</i>

626
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,532
Including us, only a few people know
what the letter said.

627
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,503
That's all.

628
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,271
<i>The race will be starting soon.</i>

629
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:18,008
<i>The stadium is alive
with enthusiasm and anticipation.</i>

630
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,711
<i>Thank you for your patience, everyone.</i>

631
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,780
<i>The race will be starting soon.</i>

632
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,048
"Liar"?

633
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,352
<i>Minister Tachihara will be
entering the field. Stay alert!</i>

634
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,355
<i>Please come to the main gate,
Ms. Tachihara.</i>

635
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,359
<i>It is said that
the first marathon was run by</i>

636
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,896
<i>an ancient Greek soldier
to announce victory in battle.</i>

637
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,032
<i>After running more than 40 kilometers</i>

638
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,535
and arriving at the gates of Athens,

639
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,570
he died.

640
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,875
Yes, a marathon is a strenuous race.

641
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,878
Just like you're taking on
this difficult race,

642
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,748
I have come here with
the same intention of taking on

643
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,383
a difficult challenge.

644
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,920
I take this opportunity to apologize

645
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,525
for the statement that has
caused so much misunderstanding.

646
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:12,897
I also promise to do my utmost
to help Japan.

647
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,238
18TH SUMIDA RIVER METROPOLITAN MARATHON

648
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,713
Now, it's time to begin

649
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,485
the 18th Sumida River
Metropolitan Marathon.

650
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:43,627
18TH SUMIDA RIVER METROPOLITAN MARATHON

651
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,565
The Minister was very brave.

652
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,134
This will improve her approval rating.

653
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,246
She's quite a woman.

654
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,428
Kiyota, the Chief is calling.
Take over here.

655
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,329
Yes, sir.

656
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:19,630
Attention...

657
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,965
Why no report?

658
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,534
Nothing has happened.

659
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,404
Increasing your duties
and running a big-shot site.

660
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,842
It must feel so good, doesn't it?

661
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,878
I should have invited you.

662
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,214
Sorry for being so rude.

663
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,149
Minister.

664
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,031
What's that smoke?

665
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:57,735
Hey!

666
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,270
Stay right here. I'm checking on it.

667
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,207
Hey! Wasn't that a bomb?

668
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,508
It's a bomb!

669
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,943
I'm not staying here!

670
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,211
It's dangerous here!

671
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,379
Run away!

672
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,414
Let's go.

673
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,088
You can't be serious.

674
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,800
Move the Minister from Point 3 to Point 1.

675
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,803
<i>Hurry! Run away!</i>

676
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,572
-Take the Chairman outside!
-This is bad. Everyone's pushing!

677
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,840
How will you protect me?

678
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,710
Mr. Chairman, there's a route out
through the parking garage.

679
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,212
Hey! Aren't you a professional?

680
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,947
You don't need to tell me!

681
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:45,916
Minister, this way!

682
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,317
Minister! Hurry!

683
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,422
Hey! Out of the way!

684
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,024
Out of the way! Minister!

685
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,693
I've lost the Minister!

686
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,362
Mr. Chairman,

687
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,032
you said this marathon was always
a source of moral support.

688
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,867
Yes, I did!

689
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,440
But this is the end of that.

690
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,077
I'll check that there are no more bombs.

691
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,111
Shimazaki!

692
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,914
Use Exit F, then R4 to the first floor,
north side storage.

693
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,084
It's narrow, but Emergency Exit 8
is 25 meters below it.

694
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,085
Yes, sir.

695
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,188
-Okay, Mr. Chairman.
-This way.

696
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,459
Please make way!

697
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,161
Please get out of the way!

698
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,671
Be careful!

699
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,817
What are you doing here?

700
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,321
The SPs are desperately searching for you.

701
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,190
This has nothing to do with you.

702
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,127
I'm sorry if I'm wrong,

703
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,130
but you know something, don't you?

704
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:09,666
Those clothes.

705
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,771
They're not the clothes someone
being threatened and targeted wears.

706
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,973
You make a great target.

707
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,010
Is it possible

708
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,046
that the threatening letter was a fake?

709
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,457
I knew it.

710
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,326
You knew what?

711
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,628
Your backpack.

712
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,830
Where did you put it?

713
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,068
You had one when you came in here.

714
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,880
It's a smoke bomb.
Black backpack, 70 centimeters.

715
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,148
A black backpack?

716
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,918
Did anyone see who brought it in?

717
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,021
My own client is here at this event.

718
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:08,458
If there's another bomb,
then I can't ignore it.

719
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,528
I only asked to interview the Minister.

720
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,798
She came to give me that interview, right?

721
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,604
"You know who wrote
the threatening letter, don't you?"

722
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,841
"I'll be waiting for you
in the training room."

723
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,076
YOU KNOW WHO WROTE
THE THREATENING LETTER, DON'T YOU?

724
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,623
Hey! Where are we going?
I don't want to die!

725
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,158
Then follow us!

726
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,126
Car to P9.

727
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,001
This is 03, the car has arrived.

728
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,569
Minister Tachihara,

729
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:58,942
you used this event as a platform
to restore your popularity, didn't you?

730
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,077
Cut it out.

731
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,411
Get out of my way.

732
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,715
Don't interfere!

733
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,118
Answer my question, Minister.

734
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,025
Get out of here!

735
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,031
-Cut it out!
-Leave me alone!

736
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,466
Don't interfere!

737
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,700
Cut it out!

738
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,035
DANGER, DO NOT SIT ON!

739
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,274
Let's cut this out, all right?

740
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,642
Go!

741
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,514
Go!

742
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,819
I've had it with you!

743
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:46,823
Let go!

744
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,868
Copy, 01, the chairman arrived safely
in the car. Standing by.

745
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,770
Do you copy, 01?

746
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,272
We're standing by!

747
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:13,717
Inukai!

748
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,425
Hands up and step forward!

749
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,501
You should be arresting
the Minister first.

750
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,906
The threatening letter
was written and sent by her.

751
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,609
Don't make things up!

752
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,381
You told me yesterday.

753
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,418
It said, "Pride is man's biggest enemy."

754
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,520
<i>What rubbish.</i>

755
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,290
<i>Don't you remember those words?</i>

756
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,193
It's what I wrote to you

757
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,562
<i>when you became a minister.</i>

758
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,230
In the words of Shakespeare.

759
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:06,536
"To obtain the trust of the people,
you must not have pride."

760
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,638
"Do your best."

761
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,607
"Inukai."

762
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,343
<i>You must have forgotten.</i>

763
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,680
That's why you used them
in your threatening letter, Minister.

764
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,581
Enough!

765
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,816
Do you know why she did that?

766
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,688
She wanted to make a big deal of being
the woman who stands up to threats.

767
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,925
I merely turned her lie into the truth.

768
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,627
I'm not interested in your conjectures.

769
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:32,929
Come on.

770
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,531
Release the Minister.

771
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,533
Minister...

772
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,370
It was me who made her a minister.

773
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:45,042
She gained popularity
thanks to the articles that I wrote.

774
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,411
It was all thanks to me!

775
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:52,349
Can't you say at least
one word of appreciation?

776
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,385
You traitor!

777
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,288
You really must love her.

778
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:00,957
What?

779
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,961
What you're saying makes no sense at all.

780
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,367
But you feel betrayed...

781
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,003
because you expected a lot from her.

782
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,274
You trusted her.

783
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:22,979
Shut up.

784
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:24,948
If you never trusted her...

785
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,119
you never would have been betrayed.

786
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,522
Sad, isn't it?

787
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,941
-Let go!
-Get back!

788
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,714
Let go! I have the duty
to report this as a journalist!

789
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,788
What a crazy fabrication!

790
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,857
You're no journalist.

791
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,159
You're just too full of yourself!

792
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,981
Here.

793
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,052
Why were you here?

794
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,789
Sorry. I got lost.

795
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,694
The event can continue now.

796
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,863
Excuse me.

797
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,677
Did that bodyguard do that on purpose?

798
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,715
Do what on purpose?

799
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,019
Nothing.

800
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:14,291
If there's anything you want to ask,
I'll answer all your questions.

801
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,661
There were no other bombs.
I'm returning now.

802
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:21,998
Hold it right there.

803
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,605
This is a request from
the MPD Security Police.

804
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,543
What you just overheard
regarding Minister Tachihara

805
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,079
must be kept secret
to protect her privacy.

806
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,380
Yes, I understand.

807
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,381
Also...

808
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,988
I'm against private personal security.

809
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,159
Money won't protect people.

810
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,896
This is no place for <i>yojimbo</i> thugs.

811
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,035
Do you know what "<i>yojimbo</i>" means?

812
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,607
Originally,

813
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,777
it didn't mean a tough guy
the mafia or samurai hired

814
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,380
to kill their enemies.

815
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,689
A pole that's used to
protect yourself from enemies...

816
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,492
is called a <i>yojimbo</i>.

817
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:27,030
-So what?
-If you hadn't drawn your guns,

818
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,701
I doubt he would have pulled a knife.

819
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:39,276
Even though I'm an unarmed bodyguard...

820
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,114
No, the fact that I'm an unarmed bodyguard

821
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,049
means I can offer proper protection.

822
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,823
It must be nice.

823
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,260
You private guards can say
whatever you like.

824
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,799
Sorry. That was pompous of me.

825
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,067
Excuse me.

-Mr. Chairman.

830
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,561
For a moment,
I wasn't sure it would be okay.

831
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,863
But all's well that ends well.

832
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,498
Thank you.

833
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,535
I heard the newbie played
an important role.

834
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,502
Not at all.

835
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:44,407
Imazeki, he's still got room
to improve as a bodyguard.

836
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:50,246
He ran off looking for a bomb,
but ends up tripping and getting hurt.

837
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,614
I'm very sorry.

838
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,419
But I was reminded of...

839
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,424
when I first decided
to sponsor the marathon.

840
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:07,030
I was running around desperately then
just as much as you were.

841
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,234
I had no regrets. I was prepared to die.

No problem. Not at all.

-That's all.
-<i>I have something to tell you too.</i>

857
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,161
I quit because I didn't want
to be partnered with you.

858
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,169
Not with a liar like you.

There.

How is it, being a bodyguard?

Well...

872
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,654
It's cooler than waving a traffic wand.

873
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,590
I'm not so sure...

874
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,026
I'm sore all over.
