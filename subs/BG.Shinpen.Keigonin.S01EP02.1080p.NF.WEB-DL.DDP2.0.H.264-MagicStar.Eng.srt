1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,379
It's all over!

2
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,150
It's my punishment for buying these shoes.

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,522
You're not going home barefoot.

4
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,217
<i>This is a special report.</i>

5
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:55,422
<i>The decision regarding the 2011 murder
at the Akabane Nursing Home</i>

6
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,790
<i>will be coming down this Thursday.</i>

7
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,292
Straighten up your shoes.
The entry hall isn't that big.

8
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>The former nurse, Yaeko Matsukawa,
is charged with the 2011 murder</i>

9
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,399
<i>of two nursing home residents...</i>

10
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,870
-I can't wake up unless I watch Shiori.
-<i>aged 82 and 89.</i>

11
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>Until now...</i>

12
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,706
Isn't she too old for you?

13
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,876
<i>...the prosecution
has requested the death penalty</i>

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,512
<i>due to the cruel and brutal nature
of the crime,</i>

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>and there's no possibility of reform.</i>

16
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,750
Why are you cleaning up?
Are you leaving or something?

17
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,187
If you don't clean up, we'll get C.

18
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,256
-What?
-What's "C"?

19
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,491
Cockroaches.

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,587
<i>At her first trial, the former nurse,
Yaeko Matsukawa,</i>

21
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>received the death penalty.</i>

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:07,627
<i>At her appeal in the High Court,
new evidence from the defense was allowed,</i>

23
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,629
<i>so there is talk that the death penalty</i>

24
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,366
<i>and even the conviction itself
could be overturned.</i>

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,835
-<i>There's sure to be repercussions.</i>
-Innocent? Wow.

26
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,338
<i>If she is ruled innocent.</i>

27
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,441
<i>Yes. Considering the feelings
of the victims' families,</i>

28
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,778
<i>there's no escaping the fact that
the accused took two lives.</i>

29
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,616
<i>But this judge
is a defender of human rights.</i>

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,619
<i>In all his cases until now,
he has never sentenced...</i>

31
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,287
-Stop it there.
-Yes, sir.

32
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,524
This is our client.

33
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,860
A judge?

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,128
TATSUO YUKINAGA
PRESIDING JUDGE

35
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,365
<i>Before dawn today,
a fire was set in front of the house</i>

36
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,335
<i>of the judge for this case,
Tatsuo Yukinaga.</i>

37
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,437
What's wrong?

38
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,414
<i>At present, the police are
considering this a threat</i>

39
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,484
<i>regarding the decision
in the case this week.</i>

40
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>They believe there could be
more threats or even attacks,</i>

41
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,658
so the MPD has assigned the SP
to guard Judge Yukinaga.

42
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,928
However, his family won't be
under the protection of the SP.

43
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:20,533
Therefore, Mr. Yukinaga himself
requested personal security for his wife.

44
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,802
-The bicycle's burned to a crisp.
-We took the job?

45
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,904
The death penalty is involved.
This could be dangerous.

46
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,906
That's why he hired us, right?

47
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,742
We'll be working with the SP, won't we?

48
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,910
What a pain.

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,948
The risk for this is Level 3.
We're getting special pay.

50
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,749
I'll do it!

51
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,785
-Will you be BG, Suganuma--
-I'll do it!

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,456
As for backup...

53
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,361
can you do it, Shimazaki?

54
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,862
All right.

55
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,665
-Backup...
-Can you do it?

56
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,666
What?

57
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,202
This serious stuff is the kind of thing
Takanashi should do.

58
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,438
No way.
He's better at hauling money around.

59
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,274
Don't worry.
I have a lot of years under my belt.

60
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,775
That works against you.

61
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,110
What? I'll do it.

62
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,080
JUNYA, MVP THREE YEARS IN A ROW!

63
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,853
JUNYA, MVP THREE YEARS IN A ROW!

64
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,526
Why are you hiding this,

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,095
old man?

66
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,529

YUKINAGA

68
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,577
We're from Hinode Security Service.

69
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,445
Visitors from Hinode Security Service.

70
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,414
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

71
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:42,749
I'm Suganuma.

72
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,718
I'm Shimazaki.

73
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:48,988
Come in.

74
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,998
YOSHIAKI OCHIAI
SECURITY BUREAU (SP), MPD

75
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello.

76
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,537
These are your bodyguards.

77
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,174
I've asked them to protect you
24 hours a day.

78
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,446
I don't need it.

79
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,949
I'm Suganuma from Hinode Security Service.

80
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,751
I'll be your personal bodyguard.

81
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,454
Since we're both women,
please speak freely with me.

82
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,991
I'm Shimazaki. I'll be working backup.

83
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,962
I told him that bodyguards for me
are a waste.

84
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,566
I mean, it's you they're after.

85
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,535
Since your husband is a target,

86
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,204
it's quite possible that
you could be in danger as well.

87
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,174
You're blowing this out of proportion.

88
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,081
Excuse me, but was it only
your bicycle that was burned?

89
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,315
Yes.

90
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,752
<i>Then it must be a threat
to influence the ruling in the case.</i>

91
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,688
In court, I've received
many messages telling me

92
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,459
not to overturn the death penalty
and to pass a guilty sentence.

93
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,630
But nobody should know
where your home is, right?

94
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:09,235
Yes. Since we moved here three years ago,
this is the first time this has happened.

95
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,238
You're awfully zealous.

96
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,273
You're not police investigators.

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,079
You don't have the weapons
to subdue the perpetrator.

98
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,315
If anything happens,
please don't do anything stupid,

99
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,217
and contact the police.

100
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,587
What? Is that true?

101
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,523
You're bodyguards
but you don't carry guns?

102
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,125
Don't worry.

103
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,193
We've been trained to handle anything.

104
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,294
Hold on here.

105
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,865
That means you're just ordinary people.

106
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,802
But you're still charging
expensive bodyguard fees?

107
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,005
Actually, I think it's pretty reasonable.

108
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,709
It's not actually guns that
protect people.

109
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,979
What? Then what will you use
to protect me?

110
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,817
Don't try to tell me
that you'll use courage.

111
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,293
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

112
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,399
Okay, see you later.

113
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,502
See you. Take care.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,538
You take care too, dear.

115
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,341
Please take care of my wife.

116
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,379
Never leave her side,
and stay with her wherever she goes.

117
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,780
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,483
We'll never leave her side,
and stay with her wherever she goes.

119
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,449
Keep your guard up.

120
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,418
-Roger.
-Roger.

121
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,672
Excuse me.
I'm going to close the curtains.

122
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,115
I'm going to hide the knives just in case.

123
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,457
The SP and bodyguards
are like chalk and cheese.

124
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,026
Which one is the cheese?

125
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,961
I mean, this is just crazy.

126
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,664
How come only my husband gets SP?

127
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,467
They look so tough and have guns.

128
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,735
But you're just...

129
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,539
In the US, the First Lady is always
guarded by the Secret Service.

130
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,442
In Japan, the Prime Minister's wife
doesn't always get SP.

131
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,213
He pays private companies like ours
to protect her.

132
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,584
Okay, could you please wash the dishes?

133
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,252
Excuse me?

134
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,355
I was too exhausted from the commotion
over the fire to do them.

135
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,093
You there.
Could you clean up the entrance?

136
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:23,863
Clean up?

137
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,998
After that fire,
it's dangerous to leave it as it is.

138
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,367
Certainly.

139
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,703
Are you kidding? What?

140
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,523
NEW CONDOMINIUM SHOWROOM OPEN!

<i>Since we moved here three years ago,
this is the first time this has happened.</i>

142
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,286
I've finished cleaning the entrance.

143
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,491
Next, you clean the bath,
and you the toilet.

144
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,127
I'm going to do some shopping.

145
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,628
Shopping?

146
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,564
Your husband is about to make
his decision on the case.

147
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,069
That's exactly why.
Every time I turn on the TV,

148
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,738
it's all about
what my husband's decision will be.

149
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,608
If I don't do something to escape,
I'll suffocate.

150
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,776
Understood.

151
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,979
However, if you're going out,
we'll be coming with you.

152
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:21,981
Here.

153
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,917
Go ahead.

154
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,693
For this morning, there's a larceny case
and a molestation case.

155
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,697
I'll put one man in the gallery,
and one each at the front and back doors.

156
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,964
Good. Proceed.

157
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,501
I'll return home in the afternoon
to prepare the decision in question.

158
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,503
You seem to be very calm.

159
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,539
All cases are equal in the court.

160
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,842
No matter the criticism,
I must remain imperturbable.

161
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,043
Very admirable.

162
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,611
You're Judge Yukinaga, aren't you?

163
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,880
Excuse me...

164
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,749
Don't you dare exonerate that woman!

165
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,452
The new evidence is all lies!

166
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,456
Let go of me! Protecting a murderer
makes you a murderer too!

167
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,761
How dare you look so indifferent!

168
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,530
You don't know anything!

169
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,700
You don't have the right to pass judgment!

170
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,453
You look lovely, madam.
They suit you so well!

171
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,757
Dear me, really?

172
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,194
It's a total flattery.

173
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,533
Where is she going to wear those?

174
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,371
Women are satisfied by just owning them.

175
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,343
I'll take them.
I've had my eye on them for a while.

176
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,545
As always, thank you for coming.

177
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,749
"As always"?

178
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,658
JUDGE INQUIRY
TATSUO YUKINAGA

179
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,592
<i>Yes?</i>

180
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,494
Mr. Yukinaga was attacked
at the courthouse.

181
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,329
Was he hurt?

182
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,231
<i>He had SP guarding him. He's uninjured.</i>

183
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,735
<i>The culprit was a woman.
The police are investigating her now.</i>

184
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,736
Roger.

185
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,338
Let me know right away
if she's the arsonist.

186
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,374
She's still shopping now.

187
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,114
Shopping with the money
her husband makes in his tough job?

188
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,749
She's got a lot of nerve.

189
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,551
You're so young.

190
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,153
Oh, is your wife the same, sir?

191
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,421
What?

192
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,792
That's none of your business!
Keep your eye on the GPS!

193
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,793
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,398
Hurry up and find a replacement
for Mr. Takanashi.

195
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,200
We'll be shorthanded if he's not replaced.

196
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,548
Get in and lock up.

197
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,458
There's nobody there.
He must be imagining things.

198
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,294
Our job is to avoid a crisis
before it happens.

199
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,399
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,175
Sorry. I was mistaken.

201
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,412
It's like you're playing bodyguards.

202
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,416
Whatever. Take me to Seijo Higashi next.

203
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,585
What? You want to go somewhere else?

204
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,521
-We're late already. Hurry up.
-Certainly. Let's go.

205
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,190
Got it.

206
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,539
The woman from the attack earlier
is the daughter of one of the victims.

207
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,409
I see.

208
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,445
She was living in Taiwan for her job.

209
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,748
She hasn't been
at the courthouse until now.

210
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,784
When she heard that
the verdict could be innocent,

211
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,187
she couldn't wait and returned
on a flight this morning.

212
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,158
Which means she didn't start the fire
at your home.

213
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,993
It must be someone else.

214
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,864
It's part of a judge's job
to be the object of grudges.

215
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,502
The jury system was implemented
to include the views of ordinary people,

216
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,571
but some people still find it hard
to understand legal thinking.

217
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,910
It's time to begin.

218
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,148
I'll contact HQ.
Stay alert in the gallery.

219
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,082
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,293
INFORMATION
12:03 P.M. RECORDED MESSAGE FROM (1101)

221
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,965
Ochiai here. You called?

222
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,634
Can't you guard me?

223
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,670
How come a judge gets priority over me?

224
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,073
They're not usually put under guard.

225
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,408
<i>It's an urgent request from
the Commissioner-General of the NPA.</i>

226
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,610
<i>I'm not your personal guard.</i>

227
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,947
<i>If you need something,
please ask your assigned SP, Kiyota.</i>

228
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,450
I'm sorry, but that man is...

229
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,753
<i>He's an excellent shot
and an expert in</i> jukendo.

230
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,189
<i>He's the perfect SP to protect you.</i>

231
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,124
I understand that, but...

232
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,593
I think he still holds a grudge
against me.

233
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,562
<i>He always looks so serious.</i>

234
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,998
<i>Out of the way!</i>

235
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,799
You're imagining things.

236
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,603
An SP does not hold grudges
against the people they protect.

237
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,272
<i>Even if it was your actions
that caused trouble,</i>

238
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,274
the responsibility lies
entirely with the SP.

239
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,743
You're giving me lip service again?

240
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,946
<i>All humans have emotions, right?</i>

241
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,984
This is a serious SOS
I'm sending you, Mr. Ochiai.

242
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,187
<i>Be careful about what you say.</i>

243
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,155
Excuse me.

244
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,959
<i>It's best to assume that someone
is always listening to your calls.</i>

245
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,530
Oh, my! What would I do
if the FBI was listening in?

246
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,799
<i>What could I say
that would make them happy?</i>

247
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,635
<i>I can't continue
this private conversation any longer.</i>

248
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,738
<i>It's my duty to my country to protect you.</i>

249
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,206
Is that so?

250
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:27,546
Then maybe I'll open my own purse,
and hire a private bodyguard.

251
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,081
I know!

252
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,551
How about that man who got beaten up?

253
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,820
<i>He was an interesting man.</i>

254
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,822
The event can continue now.

255
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,294
You're an important person.
A private guard can't protect you.

256
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,896
Goodbye.

257
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,007
Okay,

258
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,111
let's give you a light touch
around your face...

259
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,190
Do you really need to visit
the beauty salon now?

260
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,625
I already had a reservation for a haircut.

261
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,296
-Take your time.
-Thank you.

262
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,843
What do you mean by saying,
"Take your time"?

263
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:32,811
What?

264
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,782
We'll get tired if we have to
hang out here for a long time.

265
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,384
We have to stand outside
in the cold, you know.

266
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,457
But Mr. Yukinaga told us to
never leave his wife's side

267
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,494
and stay with her wherever she goes.

268
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,532
I mean that we don't have to
let her order us around like this.

269
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,301
But those are our orders, you know.

270
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes, that's true,
but do we have to obey all orders?

271
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,742
Use your head!

272
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,311
We have to protect that woman, you know!

273
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,315
If anything happens, I'm BG,
so it's my responsibility.

274
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,620
Then can I ask you a question, Ms. BG?

275
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,790
Do you think she really wanted
to get a haircut?

276
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,327
She's looking for her chance to be alone.

277
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,964
It makes me think that
she has another purpose

278
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,001
for going shopping
and to the beauty salon.

279
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,670
Another purpose?

280
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,549
CASH TRANSPORT DIVISION

281
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,624
What do you want?

282
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,993
Well...

283
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,530
we got a tough assignment today,

284
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,966
so I wanted to have
a drink with you later.

285
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,301
Tell me now.

286
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,336
What?

287
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,405
Men our age

288
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,374
don't go drinking together
without anything to talk about.

289
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,149
I thought it was a waste to
let you just quit like this.

290
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,989
Will you please come back?
I'll clear it with personnel.

291
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,091
I'm taking spot assignments
transporting money now.

292
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,160
At least tell me why you quit.

293
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,064
I mean, you requested to work in
the Personal Security Division.

294
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,502
Thank you.

295
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,548
What other purposes would she have?

296
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,719
Wasting money to relieve stress?

297
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,821
No.

298
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,324
She just wants to cause us trouble?

299
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,160
No.

300
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,363
Then what is it?

301
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,666
I don't know.

302
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,168
Then quit talking about it.

303
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,505
She's an ordinary housewife,
not the kind that has secrets.

304
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,378
Oh, no! She's gone!

305
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,783
Here she is.

306
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,818
-Madam.
-What?

307
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,320
The car is this way.

308
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,992
You can't go off without saying anything
while we're guarding you.

309
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,461
I thought you were on a tea break.

310
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,696
We don't drink anything.

311
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,531
We'll have to use the restroom if we do.

312
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,302
Really? I guess it's tough
being a bodyguard.

313
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,739
But it doesn't compare to
the hardship of being a judge.

314
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,109
Your husband does admirable work.

315
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,879
I'm not so sure about that.

316
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,949
Being a judge is very confining.

317
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,951
"Confining"?

318
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,925
When there are no cases,
he does research all day long at home.

319
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,994
I wouldn't mind if he were handsome,

320
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,864
but it's confining having that
dull-faced old man at home all day.

321
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,535
Anyway...

322
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,737
Where to now?

323
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,105
Hey.

324
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,111
Can't you leave me alone for an hour?
I want to meet someone.

325
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,284
Could you tell us who that would be?

326
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,832
I'm not obligated to tell you, am I?

327
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,235
You may be my bodyguards,
but we just met today.

328
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,337
How can I trust you so soon?

329
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,243
You can't tell us anything
about this person?

330
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,279
There's nothing fishy about it.

331
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,982
It's a salesman for Yokotetsu Real Estate.

332
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,618
"Salesman" means it's a man, right?

333
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,520
What kind of question is that?

334
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,462
Is that him?

335
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,731
He's certainly young.

336
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,700
Quit imagining things!

337
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,504
I want to move to a condo in town,
so I'm consulting with him.

338
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,073
Mr. Mikami is a newlywed with a baby.

339
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,246
This was her purpose.

340
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,215
A typical younger man.
A typical handsome face.

341
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,784
How unoriginal.

342
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,386
She doesn't think of him
as just a salesman.

343
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,922
She thinks she has a chance with him.

344
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,924
How disgusting.

345
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,593
Hey, where did it go?

346
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,498
-What? The cheating wife is right there.
-No, there's something else missing.

347
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,071
The bag with the shoes is gone.

348
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,173
That's right.

349
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,443
<i>She had it with her
when she went into the beauty salon.</i>

350
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,612
She probably forgot it
at the beauty salon reception desk.

351
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,880
Forgot it?

352
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,249
Would she forget that?

353
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,832
What's going on? Did they break up?

354
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,241
<i>Don't you think it's time to return home?</i>

355
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,543
I still have shopping to do.

356
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,081
Is something wrong, madam?

357
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,883
What?

358
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,551
Aren't you feeling well?

359
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,154
I'm just fine.

360
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,590
We're your bodyguards, madam.

361
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,459
If you're having any problems,
please tell us.

362
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,394
I told you there's nothing wrong!

363
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,533
I don't mean to intrude,

364
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,937
but was there some trouble
between you and that real estate salesman?

365
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,608
If you think so, then keep quiet!

366
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,575
Hey.

367
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,513
Your husband has asked us
to protect you, madam.

368
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,881
Leave me alone, would you?

369
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,217
They're after my husband, not me.

370
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,752
It has nothing to do with me.

371
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,821
But in the fire at your house...

372
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,324
it was the bicycle that was burned.

373
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,760
That was yours, wasn't it, madam?

374
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,463
I've had enough of you! Leave me be!

375
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,732
I don't want to see you anymore!

376
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,735
You're fired!

377
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,777
I'd like to speak to Mr. Yukinaga.

378
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,579
He's working in his study.

379
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,416
-I have something to report.
-What is it? I'll tell him.

380
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:57,122
He's our client.
Allow me to speak to him directly.

381
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,423
I can't allow that.

382
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,358
For security reasons.

383
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,826
What's going on?

384
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,732
Do you have time, sir?

385
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,675
Excuse me.

386
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,911
I'm Sawaguchi. I'm replacing Shimazaki.

387
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:21,980
Hello.

388
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,816
You look much more trustworthy
than the last guy.

389
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,551
Like an SP.

390
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,853
Seriously? Thank you.

391
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,524
She's making fun of us. You're so vain.

392
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,460
<i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

393
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,863
Your wife fired me.

394
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,167
She fired you? Why?

395
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,538
I put her in a bad mood.

396
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,275
Tell me in detail what happened.

397
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,611
Actually...

398
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,580
What's wrong?

399
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,817
You have an obligation to give
a detailed report to the client.

400
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,287
Yes, sir.

401
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,084
Basically, after my wife met
that real estate salesman,

402
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,153
she started acting strange?

403
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,455
That's right.

404
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,292
I see. I wonder why.

405
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,531
May I ask you a question?

406
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,533
Anything you like.

407
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,403
Is it possible

408
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,006
that it's not you they're after,
but your wife?

409
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,676
My wife? How could that be?

410
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,412
It was your wife's bicycle
that was set on fire.

411
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,913
<i>That bothers me.</i>

412
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,548
It was in front of my house. That's why.

413
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,551
She's a simple housewife.
She has few friends.

414
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,287
She doesn't know anyone
who would hold a grudge against her.

415
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,190
Do you have proof of your suspicions?

416
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,825
No, I don't have proof.

417
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,728
I'm sorry I was of no help.

418
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,532
The replacement bodyguard
will protect her well.

419
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,235
How old was the man?

420
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,406
He must have a family as well.

421
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,145
I noticed my wife was meeting a man
who I don't know.

422
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,915
Tell me exactly what happened.
I don't mind.

423
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,759
I apologize if I'm mistaken.

424
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,729
Does that mean

425
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,499
you hired bodyguards
because you wanted to know

426
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,535
if she was having an affair,
or what she was doing?

427
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,540
I don't need to tell you my reasons.

428
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,676
But you're deceiving your wife.

429
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,750
Sorry. That was out of line.

430
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,153
A judge must determine
whether people live or die.

431
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,924
Not only me but my family too
must live ethical and proper lives.

432
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,361
That's because nobody will trust
the decisions of a judge

433
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,363
whose private life is in shambles.

434
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,366
Do you understand?

435
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,335
As a judge,

436
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:34,339
I can't ask a detective agency
to investigate my wife.

437
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,710
Being a judge is very confining.

438
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,148
That's very confining.

439
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,819
It's not out of jealousy as a husband,

440
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,121
but out of duty as a judge

441
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,324
that you're investigating your wife.

442
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,828
If my mind is disturbed
because my wife is having an affair,

443
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,364
I can't pass judgment on people.

444
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,205
The man who met your wife was

445
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,508
<i>a Mr. Mikami from Yokotetsu Real Estate.</i>

446
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,677
<i>He was probably in his early 30s.</i>

447
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,814
I found this in the trash.

448
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,485
I was wondering why you had it
since you had such a new home.

449
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,187
YOKOTETSU REAL ESTATE
AGENT: YUSAKU MIKAMI

450
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,656
"Yusaku Mikami"?

451
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,157
What's the matter?

452
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,293
Well...

453
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,362
It seems like I've heard this name before.

454
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,797
Could it be that

455
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,000
he has something to do
with the nursing home murders?

456
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,006
I'll check into it myself.

457
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,211
If this man has anything to do
with tomorrow's case,

458
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,645
we'll need to act immediately.

459
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,316
Depending on what it is,
the decision might have to be postponed.

460
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,785
Considering the notifications
that have to be made,

461
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,654
the deadline is 7:00 p.m.

462
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,957
Bring back my wife by 7:00 p.m.

463
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,159
Understood.

464
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,327
However,

465
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,730
don't you dare tell the police about this.

466
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,633
Is that for the court too?

467
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,170
Of course. If the police act on it,
it'll cause an uproar.

468
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,240
Understood.

469
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,342
That's bad.

470
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,646
If this Mikami guy is related
to the nursing home murders,

471
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,714
then there will be trouble.

472
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,885
We need to inform the police
about this immediately.

473
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,153
I understand that this is a big problem,

474
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,823
but Mr. Yukinaga doesn't want us
to inform them.

475
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,325
But this isn't something
we can keep hidden from them.

476
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,697
But our client isn't the police.
It's Judge Yukinaga.

477
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,299
BEAUTY SALON ENTRANCE

478
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,535
If we tell them secretly,
we'll betray him.

479
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,703
ALTERNATE EXIT, ELEVATOR

480
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,606
I'll look into this first.

481
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,109
I appreciate it.

482
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,483
INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT

483
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,252
This and this.

484
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,757
Don't you think it's about time
you went back home?

485
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,526
You need to get dinner ready, right?

486
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,796
-I guess so.
-Yes, that's right.

487
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,633
It hurts!

488
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,901
Are you okay, madam?

489
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,202
Don't touch me!

490
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,071
Help me!

491
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,940
What's wrong?

492
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,342
-She just started saying, "It hurts."
-Who are you?

493
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,543
We're not involved.

494
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,211
-I mean, we are.
-What's going on?

495
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,746
Hold on a second.

496
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,450
Here's our ID.
We're not doing anything suspicious.

497
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,985
It's all right.

498
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,455
What?

499
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,162
-Madam!
-Oh, no!

500
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,463
-Look for her!
-Okay!

501
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,631
Mrs. Yukinaga!

502
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,038
What's wrong?

503
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,676
AS FOR THE ERRONEOUS
DETERMINATION OF FACTS...

504
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,312
I'm working.

505
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,157
I'm sorry to bother you
while you're working.

506
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,993
Has something happened to your wife?

507
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,928
No.

508
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,965
Why did that bodyguard come here earlier?

509
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:26,004
He reported on her security.
There's no need to worry.

510
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,674
I'll ask you again.

511
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,010
Has something happened to your wife?

512
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,816
We at the SP are risking our lives
to protect you, Your Honor.

513
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,186
Do you trust a private company
working for money more than us?

514
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,688
Think it over carefully.

515
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,923
I have an important decision
to give tomorrow.

516
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,759
Please wait downstairs.

517
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,634
She won't answer her phone.

518
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,105
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,008
I let my guard down.

520
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,648
If anything happens...

521
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,385
I'll take responsibility.

522
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,087
You can't take responsibility. I will.

523
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,789
You can't take responsibility!

524
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,661
For us bodyguards,
once we've made a mistake...

525
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,167
<i>we'll be forced out of the business.</i>

526
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,803
There's an international blacklist.

527
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,906
You're kidding!

528
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,841
But we haven't failed yet.

529
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,578
That's right. We just need to
bring her back safely by 7:00 p.m.

530
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,115
BG...

531
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,417
give us orders.

532
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,157
We'll separate and search.

533
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,993
We'll find her and bring her back.

534
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,997
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

535
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:00,998
Synchronized.

536
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:18,316
REGALO SEIJO
FREEDOM TRUNK ROOM

537
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,486
Shimazaki here.

538
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,456
I just got details on Yusaku Mikami.

539
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,757
<i>Go ahead.</i>

540
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:31,295
First of all, he's lying about
being married and having a child.

541
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,898
<i>Why would he lie about that?</i>

542
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,468
<i>Listen carefully, Shimazaki.</i>

543
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,367
Mrs. Yukinaga,
this is the bodyguard Shimazaki.

544
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,270
I fired you!

545
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,873
Yes, but your husband asked me
to protect you.

546
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,144
Is that all you have to say?

547
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,113
That's my job.

548
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,251
How did you find me here?

549
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,358
The bag with the shoes you bought
disappeared while you were here.

550
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,197
Also, it sounded like you've been
to that store many times,

551
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,500
but there were no expensive shoes
at your home.

552
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,670
FROM: GORO MURATA
I FOUND HER SAFE AT REGALO SEIJO

553
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,547
She's okay!

554
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,982
IT'S SHIMAZAKI.
SHE'S SAFE. REGALO SEIJO

555
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,020
IT'S SHIMAZAKI.
SHE'S SAFE. REGALO SEIJO

556
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,998
I secretly started renting this place
three months ago.

557
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,902
It's 18,000 yen a month.

558
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,105
It's only a two-mat room, but...

559
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,542
I keep the things I secretly buy here.

560
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,777
And sit alone quietly here.

561
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,350
This is the only place you have
that's not confining.

562
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,752
Your husband said...

563
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:41,259
that the family of a judge
must live a proper life.

564
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,895
That's right.

565
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,499
"It's all over if you commit a crime."

566
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,835
"Don't complain about the neighbors."

567
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,005
"Always talk pleasantly with them."

568
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,941
"Keep the TV and radio volume low."

569
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,209
"Don't order out."

570
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
"Don't be extravagant.
Don't wear flashy clothes."

571
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,881
I wouldn't even last a day.

572
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,950
But my husband...

573
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,254
doesn't complain at all
when he's criticized.

574
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,256
He doesn't get angry or whine.

575
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:18,229
I'm not a great person like my husband is.

576
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,999
I wanted a place to escape to.

577
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,102
So that's why you got this place?

578
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,174
Mr. Mikami told me about it.

579
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,978
His company runs it.

580
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,582
Thanks to him, I can spend time
not being a judge's wife.

581
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,688
Let's go.

582
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,159
Let's go home. Your husband is worried.

583
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,569
I can't go back.

584
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,742
BUILDING CLOSED

585
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,478
REGALO SEIJO

586
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,455
Why are you here, Takanashi?

587
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,624
I think I should tell you why I quit
the Personal Security Division.

588
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,327
Is there some trouble?

589
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,165
We should probably inform
the police, but...

590
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,537
we'll end up exposing
the client's secrets to them.

591
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,673
I'm thinking about what to do.

592
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,007
SHIMAZAKI: GUARD MRS. ASAMI YUKINAGA

593
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,110
Shimazaki told you
not to tell the police, didn't he?

594
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,714
-That was a good guess.
-It's something he would say.

595
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,718
-As a bodyguard, he's right.
-I think he's wrong.

596
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,322
If the client told us to
stand on our heads, would we?

597
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,857
Would we dance naked?

598
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,660
-That's not...
-It's the same thing!

599
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,065
Don't let that man control you, sir.

600
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,957
We keep on meeting.

601
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,030
I have important information
regarding Asami Yukinaga.

602
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,574
I'm terribly sorry
for losing sight of your wife.

603
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,279
We've found her,
so I promise we'll bring her back.

604
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,114
It's all right.

605
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,018
But why would my wife go there?

606
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,158
I just informed the proper authorities.

607
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,865
It was Yusaku Mikami who set the fire.

608
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,801
He met with your wife before.

609
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,771
He's a member of the victim's family

610
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,340
in a case you decided
a year ago, Your Honor.

611
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,609
A year ago?

612
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,878
A stalker case in Fuchu.

613
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,113
Do you remember it now?

614
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,782
Yes, I remember.

615
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,617
I will now read the verdict.

616
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:30,454
<i>An ex-boyfriend found out
where the victim had moved to.</i>

617
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,357
<i>Based on a precedent,
I gave a suspended sentence.</i>

618
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,460
<i>I believe the victim was Kanako Otani.</i>

619
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,864
<i>She was engaged at the time.</i>

620
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,765
<i>She got married after the case,</i>

621
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,069
but she was haunted by the fear
that the stalker would come back,

622
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,973
and she killed herself six months ago.

623
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,543
Apparently, she was pregnant.

624
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,113
And the woman was...

625
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,815
That's right.

626
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,085
She was married to Yusaku Mikami.

627
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,154
It wasn't a threat against
tomorrow's decision.

628
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,523
The opposite, in fact.

629
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,859
It was resentment against a past judgment.

630
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,564
It was Mr. Mikami who set the fire.

631
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,832
<i>If your husband dies,</i>

632
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,167
you'll be mine, Asami.

633
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,271
I'm the one who set your bicycle on fire.

634
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,543
I've always ridden an old bicycle

635
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,578
to go do my shopping.

636
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,747
When we were newlyweds,

637
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,416
<i>my husband often took me
shopping in the car.</i>

638
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,520
<i>But he said a judge can't get into
an accident, so we sold the car.</i>

639
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,990
<i>My bicycle was
a symbol of my confined life.</i>

640
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,893
<i>I complained to Mr. Mikami about it.</i>

641
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,830
<i>So when I saw the bicycle burning,</i>

642
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,366
<i>I thought it might be him.</i>

643
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,603
But there's nothing between us.

644
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,374
He was kind, and I liked
that he listened to me, but...

645
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,543
we only had tea together.

646
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,047
Then you can still go back home.

647
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,553
Wear this with pride,
and let's go back home.

648
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,993
What will I say to my husband?

649
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,294
Let's hurry.

650
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,196
It's too dangerous here.

651
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,899
-Dangerous?
-Mikami...

652
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,301
lied to you.

653
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,106
He doesn't have a wife or child.

654
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,375
They're dead.

655
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,112
What do you mean?

656
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,414
He is...

657
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:43,420
the husband of the victim
in a case your husband ruled on.

658
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm sure he approached you
knowing exactly who you were.

659
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,781
Oh, wait!

660
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,617
Oh, dear.

661
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:15,619
Oh, my!

662
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,921
-Excuse me.
-Hey! What are you doing?

663
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,668
8F ELEVATOR HALL

664
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,770
There's a car waiting out front.

665
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:39,543
Get in.

666
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,200
<i>The elevator isn't broken.</i>

667
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,835
What?

668
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>I control where that elevator goes.</i>

669
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:13,677
Nobody else...

670
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,580
can get inside this building.

671
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,584
<i>I'm sorry, but you're going to die, Asami.</i>

672
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,190
Are you crazy?
She has nothing to do with this!

673
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,791
<i>Yes, she does.</i>

674
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,593
My wife died!

675
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,761
Open these doors.

676
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,297
<i>You'll become a criminal.</i>

677
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,666
There's something I want to test.

678
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,404
Can a judge make a calm decision
when it's his own wife who has died?

679
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,246
EMERGENCY DESCENT

680
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,614

683
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,233
What? That's odd. It's locked.

684
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,002
-Find another entrance.
-Okay.

685
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,311
It's all over!

686
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,916
It's my punishment for buying these shoes.

687
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,355
You're not going home barefoot.

688
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,731
EMERGENCY DESCENT
STAY CLEAR OF DOORS

689

REGALO SEIJO

691
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,661
What the heck is going on?
He's not answering.

692
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,365
Get out of my way.

693
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,235
No, I won't. I'm her bodyguard.

694
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,939
Get out of the way.

695
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,542
Kanako died.

696
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,545
She's never coming back.

697
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,714
Run away.

698
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,067
Kanako...

699
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:32,676
EMERGENCY STOP

700
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,710
SECURITY OPERATION

701
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,613
SECURITY OPERATION

702
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,213
Kanako!

703
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,982
Settle down!

704
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,550
He's...

705
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,853
He's a victim too.

706
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,570
-We'll be going.
-Thank you.

707
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,919
I'm sorry for causing you to worry.

708
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,689
It's okay.

709
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:54,825
Thank you for your work.

710
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,860
Thank goodness she's okay.

711
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:06,870
Madam,

712
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,706
your husband was worried about you.

713
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,717
Madam...

714
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,124
I don't know how to face him.

715
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,526
Face him just like that.

716
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,130
Don't be so flippant.

717
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,535
I was deceived and did stupid things.

718
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:40,871
That's right.

719
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:48,011
But you wanted to see your husband
do stupid things too.

720
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,941
You're really something.

721
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,946
I heard you took down an armed man
while you were empty-handed.

722
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,650
I can see why you're so confident
about being unarmed.

723
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,086
No, I was fighting pretty desperately.

724
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,688
I admire what you did.

725
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,926
You go shopping and
to a secret meeting with her,

726
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,128
almost get killed,

727
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,864
and even give marriage counseling.

728
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,300
Oh, I see. This is sarcasm.

729
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,603
Personal security is a service industry,

730
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,440
so doing what the client wants
is part of the job.

731
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,578
Would you die if the client told you to?

732
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,446
That's awfully extreme.

733
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,750
Isn't your job pretty confining?

734
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,786
If you blindly follow orders,

735
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,955
you'll find yourself in danger.

736
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,691
You need to consider that.

737
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,693
Listen to me for a second.

738
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,462
I'm not that audacious to say that

739
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,499
I'm confident in my unarmed ability...

740
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,634
All I said was

741
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,271
not having a weapon makes you stronger!

742
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,344
What?

743
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,380
What?

744
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,583
-Mr. Shimazaki.
-Yes?

745
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,290
I was lying to myself.

746
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,094
My mind is not always in a calm state!

747
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,563
I was just concerned about my wife
like any other man...

748
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,299
Please, tell the rest to your wife.

749
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,535
Goodbye.

750
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,825
I'm sorry.

751
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,295
It's okay.

752
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,567
I wonder if...

753
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,404
I'm fit to judge others.

754
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,907
You haven't done...

755
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,543
anything wrong.

756
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,315
I know that.

757
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,155
Look.

758
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,824
I bought these.

759
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,365
I'm not sure what to say, but...

760
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,371
they sure look cool.

761
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,945
You're terrible at giving compliments.

762
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,527
-Good night.
-Good night.

763
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,629
-Good night.
-Good night.

764
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,537
If you weren't a little more resourceful,

765
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:11,374
you'll always return home injured.

766
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,911
Hopefully, it'll always be just an injury.

767
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,081
Good night.

768
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:27,290
Takanashi will be returning.

769
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,360
Really?

770
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,496
He said he would carry
the Personal Security Division

771
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,564
on his shoulders.

772
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,667
Who does he think he is?

773
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,187
Who the heck is this?

774
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,320
Excuse me. What do you want?

775
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,530
Thank you for the other day,
for saving me.

776
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,699
No problem.

777
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,704
I have a favor to ask you.

778
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,510
Can you give me private security?

779
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:59,716
There's someone I have to meet
without the SP knowing.

780
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,925
Please go through the company
for any security requests.

781
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,927
Quit acting all protective.

782
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,462
You'll catch a cold.

783
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:46,696
Who cares?

784
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,401
Hey.

785
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:58,107
The reason I was cleaning up
this morning was...

786
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,546
I've started working as a bodyguard again.

787
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,816
I mean, I never know when I might die.

788
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,454
So I have to keep this place clean.
It's one of the basics.

789
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,326
I figured you did a long time ago.

790
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,862
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

791
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,406
Good night.

792
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,411
Night.

793
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,454
<i>This time, we'll be guarding
100 million yen.</i>

794
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,589
<i>She left without a word?</i>

795
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,092
<i>"If you bring me 100 million yen,
then I'll come back."</i>

796
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,660
<i>Has Kanon been kidnapped?</i>

797
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,130
What's more important?
Her life or her value as an entertainer?

798
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,733
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
