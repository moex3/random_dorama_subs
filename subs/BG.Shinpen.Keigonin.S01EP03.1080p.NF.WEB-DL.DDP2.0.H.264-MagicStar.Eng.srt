There's no reason to do a job
where you could get killed.

6
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,568
You know, you're right.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,772
You're not even listening.

I have an urgent job. Bye.

13
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,059
Quit playing with that phone.

14
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,393
Lock the door.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,929
Take a bath.
You haven't had one for two days.

00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,531
You'll never get girls that way.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,467
I don't want to be that popular.

-Good evening.
-Good evening.

23
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,051
I was out with a woman.

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,187
I just got a beer out of the fridge.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,721
That's the worst.

26

GORO MURATA
MANAGER, PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,695
Your first concern is money?

29
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,131
There he is.

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,735
What? He really did come back?

31
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,972
Yes. He's returning to us for this job.

32
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,908
The manager said he needs my experience.

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,677
That's why I said okay.

34
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,812
That's good.

35
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,148
I wanted to work with you.

36
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,119
I mean, for the marathon job
we had the other day,

37
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,753
he ran away at the last minute.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,388
-What?
-That was a shock.

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,991
Now, now!

40
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,094
As bodyguards, we have to work together.

41
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,031
Also, to build a good team,
you need to be able to disagree.

42
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,434
Let's all get along, okay?

43
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,237
Now, for the assignment.

44
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,639
<i>If you have a single sip...</i>

-<i>...it's a taste of the tropics.</i>
-That's Kanon!

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,112
-<i>Waiha!</i>
-I'll do it!

48
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,981
I mean, I'll take the job.

49
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,382
Why now? You usually avoid work.

50
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,619
I can't let this one go.
I'm a huge fan of hers!

51
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,388
I'll do anything. Be her gofer.
Carry her bags.

52
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,489
I'll guard her with my life!

53
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,527
Sawaguchi, I hate to break the news,
but we're not guarding her.

54
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,162
What?

55
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,564
This time, we'll be guarding...

56
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,302
one hundred million yen.

57
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,104
NEW PRODUCT!
WAIHA BEER

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,072
Can you give us more details?

59
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,141
It's Kanon's bonus.

60
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,345
Oh, really? One hundred million yen?

61
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,349
Out of the blue,
she said she was quitting.

62
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,887
I reminded her that she was still bound
to her contract, but then she vanished.

63
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,322
Anyway, have a seat.

64
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,723
Thank you.

65
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,028
She left without a word?

66
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,229
It's so pitiful.

67
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,299
I worked so hard to get her this far.

68
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,403
I can't let her miss work,
so I did my best to contact her.

69
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,338
Then she goes and says,

70
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:30,610
"Boss, if you bring me 100 million yen,
then I'll come back."

71
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,713
<i>Waiha!</i>

72
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,650
So you're doing as she says?

73
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,485
A hundred million is a fortune.

74
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,155
I hired bodyguards
exactly because it's a fortune.

75
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,593
I wouldn't normally walk around
with 100 million, you know?

76
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,529
Is there a special reason
you're doing this?

77
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,066
The day after tomorrow,

78
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,236
there's an announcement
for a movie project.

79
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,706
She has a coveted leading role.

80
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,873
THE SONATA OF MEMORIES

81
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,310
I have to get her back
by tomorrow by all means.

82
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,381
Understood, sir.

83
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,618
We'll take responsibility
for protecting this money

84
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,254
and make sure it gets to her.

85
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,857
Let me introduce myself. I'm Takanashi.

86
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,858
I'm Shimazaki.

87
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,562
I'm experienced with carrying cash.
Don't you worry.

88
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,765
I'll handcuff the bag to your wrist.

89
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,770
Excuse me.

<i>Madam, why did you do this?</i>

93
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,383
There's no need to get so angry.

94
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,253
You left your home
without telling your security, right?

95
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,425
<i>Yes. I had a personal errand,</i>

96
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,827
<i>so I didn't want to bother them.</i>

97
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,364
What?

98
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,535
Did you want to make me look bad
so I would get fired?

99
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,771
Is that why you disappeared
at the marathon too?

100

AIKO TACHIHARA
HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE MINISTER

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,641
Don't be silly.

102
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,711
You're doing a great job, Kiyota.

103
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,579
In fact, it's almost too great.

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,449
-Is that right?
-Yes.

105
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,985
But could you please
step out for a moment?

106
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,055
I need to properly apologize to Ochiai.

107
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,492
Certainly.

108
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,672
I think you can see
why I can't trust Kiyota.

109
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,208
I'm terribly sorry.

110
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,745
His sense of duty is so strong
that his emotions often show through.

111
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,880
I'll warn him about that.

112
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,984
Ochiai...

113
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,123
I don't need your protection anymore.

114
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,494
As you may have guessed,

115
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:39,165
I'm in a perilous position
as a politician.

116
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,668
<i>I've always been in perilous positions,</i>

117
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,470
<i>but this one is for real.</i>

118
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,475
It exacts a toll when I don't get along
with the 24-hour security guards.

119
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,881
I've requested security
from a private security company.

120
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,450
-Private security?
-Yes.

121
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,788
You know Shimazaki, the bodyguard I met
at the Sumida River Marathon.

122
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,557
I spoke to him directly.

123
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,494
He agreed and said he would be glad to.

124
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,997
That's insane.

125
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,000
He's barely an experienced security guard.

126
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,069
He can't protect important people unarmed.

127
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,507
Your subordinate didn't even notice
that I had left.

128
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,243
He sounds much more inept.

129
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,115
Politicians are reclusive.

130
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,084
Particularly lady politicians.

131
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,721
SP are too haughty
and proclaim their duty is to the country.

132
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,559
A private company can provide
much more sensitive security.

133
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,128
What I need right now is

134
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,498
more caring security.

135
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,635
Yes, sir.

136
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,206
We're on the Central Circular Route
crossing the Shiomi Bridge.

137
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,541
<i>When will you arrive at the destination?</i>

138
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,345
Since we don't know our destination,
I don't know.

139
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,380
You don't know your destination?

140
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,784
We'll be contacting her
when we arrive in Hachioji.

141
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,586
I'll inform you when we find out.

142
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,254
Roger.

143
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,925
I wonder what this is all about.

144
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,995
What? Are those two already fighting?

145
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,030
Why did you pair them?

146
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,100
Well, because I think
they make a good pair.

147
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,135
How come? They don't get along at all!

148
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,303
Hold on.

149
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,240
What bothers me aren't those two.

150
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,042
It's the fact that
the destination isn't clear.

151
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,546
They're carrying 100 million yen,
so doesn't it seem odd?

152
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,780
Yes, it does seem odd.

153
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,950
Kanon would never greedily demand
100 million yen like this!

154
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,286
You're just a fan. What would you know?

155
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,622
I mean, look at her interviews.

156
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,624
"It's not money that I want."

157
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,360
"I want to be loved and be a good wife."
She always says so.

158
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,428
You must be stupid.
That's how she sells herself!

159
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,964
She's not selling herself!
She's not a product!

160
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,432
Forget it! Get back to work!

161
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,501
You don't know anything about Kanon!

162
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,874
Sir, we've pulled off
at North Hachioji Interchange.

163
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,677
Please keep on driving around

164
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,113
until Kanon calls me.

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,049
I thought you were going to call
once we got closer.

166
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,387
No, I'm waiting for her to call.

167
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:22,995
What?

168
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,132
What?

169
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,112
Excuse us for a moment.

170
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,086
-Let's drop this job.
-Why?

171
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,890
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but he's hiding something.

172
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,827
It's dangerous to transport money
when we can't trust him.

173
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,996
But we've already taken the job.

174
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,498
It would be irresponsible to drop it now.

175
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,069
Why are you talking in secret?

176
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,404
-We're talking about your security.
-Sir.

177
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,239
Why does it have to be cash?

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,043
You could give Kanon a check
or wire her the money.

179
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,713
Giving her cash is dangerous,
so why would you do it?

180
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,947
Well...

181
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,351
there's a tax issue...

182
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,288
and I don't want Kanon to change her mind.

183
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,459
So I'll offer her a stack of cash
she can use right away.

184
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,362
I've always worked like this.

185
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,299
I see. So that's why it's all used bills.

186
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,904
If you withdrew 100 million yen
from a bank, they'd give you new bills.

187
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,940
<i>But it's all in used bills.</i>

188
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,143
It does feel immediately spendable.

189
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,846
Yes, that's right.

190
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,181
The entertainment business runs on cash.

191
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,552
KANON

192
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,557
Yes, it's me, Bando.

193
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,193
<i>Where are you now?</i>

194
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,330
Nakase Bridge Park.

195
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>You haven't told the police, have you?</i>

196
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,369
Of course, I haven't.

197
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,405
<i>How prudent.</i>

198
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,342
<i>Go to the Tama Shopping Mall
event area in 20 minutes.</i>

199
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,947
Let's go to the Tama Shopping Mall.

200
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,882
Sir!

201
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,251
I apologize if I'm wrong, but...

202
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,653
has Kanon been kidnapped...

203
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,041
The kidnapper called me

204
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,445
yesterday at 12 noon.

205
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,947
"I have Kanon.

206
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,116
I'll return her without a scratch

207
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,119
if you pay 100 million yen."

208
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,754
"Return"?

209
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,656
I'll notify the police.

210
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,890
No! Don't!

211
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,828
He said he'd kill Kanon
if I tell the police.

212
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,946
A kidnapping?

213
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,216
The 100 million yen is the ransom.

214
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,684
What about the police?

215
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,086
Mr. Bando has requested
that we don't tell them.

216
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,956
I think we need to notify them right away.

217
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,160
We should request
immediate assistance from the local MPD.

218
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,795
I'll notify them.

219
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,798
Don't! Don't you dare tell the police!

220
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,034
I hired bodyguards
because I can't tell the police!

221
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,504
Manager, can you please give us some time?

222
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,339
<i>I'll speak to Mr. Bando.</i>

223
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,343
<i>We should probably inform
the police, but...</i>

224
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,445
Shimazaki told you
not to tell the police, didn't he?

225
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,580
If we tell them secretly,
we'll betray him.

226
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,416
I have important information
regarding Asami Yukinaga.

227
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,954
I'll wait for only 30 minutes.

228
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,556
<i>Contact me immediately after that.</i>

229
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,725
A kidnapping...

230
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,661
Will Kanon be killed?

231
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,098
Wouldn't it be best to notify the police?

232
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,467
I'm leaving it in their hands for now.

233
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,970
Let's prepare to notify them immediately
if we need to.

234
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,406
-Prepare the documents.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,910
Don't just look like a man. Man up!

236
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,414
I'll check her social networking accounts.
I may find a clue.

237
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,051
Hurry up and drive.
We need to be there by 10:00 a.m.

238
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,222
Please relax, sir.
It's five minutes to the mall.

239
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,825
There's still time to notify the police.

240
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,626
How many times do I have to tell you?

241
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,031
If you ignore the kidnapper's demands,
Kanon will...

242
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,834
You're the one who'll regret it
if the worst happens.

243
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,674
If the public finds out
that Kanon has been kidnapped...

244
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,377
it'll harm her image.

245
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,380
It'll end her career as an entertainer!

246
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,451
What's more important?
Her life or her value as an entertainer?

247
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,254
Her life, of course.

248
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,923
Kanon is my treasure.

249
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,428
But she dreamed of being a star
and has worked hard.

250
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,497
I made her give up on romance.

251
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,000
She has probably lost friends too.

252
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,203
She sacrificed a lot to make it this far.

253
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,341
Just saving her life isn't enough!

254
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,676
Please!

255
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,547
It's my duty to help her
achieve her dream!

256
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,450
Let's go to the mall.
It's Mr. Bando's orders.

257
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,953
It has already been 20 hours
since the kidnapping occurred.

258
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,759
Statistically, they're likely dead
24 hours after being kidnapped.

259
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,994
That's why I'm doing this.

260
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,763
Mr. Bando doesn't want
to cooperate with the police.

261
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,500
If we inform them,
it'll cause confusion and eat up time.

262
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,568
We're going.

263
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,344
They have 18 more minutes.

264
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,546
No, 19 minutes.

265
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,119
Manager, is it okay to keep silent
about the kidnapping?

266
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,553
No.

267
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:26,325
In the worst case, we could lose
our security business license.

268
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,697
-Hurry up!
-I know. I'm on it.

269
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,799
SECURITY POLICE

270
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,467
HINODE SECURITY SERVICE

271
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,971
Ochiai, I'm sure you know that

272
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,206
I won't tolerate
Minister Tachihara's antics.

273
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,543
I can't let her make a fool
of the SP again.

274
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,181
Maintain the same level of readiness.

275
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,183
And don't replace Kiyota.

276
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,886
But compatibility is important.

277
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,491
To achieve proper security,
we should accept some of her requests.

278
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,293
That's unlike you.

279
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,863
You sound like a civilian.

280
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,747
Hello?

281
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,582
Bando here.

282
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,586
<i>You lied, Mr. Bando.</i>

283
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,054
What?

284
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,324
<i>You promised not to tell the police.</i>

285
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,393
I haven't told them.

286
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Then who are those two with you?</i>

287
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,431
They're...

288
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,736
managers who work at my agency.

289
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,705
I have a weak heart,

290
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,309
so I had them come with me to
make sure the money was delivered.

291
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,276
Please believe me!

292
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:57,716
<i>Then bring the bag and your phone to
the coffee stand at the mall's event area.</i>

293
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,419
Sir.

294
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,791
Hello, this is one of
the managers speaking.

295
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,128
Now then, about the money,

296
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,831
if it's stolen, then we'll have nothing.

297
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:18,070
So would it be possible if
we accompanied him with the money?

298
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,675
<i>Sure, Mr. Manager.</i>

299
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,331
Don't look too mean. We're managers.

300
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,402
I thought people in show business
looked mean.

301
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,474
Sir, is it true that
you have a weak heart?

302
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,810
Yes, it's a chronic disease.

303
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,179
I almost died a few years ago.

304
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,154
Hello, Bando here.

305
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,860
<i>Keep going south,
then climb the stairs to the fourth floor.</i>

306
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,097
Kanon is unharmed, isn't she?

307
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,741
Just a little farther.

308
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,445
Shall I carry the bag?

309
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,281
No, I'll take care of it.

310
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,916
Are you okay?

311
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,053
I'm doing this for Kanon.

312
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,557
It's all right. Let's get a new one.

313
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,826
No! I want this one!

314
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,132
-Get out of my way!
-I'm sorry.

315
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,100
Who do you think you are?

316
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,404
Don't! We're managers!

317
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,241
-I'm sorry.
-You better be.

318
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,208
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,910
That was close.

320
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,384
Hello?

321
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,785
<i>You were lying.</i>

322
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,622
<i>Judging from their moves,
they must be police.</i>

323
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,423
They're not policemen.

324
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,925
<i>I'm through negotiating.</i>

325
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,627
Hold on! Wait!

326
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,263
Excuse me. Hello? Hold on a moment!

327
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,999
I'm sorry, but we're bodyguards.

328
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,767
We're not policemen.

329
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,903
<i>That's an obvious lie.
Don't try to fool me.</i>

330
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,404
I'm not lying.

331
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,407
If you're nearby, look around.

332
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,709
There's nobody besides us, right?

333
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,913
If we were the police,
there would be more of us.

334
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,284
<i>Then prove it.</i>

335
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,920
<i>Run back down to the event area.</i>

336
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,421
What?

337
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,392
I'm leaving for a moment. Hello?

338
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,059
Less than five minutes left.

339
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,862
I got through!

340
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,833
It's Kanon's secret account.

341
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,703
KANON (SUB-ACCOUNT)

342
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,737
Hello?

343
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,077
You don't see anyone that
looks like police anywhere, do you?

344
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,115
<i>Okay, take off your jacket right there.</i>

345
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,583
What?

346
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,286
<i>If you're a cop,
you'll have a gun and a badge.</i>

347
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,796
<i>Raise your arms.</i>

348
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,469
<i>Good. Turn around to the right.</i>

349
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,211
Hello? I don't have any weapons,
let alone a gun.

350
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,513
Or would you like me to strip naked?

351
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,551
<i>I'll be waiting at Akirano Bridge
in one hour.</i>

352
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,953
Wait! Let me talk to Kanon!

353
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,425
Mr. Bando says he won't give you the money
unless he knows Kanon is safe.

354
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,068
Hello?

355
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,003
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Hello?

356
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,307
This is Shimazaki. I'm a bodyguard.
Are you unharmed, Ms. Kanon?

357
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,612
<i>Yes, but if you tell the police,</i>

358
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,947
<i>I'll really be killed.</i>

359
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,952
<i>Please. Do what he says.</i>

360
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,056
<i>If he has the money, I can return.</i>

361
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,299
-What about Kanon?
-She's okay.

362
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,369
She spoke clearly, but...

363
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,004
But what?

364
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,839
Well...

365
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,407
Excuse me.

366
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,077
It has been 30 minutes.

367
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,613
I'm notifying the police, all right?

368
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,015
Hold on a minute.

369
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,785
This might be a fake kidnapping.

370
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,054
A fake kidnapping?

371
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,424
<i>I just spoke to Kanon on the phone.</i>

372
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:44,963
She said, "Please. Do what he says.
If he has the money, I can return."

373
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,700
Usually, wouldn't you say,
"If Mr. Bando pays"?

374
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,504
Also, would you just say "he"
when talking about the kidnapper?

375
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,874
Do you think she's working
with the kidnapper?

376
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,342
I can't be certain.

377
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,845
I found an odd post on her secret account.

378
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,381
A few hours before her kidnapping,

379
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,583
she told a friend that
she wouldn't do the movie.

380
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,851
Send a screenshot.

381
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,420
We'll send a screenshot
to Takanashi's phone.

382
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,621
Please check it.

383
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,589
SENDING EMAIL...

384
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,897
CONGRATS ON THE MOVIE!
YOU'LL BE A MOVIE STAR NEXT YEAR!

385
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,699
I DOUBT THAT.

386
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,501
DON'T BE SO HUMBLE. IT DOESN'T SUIT YOU.

387
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,170
"My real dream will come true."

388
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,011
It's that jerk.

389
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,992
Kanon used to date a hoodlum
from her hometown.

390
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,461
He's a lowlife.

391
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,265
Last year, she said she would marry him.

392
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,735
So I paid him off to get rid of him
and broke them up.

393
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,541
But she loves that cheap ring
that jerk gave her.

394
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,842
It always bothered me.

395
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,046
Do you know his name?

396
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,016
Nonomura.

397
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,454
Shoichi Nonomura,
a guy from her middle school.

398
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,530
I slept really well.

399
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,965
I'm thirsty.

400
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,037
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

401
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,476
Investigate Shoichi Nonomura.

402
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,580
Now it's a fake kidnapping?
I can't deal with this!

403
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,449
Man up, would you?

404
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,284
You want some lowlife to get her?

405
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,420
I'm going to the Investigation Department.

406
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,089
I won't let you have Kanon!

407
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,725
This is a good thing.
If it's a fake kidnapping,

408
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,161
we won't lose
our security company license.

409
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,866
No either way, we've failed
to inform them about illegal activity.

410
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,337
Excuse me.

411
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,571
Already?

412
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,073
What is it?

413
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,377
I've forgotten his name,
but where is the man

414
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,946
who failed to inform the police
the other day?

415
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,350
Oh, that would be Shimazaki.
He's out on a job.

416
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,054
I heard something I can't believe
from Minister Tachihara.

417
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,157
She asked Shimazaki to be her bodyguard,

418
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,493
and this Personal Security Division
supposedly accepted.

419
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,028
Excuse me?

420
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,464
I'm speaking for the SP.

421
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,001
A private company cannot protect
a cabinet minister.

422
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,404
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

423
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,474
I haven't heard anything
from Minister Tachihara or Shimazaki.

424
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,710
There's no reason to hide it.

425
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,915
I'm not so bold as to lie to the SP.

426
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,718
Maybe it's the Minister who's lying.

427
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,089
It's not easy to tell
when a woman is lying.

428
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,075
I found something out!
This guy is bad news!

429
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,530
INVESTIGATION REPORT

430
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,565
This is info about Shoichi Nonomura.

431
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,903
The used clothing store he ran in Machida
went bankrupt last October.

432
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,838
He has a mountain of debt.

433
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,139
Debt?

434
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,942
To a friend on a social networking site,

435
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,478
he said, "I won't 'jump' anymore."

436
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,682
They call it "jumping" when
you only pay the interest on a loan.

437
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,820
This means he plans to
pay off the whole loan.

438
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,856
I knew it. He's behind this.

439
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,792
Dang it!

440
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,528
I'm not paying!

441
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,132
I've been played like a fool.

442
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,635
I only want to take Kanon back!

443
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,109
I discovered her
when she was a total hoodlum,

444
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,044
polished her, and brought her this far.

445
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,713
She couldn't cry on cue.

446
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,149
She was criticized as a lousy actor.

447
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,919
I got on my knees and begged.

448
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:40,692
I spent all kinds of money.
I sold her with all my might.

449
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,330
Then she goes and kicks sand in my face!

450
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,898
Sir!

451
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,966
Don't stop me!

452
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,502
You're putting stress on your heart.
Calm down.

453
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,705
Darn it!

454
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,653
We did it!

455
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,424
With 100 million, you can pay off
your debt, and we can start a new life.

456
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,460
That's right. I'll always treat you well.

457
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,102
My dream is to live a normal life
with my precious Sho.

458
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,103
Kanon.

459
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,638
Kanon.

460
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,680
Hello?

461
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,415
Bando here.

462
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,918
<i>Bring the money
to the middle of the bridge.</i>

463
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,554
When will you return Kanon?

464
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,857
<i>I'll return her when I receive the money.</i>

465
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:52,397
I don't have the energy,
so I'll have the bodyguards bring it.

466
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,137
<i>That's fine with me.
However, only one of them.</i>

467
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,214
I don't care which of you does it.
Take this,

468
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,516
and bring back Kanon.

469
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,419
Bring her back with fake money?

470
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,888
That's one heck of a request.

471
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,423
You're a bodyguard, right?

472
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,760
Aren't you supposed to obey
the client's orders?

473
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,164
Certainly. I'll go.

474
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,971
I'm the BG.

475
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,444
The BG's duty is to protect
Mr. Bando and the 100 million yen.

476
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,050
Be careful.

477
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,888
I think the punk we ran into
at the mall...

478
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,957
is an accomplice.

479
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,593
We agree. How unusual.

480
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,129
I thought so too.

481
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,602
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized. Excuse me.

482
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,966
Chief, I looked up
the Hinode vehicle on the N System.

483
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,402
It drove toward Hachioji
early this morning.

484
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,971
-Hachioji?
-Is something bothering you?

485
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,306
No.

486
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,875
Give the local police the plate number
just in case.

487
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,044
-Tell them to be on the lookout.
-Yes, sir.

488
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,883
Just as we planned,

489
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,219
I'll be traded for the money and return.

490
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,956
I'll tell them I was blindfolded
so I didn't see the kidnapper's face,

491
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,292
and the shock was so big
that I can't work,

492
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,627
and I'll quit the agency.

493
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,398
Are you listening?

494
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,468
Put the 100 million away.
Don't you dare use it.

495
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,471
Of course.

496
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,507
That's the money that will make us happy.

497
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,811
Thank you.

498
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,588
How much longer will you keep up this act?

499
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,790
Who are you?

500
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,493
You don't have to quit.

501
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,462
You should keep earning money.

502
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,963
What are you talking about?

503
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,599
Sho!

504
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,108
You mean...

505
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,812
you used me to get the money?

506
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,082
You must be kidding!

507
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,251
You said you loved me!

508
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,754
Right?

509
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,522
Listen up!

510
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,692
Do you think I could love some woman

511
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,962
that shows off her flesh on stage?

512
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,766
You're so awful.

513
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,102
-Wait!
-Hey!

514
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,438
-Hold it!
-Let go of me!

515
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,173
Cut it out!

516
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,675
If you tell the cops...

517
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,843
I'll post this.

518
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,981
You'll never be an entertainer again.

519
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,258
I've brought what we promised!

520
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,028
Give Kanon back!

521
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,312
Excuse me!

522
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,382
I'm afraid of heights!

523
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,051
Hurry this up, please!

524
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,729
She's unharmed.

525
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Put it down...

526
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,072
and step back.

527
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,209
I'm supposed to trade you in
for the money.

528
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,977
I'll return after I check it.

529
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,313
I'll go to you.

530
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,715
I can't do that.

531
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,385
Please.

532
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188
Please! Do as I say!

533
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,163
We know everything.

534
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,802
If you come back now,
Mr. Bando will forgive you.

535
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,308
Come here.

536
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,060
I told you to step back!

537
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,542
<i>What's wrong?</i>

538
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,879
I think the fake just turned real.

539
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:42,914
<i>Hey!</i>

540
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,817
What did you say? Bring her back now!

541
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,486
Roger.

542
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,556
What do you plan to do?

543
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,463
What the heck is that guy doing?

544
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,468
Hurry up and do it!

545
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,502
All right.

546
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,043
I'll put it here.

547
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,548
I'm stepping back.

548
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,687
Holy cow!

549
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:12,003
I said I was afraid of heights!

550
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,551
If you're an actress,

551
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,488
don't you think you should learn
to act a little better?

552
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,462
I'll be fine.

553
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,839
Oh, no! The money!

554
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,542
We should go!
If he falls, we'll lose 100 million!

555
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,810
Let's go!

556
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:55,846
Hey!

557
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,088
You must be kidding!

558
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,962
-That hurts!
-I'll kill you if you fall!

559
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,098
If I fall, I'll be dead anyway!

560
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,000
That hurts!

561
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,635
I can't hold on!

562
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,470
I can't hold on!

563
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,972
I can't hold on!

564
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,480
My 100 million!

565
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,153
-Let's go!
-Wait right there!

566
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,855
I'll post...

567
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,092
these photos!

568
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,094
Let's go.

569
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,800
Help me.

570
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,845
I have a new assignment.

571
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,015
Run away.

572
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,049
Hey!

573
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,258
Wait!

574
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,340
Sir!

575
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,942
Is your heart all right?

576
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,544
My heart is fine!

577
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,547
I just wanted sympathy from the kidnapper.

578
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,815
Out of the way!

579
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,086
If they find me with all this money,
they'll find out about everything!

580
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,691
What do you think you're doing? Let go!

581
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,894
Let go!

582
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,704
I've had it. Tell us what happened.

583
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,307
Are you both going
to keep silent together?

584
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,376
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

585
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,413
Quit fooling around!

586
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,082
You'll be in trouble if you keep silent.

587
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,621
You're nothing more than private security.

588
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,959
If someone got injured, what...
How dare you yawn!

589
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,128
If someone got injured,

590
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,430
what would you do to make up for it?

591
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,133
-Good question.
-Don't talk back like that!

592
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,702
You were exploited by a fake kidnapping?

593
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,604
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:13,177
I asked the bodyguards not to tell anyone.

595
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,647
It was to protect her image.

596
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,918
But you know, we arrested Nonomura,

597
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,387
and he says she was in on it.

598
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,390
She is a naive girl

599
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,926
and knows nothing of the world.

600
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,129
That's why she was duped by that man.

601
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,466
Isn't that right?

602
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,772
Yes. I'm sorry.

603
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,042
I thought it was a candid camera prank.

604
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,247
I didn't know that
I was being used for a crime.

605
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,386
Well, if that's the case,
it can't be helped, can it?

606
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,192
<i>Kanon and Mr. Bando have been released.</i>

607
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,293
I see.

608
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,261
<i>They were given a severe warning.</i>

609
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,297
Since the money is safe
and nobody was hurt,

610
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,065
the police won't publicize it.

611
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,502
And well, thank you for protecting Kanon!

612
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,137
Why are you thanking them?

613
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,171
Sorry.

614
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,940
Thank you very, very much.

615
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,875
I respect you. Goodbye.

616
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,511
-Here.
-Okay.

617
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,347
I'm so tired. Let's go.

618
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,982
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

619
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,650
You like showing off, don't you?

620
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,220
-What?
-Have you always been like that?

621
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,191
If you have something to say, then say it.

622
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,373
If I did, you'd have to quit
the Personal Security Division.

623
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,310
I don't want that.

624
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,447
I see.

625
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,084
I want to be a first-rate bodyguard.

626
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:07,458
Do you think you got away with that?

627
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,028
Good evening.
This is my co-worker, Takanashi.

628
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,434
Why are you so hostile?

629
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,038
I don't have to answer that.

630
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,009
What's with you? We're both
in the business of protecting people.

631
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,345
That's an interesting remark.

632
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,250
What could possibly be similar
about what you and I do?

633
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,058
Don't forget that security companies
are under police jurisdiction.

634
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,766
You'll be dining with Kinoshita
from METI at 3:00 p.m.

635
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,934
-Okay.
-Don't forget.

636
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,703
AIKO TACHIHARA
HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE MINISTER

637
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,837
Hello?

638
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm replacing your appointed SP.

639
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,944
I didn't think you would allow
a replacement.

640
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,745
<i>It was my decision.</i>

641
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,481
It's to keep you
from hiring private security.

642
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,253
Avoid having any further contact
with Hinode Security Service.

643
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,856
You really do hate him, don't you?

644
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,294
No. We simply need to eliminate anyone
who takes security lightly.

645
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,801
Japan isn't as safe
as everyone thinks it is.

646
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,605
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

647
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,942
<i>That was the director. Thank you, sir.</i>

648
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,013
You're too old to be dozing all morning.

649
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,382
<i>Let's hear from Kanon now.</i>

650
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,150
<i>Go ahead, Kanon.</i>

651
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:45,723
<i>I'm extremely grateful
for being given the leading role.</i>

652
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,560
Becoming a great actress

653
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,063
is my way of repaying my fans

654
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,800
and the man who discovered me,
my agency's president.

655
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,038
I'll do my best to learn
how to be a great actress.

656
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,943
If you're going to be a bodyguard,
at least guard people like her.

657
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,416
That'll never happen.

658
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,231
Murata speaking.

659
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,435
Hello. I'd like you and Shimazaki
to come to my office now.

660
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,438
I'm terribly sorry.

661
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,810
I'll handle the trouble we had
with the Security Police.

662
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,046
<i>That isn't what this is about.</i>

663
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,518
We have an extremely important
top-secret request.

664
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:58,996
I'd like you to provide me security.

665
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,765
<i>She will take three hours
to attend her meeting and return.</i>

666
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,435
Why do you have to keep it secret
from the SP?

667
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,003
<i>I'm sorry. The Minister has...</i>

668
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,172
<i>You know nothing about the Minister.</i>

669
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,473
<i>And you think you know her?</i>

670
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,176
Minister, my mission is not yet complete.
