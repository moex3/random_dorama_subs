1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,304
This is life or death.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,874
My life depends on this.

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,417
BEAUTIFUL, NOBLE, GREAT LOVE

ART MUSEUM ENTRANCE

5
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,020
Hello.

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,689
Nobody saw you, right?

7
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,992
-Right.
-Good. This way, please.

8
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,962
This way.

9
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,066
I've brought them.

10
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,934
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,437
The SP didn't notice you, right?

12
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,337
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,273
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
HINODE PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,176
AIKO TACHIHARA
HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE MINISTER

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,982
GORO MURATA
MANAGER, PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

16
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,985
You must be surprised.
I was surprised as well.

17
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,621
I first met Minister Tachihara

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,225
when we provided security
for the Civil Party.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,861
I never thought
she'd request security herself.

20
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,330
Is this a personal security request?

21
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,900
I thought Cabinet members
were provided with SP.

22
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,739
That's why I had you come
to this location secretly.

23
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,311
On Saturday, the 10th,

24
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,315
I'm going to see someone
at the Kaylington Hotel.

25
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,052
I'd like you to provide me security.

26
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,921
However, the SP must not know about it.

27
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,928
SP is provided 24 hours a day
for government ministers.

28
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,630
<i>In your case, Minister Tachihara,</i>

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,833
<i>your security detail had been increased
since you were threatened.</i>

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,338
It's not possible for you
to slip past the SP.

31
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,444
That day, the Minister will be getting
a physical exam at Teiwa Hospital.

32
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,413
She's a close friend
of the hospital director.

33
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,749
You mean...

34
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,586
The trip from Teiwa Hospital
to Kaylington Hotel is under an hour.

35
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,755
The meeting will last one hour.

36
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,192
She will take three hours
to leave the hospital,

37
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,361
attend her meeting, and return.

38
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,765
Excuse me, but why do you have to
keep it secret from the SP?

39
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,503
Do you think I can tell you that?

40
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,541
She's meeting with the leader
of an opposing faction.

41
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,177
If it becomes public,
it would affect the election.

42
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,247
She can't have the SP coming along
to something like that.

43
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,652
I can count on you, can't I?

44
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,465
I told you, I'm fine. I'm eating right.

45
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,501
I wash my uniform myself too.

46
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,771
You-know-who is back.

47
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,009
Who's "you-know-who"?

48
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,745
-I don't know.
-That was your mom, wasn't it?

49
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,348
What does she want?
Does she want you to come home?

50
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:40,019
No. She and Mr. Odagiri
are all lovey-dovey.

51
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,023
Lovey-dovey? Is that so?

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,728
So you know, what is he?

53
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,831
-What do you mean?
-Well, I mean...

54
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,937
How old is he and what does he look like?

55
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,473
That's none of your business.
You've been divorced for years.

56
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,646
He's ten years younger than you.

57
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,249
He's totally cool and rich too.

58
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,085
No...

59
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,088
There's no way she's dating
such a perfect guy.

60
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,297
So maybe she is. What does he do?

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,166
Some kind of research.

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,037
She says he's really smart
and really kind.

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,442
So the exact opposite of me?

64
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,179
Minister, can you tell me
why you met with those people

65
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,082
from Hinode Security Service?

66
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,220
It's better for you
that you don't know, Sakagami.

67
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,456
I see.

68
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,640
I'm here.

69
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,747
We were laughing so hard about you
that we hardly drank at all.

70
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,750
I'm sorry to hear that.

71
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,418
Here.

72
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,223
We think your assignment is
too tough for an amateur.

73
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,627
Sir, I'm not an amateur.

74
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,099
Since you gave me your support,
I've worked as hard as I can.

75
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,602
You're all talk.

76
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,606
You haven't even passed a single bill.

77
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,177
-I'm doing my best.
-Are you?

78
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,079
You need to be more determined.

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,015
You need to shed a few tears
at a Diet session.

80
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,185
Sir,

81
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,089
nobody has ever been fooled
by a woman's tears.

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,258
Quite the opposite, in fact.

83
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,329
I believe once I cry,
then it's all over for me.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,234
Here.

85
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,939
-Shimazaki.
-Thanks.

86
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,176
We should turn down this job.

87
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,912
There he goes whining again.

88
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,847
Slipping her past SP

89
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,517
and escorting her to
a confidential meeting with God-knows-who?

90
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,818
That's insane!

91
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,754
Since our company accepted it,
we have no choice but to do it.

92
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,023
It's kind of exciting though.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,793
We guys are going to be in charge of
a government minister.

94
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't be stupid!

95
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,696
If the SP finds out,
we'll lose our security license.

96
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,598
It won't be exciting. It'll be a tragedy.

97
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,634
-Well said!
-Don't kid around!

98
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,202
This is seriously dangerous!

99
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,939
I know, but every job has some risk.

100
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,543
The client is taking a risk.
That's why they're hiring security.

101
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,246
Reckless clients treat us like hired guns.

102
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,315
That's why bodyguards get
no respect in Japan.

103
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,118
Respect has nothing to do
with this kind of work.

104
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,457
It's more a matter of how hard
we work behind the scenes.

105
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,727
I think people should have
more respect for this kind of work.

106
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,329
That would reduce crime.

107
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,965
That's why I joined
the Personal Security Division.

108
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,600
As for you,

109
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,603
you probably don't want any attention.

110
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,273
Why doesn't he want attention?

111
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,508
I don't know.

112
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,243
I see.

113
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,481
Actually, I believe a bodyguard's job
is to protect the client,

114
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,084
even if the world hates us for doing so.

115
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,676
Good morning.

116
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,513
Oh, you're here too, Mr. Ochiai?

117
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,481
The replacement starts today.

118
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,085
I'm your new bodyguard. My name is Mori.

119
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,188
I'll do my best to protect you.

120
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,456
Nice to meet you.

121
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,293
It's energizing to have
a young man assigned to me.

122
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,328
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,330
He's taking over for Kiyota
starting today.

124
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,668
Minister, I'm sorry I couldn't be
of help to you.

125
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,437
I would appreciate another chance--

126
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,006
Okay, let's get going.

127
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,173
The Minister is leaving.

128
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,042
Ministers must be in good health.

129
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,777
Getting a physical exam
is part of the job.

YOSHIAKI OCHIAI

BACKUP - MURATA

132
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,106
How can you be so stubborn?
The manager is covering for you!

133
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,081
Hurry up and check on traffic conditions.

134
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,053
Which of us is right?

135
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,355
What?

136
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,857
Me or that old geezer.

137
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,561
Should we accept this ridiculous request?

138
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,397
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

139
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,333
Don't you have an opinion?

140
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,001
No, I don't!

141
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,870
All I want to do is use
my physical abilities

142
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,472
to work and make money.

143
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,341
How pathetic.

144
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,178
Who are you calling pathetic?
At your age, you're pathetic

145
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,547
for whining about
why we're taking some job.

146
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,718
Besides, you're practically
an old geezer yourself.

147
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,390
Hello?

148
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,359
Hello, Shimazaki here.

149
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,761
We're at the location
and starting the mission.

150
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,233
No reports of construction or accidents
along the route to the destination.

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,234
Roger.

152
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,210
This is exciting. I feel like
we're in the US Secret Service.

153
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,211
Hey!

154
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,348
Be very careful. If SP sees us, it's over.

155
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,249
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,280
PRIVATE ROOM

157
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,750
What a nice room.

158
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,087
A physical exam
is the only time I get a break.

159
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,599
This is 03.
The Minister has arrived in the room.

160
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,302
This is 01, roger. All normal at Point 2.

161
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,042
Minister, you can be seen from outside.
Please take care.

162
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,151
Thank you.

163
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,853
I'm going to change now.

164
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,789
You must be busy, Mr. Ochiai.
You can go now.

165
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,958
I'll be going then.

166
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,805
She can be self-indulgent.
Don't let her out of your sight.

167
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,773
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,187
-I'm counting on you.
-Yes, sir.

169
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,174
SP leader has left the main guard.

170
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,876
Now heading for Point 3.

171
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,578
Roger. Let me know if you need assistance.

172
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,515
They'll be on the move
in under ten minutes.

173
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,953
Hey, quit goofing around
and check their route.

174
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,622
This is odd.

175
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,390
What is it now?

176
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,193
Aiko Tachihara is
in Secretary-General Igarashi's faction.

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,295
So the opposing faction leader
is Zenta Koda.

178
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,330
That's right. What about it?

179
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,566
He's in Niigata today
at a trade board meeting.

180
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,002
Then isn't it that Isomura guy?

181
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,971
Juro Isomura is judging
a political speech contest.

182
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:26,972
Look.

183
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,209
There are tons
of other politicians out there.

184
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,497
Thank you. I'll be getting a CT scan
and a colonoscopy now.

185
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,835
It'll take three hours,
so go wait in the waiting area.

186
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,171
No, I'll wait in front of your room.

187
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,373
After each examination,

188
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,211
I'll speak with the doctor about
how to maintain my health.

189
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,880
Why don't you have some tea
in the waiting area?

190
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,483
I can't do that while on duty.

191
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,555
Your predecessor, Kiyota,
made my life difficult

192
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,258
because he tried too hard
and was inflexible.

193
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:25,497
I hope you can work with me
for a very long time, Mori.

194
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,466
Use this to buy yourself some tea.

195
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,037
Well, if you insist.

196
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,641
I promise to contact you when I'm through.

197
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,344
In here, please.

198
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,486
It's this way.

199
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,841
This is 01, I'm with the Minister.

200
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,082
This is 03, I'm with them.

201
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,360
<i>Hello, Sakagami speaking.</i>

202
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,429
I'm at the hospital now.

203
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,232
I'm going to turn off my phone
for a while.

204
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,335
But Minister, what if...

205
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,604
Don't worry. You can take
the rest of the day off.

206
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,639
But...

207
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,647
The Kaylington Hotel.

208
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,718
All the guest rooms are occupied today.

209
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,520
The banquet and wedding halls
are booked too.

210
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,789
That doesn't mean anything.

211
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,524
When I was in Cash Transport,

212
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,927
I transported the proceeds
from a live concert here.

213
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,264
Each floor is wide open
and visible from the others,

214
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,632
so it's a very public place.

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,636
A well-known politician wouldn't go here
for a confidential meeting.

216
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,973
That makes sense.

217
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,209
So what do we do?

218
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,212
Inform them, of course.

219
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,583
Don't order me around.

220
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,387
Tell them yourself, Takanashi.
You figured this out.

221
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,165
Why are you so stubborn?

222
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,467
What a child!

223
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,050
Hello, Mori speaking.

224
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,518
Where is the Minister?

225
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,954
She's having an examination,
so I'm on stand-by as she ordered.

226
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,923
Don't just sit around
because she told you to!

227
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,826
Always know where your charge is.

228
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,727
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

229
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,466
SP haven't figured it out, have they?

230
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,635
I think it's all right.

231
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,671
I told them my tests
would take three hours.

232
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,875
Minister, when is your meeting?

233
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,277
At 3:00 p.m.

234
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,046
-Get a move on.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,352
Shimazaki speaking.

236
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,190
The bossy, stubborn old geezer noticed

237
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,495
that several things seem fishy
about this mission.

238
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,931
Fishy?

239
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,899
<i>Is Minister Tachihara</i>

240
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,836
really going to Kaylington Hotel
for a confidential meeting?

241
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,216
Minister?

242
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,466
Minister?

243
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
Minister Tachihara?

244
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,925
I don't know anything at all!

245
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,661
About five minutes ago,
the Minister herself called

246
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,497
to say she was turning off her phone
because of the physical exam.

247
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,566
That's all I've heard from her!

248
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,569
-She may have been kidnapped.
-What?

249
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,937
Did you get a ransom call?

250
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,173
-No!
-You sure you don't know anything?

251
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,508
I mean it. I don't know anything.

252
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,879
Mr. Sakagami, if something happens,
you could be held responsible.

253
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,016
Tell me as soon as you remember anything.

254
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,084
Okay.

255
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,788
Let's order a search.
This could be something serious.

256
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,889
Wait.

257
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,192
Excuse me.

258
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,830
Can you keep it a secret
that I told you this?

259
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,232
Of course.

260
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:05,837
Actually, the Minister had a list
of guests for a wedding ceremony today.

261
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,472
<i>-A wedding?
-Yes.</i>

262
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,807
For a friend of the Minister?

263
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,710
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

264
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,746
However, a few days ago,

265
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,517
she met with Personal Security people
from Hinode Security Service.

266
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,631
Minister,

267
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,735
why exactly are you visiting
Kaylington Hotel?

268
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,043
We'll keep it confidential.

269
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,581
All right.

270
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,817
I'll tell you.

271
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,992
This isn't a confidential meeting.
It's a secret rendezvous.

272
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:00,892
What?

273
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,132
I'm single, and I'm in love with someone.

274
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,640
He's married,
so nobody can know about this.

275
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm sorry that it's such a trite thing.

276
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,283
Why today at 3:00 p.m.?

277
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,053
If you wanted to avoid notice,

278
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,723
you wouldn't choose
the middle of the day on a holiday.

279
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,562
Why would you do something
this risky and anger the SP

280
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,331
just for a secret rendezvous?

281
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,302
If you want perfect security,

282
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,838
then we need to know your true purpose.

283
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,585
The first time we spent time together

284
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,889
was five years ago today.

285
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,658
We watched the sunset

286
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,628
from the Kaylington Hotel.

287
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:17,402
I intend to end our relationship today.

288
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:24,042
That's why I insisted
on meeting him today.

289
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,212
You know where
Minister Tachihara is, right?

290
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,781
What do you mean,
with you guys barging in here?

291
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,951
We know that you met with the Minister.

292
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,621
The other day, I warned you.

293
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,726
Don't forget that security companies
are under police jurisdiction.

294
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,831
You know
where Minister Tachihara is, right?

295
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,668
Yes, we do.

296
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,637
Then you'll assist us?

297
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,147
No.

298
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,584
You understand this situation, right?

299
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,153
It's an unprecedented situation.

300
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,922
The SP have lost sight of their charge.

301
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,430
Hello?

302
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,967
Okay. All right.

303
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,339
My apologies for barging in.
We won't need your help.

304
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,753
On the other end of this tunnel is
Toshin Road near The Kaylington Hotel.

305
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,555
Right.

306
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,501
What's this? There haven't been
any reports of congestion.

307
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,740
Hello. Shimazaki speaking.

308
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,175
Takanashi here.

309
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,377
-I know.
-The SP was here.

310
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,379
Already?

311
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,015
They've set up a checkpoint
near the tunnel exit.

312
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,685
I'm bothered that they're doing this
only on streets leading to the hotel.

313
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,589
I think they know what we're doing.

314
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,824
Roger.

315
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,329
-They've noticed, haven't they?
-Yes.

316
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,333
We have a report of
an unusual checkpoint at the tunnel exit.

317
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,469
They must be really ticked off.

318
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,672
-They might even shoot us.
-That's unnecessary!

319
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,240
Sorry.

320
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,878
Minister, it's not too late to return.

321
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,583
Take me to the Kaylington Hotel.

322
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,119
You could be called
to account for what happens.

323
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,990
Take me to him.

324
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,698
You arranged to meet at 3:00 p.m., right?

325
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,100
-Yes.
-Shimazaki,

326
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,269
what if we're stopped at the checkpoint?

327
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,641
We need to break through
the checkpoint, right?

328
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,618
It's 2:12 p.m. and 35 seconds.

329
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,727
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

330
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,495
I wish us all success.

331
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,305
Haven't you forgotten
to report to me, Ochiai?

332
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,075
<i>I heard something I can't ignore.</i>

333
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,747
Kiyota ordered the local police
to set up a checkpoint.

334
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:54,553
I certainly hope that nothing
has happened to the Minister.

335
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,623
-That's ridiculous.
-<i>I thought so.</i>

336
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,493
<i>If something had,
it wouldn't just be your career,</i>

337
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,095
but my career as well
that would be affected.

338
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,964
Nothing has happened.

339
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,168
Excuse me, but the Minister is calling.

340
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,912
CHECKPOINT
MPD

341
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,594
Plate number Shinagawa 300 A 80-84.

342
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,674
You're with Hinode Security, right?

343
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,142
Yes, how did you know?

344
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,377
Where are you going?

345
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:57,082
We're headed toward Yokohama
for a meeting at a client's request.

346
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,718
You're with the SP, right?

347
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,886
You're guarding Minister Tachihara.

348
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,825
Why are you at a local police checkpoint?

349
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,727
That's none of your business.

350
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,730
Is anyone behind that curtain?

351
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,801
-Well, no...
-I'll check it myself.

352
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,771
Hey!

353
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,417
What did you do with the Minister?

354
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,021
What are you talking about?

355
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,303
You're like a mole.

356
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,271
EVACUATION ROUTE

357
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:58,043
I did road construction security,
so I know a little about these tunnels.

358
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,311
Please be careful.

359
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,448
Every experience in life
is useful, isn't it?

360
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,552
These stairs lead to the surface.

361
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,996
Put this over your head.

362
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,197
-But...
-Hurry.

363
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,532
There's no time to hesitate.

364
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,367
Sorry.

365
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,094
Are you okay?

366
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,871
How can you do all this
for a stranger's secret rendezvous?

367
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,841
You're not a stranger.

368
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,443
You're our client.

369
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,349
Is something wrong?

370
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,286
I...

371
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,959
I bet you saw right through me.

372
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,896
The secret rendezvous was a lie.

373
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,168
I want to see my daughter.

374
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,037
Your daughter?

375
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,541
To be more precise,

376
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,311
a daughter I've never even held.

377
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,583
Back during my second year at university,

378
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,786
I became pregnant.

379
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,823
The father was also a student.

380
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,093
We ended up breaking up.

381
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,198
Once I had no choice but to have the baby,

382
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,035
I pretended to go abroad to study
so I could give birth.

383
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,040
Then for my own future,

384
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,913
I gave her up for adoption
to a physician couple

385
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,848
soon after birth.

386
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,188
Now, she's 26 years old.

387
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,991
She graduated from medical school

388
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,461
and will be marrying her senior,
a doctor from the same school.

389
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,666
So today is...

390
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,871
My daughter's wedding.

391
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,842
Apparently,

392
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,911
they named her Yui.

393
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,649
I've never once wanted to see her.

394
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,854
But it's funny, isn't it?

395
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,424
When I learned that
she was getting married,

396
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,329
I suddenly had to see her,
even if it's just once.

397
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,871
So that's your real reason, right?

398
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,341
You don't seem surprised.

399
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,979
You're wearing formal clothes,
a pearl brooch, and a necklace.

400
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,049
That's the opposite of what
you'd wear to a secret rendezvous.

401
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,687
In fact, it makes sense now that I know
you're here for your daughter's wedding.

402
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,322
Also,

403
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,659
everyone

404
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,496
has a past that they can't talk about.

405
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,370
Let's go.

406
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,510
EMERGENCY EXIT

407
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,679
Hello, Shimazaki here.

408
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,781
We'll be arriving soon.

409
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,885
Immediately find a route
to the banquet hall that's out of sight.

410
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,955
I know where all the hotel entrances are.

411
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,556
There's a pool next to the hotel.

412
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,725
You can reach the banquet hall
by entering that way.

413
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,793
Roger.

414
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,677
Let's go inside the church.

415
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,514
You can see her from there
without the other attendees noticing you.

416
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,489
That was a long stroll you took,
Minister Tachihara.

417
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,327
The wedding will be delayed by 30 minutes.

418
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,062
You postponed it, didn't you?

419
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,964
Minister, return with me.

420
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,099
Hold on!

421
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,267
My mission isn't complete.

422
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,336
The public thinks you're at the hospital.

423
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,972
You must leave here as soon as possible.

424
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,918
Please let me have just five minutes.

425
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,389
This is life or death.

426
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,825
My life depends on this.

427
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,381
TOMIKAWA FAMILY

428
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,637
I'm sorry for the sudden intrusion.

429
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,641
No matter how many times
I've requested a meeting,

430
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,910
you've always refused.

431
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,680
Barging in uninvited at a wedding?

432
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,882
KEICHIRO SAKIYAMA
CHAIRMAN, JAPAN FEDERATION OF PHYSICIANS

433
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,017
You lack common sense.

434
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,689
He's the chairman of
the Japan Federation of Physicians.

435
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,595
It appears you didn't know
what the Minister's purpose was.

436
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,837
I have heard that
you're opposed to increasing

437
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,606
the lump-sum benefits
for childbirth and childcare.

438
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,311
But I believe that
to stop the declining birth rate,

439
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,114
we must increase these benefits.

440
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,183
You just want to improve
your approval rating.

441
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,287
You just want to increase
how much doctors can charge,

442
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,726
which, in turn,
helps your funding sources.

443
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,330
Children are the nation's assets!

444
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,534
That kind of thing won't fool me.

445
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,809
These are the ideas

446
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,813
of a childless, single working woman.

447
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,617
It's completely unconvincing.

448
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,688
THE PARTIAL REVISION OF LUMP-SUM BENEFITS
FOR CHILDBIRTH AND CHILDCARE BILL

449
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,768
Chairman.

450
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,940
The bride, Yui Tomikawa,

451
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,976
is my daughter.

452
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,918
You know nothing about the Minister.

453
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,054
And you think you know her?

454
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,093
At the very least,

455
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,163
I realize that
politicians have many faces.

456
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,103
Yui doesn't know about me.

457
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,675
Of course, it's not public,
and the media doesn't know either.

458
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,178
Then why confess this to me?

459
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,652
When I decided that I wanted
to see Yui on her wedding day,

460
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,925
I found out that you were
one of the groom's guests of honor.

461
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:15,333
It made me think that my daughter
was trying to bring us together.

462
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,740
Because I had to give up my own daughter,

463
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,878
I want to pass a bill
that will do something for children.

464
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,119
Get out.

465
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,637
If you're going to open up
and beg like that,

466
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,473
then I guess I have no choice.

467
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,643
I'll consider it.

468
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,686
Don't ever get involved
with the Minister again.

469
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,625
If you can promise not to,
then I'll ignore this incident.

470
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,031
We're only doing our job.

471
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,336
Are you still saying those things?
You defy comprehension.

472
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,804
I can't understand you either.

473
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,809
Why are you so hostile?

474
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,279
We're both in the business of
protecting people.

475
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,952
I've seen reckless
private bodyguards get hurt.

476
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,291
When people need security,
unarmed people like you

477
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,226
should obey us, the police.

478
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,597
So gun-toting SPs are better than us?

479
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,166
This is my final warning.

480
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,475
I'm back.

481
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,111
I'll take you to the hospital.

482
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,247
Thank you.

483
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,850
Let's go.

484
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,757
Shimazaki and the others
were only following my request.

485
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,893
Don't punish them or anything like that.

486
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,372
Minister...

487
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,309
my mission is not yet complete.

488
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,196
-Shimazaki.
-Yes, ma'am.

489
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,833
Your mission is complete.

490
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,075
Let's go, please.

491
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,718
-Welcome back.
-I'm so tired.

492
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,620
I'm surprised you made it back alive.

493
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,723
Oh, thanks for that.

494
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,259
I forgot to thank you before.

495
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,595
Nice assist.

496
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,798
I don't agree with your opinion.

497
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,640
Why does he hate you so much?

498
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,144
-Actually, I think he likes him.
-Really? I like him too.

499
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,679
That's not even funny.

500
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,814
-But you're laughing.
-But you're laughing.

501
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,617
-I guess so, but...
-Write that report. Now.

502
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,886
I'll be done with it in a flash.

503
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,254
Nice work.

504
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,326
I'd prefer that you don't accept
this kind of mission again.

505
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,927
Why not?

506
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:23,467
The Personal Security Division
won't take this kind of incident lightly.

507
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,938
Coming from a former SP,
you're exactly right.

508
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,474
However, the Minister is now in our debt.

509
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,676
When it comes to the business,
this was a success.

510
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,411
I realize I have my own past, but...

511
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,317
who exactly is Shimazaki?

512
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,119
I don't think

513
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,522
he's just a regular security guard.

514
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,740
That's pretty good.
You've been practicing.

515
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,777
-Leave me alone.
-Don't talk like that. Hey, Shun.

516
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,015
Do you want to see your mom?

517
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:13,550
Not at all.

518
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,321
-Hey!
-I'm going to take a bath.

519
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,122
HITOMI

520
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,626
DIALING

521
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,703
Hi. It's me.

522
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:12,843
I think I should tell Shun.

523
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,114
He wants me?

524
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,650
Protect me until I leave this time.

525
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,618
<i>Are you deceiving us?</i>

526
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,521
<i>Zaki can't refuse me, right?
That's why I asked you.</i>

527
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,690
<i>Junya Kono is under police investigation.</i>

528
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,392
<i>We won't help you flee.</i>

529
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,359
Get going!

530
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,994
Up until six years ago...
