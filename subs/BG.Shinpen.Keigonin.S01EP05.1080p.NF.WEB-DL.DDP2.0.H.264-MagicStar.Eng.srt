1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,778
The ace of Japan's national
soccer team, Junya Kono,

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,179
has made a dashing entrance.

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:17,150
The scoring champion
three years running for Kamakura Regulus,

4
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,520
Junya has transferred to
the famous Italian club, Piedmont FC.

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,856
-Thank you.
-Japan has high expectations...

6
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,833
Mr. Kono!

7
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,102
Junya!

8
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,470
FROM: HITOMI

9
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,138
IT'S HITOMI

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,109
I WANT TO RAISE SHUN HERE WITH US.

11
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,078
MY HUSBAND AGREES.
COULD YOU TALK TO SHUN ABOUT THAT FOR ME?

12
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,746
I HEARD YOU'RE WORKING
AS A BODYGUARD AGAIN.

13
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,815
BE CAREFUL.

14
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,484
HITOMI ODAGIRI

15
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,225
So you're Mrs. Odagiri now.

16
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,666
<i>A bill to increase lump-sum benefits
for childbirth and childcare</i>

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,437
<i>has been introduced to
the ordinary session of the Diet.</i>

18
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,340
<i>This is part of the government's
social welfare reforms.</i>

19
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,710
<i>Apparently, the submission of this bill...</i>

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,514
-Morning. You're up early.
-<i>was due to the reversal of opinion</i>

21
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,183
<i>by Chairman Sakiyama of
the Japan Federation of Physicians.</i>

22
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,087
<i>Chairman Sakiyama stated that
this law affects</i>

23
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,289
<i>the children of Japan
on whom Japan's future rests.</i>

24
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,858
I was thinking about
watching one of your matches.

25
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,927
What's the point? I'm not a regular.

26
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,430
Really? Are you that bad?

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,466
Shut up! I'm not bad.

28
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,902
I just get nervous in real matches.

29
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,006
What about breakfast? You'll get hungry!

30
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,277
<i>MHLW Minister Aiko Tachihara
displayed resolve to pass the bill.</i>

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,846
<i>The declining birth rate is
a critical issue facing Japan.</i>

32
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,147
Not even a "thank you"?

33
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,650
<i>I've introduced this bill to...</i>

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,085
<i>You've really done it this time!</i>

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,088
Did you think you could hide this from me?

36
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,723
OSAMU HIKAWA
CHIEF, SECURITY BUREAU (SP), MPD

37
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,128
A serving minister escaped
under the watch of her SP guards!

38
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,598
<i>What's worse,
private bodyguards helped her!</i>

39
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,234
<i>I've never heard of such a thing.</i>

40
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,169
I'm terribly sorry.

41
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:29,442
I don't think I'll ever hear a report
from you that I'm pleased with, Ochiai.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,944
I'll clear this up.

43
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,445
YOSHIAKI OCHIAI
SECURITY BUREAU (SP), MPD

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,352
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,721
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

46
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,224
Everyone, there's good news.

47
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,792
Really? A special bonus?

48
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,594
Thirty days of paid leave?

49
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,929
We have a new job.

50
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,798
-What a letdown.
-Now, now.

51
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,767
The client heard about
our excellent reputation,

52
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,336
so he insisted on hiring us.

53
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,038
We've been depending on
the President's personal contacts,

54
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,840
but we got this one on our own.

55
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,543
He "insisted" on hiring us?
That's actually kind of scary.

56
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,378
He's not a dangerous client.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,848
BRINGING JOY TO CHILDREN THROUGH SPORTS

58
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,783
PURENESS FOUNDATION

59
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,787
I know this. It's that famous charity.

60
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,557
I doubt we'll attract any attention
from the police this time.

61
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,727
Now, as for the BG...

62
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,595
MASAYA TAKANASHI
HINODE PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

63
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,163
I think Shimazaki would be best.

64
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,399
What?

65
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,602
What's wrong?

66
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,741
Well, I mean, instead of me,

67
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,677
wouldn't it be better for Sawaguchi
to be the BG for the first time?

68
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,481
Well, if you insist so much,
I'll have to accept.

69
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,016
He only said it once.

70
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,653
Then this is your first chance
to be BG, Sawaguchi.

71
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,787
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,622
I'll be the backup.

73
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,957
I think you're up to the task.

74
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,425
Don't get so cocky.

75
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,060
-Do your best.
-I will.

76
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,162
-I'm going to the restroom.
-I'm counting on you.

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,099
Thank you, sir.

78
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,636
BG Sawaguchi.

79
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,540
We have a new team starting today,

80
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,575
and I'll be handling
your security personally.

81
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,679
Personnel changes have been made
by order of the Security Police.

82
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,015
Are you increasing surveillance on me?

83
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:20,386
Please refrain from contacting
private security firms in the future.

84
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,956
I'd like to exclude
any interference in your security.

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,391
"Exclude"?

86
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,895
You sound like you want
to destroy Hinode Security.

87
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,865
Here is the security schedule
for the week.

88
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,568
AFFINITY

89
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,147
PURENESS FOUNDATION

90
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,340
<i>Please come in.</i>

91
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm Junya Kono,
a representative of Pureness.

92
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,682
Of course, we know who you are.

93
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
-Hey!
-This way, please.

94
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,086
I mean, this is Junya.

95
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,789
To people my age, he's a god.

96
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,858
The Japanese Whirlwind.

97
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,060
You scored through four defenders
at the Youth Championships.

98
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,062
The boys in my class went wild
when we heard

99
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,264
you were going to
the big Italian club, Piedmont.

100
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,167
You're being rude.

101
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,970
It's all right.

102
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,806
I haven't been called "god"
in a while. It's nice.

103
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,476
When I played, that nickname put
a lot of pressure on me.

104
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,646
Can you tell us more about this job?

105
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,614
Sure.

106
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,418
Let's see. From the 18th to the 20th,

107
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,520
I'll be at a charity auction in Milan.

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,557
I'll be auctioning autographed balls
and other goods I collected

109
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,058
from athletes around the world.

110
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,060
I need security on the way to the airport.

111
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,630
Could you be targeted by someone,

112
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,733
like a crazy fan
or a thief hoping to make money?

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,901
No.

114
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,337
These are precious, so I just want
to make sure they're safe.

115
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,942
Please help me deliver
the dreams of the children.

116
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,013
Don't you worry. I'm Sawaguchi.
I'll be in charge,

117
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,848
and I will protect you with my life.

118
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,589
Actually, I'd like to make
one personal request.

119
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,162
He wants me?

120
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,164
He said you used to be friends.

121
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,267
That's amazing. Is that true?
Why didn't you tell us?

122
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,038
Probably because
he's too secretive. Right?

123
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,441
So was there some trouble between you two?

124
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,543
With that star soccer player?

125
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,914
-Maybe they fought over a girl.
-Quit joking around.

126
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,018
It appears there's something
bothering you.

127
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,794
Everyone has troubles in their past.

128
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,496
Even I do.

129
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,735
It's all right if you have problems
accepting this.

130
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,604
I won't ask why.

131
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,278
We'll turn this job down.

132
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,682
No!

133
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm sorry if I never told you.

134
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,569
Up until six years ago,

135
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,873
I was Kono's bodyguard.

136
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:11,384
So you were lying when you said
you're a novice bodyguard?

137
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,953
Novice? He's a total expert.

138
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,522
I always thought it was odd.

139
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,259
You were always way better than you acted.

140
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,629
Unbelievable.

141
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,234
Hey.

142
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,272
Did you know about this?

143
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,875
More accurately, I figured it out.

144
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,710
Then why didn't you say anything?

145
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,048
Keeping silent makes you just as guilty!

146
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,789
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,165
I apologize.

148
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,233
I apologize.

149
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,209
I'll take the job Kono wants me for.

150
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,182
However, unnecessary info will interfere
with his security.

151
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,353
After we've completed this mission,

152
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,924
I'll tell all of you everything.

153
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,264
Okay! Let's get to work!

154
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,667
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,390
FORMAT PC
FORMATTING...

156
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,290
Hello?

157
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,226
<i>Shiraishi here.
How are the preparations going?</i>

158
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,995
<i>I'll clear the room out for you.</i>

159
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,764
I've taken care of everything.

160
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,799
<i>I knew you were a fast worker.</i>

161
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,168
<i>Brilliant stars are a cut above.</i>

162
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,503
Don't say that.

163
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,271
I'm not a star anymore.

164
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,207
<i>To us, you're a big star.</i>

165
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,544
Goodbye.

166
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,688
<i>Kamakura Regulus!</i>

167
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,058
Go! Junya, go!

168
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,361
Kamakura Regulus!

169
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,107
FORMATTING COMPLETE

170
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,247
Zaki, try these on.

171
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
-No, it's okay.
-Come on. Try them.

172
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,354
They look great on you.

173
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,190
-You can have them.
-Thank you.

174
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,627
Excuse me!

175
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,233
Thank you.

176
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,270
Stand back! Don't push!

177
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,306
<i>-Autograph, please!
-Don't push!</i>

178
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,944
<i>It's dangerous! Don't push!</i>

179
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,347
<i>-Junya! Autograph, please!
-Don't push!</i>

180
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,186
If you're going to do this,
then give it your all.

181
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,589
Make up for keeping silent.

182
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,626
You bet.

183
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,342
Well, it sure has been a while.

184
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,210
How have you been?

185
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,548
Hi. Yes, it's been a while.

186
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,885
I always wondered
how you'd been doing, Zaki.

187
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,319
Thanks.

188
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,955
Where's the luggage
you're taking to the airport?

189
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,590
It's these two.

190
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,992
It's precious. Take care of it.

191
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,126
Certainly.

192
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,798
Protect me until I leave this time.

193
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,707
Yes, sir. I promise to protect you
until you depart.

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,878
<i>Why didn't he tell us?</i>

195
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,182
There must be something
he really didn't want us to know.

196
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,185
Providing backup is more important.

197
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,086
Check traffic conditions and social media.

198
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,254
Yes, sir. Sorry.

199
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,391
There are no congestion
or accident reports.

200
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,792
You sure recovered fast.

201
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,227
What else can I do?

202
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,130
He never told us anything
because he didn't want to.

203
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,402
Really? I guess your brains finally
caught up with your mature looks.

204
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,372
What's this?

205
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,741
JUNYA WILL BE AT THE WINTERIS SOCCER EVENT
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW!

206
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,644
Junya's supposed to be
at a soccer event in Todoroki

207
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,246
the day after tomorrow.

208
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,381
JUNYA KONO, FORMER NATIONAL TEAM
AND KAMAKURA REGULUS MEMBER

209
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,289
Five o'clock.

210
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,793
-Can we have your autograph?
-No! Stand back!

211
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,163
-What? How scary!
-Excuse us. Let me have that.

212
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,336
Sorry, but since I retired,
I haven't given autographs.

213
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,804
Will a handshake do?

214
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,673
-May I?
-All right!

215
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,609
-I hope you make a comeback!
-Me too!

216
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,677
Your foot is better, isn't it?

217
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,717
-Here you are.
-He's so cool!

218
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,233
That was amazing!

219
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,040
-Minister.
-Hold on.

220
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,311
You're Junya Kono, aren't you?

221
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,079
Hello.

222
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,883
We met at a charity event
for international education.

223
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,719
It wouldn't have been a success
without your support.

224
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,754
Excuse me.

225
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,060
Let's go.

226
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,903
I wonder if Junya Kono
is escaping overseas.

227
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,706
"Escaping"? What do you mean?

228
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,277
Politicians often act like
they know nothing

229
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,213
when actually, we know an awful lot.

230
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,721
Shimazaki.

231
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,761
A soccer event the day after tomorrow?

232
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,430
He's scheduled to appear for sure.

233
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,598
Without Junya,
the crowd will get pretty upset.

234
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,436
Oh, that? I'll cancel that later.

235
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,871
You're canceling an event for
the day after tomorrow now?

236
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,611
The media will demand an explanation
when you return.

237
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,681
I won't be coming back for a while.

238
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,519
I only said I'd be gone for two weeks.

239
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,255
I might never return.

240
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,624
Anyway,

241
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,462
when I was still playing, I got
a permanent resident visa over there.

242
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,433
Then what about
the charity event in Milan?

243
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,336
There is no charity.

244
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,008
-Why did you lie to us?
-Why did I lie?

245
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,877
-Well...
-Give us an explanation.

246
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,580
-What's going on?
-You sure are pushy.

247
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,350
It's all a lie.

248
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,754
It's all a lie?

249
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,358
Almost none of the charity money
has been used for kids.

250
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,095
<i>I was just a PR front,
making money for my backer.</i>

251
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,964
Your "backer"?

252
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,732
After I retired,

253
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,169
they covered my bills
when I went through rough times.

254
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,871
You could call them my sponsor.

255
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,745
Then why are you going to Italy?

256
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,149
Isn't it obvious?
I'm disappearing before people find out.

257
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,986
All evidence of wrongdoing is in those.

258
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,991
That's why I got bodyguards,
just in case anything happened.

259
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,495
-We won't help you flee.
-Quit acting so self-righteous!

260
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,465
I'm your client, you know.

261
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,805
Zaki can't refuse me, right?

262
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,873
No matter what I ask.

263
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,277
That's why I asked for you.

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,250
Get going! Drive!
Right now! That's an order!

265
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,120
Shimazaki...

266
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,361
Shimazaki!

267
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,806
They're going to the airport.

268
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,110
They can't do that!
We're helping him flee the country!

269
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,444
What am I supposed to do?

270
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,680
Shimazaki is just following orders.

271
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,747
But we have to stop him!

272
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,083
We're in danger
of losing our license again.

273
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,287
Even if we drop this job,

274
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,424
Kono will go to the airport
on his own anyway.

275
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,430
Maybe Shimazaki is taking him
so we can stop him.

276
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,101
CURRENT LOCATION: NEAR BAY TRUST HOTEL

277
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,277
Minister Tachihara's information
was right.

278
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,880
There are suspicious rumors
about Junya Kono.

279
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,082
He's under surveillance
by the Organized Crime Squad.

280
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,684
Inform them that
he might be fleeing the country.

281
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,389
Wouldn't it be better
if Kono fled the country?

282
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,793
Since Hinode Security is involved,

283
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,795
a charge of assisting escape
will harm their reputation.

284
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,466
It's the perfect excuse to terminate
their security business license.

285
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,335
I won't pull nasty tricks like that.

286
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,105
I'll destroy them head-on.

287
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,835
My bags.

288
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,206
You call yourselves bodyguards?

289
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,544
Are you sure about this,

290
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,681
"Zaki"?

291
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,296
Get out of my way.

292
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,766
Junya...

293
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,804
you said you wanted me to guard you
until you depart.

294
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,872
So carry these!

295
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,608
You call this a departure?

296
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,411
You...

297
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,249
were a star...
no, in fact, you're still a star.

298
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,120
Anyone who has inspired
other people's dreams

299
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,057
should never flee, no matter what happens.

300
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,361
Not just once, but twice...

301
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,797
you're going to interfere with me
going abroad?

302
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,810
Mr. Kono,

303
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,913
can I have a moment of your time?

304
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,340
Those might be police detectives.

305
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,476
Did you leak this?

306
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,245
We'd never betray a client!

307
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,181
The police may already have
an arrest warrant for you.

308
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,584
No, that's impossible.
All the evidence is here.

309
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,186
I'm leaving before an investigation...

310
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,321
Hold it right there!

311
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,163
They're asking questions
at the Milan departure desk.

312
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,465
There are detectives
at the Milan departure desk.

313
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,034
EMBARKATION, TICKET SALES

314
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,705
The headlines will say,

315
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,507
"Former soccer star Junya Kono
falls from grace."

316
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,378
"The man called the god of speed
fed off the dreams of children!"

317
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,314
Let go!

318
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,083
Let go of me!

319
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,719
Whose fault was it
that I turned out like this?

320
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,587
Come on! Say something!

321
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,189
Did you forget it all?

322
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,246
It's collapsing!

323
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,787
Junya!

324
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,726
It hurts!

325
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,810
I'd be better off dead.

326
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>That forced me to retire.</i>

327
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:43,121
<i>Even after my injury healed,
I lost my chance to go abroad.</i>

328
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,291
<i>That put an end to my soccer career.</i>

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,429
You have a lot of nerve,
working as a bodyguard.

330
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,998
I lost everything.

331
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,069
Shimazaki quit being a bodyguard.

332
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,809
He did road construction security
for six years.

333
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,816
He never once spoke about you

334
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,585
or about his past.

335
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,254
And now,

336
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:21,059
he obeys the client's orders
to the letter.

337
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,096
Even now, for you, he's--

338
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,265
-It's too late for that!
-No, it's not.

339
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,337
Mr. Kono,

340
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,441
turn yourself in before you're arrested.

341
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,611
We'll take you there.

342
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,685
Are you lecturing your client?

343
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,554
Who knew you'd all be alike?

344
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,628
Junya, when I left your side then,

345
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,897
I failed at being a bodyguard.

346
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,100
Why are you apologizing?

347
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,105
If you hadn't saved those kids,
they would have died!

348
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,840
My client was Junya.

349
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,642
Hold on a second.

350
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,514
So even if we see someone about to die,

351
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,817
we shouldn't leave the client?

352
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,419
That's what it means to be a bodyguard.

353
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,655
You're paid to protect my life!

354
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,059
It can't be helped

355
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,630
if you're on the job.

356
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,599
-I'm supposed to watch people die?
-That's not what I mean!

357
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,134
My client was Junya.

358
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,135
That's no reason--

359
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,771
My client was Junya!

360
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:45,844
You're such a bunch of idiots.

361
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,747
What's the point in talking about this?

362
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,219
I'm sick of dealing with you.

363
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,328
I'll go to the police.

364
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,935
But before that,
I have to tie up some loose ends.

365
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,370
We'll accompany you anywhere.

366
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,305
No.

367
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,109
I only want Zaki to come along.

368
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,448
Okay.

369
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,585
I won't leave your side again.

370
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,087
That's what I promised.

371
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,595
Thank you for the information earlier.

372
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,967
Junya Kono has some
very shady people backing him.

373
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:47,472
In fact, they once offered
to give me a contribution.

374
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,276
Naturally, I refused it.

375
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,212
Fortunately, he's still in the country.

376
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,548
The Organized Crime Squad
is investigating.

377
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,985
Was I of some help to you, Mr. Ochiai?

378
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:01,953
Yes.

379
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,089
I see.

380
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,794
Out of consideration for me,

381
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,566
will you please take it easy
on Shimazaki and the others?

382
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,835
I cannot do that.

383
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,804
Why not?

384
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,140
"Why not"?

385
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,678
It's the police's duty to censure mistakes
made by the private sector.

386
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,853
It seems to me that

387
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,189
this has nothing to do
with the public and private sector.

388
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,258
I think you simply hate Shimazaki.

389
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,095
No, that's not right. You don't hate him.

390
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,997
You're jealous of him.

391
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,668
Or is that even possible?

392
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,773
The mighty SP would never envy
a plain old bodyguard.

393
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,541
I'm sorry.

394
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,578
It's time for a shift change. Excuse me.

395
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,261
SHIRAISHI ARTS MANAGEMENT

396
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,806
If I turn myself in,

397
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,809
the people who took care of me
won't take it lightly.

398
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,012
I can't just betray them.

399
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,781
I'll accompany him to Shiraishi Arts.

400
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,719
Be very careful.
The Investigation Department checked him.

401
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,888
Gozo Shiraishi has been arrested
for fraud and bribery.

402
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,526
There's something fishy.

403
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,063
Junya said he put all the evidence
in his suitcases,

404
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,733
but the police are carrying
everything out.

405
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,202
That bothers me.

406
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,638
Come back out in 30 minutes.

407
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,874
If you don't contact us,
we'll call the police.

408
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,743
Roger.

409
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,746
Time is 3:58 p.m. 12 seconds.

410
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,547
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

411
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,049
I wish you success.

412
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,361
SHIRAISHI ARTS MANAGEMENT

413
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,629
Is the chairman here?

414
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,465
Kono is here.

415
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,568
Okay. This way.

416
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:38,276
This is a surprise.
I thought you were already on a plane.

417
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,979
Sorry, especially after
all you've done for me.

418
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,046
Who's that?

419
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,985
-He's my bodyguard.
-Bodyguard?

420
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,022
If you wanted a hired gun,
I would have gotten you one.

421
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,260
A hired gun?

422
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,128
I should have done that.

423
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,600
This guy lectures me
even though he's only a hired gun.

424
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,170
He told me to go to the police.

425
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,275
-The police?
-Yes.

426
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,943
What a joke.

427
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,680
Turn myself in? Don't be stupid.

428
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:35,466
Did you think I had a change of heart?
Of course not.

429
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,504
Thanks to him, I missed my flight.

430
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,172
That's so cruel.

431
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,708
-We'll have to take care of that.
-Please do.

432
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,809
Do anything you like.

433
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,945
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

434
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,081
I've had it with this guy.

435
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,603
It's been 20 minutes. Still no word.

436
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,804
Right.

437
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,213
Your client, Junya Kono is
under police investigation.

438
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,715
SECURITY POLICE

439
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,784
<i>Evidence indicating private use
of charity funds</i>

440
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,186
<i>was found in his hotel room.</i>

441
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,289
<i>Cooperate with us to arrest him.</i>

442
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,225
What if we refuse?

443
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,761
<i>Most likely,
you'll be charged with a crime</i>

444
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,398
and immediately lose
your security business license.

445
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,969
Thank you for the warning.

446
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,038
I'm on duty now. Goodbye.

447
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,574
<i>Are you sure it's okay?</i>

448
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,610
<i>If Junya Kono escapes,
we won't get away with just a warning.</i>

449
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,213
I'm counting on Shimazaki.

450
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,083
<i>You trust him too, right, Takanashi?</i>

451
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,188
<i>That's why you always worked with him</i>

452
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,424
even though you knew about his past.

453
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,826
And I think Shimazaki

454
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,996
trusts you as well.

455
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,834
So even though he realized that you knew,

456
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,070
he worked with you without any complaint.

457
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,207
It's been 30 minutes.

458
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,345
You're going too easy!

459
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,481
I'm not a hero or a star anymore.

460
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,419
These past six years,
my life has been worthless.

461
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,694
-Hurry up and get him out of here.
-Yes, sir.

462
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,262
Hold on.

463
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,010
Any last words?

464
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,947
Fire me.

465
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,184
What? I can't hear you!

466
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,187
Fire me, please.

467
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,023
What are you talking about?

468
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,792
You've been fired long ago.

469
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:24,902
Why you!

470
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,445
I'm not your bodyguard anymore!

471
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,720
What are you doing?

472
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,055
You've been double-crossed.

473
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,891
What do you think you're doing?

474
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,627
I've had it with this guy.

475
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,832
Stop right there, you jerk!

476
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,342
Hey!

477
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,943
-Takanashi!
-Yes, sir!

478
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,647
-Stop! Darn you!
-Stop!

479
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,249
They double-crossed me?

480
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,417
DON'T THROW IT AWAY!

481
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,419
The police found evidence

482
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,954
in the room that you said
was empty of everything.

483
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,891
They planted evidence that would
make you take all the blame

484
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,360
after you fled the country.

485
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,906
What's this?

486
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,817
<i>A star that has fallen from grace</i>

487
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,719
is better off dead.

488
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,752
Don't think you've caught up with me.

489
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,422
I told you.

490
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,792
I wouldn't leave your side.

491
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,934
When you hit me earlier,

492
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,037
you hit me with all your might,
didn't you?

493
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:49,974
Yes.

494
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,944
I haven't hurt that bad in a long time.

495
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,812
Sorry.

496
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,889
You gave your son
the ball I signed, right?

497
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,398
Yes. He still treasures it.

498
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,436
Here, Zaki. For your son.

499
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,071
What?

500
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,441
-Thank you.
-Wish him the best.

501
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,342
I will.

502
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,410
TO SHUN,
JUNYA, KAMAKURA REGULUS

503
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,582
<i>He says that...</i>

504
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,586
he's too nervous to be a starter
in a real match.

505
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,589
I see.

506
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,796
He should try kicking the ball
with his eyes closed.

507
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,400
Close his eyes?

508
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,771
When you realize how helpless you are,

509
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,941
you won't be so tense.

510
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,811
Okay.

511
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,383
I guess my time's just about up.

512
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,229
That's right.

513
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,392
You're Junya Kono, right?

514
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,561
Yes.

515
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,335
Isn't that Junya Kono?

516
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,469
Seriously?

517
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,970
-Wait.
-It's really him!

518
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,440
-Let's get his autograph!
-Can you wait a second?

519
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,674
No. Stop.

520
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,411
Let me have your pen.

521
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,555
-You want me to sign these?
-Yes, please.

522
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,958
-There you go.
-Thank you!

523
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,026
There.

524
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,963
-Do your best. Keep practicing.
-Thanks!

525
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,065
-That's fast!
-Keep it up!

526
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,601
-Hang in there.
-Thank you!

527
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,870
-Look at this!
-See you.

528
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,138
Let's go.

529
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,540
Come on. Let's go.

530
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,418
My injury from that accident

531
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,187
didn't end my career.

532
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,261
To be honest,
I was afraid I couldn't perform abroad.

533
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,765
The injury was an excuse to retire.

534
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,636
I couldn't overcome my own fears.

535
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,774
So...

536
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,310
you leaving my side

537
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,647
and saving those kids

538
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,683
was the right thing to do.

539
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,425
Thanks for staying with me until the end.

540
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,432
See you later, Zaki.

541
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,377
Thanks for all your help.

542
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,751
We avoided the loss of our license.

543
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,523
That was a heck of a run.

544
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,795
You've been beaten to a pulp. How pitiful.

545
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,631
So...

546
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,934
can I call you "Zaki"?

547
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,711
No.

548
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,814
I can't?

549
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,986
<i>-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.</i>

550
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:06,156
HINODE BUILDING

551
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,000
Are you all right?

552
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,635
<i>Yes.</i>

553
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:24,475
When I saw you at the hotel today,
I couldn't talk to you because...

554
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:32,516
Mr. Ochiai told me not to have
any more contact with you.

555
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,352
Is that so?

556
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,024
But when I'm told something like that,

557
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,627
it makes me want to talk to you even more.

558
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,998
<i>Be careful.</i>

559
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:49,934
Politicians

560
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:55,039
surprise others
to make them do what they want.

561
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,242
Bye.

562
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,587
That hurts!

563
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,297
You're so devoted.

564
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,935
You're still not drinking
because of your work?

565
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,138
Mura.

566
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,008
I'll forget about what happened today.

567
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,111
But there won't be a next time.

568
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,484
Our final warning. How frightening.

569
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,787
A beer and a pork cutlet sandwich.

570
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,359
You're getting used to
the private sector, I see.

571
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,027
Yes.

572
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,798
It's not always easy, but everyone
on my staff is very interesting.

573
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,704
They're the kind of people
that I'd do anything for.

574
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,677
Is that a declaration of war?

575
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,149
Don't be ridiculous.

576
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,355
I'm home.

577
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:27,164
TO SHUN,
JUNYA, KAMAKURA REGULUS

578
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,465
By the way, Shun.

579
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,803
I heard that it's good to practice
kicking the ball with your eyes closed.

580
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,505
What?

581
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,275
That way you won't feel so tense
during a match.

582
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,078
-Are you nuts?
-That's what I heard.

583
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,080
Who said that?

584
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,920
-God.
-Don't be stupid.

585
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:20,551
I HATE TO ASK YOU THIS,
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO GUARD.

586
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,019
HITOMI ODAGIRI

587
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,154
<i>The client is the former Prime Minister.</i>

588
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,656
<i>They said old people don't need security.</i>

589
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,891
I'll guard him so well,
the SP will be surprised.

590
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,793
-Someone, help me!
-Let me through!

591
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,929
<i>So you even came here
to guard his granddaughter?</i>

592
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:35,532
-I can't let you bring your grandpa shame.
-You're useless.

593
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,867
<i>Help!</i>
