1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,370
Okay.

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,344
<i>Help me!</i>

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,314
<i>Help me!</i>

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,153
Oh, hello?

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,788
Good morning. It's me.

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,991
<i>I haven't heard from you in a while.</i>

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>How's Shun?</i>

8
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,628
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
HINODE PERSONAL SECURITY DIVISION

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,736
He's still asleep.

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:42,008
You sure are treating me like a stranger.

11
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,944
<i>Well, we are strangers now.</i>

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,285
So who's this person
that needs guarding? A friend?

13
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,688
<i>Well, it's me actually.</i>

14
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,026
If you're joking, I'm not laughing.

15
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,695
<i>I thought you'd say that.</i>

16
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,700
<i>I've been getting
a lot of silent crank calls lately.</i>

17
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,736
-Silent calls?
-<i>Yes.</i>

18
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,337
So Hitomi...

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,140
I mean, on your mobile phone?

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,444
Maybe someone hates you.

21
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,878
<i>You're so mean.</i>

22
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>You're heartless, as usual.</i>

23
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,791
Hello? This is the Samejima house.

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,631
Hello?

25
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,404
Aya.

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,273
Did my enemy say anything?

27
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,708
No, nothing.

28
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,911
If he calls again, shame him.
Say, "Give your name, coward!"

29
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,947
-Okay?
-Dad.

30
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,049
Aya's just a child.

31
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,753
The SP people are here to see you.

32
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,956
Come in.

33
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,295
Prime Minister Samejima,
it has been an honor working for you.

34
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,199
Your protection under the SP
will end tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,502
I asked for it to be extended!

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,239
This is the government's decision.

37
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,109
If anything happens in the future,
please call the police.

38
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,277
Goodbye.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,022
So I have to call the cops from now on?

40
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,525
Grandpa.

41
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,494
You're not an important person anymore?

42
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,934
<i>The client is Kyoichi Samejima,
76 years old,</i>

43
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,036
the former Prime Minister.

44
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,740
During the coalition government,
his harsh comments earned him the nickname

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,275
"Man-Eating Shark."

46
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,376
<i>Give us the truth!</i>

47
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,579
Don't former prime ministers get SP?

48
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,749
If the government decides
that he's no longer important,

49
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,884
they end protection.

50
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,353
-They said they're done with him?
-Yes.

51
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,088
That poor guy.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,290
It's only natural.

53
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,793
Protecting a former prime minister
is a huge waste of our taxes.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,363
But why did he decide to hire bodyguards
out of his own pocket?

55
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,532
He's been getting
silent crank calls at home.

56
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,434
Silent calls? Is that all?

57
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,603
I get them all the time.

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,071
Are you bragging that you're popular?

59
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,673
What? What gives you that idea?

60
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,408
Now, now.

61
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,578
It's hard for a former prime minister
to give up his SP.

62
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,946
Let's work seriously on this.

63
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,549
Okay, who will be the BG this time?

64
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,985
Shouldn't it be "Zaki" this time?

65
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,154
-Hey!
-You're right.

66
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,424
An experienced bodyguard is best
for a former prime minister.

67
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,127
Can I ask you to do it, Shimazaki?

68
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,396
I'll work on-site as your partner.

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,199
Well, I guess if you insist.

70
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,968
Quit acting so humble.

71
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,869
You know you're totally confident.

72
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,739
We all know you were the bodyguard
of the famous Junya.

73
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,242
If you're going to do it,
knock us out with your skill.

74
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,545
-Okay, fine. I'll do it!
-All right.

75
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,449
In fact, I'll guard him so well,
the SP will be surprised.

76
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,586
Okay. It looks like
we're getting paid quite a lot for this.

77
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,823
Once this mission is over,
let's all have a drink together.

78
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,026
We also haven't had
a welcome-back party for Takanashi.

79
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,594
-Good idea.
-Yes.

80
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,029
Sir, you'll pay for us, right?

81
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,965
-I'm not so sure about that.
-I'll go if I don't have a date.

82
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,736
Count me out. It's a waste of time.

83
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,371
Quit acting all embarrassed.

84
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,772
It's a waste of time.

85
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,541
It's your own welcome party!

86
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,301
I'm sad to say that
our time to part ways has come.

87
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,372
We're proud to have successfully
protected you for 25 years, sir.

88
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,209
As the representative
for the 110 SP officers who protected you,

89
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,277
I bid you farewell.

90
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,246
Take care, sir.

91
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,955
Dad, you should thank them.

92
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:30,863
Hello!

93
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,034
Thanks for coming. I was expecting you.

94
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,079
Good evening.

95
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,580
What's going on here?

96
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,749
Can't you tell?

97
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,419
I've hired bodyguards to replace you SP.

98
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,191
Excuse me, but do you believe
private guards can replace the SP?

99
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,960
It's a little late for that!

100
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,529
Even though I've said that I'm in danger,

101
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,199
the police still refused
to extend my protection.

102
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,334
So I hired private bodyguards

103
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,672
to protect my life and my honor.

104
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,107
Mr. Ochiai,

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,775
leave this to us.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,879
Starting tomorrow,
we'll protect your life and honor,

107
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,280
Prime Minister Samejima.

108
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,070
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

109
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,205
We'll be accompanying you today.

110
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm counting on you.

111
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,842
I'll be attending

112
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,912
Secretary-General Igarashi's
70th birthday celebration.

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,616
I'm a little worried about
my daughter and granddaughter.

114
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,218
I'll take care of your daughter
and granddaughter.

115
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,286
Okay.

116
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,531
Hold on.

117
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,535
These weren't here when we came.

118
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,739
They're just stones. Four of them.

119
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,742
My enemy is warning me.

120
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,844
Warning?

121
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,181
He senses that I no longer have
the SP's protection.

122
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,150
Four stones.

123
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,855
Four means death. He wants me to die.

124
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,360
-What about the rocks, Grandpa?
-Nothing for you to worry about.

125
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,563
-Be careful on your way to school.
-Okay.

126
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,832
Don't cry if you're bullied.

127
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,968
It's your chance to find out what
your enemy's weakness is.

128
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,603
-I'm not being bullied.
-Good.

129
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,871
-See you.
-Bye.

130
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,372
-I'll walk her to school.
-Thank you.

131
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,440
Thank you.

132
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,480
Do you know who might be after your life?

133
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,981
Isn't it obvious?

134
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,785
The people who were hurt by my comments.

135
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,622
Back then, I was attacked by
the people who lost money

136
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,357
<i>when my comments stopped construction.</i>

137
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,126
From now on and forevermore...

138
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,229
Darn you, Samejima!

139
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,399
<i>The guy who did it
got out of prison long ago.</i>

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,534
Samejima!

141
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,069
Samejima!

142
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,407
But that was when
you were serving as Prime Minister.

143
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,212
It's the fate of politicians to be hated,
no matter how many years have passed.

144
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,284
Leave me be. I'm still pretty strong.

145
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,385
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,133
Your grandpa really loves you,
doesn't he, Aya?

147
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,736
Well, I'm his poor granddaughter.

148
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,371
Poor granddaughter?

149
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,872
You heard, right?

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,742
My mom and dad got divorced last year.

151
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,614
You answered the crank call
yesterday, right, Aya?

152
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,250
Yes. But they hung up fast.

153
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,854
You know,
I wish you wouldn't call me "Aya."

154
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:15,922
What?

155
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,859
That's how superiors address
the people below them.

156
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,129
You're just a bodyguard
that Grandpa hired.

157
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,266
Certainly, Mistress Aya.

158
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,303
That sounds so artificial.
A "Miss" would suffice.

159
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,376
Should private security be guarding him?

160
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,546
That old geezer Samejima always says
someone's after him,

161
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,481
but he has never been attacked.

162
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,886
It was over 20 years ago
that he was almost stabbed.

163
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,657
But if we miss the final attack,
the last 20 years will be for nothing.

164
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,928
If he's attacked...

165
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,531
we should welcome it.

166
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,533
Welcome it?

167
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,436
If he gets attacked the moment
the bodyguards take over,

168
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,873
it'll prove to people that
nobody is better than the SP.

169
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,814
If you want to get promoted,
you need to think like that.

170
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,582
I do want to be promoted...

171
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,652
but I won't be underhanded
with a private company.

172
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,858
Who the heck are those guys?

173
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,861
Those Hinode-whatever people.

174
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,532
They must be pretty formidable
if they've got you so upset.

175
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,414
This way.

176
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,255
Hello.

177
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,760
You all look well.

178
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,529
I had almost forgotten
what you looked like.

179
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,334
Thank you for coming,
Prime Minister Samejima.

180
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,238
I'd like to retire soon myself.

181
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,542
Prime Minister, your seat is here.

182
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,611
-Right.
-Thanks.

183
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:27,286
It seems the level of beauty among
female politicians has improved.

184
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,155
When I was in the Diet,

185
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,958
there was no such thing
as a beautiful Diet Member.

186
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
AIKO TACHIHARA
HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE MINISTER

187
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,130
Sir, you know how tame
the world has become, right?

188
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,400
You can be charged with sexual harassment
if you make jokes like that.

189
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,401
Hey, now.

190
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,108
Someone, help me!

191
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,545
Sir! You can't do this!

192
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,746
Get out of my way!

193
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,781
-Someone, help me!
-Let me through!

194
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,283
What's the commotion all about?

195
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,784
Please!

196
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,786
You have lots of enemies,
Secretary-General.

197
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,924
I'm the target.

198
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,991
What?

199
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,993
Actually,

200
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,630
my life has been in danger
for a while now.

201
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,898
Is that so?

202
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,135
I told the SP,
but they hardly looked into it.

203
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,938
They said old people don't need security,
and then abandoned me.

204
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,409
That's why I hired expert bodyguards
that are better than the SP.

205
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,677
Isn't that right?

206
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,149
Minister!

207
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,218
Minister!

208
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,453
Don't move! We won't let anyone through.

209
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,690
Detaching.

210
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,127
Stand back. This can be dangerous.

211
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,295
The target is my client.

212
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,864
-Someone, help me!
-Let me through!

213
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,465
Hey!

214
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,034
Let go of me!

215
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
It's you!

216
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,879
Minister!

217
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,815
Minister Igarashi!

218
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,219
Oh, my. It appears the target
is the Secretary-General.

219
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,754
Minister Igarashi!

220
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,789
What?

221
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,857
Minister!

222
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,463
-You...
-Minister!

223
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,532
Why are you avoiding me?

224
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,800
Get out of here now!

225
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,803
You told me you'd take care of me!

226
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,274
I took the blame for everything!

227
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,443
You broke your promise to me!

228
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,479
-Cut it out!
-Hey!

229
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,550
I've had enough of you!

230
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,554
Minister!

231
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,658
-Hey! Settle down!
-Come with us!

232
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,426
Minister!

233
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,962
-Minister!
-Sorry for the trouble.

234
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,332
The front guard
let your former secretary through.

235
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,867
We'll be more careful.

236
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,313
The intruder has been taken away.
Returning.

237
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,148
Roger.

238
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,023
1. SECURITY TARGET
KYOICHI SAMEJIMA, AGE 76, FORMER PM

239
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,827
You know, it seems like
things are going well.

240
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,863
We only just started this one.

241
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,497
That's not what I mean.

242
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,067
I'm talking about
the Personal Security team.

243
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,169
"We're finally working as a team."

244
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,505
"I think we can get along."
Were you going to say that?

245
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,241
Yes, I was.

246
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,077
I mean, you've come back,

247
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,713
and we found out
about Shimazaki's brilliant past.

248
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,715
It's like the rain has lifted.

249
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,883
It's "the fog has lifted."

250
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,584
But you do understand what I mean.

251
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,820
It's not going to be that easy.

252
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,857
But...

253
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,627
the boss has a secret too.

254
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,963
You noticed?

255
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,132
I may not look like it,
but I watch people closely.

256
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,005
Of course, I watch you too.

257
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,246
How come you have such great muscles?

258
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,316
I'm a bodyguard. It's only natural.

259
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,251
You need to drink some protein yourself.

260
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,869
The Ginza office is taking over.
Relieve some of the team.

261
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,903
Yes, sir.

262
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,873
Excuse me.

263
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:46,045
There's no need to hurt a man that much
when he's unarmed.

264
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,214
Personal protection means
completely eliminating any threat.

265
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,616
Is your definition different?

266
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,151
I'm not sympathizing with him.

267
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,120
You must be careful with someone
that angry, or they could retaliate.

268
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,121
Let's go.

269
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,157
Don't take that from this jerk.

270
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,797
Did he just call me a "jerk"?

271
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,199
Why...

272
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,373
<i>I've checked the perimeter.
Everything is safe.</i>

273
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,942
Thank you. I'll get you some tea.

274
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,479
Thank you, but we can't have any.

275
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,314
We'll need to use the restroom if we do.

276
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,317
I see.

277
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,357
I'm sorry for all the rude things
that my dad says.

278
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,858
It's all right.

279
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,996
After Mom died,
he became even more stubborn.

280
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,697
He gets out of hand.

281
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,802
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,408
It's all right. A bodyguard will also
listen to your complaints.

283
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,611
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

284
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,483
Dad will get angry if I speak too freely.

285
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,451
Even if that wasn't so,

286
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,321
since my marriage failed,
he doesn't appreciate me.

287
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,858
I heard you got divorced last year
and came back to live here.

288
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,160
That's right. My husband...

289
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,698
He had his own business,

290
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,967
but he was swindled
and his company went bankrupt.

291
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,905
Dad paid off his debts
in exchange for divorcing me.

292
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,077
I guess I'm spoiled.

293
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,946
No. Money is important.

294
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,149
If I didn't have the financial need,

295
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,251
I certainly wouldn't be a lady bodyguard.

296
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,755
You're very interesting.

297
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,524
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

298
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,298
By the way, didn't Aya only have
a half-day of school today?

299
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,299
Yes.

300
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,836
She's a little late.

301
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,271
I'll go pick her up.

302
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,273
Please don't.

303
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,443
I don't want her to be like me

304
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,246
and not be able to decide things
for herself.

305
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,615
<i>She'll come home on her own.</i>

306
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,750
Don't tell anyone.

307
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,787
-I like that stuff!
-It was the first time I went.

308
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,442
Those SPs from earlier

309
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,412
including Mr. Ochiai

310
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,882
are people I know
from my time with the police.

311
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,652
You were in the Security Bureau?

312
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,620
Right.

313
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,856
I only told you
I was a former police officer.

314
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,526
Sorry. You don't have to tell me this.

315
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,194
I'm not trying to hide it.

316
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,298
You told us about your past after all.

317
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,370
I made such a poor SP.

318
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,206
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

319
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,480
You're exactly the kind of person
who's usually very talented.

320
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,617
No.

321
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,253
I quit

322
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,356
because I made a terrible mistake.

323
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,290
A mistake?

324
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,961
It was over ten years ago.

325
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,532
I was guarding the foreign minister.

326
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,735
When he was attacked by a radical,

327
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,237
I fired my weapon.

328
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,872
Your pistol?

329
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,276
I meant to scare him,
and nobody was injured.

330
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,046
But the attacker didn't have a gun.

331
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,950
I was criticized
for unnecessarily firing my weapon.

332
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,619
It became hard to stay at my job.

333
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,160
I wasn't cut out
for being a police officer.

334
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,199
Are you sure?

335
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,401
What?

336
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,904
When I quit my job as a bodyguard...

337
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,777
I kept telling myself
that I wasn't cut out for it.

338
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,481
But now I'm back at it again.

339
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,756
I really believe that
my work is much better now.

340
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,962
Coordinating a group of people
with so much individuality

341
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,198
is far more rewarding.

342
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,170
Excuse me.

343
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,407
It's from Suganuma.

344
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,576
Hello, Shimazaki here.

345
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,813
What? Aya?

346
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,026
-Kiwako!
-Dad!

347
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,795
She still hasn't come home
an hour after school was let out.

348
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,797
-Did you search the area?
-I've looked everywhere.

349
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,666
What was the point of having you around?

350
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,867
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,770
I told her that she didn't have to
go pick her up.

352
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,607
How can a mother
put her own child in danger?

353
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,710
This is a kidnapping!

354
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,646
I'll call the police.

355
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,747
Don't!

356
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,149
I can't trust the police.

357
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,454
If we call the police,
the victim usually isn't returned!

358
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,861
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?

359
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,829
-No, I haven't.
-Thank you.

360
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,436
What are you doing? Relax, would you?

361
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,840
But I have to find her, no matter what.

362
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,078
That's what I love about you.

363
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,647
What?

364
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,283
That cleared your head, right?

365
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,819
What a jerk!

366
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,590
-Check over there.
-Yes, sir.

367
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,398
Excuse me.

368
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,734
-Can I ask you something?
-Okay.

369
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,803
Do you know Aya Samejima?

370
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,806
Yes. She was just at Mosaic Park.

371
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,207
-Is Mosaic Park that way?
-Yes.

372
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,175
Thanks.

373
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,444
-This must be it.
-Right.

374
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,980
There she is.

375
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,692
Who's that?

376
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,794
Miss Aya!

377
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,297
-After him!
-Got it!

378
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,333
Are you okay?

379
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,868
Who said you could touch me?

380
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,902
Sorry.

381
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,287
What did you talk about
with the man in the park?

382
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,591
Nothing.

383
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,093
He just asked for directions.

384
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,528
Where did he want to go?

385
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,563
The station.

386
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,867
But you've never seen him before, right?

387
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,705
Even if I knew him,
I'd say the same thing.

388
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,108
Miss Aya.

389
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,545
Why did you go to that park?

390
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,351
I was just wondering why
you were sitting all alone there.

391
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,322
Who cares? I can do what I want, right?

392
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,458
Aya! I'm sorry.

393
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,359
Aya!

394
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,164
It looks like my fears
turned out to be right.

395
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,534
We avoided the kidnapping,

396
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,005
but my enemy is trying
to put my family in danger.

397
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,741
Strengthen security tomorrow!

398
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,742
Yes, sir.

399
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,314
I'm home.

400
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:16,988
I'm home!

401
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,398
I've been meaning to tell you

402
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,733
that you could at least say
"welcome home" when I arrive.

403
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,404
Welcome home.

404
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,844
If you hate me that much,

405
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,980
then why don't you go back to your mom?

406
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,216
She called me.

407
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,319
She said you're welcome home anytime,
so come back home.

408
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,088
And that guy,

409
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,226
Odagiri.

410
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,429
Her new, young, and rich husband.

411
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,933
He also wants you to come back.

412
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,438
I don't mind going back, but I'm only here
because you'll be lonely.

413
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,507
What?

414
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,611
Who said I'll be lonely?

415
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,212
Who cares?

416
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,222
I guess you dealt with a lot
when we got divorced, didn't you?

417
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,129
Do you want some fried rice?

418
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,732
Sure, I'll eat your food.

419
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,570
You'll eat my food?
Then I'll cook for you.

420
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,072
Thank you so much.
It brought tears to my eyes.

421
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,978
You just smiled, didn't you?

422
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,181
You smiled. I know you did.

423
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,117
No, I didn't. Quit bugging me!

424
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,020
All right! That's what I call
a rebellious child!

425
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,156
Do I still have any? Oh, there's plenty.

426
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,298
Because I will get lonely.

427
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,671
Okay. Here we go.

428
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,185
So are you striking first this time?

429
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,220
Sorry to call you when you're so tired.

430
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,091
I have early morning duty tomorrow.
Keep it short.

431
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,228
Okay, I'll be direct.

432
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,600
Can you tell me anything about
the former Prime Minister Samejima?

433
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,868
Do you think I can?

434
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,604
I understand your position.

435
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:49,140
However, I was just hoping
you could give me a hint

436
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,476
that would make it easier
for us to protect him.

437
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,113
You mean, you want me
to return an old favor?

438
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,216
If I was in a position
to make that kind of deal,

439
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,952
I never would've quit the police force.

440
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,088
I'll be clear with you.

441
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,759
I never asked you to,
but you took the blame for me and quit.

442
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,596
That wasn't part of your duties.

443
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,200
I have no intention
of cooperating with you.

444
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,613
He didn't even drink anything, did he?

445
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,857
-Was it good?
-It was.

446
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,614
Hello? Good evening. It's Shimazaki.

447
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,052
I have an idea
about tomorrow's bodyguard job.

448
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,355
SAMEJIMA

449
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,935
Hold on a moment.

450
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,588
One stone.

451
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,492
No listening devices around the perimeter.

452
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,593
Same inside.

453
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,563
-I checked the family albums.
-I researched the past incident.

454
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,797
Thank you.

455
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,434
There was one stone.

456
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,303
Let's proceed according to the plan.

457
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,071
Time is 7:22 a.m.

458
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,607
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

459
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,777
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized. Everyone, into position.

460
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,213
Excuse me.

461
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,650
Everything is normal
inside and outside the house.

462
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,053
-You were very thorough, right?
-Yes, sir.

463
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,157
There will be three of us
guarding your home.

464
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,894
Also, since Aya will be going on
a field trip to a television station,

465
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,796
we'll accompany her.

466
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,765
No. No school for you today, Aya.

467
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,734
What? I want to go to the TV station.

468
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,769
Aya,

469
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:36,074
you were almost kidnapped yesterday.

470
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,979
I was looking forward to this.

471
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,714
We'll stick very close to her.

472
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,715
No!

473
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,850
Sir.

474
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:50,054
You hired bodyguards
so you could live your life normally.

475
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,261
I'll hold you responsible
if anything happens!

476
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,562
Yes, sir.

477
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,566
-It's big.
-Yes, it sure is big.

478
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,537
I wonder if we'll meet anyone.

479
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,005
That would be cool.

480
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,342
This way. Come this way.

481
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,313
This way. Make a line.

482
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,783
Okay, now this way. Let's go.

483
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,552
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

484
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,228
It's Matsuo!

485
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,932
Hello! Welcome!

486
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,601
-You're so pretty!
-Thank you.

487
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,136
Look at this.

488
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,241
BID-RIGGING FELLED IN A SINGLE STROKE

489
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,212
You were attacked in 1998, right?

490
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,482
Fortunately, SP shielded me,
so I wasn't injured.

491
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,219
The perpetrator got out of prison
a long time ago.

492
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,058
Only in Japan are you despised
for doing what's right.

493
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,596
-This TV station is cool!
-It sure is.

494
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,030
Let's stop for a moment, kids.

495
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,198
-Okay!
-Okay!

496
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,266
Look to your right.

497
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,401
-Wow, cool!
-Cool!

498
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,137
This is a recording studio
where we make TV programs.

499
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,441
-Look at that!
-Next, we'll go to the sub.

500
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,344
-What's a "sub"?
-Good question.

501
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,512
I wonder what's there?

502
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,114
I'm excited to find out.

503
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,620
Keep quiet here. Everyone is working.

504
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,724
That's Minister Tachihara.

505
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,027
This is the sub.

506
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,562
Amazing!

507
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,796
I want to be on TV.

508
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,765
I can't let you.

509
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,368
-Really?
-I want to be on TV too.

510
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,605
Talk with him. If you mention
my grandpa's name, he'll let me on.

511
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,475
But everyone is working.

512
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,977
I thought a bodyguard would do
anything I asked.

513
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,616
I can't let you bring your grandpa shame.

514
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,019
You're useless.

515
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,256
What about you?

516
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,227
Today's economy troubles me.
What do you think?

517
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,631
Well, I'm not optimistic about
the current state of the economy.

518
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,600
I would agree.

519
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,637
WRAP IT UP

520
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,608
Cut! You're hopeless!

521
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,777
-What's wrong?
-Do it in this order.

522
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,446
-Why?
-We're doing this part now.

523
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,481
If you don't say this part...

524
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,551
No, you need to do that.

525
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,594
I'll return to the studio later.
Thank you.

526
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,069
So you even came here
to guard his granddaughter?

527
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,906
It's my job to stick by her side,
no matter where she goes.

528
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,943
It's okay to talk now.

529
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,548
Mr. Ochiai and the others are
in the waiting room while I'm on TV.

530
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,616
Sorry, but I'm working now.

531
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,588
Shimazaki.

532
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,160
Excuse me.

533
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:22,900
Miss Aya!

534
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,271
The teacher will be angry
if you go off alone.

535
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,639
Stay away from me!

536
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,975
Okay, let's go.

537
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,512
Let go of me!

538
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,447
Let go!

539
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,384
Help!

540
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,285
Help me!

541
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,887
Hey, you!

542
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,223
-No, you've got it wrong.
-Who the heck are you?

543
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,725
I'm with Personal Security
at Hinode Security.

544
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,929
Aya!

545
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,446
I'll report you as a peeping tom.

546
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,282
Peeping tom?

547
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,595
Use another one.

548
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,465
I'm Aiko Tachihara.

549
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,801
Don't you remember me?

550
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,171
We met at your grandpa's retirement party.

551
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:38,109
You were a very cheeky granddaughter.

552
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,678
I'm not criticizing you.

553
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:45,183
If you're cheeky,
it means you're intelligent.

554
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,388
But don't you think locking yourself
in the restroom

555
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,590
is awfully childish?

556
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,071
It's good to see you again.

557
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,075
Thank you.

558
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,548
I guess there are places
that you can't go.

559
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,857
<i>This is 02.</i>

560
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,826
I've caught the perpetrator.

561
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,895
Roger.

562
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,699
We caught the perpetrator.

563
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,870
It was you? You troublemaker!

564
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:39,837
I'm sorry.

565
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,606
I'm very sorry!

566
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,312
I told you not to come around here again
once I took care of all your debts, right?

567
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,114
I'm terribly sorry, I just...

568
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:55,153
I wasn't able to give Aya
her birthday present.

569
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,991
Her birthday was long ago.
You're slow at everything you do.

570
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,593
And you're so easily deceived.

571
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,128
Cut it out, Dad!

572
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,898
You still like this moron?

573
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,801
Don't you remember
all the pain you went through?

574
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,850
Excuse me. This is for Aya.

575
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:34,992
Aya.

576
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,462
How did you contact him?

577
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,067
You don't have a mobile phone.
Was it that call?

578
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,137
Hello? This is the Samejima house.

579
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,272
<i>Aya. It's Dad.</i>

580
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,676
<i>I'll be waiting for you
on Wednesday at Mosaic Park.</i>

581
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,743
Okay.

582
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,478
Hello?

583
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,984
-Aya!
-Aya!

584
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,153
-Aya!
-You used the stones

585
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,822
as a signal to her, right?

586
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,826
<i>Four stones meant you'd call at 4:00 p.m.</i>

587
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,230
<i>One stone meant you'd meet at 1:00 p.m.</i>

588
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,839
Such impertinence!

589
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,143
Sir, I'm a useless person.

590
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,314
But I want to do whatever I can for Aya.

591
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,150
A debt-ridden father has no right
to see his child!

592
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,453
-Sir!
-What do you think you're doing?

593
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,487
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,991
You gave us an order.

595
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,995
You ordered us to protect
your life and your honor.

596
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,906
Prime Minister,
you made a request for an inquiry.

597
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:00,811
We investigated the criminal
who attacked you in 1998.

598
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,152
He died ten years ago.

599
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,023
The organization that suffered losses then
no longer exists either.

600
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,326
You aren't being targeted.

601
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,732
That's all I have to report.

602
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,305
Goodbye.

603
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,945
I'm not being targeted.

604
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,285
Not by anyone.

605
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,766
It's good to know you're safe.

606
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,805
Isn't that

607
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,276
what's most important?

608
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,979
The most important...

609
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,221
I'm sorry.

610
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,754
Grandpa.

611
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,156
Do you want to hold him?

612
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,519
Mr. Ochiai!

613
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,196
What's with you? You won't even stop
when you hear me calling.

614
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,100
Mr. Samejima seemed saddened.

615
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,440
Being targeted by someone
was like proof that he still existed.

616
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,212
Once someone has attracted attention,
they're not easily forgotten.

617
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,281
That's why I told him the truth.

618
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,817
That's very kind of you.

619
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,354
Don't flatter me with cheap comments.

620
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,258
That was "cheap"?

621
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,129
At any rate,

622
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,533
I never want to see you
where I'm working again.

623
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,244
-Nice work.
-Nice work.

624
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,649
I'm glad the plan worked.

625
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,152
Come to think of it,
when did you realize it was her dad?

626
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,189
She wasn't the least bit scared
when we found her at the park.

627
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,992
And there was no evidence
that he was targeted.

628
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,227
Also, kids

629
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,797
unexpectedly want
to protect their parents.

630
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,934
I'm only here because you'll get lonely.

631
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,272
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, it is.

632
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,309
I'm just checking,
but you're paying, aren't you, sir?

633
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,443
You're worried about that?

634
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,214
I'll pay, but please refrain
from ordering expensive stuff.

635
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,984
We sure aren't paid much
to put our lives on the line.

636
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,854
You're so right.
I wish that were different.

637
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,991
-Lobster with caviar sauce.
-You're going for that?

638
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,428
Then I'll have the Mexican chips
with avocado salad.

639
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,030
Wimpy food for a wimpy guy.

640
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,933
I'll have pickled mackerel carpaccio.

641
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,100
-Thank you.
-They have that?

642
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,969
-Yes, they do.
-That's so refined.

643
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,137
Filet mignon.

644
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,972
-What?
-Filet mignon?

645
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,774
Where do you see that?

646
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,108
Oh, I get it.

647
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,746
Wait, I thought you said
this was a waste of time.

648
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,847
Right. He did.

649
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,316
This is part of the job.

650
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,819
Can't you be honest?
You know you wanted to be with all of us.

651
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,589
-Roger.
-Anyway, let's take a picture.

652
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,590
What?

653
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,725
Why? Act your age, will you?

654
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,060
Come on. Why not?

655
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,128
Count me out.

656
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,431
There you go, ruining things again.

657
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,632
Leave him be.

658
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,134
Could you please
take the picture, Takanashi?

659
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,736
Right, take the picture.

660
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,738
Come on. Hurry up.

661
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:31,976
Take the picture.

662
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,478
Excuse me. Take a picture of us, please.

663
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,546
Sure.

664
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,182
It's ugly if something is missing.

665
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,618
Synchronized.

666
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,686
I don't understand what you mean.

667
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,521
It's all right. Okay, let's go.

668
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,056
Oh, all right.

669
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:47,992
Ready, go!

670
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,760
-Synchronized!
-Synchronized!

671
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,187
Sorry. Were you waiting long?

672
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,058
Don't talk like this is a date.

673
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,136
-Is this about Shun?
-No.

674
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,139
Then what is it?

675
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,441
Well,

676
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:45,182
I just happened to do a job
related to silent crank calls.

677
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,887
So it made me think about you.

678
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,691
You're kind even to strangers.

679
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,861
Can you give me the details?

680
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,367
-You won't laugh?
-No.

681
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,603
Someone

682
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,307
is targeting me.

683
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,381
I want you to protect me.

684
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,487
I'll handle it.

685
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,689
It's a good chance to show her
that he's a real pro.

686
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,025
<i>Did we talk like this six years ago?</i>

687
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,693
Things are different when you're divorced.

688
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,428
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

689
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,263
<i>It's all that woman's fault!</i>

690
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,866
<i>I'll never forgive her! I'll destroy her!</i>

691
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:36,934
A SHOCKING FAREWELL
