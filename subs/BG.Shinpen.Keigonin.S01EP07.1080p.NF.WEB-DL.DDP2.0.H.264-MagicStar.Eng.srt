1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,139
Don't you dare shoot yet!

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,343
There's one thing I want to say
before I die.

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,047
27 HOURS EARLIER

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,181
<i>Sorry. Were you waiting long?</i>

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,385
Don't talk like this is a date.

6
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:27,994
I just happened to do a job
related to silent crank calls.

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,932
So it made me think about you.

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,770
Can you give me the details?

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,106
-You won't laugh?
-No.

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,545
Someone

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,782
is targeting me.

12
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,320
When did it start?

13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,158
About three months ago, I think.

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,527
I see.

15
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,663
-Three months ago, isn't that...
-Yes.

16
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,667
It was right when Shun started
staying at your place.

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,438
Because of that, I didn't stop Shun.

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,945
Protect me.

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,787
Your ex-wife?

20
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,788
Yes.

21
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,326
But I'm still not sure
if someone really is after her.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,895
It's troubling though.

23
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,165
I'd like to take the job
and protect her, but...

24
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,635
I hate to be rude,
but what about the payment?

25
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,370
I doubt that'll be a problem.

26
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:49,042
But can I ask someone else
to be the BG for this?

27
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,111
Why?

28
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,246
She asked you personally.

29
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,681
I understand that,

30
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,718
but it's kind of hard to do this
for my ex-wife, you know.

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,354
-Why are you ashamed?
-I'm not ashamed.

32
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,789
I can't be wholly professional.

33
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,925
I get it! If you protect her well,
your love will return...

34
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,361
No, it won't! She's remarried.

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,697
An affair with your ex-wife
would be quite novel.

36
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,700
-I'm sorry.
-Now, now.

37
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,902
I understand how Shimazaki feels.

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,006
Even surgeons don't want to operate
on their own family.

39
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,510
The client is a woman,
so Suganuma is the best choice.

40
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,379
-Okay.
-First, I'll go and talk to her.

41
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647
Thank you.

42
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,817
-Thank you.
-I'll take care of it.

43
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,120
-Thank goodness.
-What's your ex-wife's address?

44
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,321
I'll get it.

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,828
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

46
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,164
Just as I thought.

47
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,732
Have a seat.

48
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,667
Thank you.

49
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,938
I didn't think he would want
to do this himself.

50
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,107
Will that be a problem?

51
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,408
No.

52
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,246
I only asked him because I don't know
any other security companies.

53
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,981
Let's get started.

54
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,786
May I ask why you feel threatened?

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,854
All right.

56
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,758
Sometimes I get mysterious calls,

57
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,162
and it's like someone
is following me when I go to work.

58
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,364
Where do you work?

59
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,169
I do flower arranging
for many different shops.

60
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,239
How exquisite.

61
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,775
How nice it must be
to live in a lovely home

62
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,277
and arrange beautiful flowers
for a living.

63
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,780
Arranging flowers takes
a lot of energy, you know.

64
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,150
The flowers in my garden were destroyed.

65
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,925
As soon as I replant my flowers,
they get destroyed like this.

66
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,563
At first, I thought it was done by cats,
but this is the third time in a row.

67
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,131
It frightens me.

68
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,269
I see your husband runs a biotech company.

69
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,671
-That's right.
-What does he think?

70
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,575
I haven't told my husband.

71
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,447
He's working overseas right now.

72
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,084
It's hard to tell him that
something strange is happening

73
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,319
while he's away.

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,990
I don't have definite proof
that someone's after me either.

75
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,026
I thought it was best
to talk with Shimazaki,

76
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:25,965
then maybe I could get
some kind of clues to work with.

77
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,625
<i>This way, please.</i>

78
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,238
It's awfully unusual for you
to invite me out.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,473
I didn't invite you out.

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,375
I just want to talk.

81
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,079
That's still inviting me out.
Oh, forget it.

82
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,348
What do you want to talk about?

83
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,649
-Two beers.
-Got it.

84
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,618
-You already know.
-I have no idea!

85
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,088
No. You already know.

86
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,528
Is this about my wife? I mean, my ex.

87
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,664
You should be her BG.

88
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,939
Can I order?

89
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,006
After we talk.

90
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,778
You know, it's like you're always
angry about something.

91
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,114
But you're angrier than usual now.

92
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,419
-Your wife is frightened.
-My ex-wife.

93
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,455
How can you be a pro
if you can't protect a frightened lady?

94
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,860
What?

95
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,828
It's just...

96
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,832
I never thought a guy like you
would say "lady."

97
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,801
-Is it strange?
-No, not at all.

98
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,672
Whether a lady has status or is athletic,

99
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,275
ladies are still physically weak
and cannot be compared to a man.

100
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,010
They have to be protected.

101
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,112
Well, I guess you're right.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,481
Here you are.

103
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,317
We're still not done.

104
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,356
You can say anything you like
about male superiority,

105
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,458
but that's reality.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,462
You're a real romantic, aren't you?

107
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,165
-Cut that out.
-Sorry.

108
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,068
Anyway, thanks.

109
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,905
I'll think it over.

110
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,342
I'm glad to hear it.

111
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,946
Is it all right to order now?

112
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,947
Go ahead.

113
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,384
By the way, the best food here
is the cheap stuff.

114
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,286
What do you recommend?

115
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,520
I recommend...

116
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,857
this stuff, like chicken skin.

117
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,958
Chicken skin?

118
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,502
-Chicken skin.
-Chicken skin.

119
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,705
Nomoto is done for.

120
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,943
-He got carried away.
-You're so right.

121
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,048
We need someone from your side
to be his opponent.

122
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,449
Okay.

123
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,986
I want the newscaster Kawakami to run.

124
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,357
He may not look like it,
but he's easily seduced by women.

125
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,162
It's time to do your thing.

126
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,633
If I succeed,
I expect a big reward, you know.

127
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,030
Excuse me.

128
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,299
Minister, are you feeling all right?

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,767
YOSHIAKI OCHIAI
SECURITY BUREAU (SP), MPD

130
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,736
No matter how high I go,

131
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,072
I always feel like
I'm just a party hostess.

132
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,875
You must be wondering, Mr. Ochiai...

133
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,345
why it took me so long to realize that.

134
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,881
No.

135
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,817
"No"?

136
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,288
Please be frank with me.

137
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,624
Tell me, "Don't be weak."

138
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,461
Or even, "Quit if you don't like it."
Tell me anything.

139
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,000
I believe I understand your feelings.

140
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:33,172
However, I'd like to keep
my personal opinions to myself.

141
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,676
You're quite admirable.

142
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,612
You never break the rules.

143
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,953
You become vulnerable
when you break rules.

144
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,024
My duty is to keep you safe, Minister.

145
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,612
Good evening.

146
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,815
What?

147
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,150
Please come in.

148
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,585
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,088
Come in.

150
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,593
My silly son will be home
from cram school soon.

151
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,195
It's all right.

152
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,470
-Here, Shimazaki.
-Yes?

153
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,740
Oh, thank you.
I'll get you something to drink.

154
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,907
Thank you.

155
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,786
I spoke to Hitomi Odagiri.

156
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,156
Okay.

157
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,996
It appears it's not just her imagination.

158
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,674
INVESTIGATION REPORT

159
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,981
If we provide private security
for several days and try several methods,

160
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,816
I think we can solve this issue.

161
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,822
This is a difficult request,

162
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,093
but Hitomi is depending on you, isn't she?

163
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,665
Don't you think you should
respect her wishes?

164
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,375
Welcome home.

165
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,481
Nice to meet you. I'm Murata.
I work with your dad.

166
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,418
Hey, at least say hello!

167
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,754
It's all right. Actually...

168
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,092
I bought some steamed meat buns,
so don't you want to try some?

169
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,034
I'm Shun Shimazaki.

170
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,635
Thank you.

171
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,238
Not all of them. What are you doing?

172
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,509
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

173
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,213
He's in his second year of middle school.

174
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,383
Even my son is still rebellious at age 19.

175
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,719
In fact,

176
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,957
my wife once asked me for a divorce.

177
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,662
They say a bodyguard is only
a real pro after he gets divorced.

178
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,966
I'm surprised you stayed together.

179
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,371
The amount of effort it took
would make you weep.

180
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,173
Really?

181
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
Actually,

182
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,378
all I did was work as hard as I could.

183
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,582
Let's have these while they're hot.

184
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,817
Thanks.

185
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,688
This place makes delicious ones.

186
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,297
Thank you.

187
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,538
Oh, that's good.

188
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,049
Everyone, with regard to
Hitomi Odagiri's personal security,

189
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,151
I'll handle it.

190
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,989
-Thank you, Shimazaki.
-Yes, sir.

191
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,259
We'll also be starting
the Overlook Coop security today.

192
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,028
That's yours, Takanashi and Suganuma.

193
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,396
-Yes, sir.
-Understood.

194
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,965
SATOSHI ODAGIRI (HUSBAND)

195
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,702
I'll be running backup for you,
so please check in every hour.

196
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,837
Roger.

197
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,040
The time is 9:35 a.m. and 52 seconds.

198
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,241
Wait! What?

199
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,110
-What?
-You're off. Is your battery dead?

200
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,549
Why today of all days?

201
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,750
Is something wrong?

202
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:12,952
No. Nothing.

203
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,659
Use mine. I'll be here all day.

204
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,962
Thanks for this.

205
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,467
-See you later.
-Bye.

206
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,501
Bye.

207
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,377
-Ta-da!
-What?

208
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,979
No way!

209
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,715
That's a necessity for your work, right?

210
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,251
Yes, but...

211
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,254
Come on. Try it on.

212
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,662
What?

213
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,465
What? You're acting funny.

214
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,869
Why are you silent?
What is it? What's wrong?

215
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,171
-Actually...
-What?

216
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,075
I want to...

217
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,145
protect you forever.

218
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,948
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

219
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,752
You are so darn ordinary!

220
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,355
Okay.

221
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,060
I want to protect you forever.

222
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,695
-What?
-What?

223
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,297
Look, you're angry now.

224
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,301
-No, I'm not angry at all.
-Yes, you are.

225
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,537
-I'm not angry at all.
-You're really angry.

226
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,771
Look at you.

227
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,773
You're angry. Oh, you scared me!

228
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,547
Oh, you!

229
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,616
-I'll do the protecting.
-Then protect me.

230
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,661
I'm Shimazaki
from Hinode Security Service.

231
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,232
Thank you, Mr. Bodyguard.

232
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,874
I'm Hitomi Odagiri.

233
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,314
-You'll be going out to work today?
-Right.

234
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,649
I'll escort you everywhere.
Don't you worry.

235
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,620
This feels kind of weird.
Anyway, thank you.

236
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,456
I also have a request
to help me protect you.

237
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
What's that?

238
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,827
Cooperation from your family is essential.

239
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,831
Please inform your husband
that we're providing you with security.

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,037
My husband spends all his energy
on his work every day.

241
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,173
I don't want to cause him any undue worry.

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,174
Then...

243
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,511
if you're in danger,

244
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,281
please allow me to contact your husband.

245
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,584
All right.

246
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,321
I have a request too.

247
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,590
Yes? What is it?

248
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,660
By chance,
if anything should happen to me,

249
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,364
I want you to take good care of Shun.

250
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,669
Understood.

251
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,077
Personal security commencing now.

252
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,579
-We're going to Meguro.
-<i>Roger.</i>

253
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,084
Estimated time of arrival, 2:05 p.m.

254
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,118
<i>Roger.</i>

255
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,994
There.

256
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,164
-Shall I carry this?
-It's okay. This is for my work.

257
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,331
Take these.

258
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,300
All right.

259
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,537
After becoming a freelancer,
I carried this all around

260
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,238
and got more clients.

261
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,442
I met my husband at his company
when I provided them arrangements.

262
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,913
You must be happy you've been blessed
with a wonderful husband.

263
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,447
Is that sarcasm?

264
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,750
I heard from Shun.

265
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,021
He's young, rich, talented, and kind.

266
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,890
I bet he said
he's the exact opposite of you.

267
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,293
That's exactly right.

268
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,827
Time to get started.

269
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,829
-Can you wait here?
-I'll be over there.

270
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,798
All right.

271
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,300
My apologies. I'm working now.

272
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,270
Really? It's not personal business?

273
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,908
I often go to that restaurant.

274
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,145
I wanted to apologize to you
for being rude the other day.

275
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,083
I was going to treat you
to some wine and lunch.

276
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,820
How about dining with me once?

277
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,689
We're a different class of people.

278
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,260
Oh, my! You certainly have
a high opinion of yourself.

279
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,730
I don't like comments
meant to toy with a man.

280
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,170
Don't trouble yourself. Goodbye.

281
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,373
Mr. Shimazaki,

282
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,710
do you enjoy your work?

283
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,651
Is it fun being a bodyguard?

284
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,856
I mean, you exert
all this effort for others,

285
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,825
but not for yourself.

286
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,695
You work in their shadow.

287
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,566
But...

288
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,505
don't you do your job
for the benefit of others too?

289
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,145
I'm sorry. It was rude of me
to compare myself to you.

290
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,281
My apologies. Goodbye.

291
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,791
Thank you.

292
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,730
Go ahead.

293
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,419
Okay.

294
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,323
You're going to a flower shop
in Ebisu for supplies next, right?

295
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,792
You really know your stuff.

296
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,886
It's like a groper is after me.

297
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,421
Don't turn around.

298
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,089
Keep walking.

299
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,830
You were second in the prefecture
in the 1km run back in high school, right?

300
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,067
It was in the 800 meters run.
Why do you remember that?

301
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,104
Turn right at the stairs,
then turn at the next corner.

302
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,873
-I'll carry this.
-What? Why?

303
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,841
Please pick up your pace.

304
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,947
-Go down.
-Okay.

305
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,992
-Left!
-Okay.

306
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,702
Stop here.

307
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,941
Wait here.

308
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,648
What do you want?

309
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,252
Who the heck are you?
What are you to that woman?

310
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,987
"That woman"?

311
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,422
That woman, Hitomi.

312
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,959
She's a thief who stole what was mine!

313
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,129
Calm down.

314
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,200
You're the one
who's been following Hitomi,

315
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,868
making silent crank calls,

316
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,370
and destroying her flowers, right?

317
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,371
Am I wrong?

318
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,275
You see, it's all that woman's fault!

319
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,718
That hurt!

320
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,797
I dated Satoshi for three years.

321
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,534
I could understand
if she was a young woman,

322
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,004
but why did he marry
an older woman with a kid?

323
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,840
I'll never forgive her!

324
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,543
I'll destroy her!

325
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,611
Stop it!

326
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,546
Stay back!

327
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,315
Let me talk to her.

328
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,256
Please calm down.

329
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,798
You're Shoko, aren't you?

330
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,902
He told me your name.

331
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,872
Give him back.

332
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,480
-I met Satoshi after you two broke up...
-Give him back!

333
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,151
I can't do that.

334
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,321
Satoshi isn't an object
that belongs to me.

335
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,857
He doesn't belong to anyone.

336
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,871
Why are you patronizing me?

337
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,241
What's wrong with you?

338
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,883
Would you like to file charges
with the police?

339
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,386
No.

340
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,158
If I were her,
I wouldn't come after me again.

341
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,862
Understood.

342
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,367
At least it didn't turn into
anything serious.

343
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,039
Is your mission complete?

344
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,242
I'll take you home.

345
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,149
Is it possible to add an extra service?

346
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,753
An extra service?

347
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:24,576
MESSAGE: YOU, MOM, AND I ARE HAVING
DINNER TOGETHER IN MEGURO. DAD

348
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,077
What?

349
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,748
Roger. Report received and acknowledged.

350
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,423
By order of the client,
Shimazaki will be dining with her.

351
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,924
I see.

352
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,961
Well then...

353
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,764
This could be bad
if they hit it off again.

354
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,200
I mean, she's married to a rich guy.
Zaki will be in big trouble.

355
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,268
Cut that out.

356
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,498
-If you insist. Thank you.
-Please.

357
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,003
I haven't seen Shun in a while.
Has he grown?

358
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,771
Actually, just now,

359
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,842
he said their practice is running late,
so he wants us to start without him.

360
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,115
Thank you.

361
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,652
Can I give you an order?

362
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,921
What?

363
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,925
During dinner, talk normally with me.
You're being too stuffy.

364
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,694
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,163
I mean, okay.

366
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,698
Order anything. I'm paying.

367
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,733
No. I'll pay.

368
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,868
No, it's all right. You saved me today.

369
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,738
-That's my job.
-Okay, then we'll go Dutch?

370
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,574
I can't do that either.
I'm his father after all.

371
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,410
You said "after all," didn't you?

372
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,745
Right?

373
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,548
You've really matured.

374
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,053
Did we talk like this six years ago?

375
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:21,993
No.

376
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,496
I didn't think so.

377
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,402
You should tell your husband everything.

378
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,542
You're right.

379
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,313
But he's six years younger.
I have to act more mature.

380
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,215
Being divorced doesn't help either.

381
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,718
Is that anything to tell your ex-husband?

382
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,688
Well, things are different
when you're divorced.

383
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,800
-Any reservation changes?
-None, sir.

384
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,701
-Good. Proceed.
-Thank you.

385
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,737
-So can I order?
-Oh, sure.

386
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,164
You are here on personal business
just as I thought.

387
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,332
No.

388
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,342
These are beautiful flowers.

389
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:54,819
Excuse me.

390
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,861
I'm sorry to cause you this trouble.

391
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:07,866
No one knows who might be listening
if we used the usual restaurant.

392
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,302
Are you serious about this?

393
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
Yes.

394
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,274
Please allow me to leave the party.

395
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,111
What do you think you can do

396
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,747
if you leave me?

397
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,016
I want to...

398
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,353
become a politician.

399
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,858
<i>That was Minister Tachihara, wasn't it?</i>

400
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,360
Do you know her?

401
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:41,099
-I know her through work.
-As a bodyguard? For a minister?

402
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,168
Amazing!

403
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,240
No. She's the amazing one.
I just work in her shadow.

404
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,609
Why are you so amazed?

405
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,213
You're amazing.
You do so many amazing things.

406
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,781
CHIEF MURATA
INCOMING CALL

407
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,516
HINODE BUILDING

408
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,286
Really? A date with his ex-wife?

409
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,289
The boss got angry when I said that.
This is an important mission.

410
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,491
It's a good chance to show her
that he's a real pro.

411
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,960
Men have a hard time getting over things.

412
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,229
Especially guys like Shimazaki.

413
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,773
This place is on my way home.

414
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,041
What?

415
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,376
-I had it repaired.
-You didn't have to do that.

416
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,485
I thought this watch
was important for today.

417
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,190
You figured it out?

418
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:45,196
Actually, my wife gave me my watch
as a present too.

419
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,401
Then...

420
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,237
Synchronized?

421
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:54,839
Synchronized.

422
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,843
Thank you. You've been a great help.

423
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,257
Boss.

424
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:20,932
That guy...

425
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,669
<i>Minister!</i>

426
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,970
-Someone, help me!
-Let me through!

427
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,042
Minister Igarashi!

428
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,245
You told me you'd take care of me!

429
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,082
I took the blame for everything!

430
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,587
The Secretary-General
and Minister Tachihara are meeting

431
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,654
on the second floor.

432
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,257
I doubt this is a coincidence.

433
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,460
-Where's the SP?
-On standby upstairs.

434
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,603
Minister Tachihara is in a meeting.

435
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,272
Okay. Sorry, but can we talk for a moment?

436
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,717
See the man at the table
on the first floor wearing glasses?

437
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,467
Thank you for the information.

438
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,155
Let's get out of here.

439
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,190
What?

440
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,325
We just ordered.

441
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,693
I know that.

442
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,638
What? Why the serious look?

443
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,740
It might not be safe here.

444
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:10,908
It might not be safe?

445
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,281
Excuse me.

446
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,153
Allow me to see Mr. Igarashi.

447
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,488
I can't do that.

448
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,159
I want to apologize for the other day.

449
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,329
I know you're here!

450
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,835
I just want a moment. Let me apologize.

451
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,704
I don't need your apologies.

452
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,040
Go away!

453
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,110
Mr. Igarashi says he won't talk to you.

454
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,045
Please leave.

455
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,253
Then...

456
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,489
can I die here?

457
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,260
What are you talking about?

458
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,530
I wanted to apologize to him.

459
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,501
Then if he apologized to me too,

460
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,571
I thought I could continue living.

461
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,340
Quit talking nonsense.

462
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,744
Go on. Get out.

463
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,285
I wonder...

464
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,722
what I should do to assure my death.

465
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,861
It wasn't easy to get this.

466
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,900
Tell me what's going on.
Shun still isn't here either.

467
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,037
What? What is it?

468
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,706
I'll explain after we leave.

469
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,087
Stay calm.

470
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,755
I won't let anyone touch you two.

471
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,396
Get down!

472
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,765
Get to the corner!

473
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,648
Why? Why do I have to be
the only one to die?

474
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,317
I was tricked.

475
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,786
It's insane.

476
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,922
It's totally insane.

477
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,959
I'll aim for the leg.

478
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,427
No! Don't you dare shoot!

479
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,829
Shooting is a last resort.

480
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,131
I'm on my way.

481
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,771
So is anyone willing to die with me?

482
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,172
No!

483
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,742
Quit making such a ruckus!

484
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,653
Excuse me.

485
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,522
Can I talk?

486
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,193
I won't do anything, so take it easy.

487
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,464
You're SP, aren't you?

488
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,699
No! I'm not.

489
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,002
I'm a private bodyguard.

490
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,538
I'm here on personal business.

491
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,109
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

492
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,083
I want to talk with Mr. Igarashi.

493
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,720
It's all right.

494
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,291
Okay. All right.

495
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,662
If that's what you want,

496
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,633
then you won't mind
if everyone here leaves, right?

497
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,568
They're not involved, right?

498
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:02,973
There's no need to needlessly
make your crime worse, right?

499
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,677
I'll make sure you talk to Mr. Igarashi.

500
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,980
Bring him here now!

501
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,615
Okay.

502
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,353
All right. I'll bring him.

503
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,958
Just keep pointing that right here.

504
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,262
But don't you dare shoot yet!

505
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,735
There's one thing I want to say
before I die.

506
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,809
Actually, I was going to
have dinner here today

507
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,946
with my ex-wife and son.

508
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,915
That may not have anything to do with you,

509
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:50,054
but it's the first time I'm having dinner
with my whole family in six years.

510
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,656
It was meant to be special.

511
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,425
Who cares? Hurry up!

512
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,960
Sorry! Okay!

513
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,129
So you see...

514
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,299
my wife, I mean my ex-wife...

515
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,136
I want to apologize to her.

516
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,853
It was all my fault.

517
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,891
I'm sorry. I apologize.

518
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,844
I was a terrible husband to her.

519
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,614
I made a mistake at work,
got depressed, and went nuts.

520
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,651
I took it all out on her.

521
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,122
It was only natural that
she got sick of me and got rid of me.

522
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,660
I never once

523
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,730
apologized to her.

524
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,733
What's wrong with people?

525
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,506
Even when we know we're wrong,
we can't apologize.

526
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,510
Hurry up!

527
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,479
You've got to be kidding me!

528
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,951
You still don't get it, do you?

529
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:31,188
I didn't get sick of you.
I'm not that cold a person.

530
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,192
I only left you to put a scare into you.

531
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,962
You wanted to put a scare into me?

532
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:38,996
-That's right.
-What?

533
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,164
I said that's right.

534
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,734
I thought you never wanted
to see me again!

535
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,603
You were wrong as always!

536
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,506
You're the one
who said you wanted a divorce!

537
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,608
I went away for your sake and Shun's!

538
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,344
You just wanted an easy life. That's all!

539
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,112
You're not even wearing
the watch I gave you!

540
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,447
-Yes, I am.
-You're right. What?

541
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,782
It happened to be broken,
and I got it back just now.

542
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,950
"Happened to"?

543
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,787
So it returned just in time for me?
What a lucky coincidence.

544
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,423
Yes, just like us,
things go wrong at the wrong time!

545
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,460
-That's so right!
-Quit your arguing!

546
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,362
Who cares about that right now?

547
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,296
Sorry.

548
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,498
Put your gun down.

549
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,704
-Go!
-This way. Stay calm.

550
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,607
Go!

551
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,911
This way, please.

552
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,030
That's hot.

553
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,401
That's odd. He missed his hourly check-in.

554
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,404
Maybe he and his wife are hitting it off.

555
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,340
Oh, come on.
He's working with a client, you know.

556
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,208
-But it's his wife.
-His ex-wife.

557
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,547
That guy is the type who would contact us
even when it's unnecessary.

558
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,617
Okay, I'll call him.

559
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,300
Let me hear what you have to say.

560
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,173
You're pointing a gun at me.

561
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,875
How can I talk to you?

562
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,719
All right.

563
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,622
I'll put my gun down.

564
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,297
Put your gun down too.

565
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,571
You're the one who...

566
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:01,505
Hey!

567
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,342
I've had enough of you!

568
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,080
I'm sorry for what I did.

569
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,719
If you really feel that way,
bring Mr. Igarashi here.

570
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,688
I'll give him your message.

571
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,294
In the corruption scandal four years ago,

572
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,831
Mr. Igarashi made a promise to me.

573
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,570
That's why I took all the blame!

574
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,008
It was the typical "My secretary did it."

575
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,246
But he didn't keep his promise!

576
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,883
You tricked me, Mr. Igarashi!

577
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,753
Of course, you should apologize to me!

578
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,525
Hurry up and bring him here
and have him apologize to me.

579
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,063
After I see that, I will die.

580
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,833
Can I apologize instead?

581
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,901
No!

582
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,106
I'll apologize for my rudeness
the other day as well.

583
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,509
I apologize.

584
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,579
I'm terribly sorry.

585
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,489
Is that still not enough?

586
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,671
I told you, there's no point
in you apologizing!

587
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,840
Stop this foolishness, Ueno!

588
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,911
Remember what I told you four years ago?

589
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,380
If I took the blame,

590
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,916
it would throw politics
and the people into confusion.

591
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,453
It's the secretary's job to prevent that.

592
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,990
You did a good job!

593
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,527
You're lying!

594
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:09,733
You pinned the blame on me
and then abandoned me!

595
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,036
The least you can do is apologize!

596
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,738
You should apologize!

597
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,109
Take responsibility
for this outrage by dying!

598
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,210
Sir!

599
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,813
What's wrong?
Isn't that why you came here?

600
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,082
The only thing a shameless man
like you can do

601
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,017
is die a quick death!

602
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,418
Don't talk like that, sir!

603
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,921
I won't allow pointless deaths!

604
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,926
Apologize!

605
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,677
Come with us!

606
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:54,945
I'm sorry!

607
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,381
I'm sorry!

608
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,716
Boss?

609
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,151
I'm sorry!

610
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,319
Boss!

611
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,691
-I've been shot.
-I'll stop the bleeding.

612
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,696
Are you all right?

613
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,236
Thank goodness it wasn't my heart.

614
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,444
<i>The 40-year-old male perpetrator
was arrested at the scene.</i>

615
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,948
<i>But as you can see,
the area is still bustling</i>

616
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,383
<i>with activity by police-related personnel.</i>

617
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,085
<i>Someone has just exited.</i>

618
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,553
MAN ARMED WITH PISTOL TAKEN INTO CUSTODY

619
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,255
<i>Secretary-General Igarashi just exited.</i>

620
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,591
<i>Civil Party Secretary-General
Igarashi just exited.</i>

621
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,327
<i>I think that's Minister Tachihara too.</i>

622
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:48,232
<i>-That's Minister Tachihara.
-A man fired a gun at someone.</i>

623
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,533
<i>Coming through!</i>

624
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:53,370
<i>Just now, emergency medical
personnel are coming out.</i>

625
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:57,841
Emergency medical personnel
have exited pushing a stretcher.

626
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,245
There appears to be a male victim
on the stretcher.

627
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:06,416
According to employees at the scene,
the male victim was shot in the leg

628
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,086
and has bled quite a lot.

629
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,654
His life could be in danger.

630
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,066
Thanks.

631
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,534
Thank you.

632
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,803
What happened?
There has been mass confusion.

633
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,205
I'll explain everything later.

634
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,874
Are you okay?

635
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,409
I'll be all right.

636
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,445
Thank you very much.

637
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,383
Thank you too.

638
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,486
-Thank you for what?
-What?

639
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,187
Thank you for what?

640
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,791
Mission complete.

641
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,696
Goodbye.

642
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,700
Take care of your mother.

643
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,678
Excuse me.

644
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,918
Even though we were here,
we allowed a civilian to be injured.

645
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,253
I'm terribly sorry.

646
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:19,990
It's okay.

647
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,127
Nobody died.

648
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,364
Don't worry about it.

649
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:34,938
Excuse me.

650
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,344
The gunshot wound to his leg
damaged an artery

651
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,279
and may have fractured his femur.

652
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,147
We're taking him
to Dogami General Hospital.

653
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,283
Dogami General Hospital. Okay. Thank you.

654
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,151
Let's go.

655
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,298
He's going to Dogami General Hospital.

656
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:02,966
-Let's go.
-He was shot...

657
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,404
He was shot means he was shot, right?

658
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,575
-I can't believe this.
-Pull yourself together!

659
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,877
That's what being a bodyguard is!

660
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:16,780
Let's go.

661
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,416
Boss.

662
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,819
I've informed your family.

663
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,690
Thank you.

664
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,995
Your son answered.
He said they'll be on their way soon.

665
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,703
You said he was being rebellious.

666
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,010
He was actually very proper.
He even thanked me.

667
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,313
Really?

668
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,783
Is that so?

669
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,824
I hope my Shun turns out like that.

Shimazaki.

672
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,496
Yes?

673
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,169
Is your watch

674
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,705
all right?

675
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,710
Yes. It's working perfectly.

676
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,083
-I'm glad to hear it.
-Thank you.

677
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,667
The time is 6:14 p.m...

678
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,503
and five seconds.

679
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,242
Synchronized.

680
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,482
Synchronized.

681
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,298
Can I cover him with this?

682
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,343
You told me

683
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,250
to be the bodyguard for my wife.

684
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,921
I'm glad I did it.

685
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,700
I realized

686
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,106
that our time as a married couple
doesn't disappear.

687
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,045
Thank you.

688
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:08,885
Sorry.

689
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,293
What's going on?

690
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,794
Let me check the electrodes.

691
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,065
-Cardiac arrest!
-Okay!

692
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,167
-I need to sit there.
-Okay.

693
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,169
-Get ready.
-Okay.

694
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,341
You must be kidding.

695
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,413

FINAL CHAPTER

698
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,413
Can you make public
what happened that day?

699
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,282
I didn't see the moment of the shooting.

700
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,351
<i>The recording on the day
of the shooting has been deleted.</i>

701
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,753
The only thing I did was
I just stuck with the police.

702
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,256
<i>We don't have status, power, or weapons,</i>

703
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,524
but the one thing we had
was stolen from us!
