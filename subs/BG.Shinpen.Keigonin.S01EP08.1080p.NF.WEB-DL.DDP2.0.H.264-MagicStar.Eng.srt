1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,902
Bring him here now!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>In the corruption scandal
four years ago...</i>

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,642
you pinned the blame on me
and then abandoned me!

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,478
The least you can do is apologize!

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,679
You should apologize!

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,580
Sir!

7
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,016
The only thing a shameless man
like you can do

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,417
is die a quick death!

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,651
Don't talk like that, sir!

10
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,553
I won't allow pointless deaths!

11
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,157
Apologize!

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,601
Are you all right?

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,903
<i>The gunshot wound to his leg
damaged an artery</i>

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,938
<i>and may have fractured his femur.</i>

15
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,941
<i>I've informed your family.</i>

16
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,012
Your son answered.
He said they'll be on their way soon.

-Yes?

00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,358
The time is 6:14 p.m.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,261

Synchronized.

23
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,485
What's going on?

24
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,420
-Cardiac arrest!
-Okay!

25
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,456
-I need to sit there.
-Okay.

26
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,890
-Get ready.
-Okay.

27
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,929
You must be kidding.

28
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,165

29
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,235
-Give me that.
-Mr. Murata!

TOKYO FIRE AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT AGENCY

31
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,484
Mr. Murata!

32
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,065
The shooter is Yugo Ueno.
He's 48 years old and unemployed.

33
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,168
From 2001 to 2014,

34
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,770
he was the private secretary
for Secretary-General Igarashi.

35
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,039
Secretary-General Igarashi's
private secretary?

36
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,276
According to his statement,
the pistol used in the crime

37
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,079
was acquired for the purpose
of committing suicide.

38
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,082
Other elements of the case
are still under investigation.

39
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,551
That is all.

40
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,120
-What? That's it?
-It's over? Hey!

41
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,524
Mr. Hikawa!

42
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,659
-Mr. Hikawa.
-The SP were at the scene, correct?

43
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,994
They messed up, didn't they?

44
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,497
The SP's mission
is to protect important people.

45
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,132
They carried out that mission.

46
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,635
But a civilian has died!

47
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,503
Is protecting VIPs all they do?

48
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,340
I heard that the victim struggled
with the enraged shooter.

49
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,209
-Really?
-It's terribly regrettable.

50
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,878
You mean the victim provoked the shooter?

51
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,381
You saw the shots being fired,
didn't you, Minister?

52
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,249
What happened?

53
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:07,153
I was being protected by the SP,

54
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,322
so I didn't see
the moment of the shooting.

55
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,326
Minister, the victim
was a private bodyguard, right?

56
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,396
How did he provoke the shooter?

57
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,631
No matter the cause,

58
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,569
it doesn't change the fact that
a precious life has been lost.

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,940
I wish to express
my sincerest condolences.

60
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,177
Minister, we demand an explanation.

61
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,583
GORO MURATA
FUNERAL, MARCH 2ND, 10:00 A.M.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,239
-Hey!
-Cut that out!

63
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,773
Stop that!

64
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,010
-Don't get violent!
-Hey! That hurts!

65
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,313
You don't have to get violent!

66
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,982
I knew it.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,820
-Yoichi.
-Dad was a fool.

68
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,156
You're wrong.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,362
He never provoked the shooter.

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,800
Your father worked
until the very end as a bodyguard

71
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,703
to protect the lives of everyone there.

72
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,340
Then...

73
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,243
why is this happening?

74

POLICE VERIFY VICTIM'S WORDS
PROVOKED RESTAURANT SHOOTER

77
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,688
It's like Dad was shot
because he meddled in the affair.

78
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,160
Madam...

79
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,828
Yoichi...

80
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,799
I won't let your father
be disgraced like this.

81
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,968
I'll work hard to clear this up.

82
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:02,969
Impossible.

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,173
The police and politicians are cooperating
to blame the bodyguard.

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,045
The dead cannot speak.

85
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,316
Bodyguards are nothing more than
underpaid slave labor!

86
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,718
-Don't say that about his work!
-Stop it!

87
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,489
Stop doing this.

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,291
Don't do this now.

89
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,862
Being a bodyguard
is sometimes a deadly job.

90
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,067
But we all cannot expect to die doing it!

91
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,771
The things that Personal Security Manager
Murata taught us...

92
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,841
Let us all properly remember them.

00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,586
My dear,

95
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,692
thank you for all you've done.

96
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,925
If I may.

97
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,176
Time is 11:28 a.m.

Synchronized.

102

<i>Synchronized.</i>

103
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,069
I wish us all success.

104
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,129
Thank you. Yes.

105
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,699
Certainly. We'll be waiting.

106
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,505
We just got a new security job.

107
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,375
The client will be arriving soon.

108
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,647
Sorry, but I'm not sure if I can work.

109
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,883
To be honest, the shock is just so huge.

110
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,652
I understand,

111
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,589
but due to the shooting,
we've lost several jobs.

112
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,491
We need to pull it together.

113
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,626
You're right.

114
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,130
That would make Mr. Murata happy.

115
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm not in the mood for that.

116
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,839
More important than work is clearing
Mr. Murata's tarnished name.

117
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,374
But how?

118
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,743
By making the police admit fault!

119
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,146
If we could do that,
this never would have happened.

120
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,715
<i>The police and Minister Tachihara
are in collusion</i>

121
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>trying to cover up
the Secretary-General's provocation.</i>

122
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,619
So we should just drop it?

123
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,921
How can Mr. Murata rest in peace?

124
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,592
You want him to be blamed
for his own death?

125
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,960
Of course not!

126
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,566
Who said we were going to drop this?

127
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,271
We still don't know
what the best thing to do is.

128
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,540
We can't act desperately!

129
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,077
Preparing perfectly before a mission

130
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,614
is the way that
we bodyguards work, isn't it?

131
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,216
Until we can see what to do,

132
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,719
we must keep this thing alive,

133
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,021
this Personal Security Division
that he started.

134
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,791
You sure are cold.

135
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,396
Do you really think it'll work out
if we just wait?

136
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,070
Hello, everyone!

137
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,939
Thank you for the other day.

138
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,408
Chairman Okubo, thank you as well.

139
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,944
You're the client, Chairman?

140
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,314
I'm very sorry to hear about
what happened.

141
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,618
Who would've thought
Mr. Murata would lose his life?

142
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,825
Thank you.

143
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,063
I wasn't sure if this was the right time,

144
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,700
but I thought hiring you
was the best way to pay my respects.

145
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,637
I'd like to hire you as security
for the announcement ceremony

146
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,838
of our new product.

147
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,581
Sunny-side-up egg flavor?

148
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,816
-Unusual, right?
-Yes.

149
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,918
-I'm confident it will succeed.
-Is that so?

150
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,154
However, I've come here

151
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,590
because the workers at a factory I closed

152
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,428
are threatening to start
a boycott of our products.

153
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,796
That sounds like trouble.

154
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,698
I'm not worried about myself.

155
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,269
I just don't want my precious
new product to suffer any damage.

156
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,573
This product took
over two years to develop.

157
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,775
Its taste is revolutionary.

158
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,245
Talk to him.

159
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,282
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

160
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,218
Can you boil some water for these?

161
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,957
Hey, wait! I said wait!

162
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,329
Wait, all right?

163
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>Listen up!</i>

164
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,978
SP has received a lot of criticism
about the shooting the other day.

165
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,280
But we did nothing wrong.

166
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,584
Work with confidence. However...

167
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,487
don't let your guard down.

168
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,621
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

169
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,856
Dismissed.

170
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,461
You're maintaining your stance on this?

171
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,166
I've thought this over very carefully.

172
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,802
Considering our current position,

173
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,904
we can't make an enemy
of the Secretary-General.

174
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,640
But Mr. Murata's reputation
will remain tarnished!

175
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,708
Hold on.

176
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,879
You were there too.
I'm protecting you as well.

177
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,315
You're only protecting yourself!

178
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,518
You're choking me.
Do you plan on killing me?

179
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,621
Ochiai!

180
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,123
We didn't kill him.

181
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,326
Murata was shot by the suspect.
That's undeniable.

182
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,297
We only changed one little detail.

183
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,169
It's time to take a firm stance.

184
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,007
The leadership
has great expectations of you.

185
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,983
I think we can cover this site
with three people.

186
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,785
I'll be the backup.

187
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,787
Can you be BG, Sawaguchi?

188
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,491
A commemorative first BG.

189
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,660
-Commemorative?
-Yes.

190
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,062
Earlier,

191
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,500
-I couldn't tell you this.
-Yes?

192
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,171
Is it okay if I resign?

193
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,409
I'm ashamed to admit it,

194
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,778
but my mom is pressuring me
to quit this dangerous job

195
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,446
as soon as possible.

196
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,650
What about you?

197
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,356
Do you want to quit, Sawaguchi?

198
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,626
I don't really know.

199
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,032
Working here every day
was really interesting.

200
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,168
But...

201
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,206
I think this isn't the kind of job
that I can do my whole life.

202
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,880
-Sorry for being so frank.
-No, it's okay.

203
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,315
It's better than making stuff up.

204
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,752
Are you going to be okay, Shimazaki?

205
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,556
Isn't Takanashi going to quit too?

206
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,329
I'll do this, even if I'm alone.
There's no other work I can do.

207
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,399
More importantly,

208
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,369
this your first and last BG job.

209
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,437
Do your best.

210
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,340
Yes, sir. I will.

211
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,409
I'll make this a good memory.

212
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,946
Memory...

213
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,619
Mr. Ochiai.

214
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,022
I want to talk to you.

215
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,424
I'm on my way to work.

216
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,194
Why won't you tell the truth?

217
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,864
Are the police being silenced?

218
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,999
I don't know what you mean.

219
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,701
Excuse me.

220
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,940
At first, I was angry at you
for looking down on private security.

221
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,175
But you're always very thorough.

222
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,446
I don't think you can be that way
unless you're extremely determined.

223
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,249
Mr. Ochiai,

224
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,818
save Mr. Murata.

225
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,954
Please!

226
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,161
I offer my deepest condolences
for Mr. Murata.

227
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,009
You're wasting your time.

228
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,111
He's an SP.

229
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,614
The police will never tell you the truth
if you confront them.

230
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,819
What else is there to do?

231
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,959
You really make me angry.
You're so heavy-handed.

232
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,933
But that's what I love about you.

233
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,740
That cleared your head, right? Let's go.

234
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,447
JYONAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

235
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,420
You did a good job putting out the fire.

236
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,323
It proves my belief in you
was well-founded.

237
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,627
I don't want to die just yet.

238
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,163
That's a pretty alarming thing to say.

239
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,165
When I was a newscaster,

240
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,136
I covered the Diet Member
who blew the whistle on illicit donations

241
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,439
from a major corporation
and then died in an accident.

242
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,443
That kind of thing isn't uncommon
in the political world.

243
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,713
You win only if you don't care
what means you use.

244
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,417
That's the world you live in.

245
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,270
TAKANASHI, SUGANUMA, SAWAGUCHI

246
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,738
OPERATION SCHEDULE:
MURATA, SHIMAZAKI

247
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,242
Everyone, we have our first job.

248
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,878
<i>All I did was work as hard as I could.</i>

249
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,747
Don't talk like that, sir!

250
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,916
I won't allow pointless deaths!

251
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,566
Minister Tachihara
wants to speak with you.

252
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,001
-May she?
-Do I have a choice?

253
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,445
-I'm sorry for--
-If you're going to apologize,

254
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,614
not to me.

255
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,816
Apologize to his family.

256
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,989
I didn't come here to apologize.

257
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,792
I decide only to make requests

258
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,695
when I know that
I'll get something in return.

259
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,836
Then why are you here?

260
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,106
Mr. Shimazaki,

261
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,177
you may think it's crazy for me
to say this to a bodyguard,

262
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,779
but be extra careful about your safety.

263
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,315
What?

264
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,887
Besides the police, the only people
who witnessed that whole incident...

265
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,823
were you and Mr. Murata.

266
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,359
I think you understand.

267
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,529
With Mr. Murata dead,

268
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,298
you're the only one left.

269
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,703
Are you telling me someone
might want to silence me?

270
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,439
Don't be stupid.

271
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,045
I'm merely a civilian
with zero interest in politics.

272
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,813
For ten years,

273
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,883
I've battled malicious gossip
about my newscaster past

274
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,987
while I embraced the political world,
so this is my warning to you.

275
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,527
Goodbye.

276
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,748
Good night.

277
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:21,520
HINODE BUILDING

278
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,795
-No! I told you no!
-Come on. Let me have it!

279
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,197
-Come on! Why not?
-I told you so.

280
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,084
I'm home.

281
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,961
So Shun,

282
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,464
did anything unusual happen?

283
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,466
Unusual? Like what?

284
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,701
Did anyone come by
or was anything delivered?

285
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,703
No.

286
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:23,882
You want this?

287
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,287
No, I don't.

288
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,123
Are you sure?

289
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,225
SUNNY-SIDE-UP EGG FLAVOR?
EGG-CHAN

290
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,595
I guess you do.

291
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,367
SUNNY-SIDE-UP EGG FLAVOR?
EGG-CHAN

292
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,874
Okay, let's eat.

293
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,318
Are you working?

294
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes.

295
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,533
Pretty good, isn't it?

296
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,835
What flavor is this?

297
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,440
Sunny-side-up egg flavor.

298
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,710
That's unexpected.

299
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,116
Man, this is good.

300
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,991
Today is the announcement event
for Sasuke Foods' new product.

301
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,128
We need to pay special attention
to the tasting booth.

302
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,630
Suganuma and I will be the backup.

303
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,032
The BG will stick with Chairman Okubo.

304
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,134
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,371
Can you get my earphone?

306
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,506
What's your problem?

307
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,074
Thanks.

308
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,877
This is your first BG.
We're counting on you.

309
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,412
Roger.

310
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,921
The time is 8:31 a.m. and 15 seconds.

311
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,457
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

312
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,992
Synchronized. We're ready.

313
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,026
Let's do this.

314
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,696
Base team, we'll contact you
if we need support.

315
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,165
Okay.

316
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,667
Once this mission is complete,
we'll help you.

317
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,873
Waiting around is pointless.

318
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,044
Time is limited.

319
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,148
Thank you.

320
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,719
All right, let's go!

321
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,455
Okay!

322
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,731
Here it is!

323
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,645
Hello!

324
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,115
Congratulations on the new product!

325
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,353
There are samples, so please try some.

326
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,589
Have a taste of this miracle flavor!

327
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,990
Iguchi Cutter!

328
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,260
Thank you.

329
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,331
Thank you.

330
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,632
Okay.

331
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,236
Everyone, over here, please. This way.

332
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,172
-It looks delicious. I'll try some.
-Go ahead.

333
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,342
EGG-CHAN

334
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,778
BG, you look frightening.
Take a deep breath.

335
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,380
Roger.

336
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,488
-Chairman, congratulations.
-Congratulations.

337
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,025
Is this your new secretary?

338
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,462
No, he's my bodyguard.

339
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,164
-Bodyguard? Really?
-Quite handsome, isn't he?

340
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,001
-Yes, he is.
-What a handsome man!

341
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,004
Quit posing.

342
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,105
Sorry.

343
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,009
-Nice. Thank you.
-May I? Thank you.

344
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,444
-This is fascinating.
-It's egg flavor.

345
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,779
Egg flavor?

346
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,829
Everyone, this way, please.

347
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,132
-Is it good?
-Yes, it is.

348
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,908
It gets even better
if you add a little ketchup.

349
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,612
Suspicious individual
at the back near the entrance.

350
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,713
Checking it out.

351
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,615
How is the taste?

352
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,950
This is 03, on my way.

353
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,918
BG, remaining with the Chairman.

354
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,592
Excuse me.

355
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,494
Have you been invited?

356
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,563
BLACK COMPANY
WE WON'T FORGIVE YOU, SASUKE FOODS!

357
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,466
The only people allowed in
are those who have been invited.

358
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,467
Please leave.

359
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,535
What?

360
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,736
Leave us be!

361
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,372
We represent the people who Okubo fired.

362
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,908
How can he launch a new product
after closing a plant?

363
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,409
Today is a day of celebration.

364
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,912
The people who made it aren't to blame.

365
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,847
Shut up! This is none of your business.

366
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,717
-Hey, you!
-Come back!

367
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,552
Stop!

368
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,553
Out of the way!

369
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,855
That hurts!

370
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,024
-That hurts!
-Pardon me.

371
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,837
-Well done.
-Thank you.

372
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,974
The two men from the funeral are here.

373
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,009
What?

374
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,544
Right.

375
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,714
Is it possible
to take them to court over this?

376
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,750
I see.

377
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:33,752
Evidence?

378
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,021
Okay.

379
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,690
I see. Thank you.

380
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,229
Of course, there isn't any evidence.

381
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,002
JANUARY 21, CLIENT: SASUKE OKUBO

382
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,345
FEBRUARY 7, CLIENT: AIKO TACHIHARA

383
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,249
<i>I first met Minister Tachihara</i>

384
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,319
<i>when we provided security
for the Civil Party.</i>

385
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,089
<i>I never thought
she'd request security herself.</i>

386
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,357
Is this a personal security request?

387
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,360
I thought Cabinet members
were provided with SP.

388
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,796
He made recordings while on duty.

389
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,165
FEBRUARY 16, CLIENT: JUNYA KONO

390
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,443
Here you are, dear.

391
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,379
IN MEMORY OF GORO MURATA

392
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,487
Why put that there? He'll never eat it.

393
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,460
Aren't you going to prep school?

394
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,468
Don't answer it.

395
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,104
It's just a crazy reporter.

396
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,606
Your father

397
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,709
didn't do anything to be ashamed of.

398
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,413
Hello, this is the Murata household.

399
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,383
This is Takanashi from Hinode.
I'd like to ask you something.

400
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,518
<i>Yes?</i>

401
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,454
Did you get Mr. Murata's belongings
back from the police?

402
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,025
Yes. We got his clothes
and his wallet back.

403
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,562
So you still don't have
his mobile phone or any other items?

404
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,230
Right.

405
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,699
Why do you ask?

406
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,436
We might be able
to clear his tarnished reputation.

407
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,174
-Chairman.
-Yes?

408
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,543
A final word from you, please.

409
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,443
Okay.

410
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,078
Please.

411
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,547
Chairman!

412
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,317
Thank you for coming today.

413
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,321
We've labored very hard
on this new product, Egg-chan.

414
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:28,159
Being able to bring this product to you

415
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,295
pleases me very much!

416
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,166
Ever since I was a destitute child,

417
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,402
I have survived

418
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,873
because of the oath I swore to the moon.

419
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,443
I'll never give up
on my search for delicious food!

420
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,213
It was a full moon
much like Egg-chan here.

421
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:53,484
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank the moon.

422
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,120
Thank you so much for your work.

423
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,689
You're welcome, sir.

424
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,597
I'm glad that there were
no significant disturbances.

425
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,534
I've obtained the names
of the visitors from the plant.

426
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,501
I see.

427
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,673
I'll speak with them
so we can clear this up.

428
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,175
Thank you.

429
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,380
I hope the misunderstanding
about Mr. Murata gets cleared up too.

430
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,150
I've seen all the news stories,

431
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,820
but I don't believe any of them.

432
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,156
I believe Mr. Murata.

433
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,593
I mean,

434
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,698
look at this dependable bodyguard
that he has trained.

435
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,203
As bodyguards, we have to work together.

436
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,538
Okay! Let's get to work!

437
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,909
<i>I really believe that
my work is much better now.</i>

438
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,313
<i>Coordinating a group of people
with so much individuality</i>

439
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,616
is far more rewarding.

440
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm glad to hear it.

441
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,789
I've always wanted
to be called dependable.

442
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,625
I like you so much,

443
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,895
I want you to be
my granddaughter's husband.

444
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,996
You do?

445
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,898
You gold digger.

446
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,868
Well, she's still only five years old.

447
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,170
Five years old?

448
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,205
It'll be a while then.

449
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,242
Excuse me.

450
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,877
But you're her age mentally.

451
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,879
Don't laugh at the mental age
of a five-year-old.

452
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,949
TAKANASHI: GO TO MURATA'S HOME IMMEDIATELY
AFTER YOU'RE DONE. IT'S IMPORTANT.

453
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,264
His belongings haven't been returned?

454
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,532
Right.

455
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,501
This is everything the police returned.

456
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,703
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

457
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,770
His mobile phone

458
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,707
as well as his digital recorder
aren't here.

459
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,075
Digital recorder?

460
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,478
He recorded everything while on duty.

461
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,281
<i>I'm sure he recorded that day as well.</i>

462
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,818
Take responsibility
for this outrage by dying!

463
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,986
Don't talk like that, sir!

464
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,021
I won't allow pointless deaths!

465
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,125
He...

466
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,162
must have recorded everything
even before the incident.

467
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,964
Are you saying

468
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,867
the police took it?

469
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,675
-Those jerks!
-It's too soon to tell.

470
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,909
Then why isn't it here?

471
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,944
Calm down.

472
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,147
You father always stayed calm

473
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,116
and gave us encouragement.

474
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,422
Have a seat.

475
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,865
Let's go to the MPD tomorrow.

476
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,567
If a family member goes,

477
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,172
you can request the return
of his personal belongings.

478
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:04,976
All right.

479
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,113
I don't know if I can do it though.

480
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,051
I'll go.

481
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,320
I'll do it.

482
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,290
I'll make them give it back.

483
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,626
We can't let you go alone.

484
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,063
Why not?

485
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,700
I can go alone. I don't have a father
to go with me anyway!

486
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,069
If your father were here,

487
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,674
he would never let a minor like you
go by yourself.

488
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,680
IN MEMORY OF GORO MURATA

489
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,781
Please

490
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,717
take care of him.

491
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,987
Please protect my son.

492
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,624
We will.

493
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,498
We will.

494
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,068
Let's get it back,
no matter what it takes.

495
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,571
Don't rush this. It won't be easy.

496
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,107
But if there's a recording
of the incident,

497
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,375
we can prove that
he didn't recklessly provoke--

498
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,044
I said not to rush this!

499
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,047
Let's proceed carefully.

500
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,016
Sorry.

501
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,129
You seem to be fond of Yoichi.

502
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,997
That's not true.

503
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,399
I'm not criticizing you.
It's a compliment.

504
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,903
-You really are a pain.
-I know I'm a pain.

505
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,506
Anyway, have a drink.
It's only water though.

506
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,574
Oh, sorry.

507
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,092
I never told you

508
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,628
why I quit the JSDF, did I?

509
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,964
No. You didn't.

510
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,671
One time I was training
with a younger soldier,

511
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,841
there was an accident.

512
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,178
I was friends with him.

513
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,214
He was such a coward.

514
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,650
He was always afraid.

515
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,687
I told him to build some courage

516
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,657
and I took him on
a mountain training exercise.

517
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,695
But then, he had a fall

518
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,332
and was seriously injured.

519
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,770
He had to be released from the service.

520
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,175
For me alone to remain

521
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,812
made me feel guilty.

522
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,282
So I quit as well.

523
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,753
To be honest,
I probably should have stayed

524
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,022
and made up for what happened.

525
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,358
Then...

526
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,166
-that guy and Yoichi...
-Yes.

527
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,003
They're similar. A little.

528
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,209
Remember what you said?

529
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,545
What?

530
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,450
I'm afraid to work with someone
who's not afraid.

531
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,022
That was the one thing in this world
I never wanted to be told.

532
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,459
"In this world"?

533
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,526
Right.

534
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,130
But

535
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,166
I'm glad

536
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,238
that Mr. Murata convinced me
to return here.

537
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,976
That's exactly why I can't let

538
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,780
Mr. Murata's case remain unsettled.

539
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,518
Me either.

540
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,160
Hey, are you guys fighting again?

541
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,161
No, we're not.

542
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,431
Okay. I got dinner.

543
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,500
Where's Sawaguchi?

544
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,901
-Here!
-You're so slow.

545
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,371
That was heavy.

546
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,714
Actually, I've thought it over.

547
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,550
I'm giving up after all.

548
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,252
What?

549
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,754
To put it simply, after being BG...

550
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,456
Hold on!

551
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,692
You're giving up being a bodyguard?

552
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:52,363
No. I'm giving up on giving up.

553
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,131
What? You were going to quit?

554
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,900
-Maybe.
-You can't "maybe" quit!

555
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,569
-I agree.
-You said you wouldn't stop me.

556
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,171
-I did?
-What?

557
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,406
You're mean!

558
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,375
Here, Shimazaki.

559
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,577
This is yours, Takanashi.

560
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,547
-Mine?
-You think I like this?

561
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,982
What are you putting on yours, Shimazaki?

562
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,719
-I wouldn't have that.
-No, it's no good.

563
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,822
-No, I always have it that way.
-Are you kidding?

564
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,195
I haven't had the courage
to look at this lately.

565
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,898
I'm glad we took this.

566
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,913
Oh, dear.

567
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,218
I held these back at the funeral,
but I can't now.

568
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,594
Also...

569
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,331
I'll send you this photo later.

570
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,709
Who's there?

571
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,749
I know there's two of you there.

572
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,553
I'm a pro too. I know you're there.

573
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,463
If you have something to say,
then show your faces.

574
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,645
<i>Be extra careful about your safety.</i>

575
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:59,216
I embraced the political world,
so this is my warning to you.

576
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,143
Hurry up.

577
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,713
It's Sunday.
Why did you wake me up so early?

578
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,255
You're going back to your mom's.

579
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,324
-What?
-I called and told her.

580
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,093
Why are you doing this?

581
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,203
How old are you now?

582
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,939
How can you forget your son's age?

583
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,841
I'm 13.

584
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,448
How strong are you now?

585
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:42,820
Hurry up.

586
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,527
That's it?

587
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,906
That hurts!

588
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:09,913
Good enough.

589
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,218
Now...

590
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,688
I have some dangerous work to do.

591
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,290
You always do.

592
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,905
I wonder where that's going.

593
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,651
Shun.

594
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,090
I want you to go many places.

595
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,260
What's that all about?

596
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,299
Go somewhere incredibly far.

597
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,672
Or somewhere amazingly high.

598
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,645
Or somewhere unbelievably huge.

599
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,621
Or somewhere cold.

600
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,898
I hate the cold.

601
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,578
We've arrived.

602
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,446
Roger. We're on standby.

603
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,295
I'm going.

604
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,076
I'm the son of Goro Murata,

605
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,744
the victim of the shooting the other day.

606
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,016
I'd like you to return
my father's belongings.

607
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,688
I see. Let him wait for now.

608
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,334
Where's Ochiai?

609
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,904
He's part
of Minister Tachihara's detail today.

610
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,007
Do you know these guys?

611
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,510
Are they from Hinode?

612
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,079
I think they are.

613
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,314
Akira Shimazaki.

614
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,251
-Right?
-Yes.

615
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,052
I heard that was his name.

616
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,191
So you've come.

617
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,063
Thank you for waiting.
You're Mr. Murata, right?

618
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,131
Yes.

619
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,034
We forgot to return these by mistake.

620
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,311
Let's go.

621
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,616
Here's the digital recorder.

622
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,053
-We've overcome the first hurdle.
-I sure hope so.

623
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,022
Let's listen. I'll connect it.

624
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,870
-The recordings are still there.
-And the day of the incident?

625
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,507
FEBRUARY 26, CLIENT: HITOMI ODAGIRI

626
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,810
Is it on a memory card?

627
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,793
FEBRUARY 26, CLIENT: HITOMI ODAGIRI

628
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,297
It's been deleted.

629
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,968
<i>The recording on the day of the shooting</i>

630
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,337
has been deleted.

631
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,743
That's why they returned it so easily.

632
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,646
I thought it was strange.

633
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,514
Yoichi...

634
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,550
It's over.

635
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,952
There must be some other way.

636
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,421
Don't try to console me.

637
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,962
Dad will be remembered
as an overzealous bodyguard!

638
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,773
All I did was work as hard as I could.

639
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,808
BODYGUARD PRETENDING AS HERO
FAILS AT POLICE MAKE-BELIEVE

640
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,810
POLICE VERIFY VICTIM'S WORDS
PROVOKED RESTAURANT SHOOTER

641
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,081
Shimazaki!

642
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,087
HINODE BUILDING

643
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,920
They were clearly targeting you.

644
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,324
Anyway, keep an eye on Yoichi.

645
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,459
All right.

646
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,002
I will be in charge of security
at the Civil Party Convention.

647
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,705
You will be guarded by four SPs, Minister.

648
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,708
Four is quite a burden.

649
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:27,217
I don't know if I'm deserving
of all this protection now.

650
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,123
When a person has lost
something precious to them,

651
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,160
all they think of is
holding on to their status.

652
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:41,998
Minister,

653
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,701
may I say something personal?

654
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,370
Certainly.

655
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,607
When Mr. Murata was in the SP,

656
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,509
he was my boss.

657
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,380
He took responsibility for my mistake,

658
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,718
quit the force,
and became a private bodyguard.

659
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,922
He told me

660
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,125
<i>to change the system.</i>

661
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,729
I often thought of doing so.

662
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,134
But I've never changed a thing.

663
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,841
The only thing I did was
I just stuck with the police.

664
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,150
Thank you

665
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,552
for opening up to me.

666
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,357
Sorry for speaking unnecessarily.

667
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,659
Shall we get going?

668
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,302
Stop!

669
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,437
-Stop!
-Excuse me!

670
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,875
Minister Tachihara,

671
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:03,213
can you make public
what happened that day?

672
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,186
You're the only one who can do that now.

673
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,392
Please, Minister.

674
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,661
Remove him.

675
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,132
Minister, I refuse to give up.

676
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,836
We don't have status, power, or weapons,

677
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,372
but the one thing we had
was stolen from us!

678
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,922
I swear, we'll never give up!

679
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,063
We'll never give up, no matter what!

680
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,718
Don't worry.

681
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,088
I swear we'll find a way.

682
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,230
Forget it.

683
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,700
I'm tired of this.

684
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,555
Stay here.

685
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,411
Sir, the fire hasn't been put out.

686
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,717
I'm sure that nobody can extinguish it.

687
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,156
The truth should be made public.

688
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,427
I was wrong.

689
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,165
And you were too, sir.

690
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,337
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

691
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,241
Yes, I do.

692
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,750
Mr. Ochiai,

693
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,419
I'll go home on my own.

694
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:58,788
You can't.

695
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,623
I'm resigning as a minister.

696
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,461
I won't need SP protection anymore.

697
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,831
I appreciate what you've done.

698
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,667
Thank you for everything.

699
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,819
Aiko Tachihara is resigning as a minister?

700
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,323
I hope she's not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

701
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,563
Don't let her near that Shimazaki
who was at the shooting.

702
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,703
Why don't we get rid of Akira Shimazaki

703
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,241
just like we did with those recordings?

704
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,783
It's not like you
to make a joke like that.

705
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,751
A joke?

706
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,858
You said it was time
to take a firm stance, right?

707
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,862
In order to protect

708
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,167
the 40,000 members of the MPD,

709
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,170
we have to do the unthinkable.

710
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,909
Isn't that what you mean by a firm stance?

711
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,987
Mr. Shimazaki.

712
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,995
I will reveal everything.

713
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,669
I'll make public the truth
about the shooting incident.

714
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:53,329
Thank you for doing this, Minister.

715
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,332
You're welcome.

716
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,239
Please fight with us.

717
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,085
<i>The final episode.</i>

718
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,488
<i>I can't be sure of
what's right and what's wrong.</i>

719
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,456
<i>I can't be sure, however...</i>

720
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,559
<i>I want to protect these things.</i>

721
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,428
These are the people we want to protect.

722
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,297
<i>Stop, Ochiai!</i>

723
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,165
FAREWELL, BODYGUARD
