1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,437
<i>In the corruption scandal four years ago,</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>you pinned the blame on me
and then abandoned me!</i>

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,642
The least you can do is apologize!

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,011
You should apologize!

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:11,945
Sir!

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,114
<i>The only thing a shameless man
like you can do</i>

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,715
<i>is die a quick death!</i>

8
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,883
Don't talk like that, sir!

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,952
I won't allow pointless deaths!

10
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,724
<i>Dad was a fool.</i>

11
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,261
Bodyguards are nothing more than
underpaid slave labor!

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,263
-Don't say that about his work!
-Stop it!

13
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,600
<i>Your father worked until the very end
as a bodyguard to protect everyone there.</i>

14
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,402
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

15
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,904
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>Besides the police, the only person left
who witnessed that incident</i>

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,575
<i>is you now.</i>

18
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,845
Are you telling me someone might
want to silence me?

19
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,581
<i>We might be able to clear
his tarnished reputation.</i>

20
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>He recorded everything while on duty.</i>

21
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>I'm sure he recorded that day as well.</i>

22
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,721
Are you saying the police took it?

23
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,089
<i>I'll make them give it back.</i>

24
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,390
So you've come.

25
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,759
<i>The day of the shooting has been deleted.</i>

26
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,729
Dad will be remembered
as an overzealous bodyguard!

27
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,365
Can you make public
what happened that day?

28
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,268
-Remove him.
-Minister, I refuse to give up.

29
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,237
We don't have status, power, or weapons,

30
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,640
but the one thing we had
was stolen from us!

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,776
<i>Don't let her near that Shimazaki
who was at the shooting.</i>

32
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,279
Why don't we get rid of Akira Shimazaki

33
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,980
<i>just like with those recordings?</i>

34
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,951
I'll make public the truth
about the shooting incident.

35
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,821
Please fight with us.

36
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,992
Will you really reveal the truth?

37
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,529
Thank you. I'm deeply impressed.

38
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,367
I'm friends with one of the producers
on my old program,

39
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,503
<i>News Level 5</i>.

40
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,308
He promised to let me
secretly appear on it live tomorrow.

41
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,609
On TV?

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,047
This isn't something
that can be posted on social media.

43
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,583
I need to show my face

44
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,519
and talk about what happened that day.

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,222
But you'll be making enemies
not just of the police,

46
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,658
but also of Mr. Igarashi
and the Civil Party.

47
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,094
I've already made him my enemy.

48
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,196
What?

49
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:14,200
Earlier, I was advised to step down
from my post as a minister.

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,340
Aiko Tachihara tried to sidestep
her comment belittling the unemployed

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,410
and is overshadowed by the scandal of
sending the threatening letter to herself,

52
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,247
so she is stepping down
to take responsibility.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,983
They'll be announcing it that way soon.

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,451
No way.

55
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,320
-No way!
-Don't worry.

56
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,189
I'll make the best of it.

57
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,492
Revealing the truth will lead

58
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,729
to the denunciation of
Secretary-General Igarashi's misconduct.

59
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,796
Hold on.

60
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,767
People who commit a cover-up
must fight against cover-ups.

61
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,569
Is that wishful thinking?

62
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,909
<i>Back when that happened,
you all saved my life.</i>

63
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,778
<i>When I met my daughter,</i>

64
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,348
<i>you all kept my secret.</i>

65
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,088
Now,

66
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,092
it's my turn to protect
Mr. Murata's honor.

67
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:22,202
But you'll be putting yourself in danger.

68
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,603
There have been

69
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,740
many cases of whistle-blowers' lives
being threatened.

70
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,110
It's okay.

71
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,180
I'll have a capable bodyguard
to protect me.

72
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,485
After stepping down as a minister,
I won't have SP protection anymore.

73
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,755
They'll do anything to stop me,

74
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,925
so I want to request your protection

75
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,028
until I can reveal the truth
about the shooting.

76
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,802
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

77
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,354
The SP Ochiai?

78
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,191
He said that he would

79
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,629
settle this incident himself.

80
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,697
He sounds like a good man.

81
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,034
I'm also taking discreet steps.

82
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,571
I wonder how magnificently
he will handle this.

83
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,106
I'd like to see it.

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,142
Okay.

85
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,711
What's wrong?

86
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,847
Are you afraid?

87
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,486
No. Thanks to being part of
your protection detail,

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,022
I achieved my position.

89
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,693
Okay, I wonder how
that ungrateful woman is being dealt with.

90
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,595
It's time to check.

91
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,299
Sorry to interrupt the program,
but we have breaking news.

92
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,935
Aiko Tachihara, a Civil Party member
of the Lower House,

93
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,738
has announced she is stepping down
as Health, Labor, and Welfare Minister.

94
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,473
I repeat.

95
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,010
Aiko Tachihara, a Civil Party member
of the Lower House,

96
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,680
has announced she is stepping down
as Health, Labor, and Welfare Minister.

97
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,949
She tried to sidestep her comment
belittling the unemployed

98
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,119
and was scandalized by sending
a threatening letter to herself.

99
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,388
She is taking responsibility
for those things.

100
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,926
<i>Diet Member Aiko Tachihara is
leaving the Civil Party as of today</i>

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,731
<i>and will announce later
what her future political plans will be.</i>

102
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,067
<i>Returning to the previous topic...</i>

103
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,636
We'll pick you up at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

104
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,605
Please wait for me here.

105
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,943
I'll contact you once I'm prepared.

106
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,545
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:47,880
Minister.

108
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,489
Thank you very much.

109
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,228
Not at all. I owe you.

110
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,534
When you said I was
the only one who could do this,

111
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,937
I realized what I must do.

112
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,307
Can you make public
what happened that day?

113
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,642
You're the only one who can do that now.

114
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,012
-Mr. Shimazaki.
-Yes?

115
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,616
When everything is over,

116
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,689
will you join me for the dinner
that we both know we've been anticipating?

117
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,129
What's your answer?
This is your client's order.

118
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,499
Understood.

119
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,968
I would be glad to.

120
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,510
I'll see you to your room.

121
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,945
Wait for me to open your door.

122
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,821
Go ahead.

123
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,230
Wait a moment, please.

124
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,674
Sorry to keep you waiting.

125
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,023
MURATA

126
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,193
Thank you.
This will make my husband happy.

127
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,530
My dear.

128
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,400
Really?

129
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,071
But she always lied that
she didn't see anything at the shooting.

130
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,740
She's just working for Igarashi.

131
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,811
She regrets doing that now
and will speak the truth on TV.

132
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,514
I can't trust anyone.

133
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,584
Including the people
who worked for your father?

134
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,556
Fine. If you can't, then don't.

135
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,525
However,

136
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,095
if Minister Tachihara
really does speak the truth,

137
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,198
I want you to trust her.

138
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,701
Also,

139
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,137
promise to go to prep school.

140
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,542
Because Dad would be sad if I didn't?

141
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,678
-He can't be sad if he's dead.
-Wrong.

142
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,780
That's what I want you to do.

143
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,985
You're awfully intense.

144
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,192
Fine, I will.

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,064
Hello?

146
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,366
What? You're still alive?

147
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,368
Gee, I'm sorry.

148
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,671
<i>I forgot my ball.</i>

149
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,673
I'm coming to get it now.

150
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>Okay.</i>

151
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
How are you?

152
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,781
<i>Not bad. I'm going to see
the Japan National Team play this Sunday</i>

153
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,349
<i>with Mr. Odagiri.</i>

154
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,388
Really?
That Mr. Odagiri is quite something.

155
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,057
He wants me to live here.

156
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,159
He says not to worry about a thing.

157
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,529
That's good.

158
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,132
Yes.

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,101
<i>Right.</i>

160
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,939
Okay, I have to go to work.

161
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>Don't forget</i>

162
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,078
to clean up the place

163
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,181
so you can die anytime.

164
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,118
That's one of the basics.

165
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,922
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,826
That's what I told you.

167
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,066
Don't add "so you can die anytime."

168
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,404
I'm not going to die.

169
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,242
Don't go and change it.

170
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,358
TO SHUN,
JUNYA, KAMAKURA REGULUS

171
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,260
<i>He should try kicking the ball
with his eyes closed.</i>

172
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,629
When you realize how helpless you are,

173
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,464
<i>you won't be so tense.</i>

174
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,321
This is 01, we're here.
The client will be arriving soon.

175
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,090
Going on standby.

176
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,592
<i>-Good morning.
-Good morning.</i>

177
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,327
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

178
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,696
This is 02, roger.

179
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,398
All clear at Point 1.

180
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,072
Points 2 and 3, no police.

181
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,718
Minister Tachihara is late.

182
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,096
-Hello?
-What's wrong?

183
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,797
It's been 15 minutes.

184
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,099
NEWS LEVEL 5

185
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,112
<i>It's been 45 minutes.</i>

186
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,180
Contact the client.

187
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,734
<i>The number you have dialed
is either outside the service range...</i>

188
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,477
The program before it is almost over.

189
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,946
Even if you get here in ten minutes...

190
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,449
she still has to prep.

191
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,817
She won't make it.

192
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,756
She's not coming, is she?

193
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,594
Let's wait.

194
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,264
It's been over an hour.

195
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,932
You can't even contact her.

196
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,103
She broke her promise.

197
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,910
<i>It was you, wasn't it, Mr. Yamane?</i>

198
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,214
<i>Yes. It was an honor to be asked
to MC this amazing annual event.</i>

199
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,284
<i>Weren't you nervous about being MC
for such a renowned event?</i>

200
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,221
<i>Everyone wanted to have fun,
so I was able to have fun too.</i>

201
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,756
<i>It's a sporting event, but...</i>

202
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,865
<i>It's just a little more. Hang in there.</i>

203
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,800
<i>-I'm not sure I can.
-Oh, dear.</i>

204
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,802
<i>Next year, I will...</i>

205
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,204
<i>What will you do,</i>

206
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,406
<i>Zaki?</i>

207
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,344
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

208
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,181
HOW FAR WILL
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TAKE YOU?

209
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,059
<i>She left us high and dry!
She played us for fools!</i>

210
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,761
<i>She didn't even leave a word.
We trusted her.</i>

211
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,731
When we arrived at the hotel,

212
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,900
she had already checked out of her room.

213
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,203
It means something might have happened
to Minister Tachihara.

214
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,739
Even so, she could at least call us.

215
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,343
Dang. I may never trust women again.

216
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,611
Let's forget this.

217
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,114
All politicians are
nothing more than liars.

218
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,384
-We never should've trusted her.
-President!

219
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,953
Why are you all looking so gloomy?

220
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,724
Of course, we are.
I haven't been tricked like this in ages.

221
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,726
You've been tricked before?

222
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,562
A guy betrayed me once and fleeced me.

223
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,297
I couldn't trust anyone for a while.

224
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,201
What?

225
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,236
I'm better now.

226
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,642
This just arrived.

227
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,815
It's from a company called AI Inc.

228
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,286
What? Could that be Minister Tachihara?

229
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,256
She sent it to me just in case.

230
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>I'm sorry for not keeping
my promise this morning.</i>

231
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,068
<i>A moment ago,</i>

232
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,971
<i>Sanko TV refused to allow me on the show.</i>

233
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,807
<i>I think the party had
something to do with it.</i>

234
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,712
<i>I was worried about leaks,
so I didn't contact you.</i>

235
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,481
<i>As you said, Mr. Shimazaki,</i>

236
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,884
<i>whistle-blowers' lives
really are threatened.</i>

237
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,921
<i>But I haven't given up.</i>

238
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,326
<i>In fact, I'm more convinced than ever
that I must do this.</i>

239
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,895
<i>Give me another chance.</i>

240
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,198
<i>This time, I swear I'll keep my promise.</i>

241
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,435
At the Civil Party Conference on the 18th,

242
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,771
she says she'll set the record straight
about Mr. Igarashi.

243
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,840
Even the Prime Minister will be there.

244
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,976
When the Secretary-General is pressured

245
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,012
in front of the PM and party leaders,
he can't escape.

246
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,016
However, since Minister Tachihara
left the party, she can't get in.

247
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,019
Nobody without an invitation can enter.

248
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,388
-You mean...
-That's right.

249
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:35,327
She has asked for you to provide her
protection past the strict security,

250
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,396
and into the meeting room.

251
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,867
What if she leaves us high and dry again?

252
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,935
She'll come for sure.

253
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,005
-Is that wishful thinking?
-No.

254
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,009
Remember what she said?

255
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,610
<i>Now,</i>

256
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,114
it's my turn to protect
Mr. Murata's honor.

257
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,383
<i>She used the word "protect."</i>

258
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,486
There was truth in her words.

259
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,522
Let's trust her.

260
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,798
-Shimazaki.
-Yes, sir.

261
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,299
Don't do this if you can't.

262
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,972
This has been on my mind
since Murata died.

263
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,941
Protecting the client is important,

264
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,677
but you must protect yourselves as well.

265
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,013
I'm sure that's what he taught you.

266
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,448
That's right.

267
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,651
Shimazaki! Yoichi...

268
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,889
He posted on social media.
It's on news websites.

269
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,793
ARE THE TEARFUL ACCUSATIONS
OF THE VICTIM'S SON TRUE?

270
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,694
SON OF SHOOTING VICTIM SPEAKS OUT

271
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,097
Do you know about what Murata's son did?

272
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,269
Shimazaki is probably trying
to start something.

273
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,238
Are you really going to do this?

274
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,910
Are you going to stop me?

275
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,184
Don't you want to protect the system?

276
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,988
Unless you plug the hole,
the levee will break.

277
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,533
Party leader squad chiefs,
Nemoto, Sakai, Kiyota.

278
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,402
Continue as-is with your protection.

279
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,905
Review your security plans. Don't mess up.

280
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,073
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

281
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,715
We know you're in there, Yoichi Murata.

282
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,318
-Let us talk to you.
-Excuse me.

283
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,853
-Excuse me.
-Let us through.

284
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,922
There's more and more of them.

285
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,325
Why couldn't you wait?

286
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,129
Tachihara is a liar.

287
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,433
That's why I decided
to do something myself.

288
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,569
What you did was very dangerous.

289
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,908
I only told the truth.

290
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,346
If you leave now, they'll just mob you.

291
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,780
I'm not afraid of that!

292
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,716
Saying you're not afraid...

293
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,719
doesn't impress anyone.

294
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,023
You posted that out of frustration,
but you've hurt your dad more.

295
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,926
Can't you understand even that?

296
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,071
I apologize for what Yoichi did.

297
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,376
The press will be after you for a while.

298
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,379
Is there anywhere else that you can stay?

299
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,984
-My sister's place.
-We'll take you there.

300
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,754
Then we'll think about what to do next.

301
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,356
Thank you so much.

302
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,626
Yoichi!

303
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,831
-How will we get through?
-There's a ton of them out there.

304
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,409
You got it!

305
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,578
They're coming out!

306
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,613
Yoichi Murata?

307
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,149
You wrote that you had proof, right?

308
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,517
-Step back!
-Get back!

309
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,619
Why are you making enemies of the police?

310
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,056
-<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>
-Stand back!

311
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,857
-Stand back!
-Get back!

312
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,993
-Get back!
-Don't you have anything to say?

313
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,962
Stay back!

314
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,364
-Stay back!
-Lay off!

315
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,233
If you don't speak, the truth won't...

316
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,568
Get back!

317
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,671
-This way.
-Okay.

318
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,880
I hope that fooled them.

319
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,449
Nice job.

320
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,523
-I'm going back to the office.
-Let's go.

321
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,567
When everyone out front leaves,
we'll go join your mother.

322
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,073
You know,

323
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
I'm sorry...

324
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,284
You did it for your father, right?

325
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,686
But I didn't think this would happen.

326
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,089
An apology...

327
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,161
should only be made when your heart
tells you that you really must.

328
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,531
Your father was that way.

329
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,634
He was a very gentle person.

330
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,236
But more than that...

331
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,640
he had a strength that wouldn't
let him bend his beliefs.

332
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,778
Really?

333
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,016
Before your father died...

334
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,854
he talked about you, Yoichi.

335
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,658
<i>Even my son is still rebellious at age 19.</i>

336
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,795
You said he was being rebellious.

337
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,232
He was actually very proper.
He even thanked me.

338
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,201
Really?

339
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,637
Is that so?

340
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,939
<i>Is that all?</i>

341
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:26,278
As your father, I think he felt relieved.

342
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,720
I didn't like my father.

343
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,925
I could never understand
why he did such an ungrateful job

344
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,927
like being a bodyguard.

345
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,896
It made me so angry.

346
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,688
Don't go anywhere.

347
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,732
Take your shoes off when you come in!

348
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,322
Time to die, pal!

349
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,894
Are you okay?

350
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,364
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

351
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,732
That's good.

352
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,601
What about you, Mr. Shimazaki?

353
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,936
No, I'm okay.

354
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,839
I'll be fine once I get to the hospital.

355
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,013
Are you okay?

356
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,983
-Yes. Just a little dislocation.
-What?

357
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,921
-Can I have some water, Sawaguchi?
-Okay.

358
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,158
So who were those two guys
who attacked you?

359
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,264
They were hired by people
who don't want the truth to come out.

360
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,234
The Secretary-General? The police?

361
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,904
Either way, that's plain nasty!

362
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,674
Powerful people have no scruples.

363
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,309
It makes me so angry!

364
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,078
-Oh, I'm sorry!
-It's okay.

365
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,348
I doubt they'll show up again.
I took photos of them.

366
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,618
You remember these guys, right?

367
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,990
I've just checked on Yoichi's family.
They're fine.

368
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,259
I told them to stay inside for a while.

369
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,695
Takanashi, what's that?

370
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:09,768
Is that a get-well gift for Shimazaki
since he was injured?

371
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,471
They're leftovers from the food
I brought to Yoichi.

372
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,674
You know, I could get used to this.

373
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,509
Your choice is very feminine.

374
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,644
I wish you were my wife.

375
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,046
Thank you.

376
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,648
The Civil Party Conference is in six days.

377
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,650
Will you be better by then?

378
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,721
Well, as for that...

379
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,992
Could I ask you to take over as BG?

380
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,929
When I was young,
I'd still do it even if I was injured.

381
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,699
But I don't want to cause us any trouble.

382
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,469
I'm the only one who can do it.

383
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,237
Don't be so humble.

384
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,741
Can you trust our client?

385
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,244
It's hard for me to do that.

386
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:59,217
I know our only choice is to rely on her
to restore Mr. Murata's honor.

387
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,921
Will she really do something that

388
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,857
would knock her out of her seat
in the Diet?

389
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:07,959
I see.

390
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,567
Of course, a bodyguard
has to be trustworthy.

391
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:20,405
But it's even more important
to trust your client.

392
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,974
You see...

393
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:28,680
how can you trust someone
who doesn't trust you?

394
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,052
I've decided to trust her.

395
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,888
I couldn't prepare if I didn't.

396
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,424
Nice.

397
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,196
Actually, I'm the type
who trusts just about anyone.

398
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,132
SCHEDULE OF CLIENT ACTIVITY

399
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,801
-You've really matured.
-Thanks.

400
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,143
May I come in?

401
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,512
You're already inside, as always.

402
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,483
Were you injured?

403
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,686
You sure timed your visit just right.

404
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,088
What did Minister Tachihara
speak to you about?

405
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,961
I know she came here
after announcing her departure.

406
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:18,930
Nothing.

407
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,401
I see. So it was something
that you have to hide.

408
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,004
-Hey, that's...
-Stop that!

409
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,306
Sorry.

410
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,575
Sorry.

411
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,310
Please leave.

412
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,179
Mr. Ochiai,

413
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,915
can the police do what they like
to private citizens?

414
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,453
I think that future SP operations
should be done

415
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,921
in cooperation with private companies.

416
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,189
What are you saying?

417
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,325
We'll be getting more visitors from abroad
as 2020 approaches.

418
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,862
There will be even greater demand
for protection services.

419
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,434
But there aren't any private firms
fit to cooperate with the police.

420
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,072
That's only my personal opinion.

421
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,877
Sorry. Excuse me.

422
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:06,978
Excuse me.

423
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,322
HINODE BUILDING

424
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,129
What do you want?

425
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,131
Sorry if I'm wrong, but...

426
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,701
is my existence
an inconvenience to the police?

427
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,139
I was at the scene of that shooting.

428
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,308
Take responsibility
for this outrage by dying!

429
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,145
Apologize!

430
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,251
For those who don't want
the truth to be known,

431
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,654
I'm a thorn in their side.

432
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,826
I don't know if this
will answer your question.

433
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,396
I will never give useless warnings.

434
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,436
Regarding that shooting incident,
I'll bear responsibility for settling it.

435
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,074
"Settling it"?

436
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,077
What do you mean by "settling it"?

437
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,213
Goodbye.

438
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,327
We'll scout out
the party conference location

439
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,262
<i>and map out Minister Tachihara's route.</i>

440
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,265
<i>We may have to use brute force.</i>

441
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,406
I'll try to get inside
so I can report on the proceedings.

442
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,609
<i>I was a shoplifting spotter,
so I know how to watch people.</i>

443
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,477
I'd like a job here.

444
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,279
I'll prepare the equipment.

445
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,348
We're doomed if we lose contact.

446
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,117
<i>I'll check the radio output
and transmission relays.</i>

447
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,752
SPARE BATTERIES

448
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,156
We're doing this
to restore Mr. Murata's honor.

449
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,859
<i>It's our duty
as the Personal Security Division.</i>

450
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,393
I'm from Hinode Security.

451
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,231
<i>We must succeed.</i>

452
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,901
We'll go in unarmed.

453
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,105
We'll drive the car past the SP once,

454
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,308
stop here, and let the client in.

455
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,812
We'll pass through the kitchen and pantry
behind the refrigerator here.

456
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,315
<i>There's sure to be SP stationed here.</i>

457
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,017
<i>Sawaguchi and I will go as far as we can,</i>

458
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,153
but if there's trouble,
we'll need you to take over.

459
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,722
Roger.

460
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,560
We'll meet Minister Tachihara

461
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,196
in front of the hotel
she's hiding in at 11:30 a.m.

462
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,064
We'll enter at venue P1.

463
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,301
As 01, I'll keep you updated
on the situation at the conference.

464
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,937
As 02, I'll check the area.

465
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,406
As 03, I'll provide backup for BG.

466
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,576
Okay.

467
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:56,014
We must get her onto the stage
before the conference ends at 2:00 p.m.

468
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,785
The time is 8:50. Synchronized.

469
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,220
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

470
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,055
Synchronized. I wish us...

471
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,097
Synchronized. I wish us all success.

472
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,839
Okay. Let's go.

473
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,675
This is 03. On standby.

474
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,514
This is 02.

475
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,018
Five security guards
at the reception in the foyer.

476
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,152
CIVIL PARTY

477
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,523
CIVIL PARTY REGULAR CONFERENCE
RECEPTION

478
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,165
Would you like something to drink?

479
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,671
This is 01,
a third of the guests have arrived.

480
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,052
-One minute 50 seconds left.
-Hey!

481
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,024
-One minute...
-Quit counting down.

482
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,559
What?

483
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,796
Don't you trust the client?

484
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,968
I trust her.

485
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,837
One minute 30 seconds left.

486
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,341
I'm certain Minister Tachihara will come.

487
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,116
Okay, in the minute and 20 seconds left,
I have something to tell you.

488
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,420
One minute 15 seconds. What?

489
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,488
Just for your information...

490
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,324
I trust you.

491
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,063
That's why I asked you to be the BG.

492
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,605
Fifty-five seconds.

493
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,409
Fifty seconds.

494
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,711
I do too.

495
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,647
Forty-five seconds.

496
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,650
She's here.

497
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,524
I'll take that.

498
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,065
Thank you for waiting.

499
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,236
I've come this far, so no matter
how hard they try to stop me,

500
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,939
I'll reveal the truth about the shooting.

501
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,809
Please protect my wishes.

502
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,046
Understood. Leave it to us.

503
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,649
We'll protect you to the very end.

504
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,924
This is 01, Secretary-General has arrived.

505
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,596
All clear.

506
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,966
Aiko Tachihara will likely come
with Hinode guards.

507
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,902
If you see her,
inform me and don't let them through.

508
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,313
This is 02, many ordinary guests
outside the restaurant near the east exit

509
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,648
and no sight of the police.

510
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,179
Thank you very much for coming, everyone.

511
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,916
The speech by Prime Minister and
Civil Party President, Hiroshi Shinoyama

512
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,951
will commence shortly.

513
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,757
Last year was a trying year
for the Civil Party.

514
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,395
But you entrusted the government
to a greenhorn like me.

515
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,530
This has inspired me.

516
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,239
Also, we heard earlier
from the distinguished...

517
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,474
This is 01,
Prime Minister's speech has begun.

518
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,211
Conference scheduled to end at 2:00 p.m.

519
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,979
Hurry, please.

520
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,853
Passing through the pantry.
Heading to the foyer.

521
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,328
Where are you going?
You can't go in there.

522
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,368
They're coming.

523
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,836
Suspicious persons detected.

524
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,441
Excuse me.

525
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,577
Is that Minister Aiko Tachihara?

526
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,113
Me?

527
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,016
We've been identified. Can you take over?

528
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:32,950
<i>Roger.</i>

529
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,519
Head from P3 to P6. I'll meet you there.

530
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,966
Go on ahead. I'll distract them.

531
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,507
It hurts!

532
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,909
Excuse me,
is there a restroom around here?

533
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,145
-Let's go.
-It hurts!

534
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,913
-My stomach hurts!
-Out of the way!

535
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,482
No! Don't shake me so much!

536
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,953
I'd like to wipe away
the negative image we have

537
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,591
and start fresh as a clean Civil Party.

538
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:17,995
Roger.

539
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,665
Don't make contact
with Aiko Tachihara yet.

540
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,047
This is 01, SP Ochiai has left the room.

541
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,082
<i>I don't know his destination. Be careful.</i>

542
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,419
<i>This is 03, roger.</i>

543
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,323
This is 03, arrived at the meet-up point.

544
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:48,893
This way.

545
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,031
Pardon me.

546
00:38:59,136 --> 00:38:59,970
This way.

547
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:02,907
Stop!

548
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,481
-He's going down!
-Okay.

549
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,785
Hey! Stop!

550
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,823
Darn, who is this guy?

551
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,795
I'll be at Stairwell 9 soon.

552
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:34,739
Roger.

553
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,608
Roger.

554
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,383
It's swarming with SP in there.

555
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,718
This way.

556
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,160
Are you certain about this,
Minister Tachihara?

557
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,732
Past that door and down the hall
is the banquet hall.

558
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,869
If you're even slightly unsure,

559
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,804
I won't force you to do this.

560
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,372
Don't underestimate me.

561
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,808
I don't hesitate
once I've made up my mind.

562
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,546
For all of you, and for me,

563
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,948
this must happen today.

564
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,527
It's been a while, Minister Tachihara.

565
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,263
How are you feeling?

566
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,401
Mr. Ochiai, please let us through.

567
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,471
You cannot enter without an invitation.

568
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,806
Please.

569
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,142
We have to go past there.

570
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,712
If you must,
then it'll be over my dead body.

571
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,947
Mr. Ochiai!

572
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,317
What you all are trying to do
is outrageous.

573
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,821
If you reveal the truth,
it will affect the government.

574
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,857
Will disrupting the system
and public order...

575
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,893
bring Mr. Murata back to life?

576
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,198
No, it won't.

577
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,035
Am I wrong, Mr. Shimazaki?

578
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,975
I don't know.

579
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,146
I can't be sure of what's right
and what's wrong.

580
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,815
I can't be sure, however...

581
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,585
I want to protect these things.

582
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,222
Mr. Murata.

583
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,524
The wishes of Minister Tachihara.

584
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,159
These are...

585
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,198
the people we want to protect.

586
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,487
You're not going after my injured arm?

587
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,104
The police are helpless
if they don't have evidence.

588
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,640
I recorded the shooting too.

589
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,510
I've done it ever since
Mr. Murata taught me to.

590
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,481
<i>If I took the blame,</i>

591
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,117
<i>it would throw politics
and the people into confusion.</i>

592
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,820
<i>It's the secretary's job to prevent that.</i>

593
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,258
As a police officer at the scene,
I will reveal the truth.

594
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,260
No, I will.

595
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,696
There are other things
you should be doing.

596
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,600
You're not under my protection anymore.
Let them keep you safe.

597
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,569
Mr. Ochiai.

598
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:54,838
Remember what I said?

599
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,143
I will bear responsibility
for settling that shooting incident.

600
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,515
Mr. Murata rescued me
when I was in a jam before.

601
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,117
Also, you, the people working for him,

602
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,954
helped me overcome
my remaining misgivings.

603
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,291
I'll accompany you from here.

604
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,660
Thank you.

605
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,631
Sir, are you serious?

606
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,799
Yes.

607
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,503
Chief, Ochiai has abandoned his...

608
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:27,771
Stop it!

609
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,780
Mr. Ochiai!

610
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,484
-Take her somewhere safe.
-Right. This way, Minister.

611
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,223
Hurry up!

612
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,794
What are you doing?

613
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,030
<i>Stop Ochiai! That's an order!</i>

614
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:53,931
Stop!

615
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,401
Stop!

616
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:02,106
-That's not part of our orders!
-Don't, Nemoto!

617
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,812
You... Did you deceive me?

618
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,948
You call this settling it?

619
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,684
You were planning
to go public right from the start!

620
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,156
We'll be ruined if police misconduct
is revealed from outside.

621
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,261
I'm a police officer.

622
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:45,816
Go on ahead.

623
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,388
What the heck are you doing?

624
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,934
Hold on to me.

625
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,403
I won't rely on unarmed private security.

626
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,741
This is a public-private partnership.

627
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,587
Stop, Ochiai!

628
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,024
Today has been a peaceful day.

629
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,194
I got caught up
in an unfortunate incident,

630
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,895
but I'm thoroughly refreshed now

631
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,632
and will press on
for the citizens of this country!

632
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:39,937
Okay.

633
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,472
Let us applaud together.

634
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,608
Ready!

635
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,521
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

636
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,389
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

637
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,393
-Excuse us. Let us through.
-Excuse me.

638
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,229
-Let us through.
-Excuse me.

639
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,930
Let us through.

640
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,567
-Excuse me.
-Sorry. Excuse me.

641
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,573
Mr. Igarashi.

642
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,476
You're finished.

643
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,946
<i>If I took the blame,</i>

644
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,682
<i>it would throw politics
and the people into confusion.</i>

645
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,052
<i>It's the secretary's job to prevent that.</i>

646
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,556
<i>You did a good job!</i>

647
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,091
<i>You lie!</i>

648
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:40,697
<i>You pinned the blame on me
and then abandoned me!</i>

649
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,034
<i>The least you can do is apologize!</i>

650
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,069
<i>You should apologize!</i>

651
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,407
<i>Take responsibility for this outrage
by dying!</i>

652
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,475
<i>Sir!</i>

653
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,011
<i>What's wrong?
Isn't that why you came here?</i>

654
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,180
<i>The only thing a shameless man
like you can do</i>

655
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,148
<i>is die a quick death!</i>

656
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,616
<i>Don't talk like that, sir!</i>

657
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,286
<i>I won't allow pointless deaths!</i>

658
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,298
SHOCKING REVELATION OF SHOOTING FACTS

659
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,233
SECRETARY-GENERAL IGARASHI
REBUKED FORMER SECRETARY

660
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,937
<i>The police have made a new announcement</i>

661
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,673
<i>about the shooting that occurred
in Meguro the other day.</i>

662
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:28,946
<i>The shooter, Ueno,
was provoked by the inhumane remarks</i>

663
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,848
<i>made by Secretary-General Igarashi.</i>

664
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:37,154
<i>Another look is being taken
at the testimony</i>

665
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,924
<i>of Igarashi's former secretary
that Igarashi directed him</i>

666
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:46,463
<i>to accept 70,000,000 yen in bribes
four years ago.</i>

667
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,098
<i>Diet Member Igarashi...</i>

668
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:52,803
Murata, the people who work for you
protected you while being unarmed.

669
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,240
<i>There are already moves to replace him.</i>

670
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:05,015
Thank you very much.

671
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,851
Thank you for this.

672
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,154
So you know how to speak politely.

673
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:13,390
I always could.

674
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,160
Are you going to prep school?

675
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,397
-A little.
-You better go all the time.

676
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,799
He can go at his own pace, right?

677
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,970
But...

678
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,606
I'll...

679
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,609
take care of my mom.

680
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,381
Good.

681
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:43,820
Here.

682
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,894
This was returned by the police.
It's the final recordings.

683
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,399
Take care of it.

684
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,942
Can I listen to it with you here?

685
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,814
Of course.

686
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,185
<i>You said he was being rebellious.</i>

687
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,489
<i>He was actually very proper.
He even thanked me.</i>

688
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,425
<i>Really?</i>

689
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,760
<i>Is that so?</i>

690
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,030
<i>Shimazaki.</i>

691
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:27,931
<i>Yes?</i>

692
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,100
<i>Is your watch</i>

693
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,769
<i>all right?</i>

694
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,638
<i>Yes. It's working perfectly.</i>

695
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,943
<i>-I'm glad to hear it.
-Thank you.</i>

696
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,515
<i>The time is 6:14 p.m...</i>

697
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,485
<i>and five seconds.</i>

698
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,620
<i>Synchronized.</i>

699
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,559
<i>Synchronized.</i>

700
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:13,977
What?

701
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,823
-There's no food.
-What are you doing?

702
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,693
-Oh, I'm home.
-Welcome home.

703
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,730
Wait, I didn't tell you to come back.

704
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,932
-I decided to.
-What?

705
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,404
Mom tried to stop me
but ultimately said to do as I like.

706
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,340
So she told me to say "hi" to you.

707
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,244
I see.

708
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,347
Why are you dressed like that?

709
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,551
I'm just going to meet someone.

710
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,754
-Who?
-Why should I tell you?

711
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,056
So it's a date?

712
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,259
No, it's not that kind of thing.

713
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,767
Women are pretty selfish, aren't they?

714
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,803
What?

715
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,572
They're totally different
depending on the day.

716
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,777
It makes me so mad
how they keep changing their minds.

717
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,214
You have so much to learn.

718
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,484
It's a man's job to have his life
turned upside-down by women.

719
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,053
But you got divorced.

720
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:32,656
You're right.

721
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,604
Sorry to keep you waiting.

722
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,240
No, I just got here.

723
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,317
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

724
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,929
Please don't laugh.

725
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,532
Okay, I won't laugh.

726
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,570
I'm going to try
to become the prime minister.

727
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,342
I intended to give it all up that day.

728
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,679
When I remember that,
I realized I can change things.

729
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:04,814
I...

730
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,186
will continue working to protect people.

731
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,922
Just like I have been.

732
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,824
Let's have a date again sometime.

733
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,643
I appreciate your honest vote.

734
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,647
You know that's against voting laws.

735
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,383
Is your injury healed?

736
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,153
Yes, it is. Thank you.

737
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,925
I called to tell you that I've been put
in charge of embassy protection.

738
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,695
Well, that sounds like a promotion.

739
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,963
Congratulations.

740
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,099
They're trying to keep me quiet.

741
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,135
That's why they've put me here.

742
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,504
<i>I see.</i>

743
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,009
By the way, would you like to join us?

744
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,513
The Foreign Office has a system
for "ascending" private citizens

745
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,283
to temporarily work
as security specialists.

746
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,985
"Ascending"?

747
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,154
<i>I'll give you a recommendation.</i>

748
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,591
<i>I doubt you can give
your answer immediately.</i>

749
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,826
<i>I'll give you a week.</i>

750
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,429
Oh, I already have an answer.

751
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:01,398
That was fast.

752
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:07,137
<i>In that job, you only protect
certain VIPs, don't you?</i>

753
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,273
I believe that

754
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:15,078
there should be no limit
to the kind of people that we protect.

755
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,183
I thought you'd say that.

756
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,952
-Bye.
-<i>But actually, I...</i>

757
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,260
He really doesn't listen to anyone.

758
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,805
AIKO TACHIHARA

759
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:02,926
Go ahead.

760
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,896
Hey, is that you, Mr. Sato?

761
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,766
-Sir!
-Don't call me that.

762
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,137
Have you gotten used to
being a bodyguard yet?

763
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,072
No, not yet.

764
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:20,410
What? What's wrong with you?
Get your act together.

765
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,544
Sorry. I will.

766
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,015
-Here, why don't you have this?
-What is it?

767
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,717
-Meat buns.
-Meat buns?

768
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,719
But...

769
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,058
Okay, sure.

770
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,926
-Bye.
-Okay.

771
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,695
-Good night.
-Thank you.

772
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,264
Go ahead.

773
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,299
Prep for Kazuki Koda is done.

774
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,701
Final route check complete.

775
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,202
-You're late, newbie!
-Yes, sir!

776
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,171
You get ready too, Acting Chief.

777
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,973
We need to be punctual.

778
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,609
-Shingawa.
-Yes, sir. What is it?

779
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,979
The time is 8:55 a.m.

780
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,514
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

781
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,616
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

782
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,285
Synchronized. I wish us all success.

783
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,221
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

784
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,926
Please continue walking.

785
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,931
This way.

786
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,507
Hey.

787
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,543
Don't lose sight of the subject.

788
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,278
Yes, ma'am.

789
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,353
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI: DUTY STARTED
MAYU SUGANUMA: DUTY STARTED

790
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,226
This is 01. Arriving soon.

791
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,427
<i>Roger.</i>

792
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,319
Thanks again for today.

793
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:10,553
Our pleasure.

794
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,770
Passing Point 3 soon.

795
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,372
Roger.

796
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,088
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
