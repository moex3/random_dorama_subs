1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,171
THE WORLD CHANGES DRASTICALLY OVERNIGHT.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,108
THOSE WHO CAN STAND UP TO IT

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:12,145
ARE PROFESSIONALS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS.

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:19,252
THE NEED FOR PROTECTORS HAS ARRIVED…

5
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,603
CHIYODA WARD, TOKYO
JANUARY 29, WEDNESDAY

6
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,838
IN CELEBRATION OF ASSEMBLYMAN
TAKASHI KUWATA'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY

7
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,306
IN POLITICS AND THE ELECTORAL COMMITTEE

8
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,410
Mr. Kuwata, thank you very much.

9
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,579
Congratulations, Mr. Kuwata.

10
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,682
-Thank you.
-That is the perfect chance.

11
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,485
And that is why we have to go for it.

12
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,257
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI
BODYGUARD, KICKS GUARD

13
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,359
This is 01.

14
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,061
The performance ends in 45 seconds.

15
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,030
<i>The number of guests has increased.</i>

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,266
<i>Everyone should exercise caution.</i>

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,839
-Would you like something to drink?
-No, thank you.

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,575
This is 02. Understood.

19
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,646
Attention to all, our mission this time
is just to protect Mr. Kuwata.

20
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:20,814
Nothing more, nothing less.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,615
-This is 03. Roger that.
-This is 04. Understood.

22
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,883
<i>This is 01, to 02.</i>

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,585
I'm the one issuing orders.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,390
Thank you very much.

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,325
Congratulations, Mr. Kuwata.

26
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,460
Hello, Mr. Ryu.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,030
Celebrating your 20th anniversary
as a politician in 2020…

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,398
That's a good omen.

29
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,867
I've made a lot of enemies in my work,

30
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,536
but I will continue on
for the sake of the people!

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,485
This is 02, to 04.

32
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>Please check out the waiter at Table B.</i>

33
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,729
This is 04.

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,065
Target is holding a corkscrew
under the napkin in his right hand.

35
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,233
A corkscrew?

36
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,703
All the wines here
should have been uncorked beforehand.

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,540
That waiter is not on the employee list.

38
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,380
-This is 02, dealing with the situation.
-This is 03, assisting 02.

39
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,427
I would like a glass of champagne, please.

40
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,397
Please excuse us.

41
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,934
This is 01.

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,369
We're changing formations.

43
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,272
Squad B is to keep an eye
on Assemblyman Kuwata.

44
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>-This is B1. Understood.
-This is B2. Understood.</i>

45
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,677
Sorry to interrupt your conversation.

46
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,480
We've found someone suspicious
and have removed them.

47
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,249
Let's head over there.

48
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,544
What gives you the right to do this?

49
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,546
You guys aren't even cops!

50
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,150
You're just mere bodyguards.

51
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,352
Don't get ahead of yourselves!

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,322
-Hey!
-Takanashi!

53
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,691
This is as far as our work goes.

54
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,559
Hopefully, he won't try anything else…

55
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,694
I'm sorry, Shimazaki.

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,128
What are you doing, 01?

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,032
Hey… are you all right?

58
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,033
What's wrong?

59
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,342
Do you think some good wine
will come out if I pull it out?

60
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,736
<i>Personal Security Division reporting.</i>

61
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,738
<i>Team A, Sawaguchi, Takanashi, Suganuma,</i>

62
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,607
<i>and Team B, Shirai, Kawazu, Ito, Hagiwara,</i>

63
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,210
<i>have successfully completed the mission
of protecting Mr. Takashi Kuwata.</i>

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,547
<i>Shimazaki is currently being questioned
at the prefectural police station.</i>

65
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,482
<i>That is all.</i>

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,983
<i>Good work.</i>

67
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,220
Mr. Kuwata and President Ryu
are pleased with your work.

68
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,323
It was a good advertisement for us too.

69
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,561
-Dismissed.
-Yes, sir.

70
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,331
A news article has been released.

71
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,869
It says that bodyguards
took down the intruder!

72
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,672
<i>Those against the Political Funds Control
Law revision apparently planned this.</i>

73
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,907
-There's even a video.
-<i>What do you have to say about that?</i>

74
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,410
-Oh, my.
<i>-No matter who is behind this…</i>

75
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,478
I'm glad that
it worked in our favor eventually.

76
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,413
Isn't it great?

77
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,615
Your first assignment as 01
is the talk of the town.

78
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,651
But Shimazaki got hurt
because that guy went after me.

79
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,954
He wasn't after you.
Don't be so self-conscious.

80
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,058
-Really?
<i>-I will never succumb to violence.</i>

81
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,826
<i>That is all.</i>

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,062
-Good work.
-Good work.

83
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,100
-Are you all right, Shimazaki?
-Yes, I'm fine.

84
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,936
I only covered for you
because I thought that

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,540
the girlfriend you finally have
might get sad if you got hurt.

86
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,709
How did you know
I got myself a girlfriend?

87
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,944
-What?
-You wouldn't shut up about it.

88
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,047
-She's the cutest so far, right?
-Yes.

89
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,983
I'm back from my questioning.

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,151
It must have been hard on you.

91
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,119
Not at all.

92
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,588
-Can we have a talk?
-Yes, sir.

93
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,294
<i>What is it?</i>

94
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,696
Did you do as I instructed?

95
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,367
Yes, I didn't file a police report.

96
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,002
Good job.

97
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,905
I'll reimburse your medical fees
under a different name.

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,942
If the media gets wind of the fact
that blood was shed there,

99
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,345
it could put a blemish on Mr. Kuwata's
20th-anniversary celebration.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,214
But…

101
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,816
was it really okay
not to chase the criminal?

102
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,086
The duty of a bodyguard
is not to capture criminals.

103
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,355
You should draw a line
between duty and morals.

104
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,425
The security industry is prone
to workplace reforms,

105
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,293
-you should know that…
-Yes, I understand.

106
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,632
Shimazaki!

107
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,300
-Shimazaki!
-Yes?

108
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,736
What's wrong with your hand?

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,671
Oh, it's nothing.

110
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,442
This is a letter addressed to
your previous company.

111
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,644
-Thank you.
-Please excuse me. Good work today!

112
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,813
TO AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
HINODE SECURITY SERVICE

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,982
FROM SHINSUKE MATSUNO
CHIBA CITY, CHIBA PREFECTURE

114
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,784
What's that, a love letter?

115
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,718
No.

116
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,487
Wait, this address…

117
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,388
ACQUAINTANCE

118
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,723
I knew it.

119
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,324
It's from Chiba Chuo Detention Center.

120
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,261
Is your friend in prison or something?

121
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,262
No…

122
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,998
It might be a bodyguard request.

123
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,268
-"Good day. I'm sorry…
-Hey.

124
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,836
for suddenly contacting you."

125
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,905
"I am Shinsuke Matsuno,

126
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,474
currently serving my sentence
in Chiba Chuo Detention Center."

127
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,142
"I am about to finish serving my sentence,

128
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,044
and I would like to
request Akira Shimazaki's service

129
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,612
to protect me upon my release."

130
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,880
Who is Shinsuke Matsuno again?

131
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,516
I think he's the one involved in
the Kanto University of Technology case.

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,285
-That's right…
-Right, the sealed room mystery!

133
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,123
KANTO UNIVERSITY FEMALE RESEARCHER
FATALLY SUFFOCATES IN LABORATORY COLD ROOM

134
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,958
This was on the news
every single day then.

135
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,596
COULD THIS BE A CASE OF MURDER BY
A STALKER DISGUISED AS AN ACCIDENT?

136
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,865
The court ruled the incident an oversight,

137
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,968
but the media called it
a well-planned murder, didn't they?

138
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,304
But why would Shinsuke Matsuno
ask Shimazaki for help?

139
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,473
Since he sent it to me,
I should give him a reply…

140
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,540
That is unnecessary.

141
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,777
There's no way
we would protect a criminal.

142
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,746
But he made the effort
to write us a letter.

143
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,148
-I think--
-That is not necessary.

144
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,353
We only serve VIPs here in Kicks Guard.

145
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,122
That is President Ryu's company vision.

146
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,292
There will be no exceptions.

147
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,311
<i>I've read the letter you sent me.</i>

148
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,579
<i>I'm Shimazaki.</i>

149
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,814
<i>I'm Matsuno.</i>

150
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,617
<i>I'm sorry that
I sent you a letter so suddenly.</i>

151
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,618
<i>No, that's fine.</i>

152
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,222
Excuse me, but how did you know me?

153
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,196
I was in the same workshop as Junya Kono,
the former soccer athlete.

154
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,732
<i>I made him reveal your name.</i>

155
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,669
<i>I heard that a bodyguard protected him
with his life on the line, like a fool.</i>

156
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,771
See you later, Zaki.

157
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,475
A "fool"…

158
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,211
I'm honored.

159
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:12,552
Well, I intend to visit the laboratory
after I'm released.

160
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,389
Wait, do you mean
where the incident occurred?

161
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,290
Yes.

162
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,993
I would like to pay my respects
to the late Ayako Itami,

163
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,697
and I would like to apologize
to Professor Sakagami

164
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,933
for causing him trouble.

165
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,969
I know.

166
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,271
Everyone says that it wasn't an accident

167
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,274
and that I was the one who killed her.

168
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,912
The press probably won't let me be,
once I'm out of prison.

169
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,147
But…

170
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,517
I really want to go to the laboratory,
no matter what.

171
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,920
I have to go there.

172
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,930
Will you protect me until I'm able to
offer my apologies to him?

173
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,242
I'm really sorry.

174
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,148
Due to our company's policy,
I am unable to accept your request.

175
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,686
Is that because… I'm a criminal?

176
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,556
I guess so.

177
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,327
There's no way
you would protect a murderer.

178
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,299
Thank you, Mr. Shimazaki.

179
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,702
You came all the way here
just to refuse my request.

180
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
I'm really grateful for
your consideration.

181
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,377
It has been a long time since
I was treated as a proper human being.

182
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,780
I'm glad that I sent you that request.

183
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,523
<i>About Matsuno's bodyguard request,</i>

184
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,926
<i>it would've been accepted
if we were back in Hinode.</i>

185
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,762
It can't be helped.

186
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,399
Kicks Corp. bought in Hinode.

187
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,535
That was tough.

188
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,577
Hey, how about changing your perspective?

189
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,581
Our salary increased,
and we only have VIPs as customers.

190
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,051
There's nothing to complain about
as a bodyguard.

191
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,153
You're really simple-minded.

192
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,488
Then what are you so unhappy about?

193
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,656
I don't know.

194
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,360
The security industry is growing rapidly,
for better or worse.

195
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,829
We have no choice but to follow suit.

196
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,664
I won't grow with it.

197
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,633
You're really childish.

198
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,103
Even I have my fair share of memories
back in Hinode too.

199
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,605
I didn't forget all of that.

200
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,109
But doesn't it feel much better
if you just focus on your current job?

201
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,449
Hey, are you listening?

202
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,186
Are you trying to kill me?

203
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,521
Fool.

204
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,096
SHIROYAMA GENERAL HOSPITAL

205
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,230
It hurts!

206
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,432
-That hurts!
-It's going to be done in an instant.

207
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,670
It wouldn't have been so painful if you
had it treated right after you got hurt.

208
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,605
I thought it wasn't a big deal.

209
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,040
Some professional you are.

210
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,609
Your body is an important part of
your work.

211
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,946
That hurts!

212
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,681
Come on, put it straight!

213
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,883
-Bite down on your teeth.
-Are you serious?

214
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,384
You're a demon.

215
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,621
Japan is getting really dangerous.

216
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,590
Who would've thought that

217
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,425
someone would launch
an assault at a party?

218
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,762
But my superior was happy and said that
it was a good advertisement for the firm.

219
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,096
Advertisement?

220
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,235
You should give guys like that
a good kick.

221
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,271
Hey, I'm working in a company.

222
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,240
Why are you acting all cool?

223
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,410
Being a bodyguard is about
protecting others,

224
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,914
but the company may not necessarily
protect the bodyguards themselves.

225
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,816
You'll die if you push yourself.

226
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,655
Just joking.

227
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,558
As a doctor,
I'm not in a position to lecture others.

228
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,061
Well, you're putting
your life on the line.

229
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,665
Make sure you don't have any regrets.

230
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,667
All right, all done!

231
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,870
I'll prescribe you
some anti-inflammatory drugs.

232
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,676
I'm sure you know, but please refrain
from consuming alcohol tonight.

233
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,178
-Yes.
-Good.

234
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,833
"No regrets", right…

235
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,108
Hinode has merged with Kicks Corp.
at the start of this year.

236
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm also glad that we were given
an opportunity at this time

237
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,748
to provide security services
for Assemblyman Kuwata.

238
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,520
Why is Kicks Corp., a top IT corporation,
interested in security services?

239
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,255
As I traveled around the world,

240
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,259
I learned that the level of security
defines a nation's international standing.

241
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,028
With Kicks' participation
in the security industry,

242
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,597
we will be able to develop

243
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,032
new security technologies
that incorporate communication.

244
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,402
I hope to improve international trust
in Japan in the future.

245
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,672
That is my new ambition.

246
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,183
How is your injury, Shimazaki?

247
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,018
It's fine.

248
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,389
But I suppose injury is part and parcel
of this occupation.

249
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,424
Be careful.

250
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,128
You're the ace
that will lead our security division.

251
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,096
Yes, sir.

252
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,533
President, I came here today
to consult about something.

253
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,638
Please take a look at this.

254
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,576
Oh, this?

255
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,580
The request was to protect him until
he offered his apology to the victim.

256
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,082
What's the matter, Shimazaki?

257
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,488
Our target clientele is VIPs.
I'm sure you know about that.

258
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,890
Yes, sir.

259
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,693
But I would like to meet him in person.

260
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,496
And if possible, I would like to
help him somehow…

261
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,298
Is that sympathy you're feeling?

262
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,068
Doesn't that contradict your duty
as a bodyguard?

263
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,605
You know,

264
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,576
I want to improve the societal status
of bodyguards in Japan.

265
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,913
I'm sure you understand.

266
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,055
Oh, it's time for my dinner meeting.

267
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,590
Thanks for coming.

268
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,193
I'm always open to direct negotiation.

269
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,970
FROM SHINSUKE MATSUNO

270
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,991
You're just mere bodyguards.

271
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,307
Did he go to the basement?

272
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,719
SUBWAY

273
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,104
Isn't he Mr. Kuwata's…

274
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,457
Japan is getting really dangerous.

275
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,825
<i>Who would've thought that</i>

276
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,460
<i>someone would launch
an assault at a party?</i>

277
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,702
Why did you meet
with Mr. Kuwata's secretary?

278
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,505
You received something just now,
didn't you?

279
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,310
-That hurts…
-Answer me!

280
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,878
I said it hurts!

281
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,150
Hey!

282
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,421
What did you receive?

283
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,626
Were you instructed to do that
under Mr. Kuwata's instructions?

284
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,894
What the hell are you doing?

285
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,235
Did you really want all that dirty money?

286
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,542
Don't talk all big, you bastard.

287
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,378
It was your president
who came up with that plan!

288
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,015
If you didn't get in the way,

289
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,818
the incident would have just ended with
your colleague getting a small scratch!

290
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,172
My supporters have rapidly increased,
thanks to you.

291
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,575
It was right of me to say that
I will never succumb to violence.

292
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,545
We have also received
a lot more inquiries.

293
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,881
Excuse me.

294
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,017
There is a message for you.

295
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,120
Please excuse me.

296
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,258
-Please excuse me for a moment.
-Sure.

297
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,503
I'll treat you to this.

298
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,172
Leave after you're done drinking it.

299
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,244
Were you having your dinner meeting
with Mr. Kuwata?

300
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,452
Just now, I met with the man
who attacked Mr. Kuwata.

301
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,635
That man received an envelope of cash
from Mr. Kuwata's secretary.

302
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,938
This is a portion of it.

303
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,107
Please return it to Mr. Kuwata.

304
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,178
What are you talking about?

305
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,785
In order to garner
sympathy votes for Mr. Kuwata

306
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,988
and to promote your own company,

307
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,526
did you two come up
with that ridiculous plan?

308
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,995
And you decided not to target Mr. Kuwata,

309
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,598
<i>but Sawaguchi, the most inexperienced
in our division?</i>

310
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,868
Let's calm down, shall we?

311
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,604
President.

312
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,641
We bodyguards are putting our lives
on the line in our work.

313
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,377
Shimazaki.

314
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,614
The thing about business is that

315
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,882
it's not about working your muscles,

316
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,585
but working your brains.

317
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,094
President, your method

318
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,132
may help you protect money,
but it will never help you protect lives.

319
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,102
Is that so?

320
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,170
I see.

321
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,410
What a shame. I bought you with my money.

322
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,850
But if you don't agree with my methods,

323
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,986
you are free to leave.

324
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,890
Of course, I'll give you
your severance payment accordingly.

325
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,561
But if you do that,

326
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,899
I'm afraid that it'll be hard for you
to get a job in the security industry.

327
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,737
"I don't want to do something
that will ruin my entire career."

328
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,473
Aren't you thinking of that right now?

329
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,478
Are you going to hit me?

330
00:21:55,614 --> 00:22:01,086
In the end, bodyguards only think about
resolving issues with violence.

331
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,860
That's why people always say that
bodyguards are no better than bouncers.

332
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,372
I understand.

333
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:26,078
There is no way I'm staying in Kicks Guard
after knowing something like this.

334
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm resigning.

335
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,416
In exchange,

336
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,619
please promise that

337
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:40,592
you will never do anything to mess with
the bodyguards working on-site ever again.

338
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,094
Otherwise…

339
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:47,165
I will expose everything that
you and Mr. Kuwata have done.

340
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,269
Please.

341
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,594
Hey.

342
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,063
Breakfast is ready.

343
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,131
SHUN SHIMAZAKI
AKIRA'S SON

344
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,299
-Fully toasted or lightly browned?
-Fully toasted.

345
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,173
Two eggs. This is bad.

346
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,307
What about it?

347
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,942
Is your work dangerous today?

348
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,344
Will your life be in danger?

349
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,515
How long do you think
we've been living together?

350
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,584
Let's see, you came over
from your mom's place

351
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,853
in December during
your first year in middle school…

352
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,588
So it's around a year and four months?

353
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,791
You didn't have to calculate it.
I was using it as an analogy.

354
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,792
Then tell me that sooner.

355
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,327
You know, you usually prepare
a filling breakfast

356
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,430
on days when you've resolved yourself…

357
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,898
Hey, why are you…

358
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,167
…that it might be your last meal.

359
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,868
I don't really mind, you know.

360
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,871
That's the life of a bodyguard after all.

361
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,307
I'm glad to hear that as a man.

362
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,544
But make sure you've done
all the necessary procedures.

363
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,013
Your severance pay, condolence money,
and life insurance policies…

364
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,581
Make sure
I'm the beneficiary of all these.

365
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,653
About that…

366
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,157
Man, that's hot.

367
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,225
You know…

368
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,329
I resigned from my company.

369
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,666
-What? I didn't hear anything about this!
-That's why I'm telling you now.

370
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,571
Don't tell me you got retrenched?

371
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,339
It's not exactly that.

372
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,942
-Then did you sexually harass--
-There's no way I did that!

373
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,611
To put it simply,

374
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:41,913
I was fired.

375
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,082
Then what are you going to do from now on?

376
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,218
-In fact, what about me--
-Don't worry.

377
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,454
No matter what, I'll make sure
you'll be able to attend university.

378
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,256
"No matter what"?

379
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,657
Oh, right.

380
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,092
This…

381
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,896
I decided that
I'm giving this to you first.

382
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,267
I'm counting on you from now on.

383
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,369
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
BODYGUARD

384
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,238
<i>I wonder what happened to Mr. Shimazaki.</i>

385
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,308
<i>He just suddenly resigned
and gave up on everything.</i>

386
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,277
That is so unlike him.

387
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,679
I'm sure he must've had some reason.

388
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,914
What kind of reason?

389
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,450
Maybe he suddenly felt like retiring?

390
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,085
You think that geezer would retire?

391
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,387
I mean, he injured himself
before his resignation.

392
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,524
There are times
when humans get scared all of a sudden.

393
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,628
And his son is growing up too.

394
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,030
Maybe he felt like
having a more secure job now.

395
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,799
Can he really find work
other than being a bodyguard?

396
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,868
Chairman Sudou will arrive at 11:00 a.m.

397
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,570
Is everyone ready?

398
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,804
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,941
Right.

400
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,044
I'll announce this since everyone is here.

401
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,880
With Shimazaki's departure,

402
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,483
the one to fill up the empty position
of Squad A's leader…

403
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,220
is you, Suganuma.

404
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:56,888
What?

405
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,894
President Ryu said that he would like
to make use of your image as a woman.

406
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,297
I hope you meet with his expectations.

407
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,499
Yes, sir!

408
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,604
He has arrived.

409
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,844
Pleased to meet you.

410
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:39,931
CHIBA CHUO DETENTION CENTER

411
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,434
Mr. Shimazaki!

412
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,106
You've worked hard.

413
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,177
I'm Shimazaki, here on
Mr. Matsuno's request for a bodyguard.

414
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,845
I'm Haneyama, Matsuno's attorney.

415
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,980
Thank you.

416
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,515
I've heard about what happened.

417
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,353
Will it really be all right for him
to go to the laboratory?

418
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,990
I've already obtained permission
from the professors there.

419
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,860
We'll reach Kamakura today, then head to
Kanto University of Technology tomorrow.

420
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,530
His release from prison
is still kept a secret,

421
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,466
but why didn't you come in a car?

422
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,102
Everyone would be able to see Matsuno!

423
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,237
I asked him to do this, Mr. Haneyama.

424
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,907
I can't hide from everyone forever.

425
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,509
I should get used to it.

426
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,012
I will take extra caution.

427
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,747
I'm counting on you.

428
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,585
You grew out your hair a little.

429
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,453
Oh, yes.

430
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,155
Right, here you go.

431
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,424
The phone you requested for.

432
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,960
I applied for a temporary contract
that lasts for a month.

433
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,094
Thank you very much.

434
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,731
I don't mean to be rude, but it's better
if you don't stand out from the crowd.

435
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,932
Please take this too.

436
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,634
Thank you for all these.

437
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:59,144
Actually, we've received
an anonymous call in our office

438
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,249
asking if it's right to let a murderer
like Matsuno roam around society freely.

439
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,587
I'm his attorney, so I believe in him…

440
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,291
but the majority of society believes that
Matsuno killed that woman.

441
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,127
KANTO UNIVERSITY FEMALE RESEARCHER
FATALLY SUFFOCATES IN LABORATORY COLD ROOM

442
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,096
THE ACCUSED, SHINSUKE MATSUNO,
AVOIDS THE DEATH PENALTY

443
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,764
Please don't forget that.

444
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,665
Yes.

445
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,736
Sorry to keep you waiting.

446
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,839
-Let's go.
-Yes.

447
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,312
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Thank you.

448
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,217
This is just something from me
to celebrate your release. Please.

449
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,553
Thank you.

450
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,155
Aren't you going to eat, Mr. Shimazaki?

451
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,025
I try my best not to eat when I'm on duty.

452
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,127
-All right, thank you.
-Please do.

453
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,269
Delicious.

454
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,338
I've tried the food
they served here before.

455
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,375
This place serves better <i>ebi</i> tempura than
the soba restaurant at the train station.

456
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,378
Please listen to me while you eat.

457
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:12,484
Usually, bodyguards work in pairs
to ensure that

458
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,053
we can carry out our duties perfectly.

459
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,023
However, I resigned from Kicks Guard,

460
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,459
so I will be the only one protecting you.

461
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,627
I understand.

462
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,499
Unlike police, private bodyguards are
not allowed to carry any firearms.

463
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,903
I've just become a freelancer,
so I can't even use a police baton.

464
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,040
In other words, I'm completely unarmed.

465
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,979
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

466
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,547
Yes.

467
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,685
I'm sorry that I have to use
some of the pay I saved from my workshop.

468
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,654
-I'll pay for your service in advance--
-No, it's fine.

469
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,189
You can pay me after it's done.

470
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,724
-But I would like to--
-No.

471
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,127
I will gladly accept it after my work
is successfully completed.

472
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,096
You're scary.

473
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,870
Excuse me, but you didn't resign from
your company because of me, did you?

474
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,376
No, but I've been thinking for a while.

475
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,145
I felt quite restricted working
for a company,

476
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,748
and I thought that I might feel
more at ease if I work as a freelancer.

477
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,417
-I see. Even so…
-Yes.

478
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,454
In my case, I couldn't return
to the organization anymore,

479
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,457
and I can't continue my research either.

480
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,293
It feels rather lonely.

481
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,797
I told myself that
I should never forget what I did.

482
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,704
Oh, so this is Ayako Itami…

483
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,773
And the one in the middle
is Professor Sakagami.

484
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,975
He's the top researcher in the laboratory.

485
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,279
He's a wonderful researcher
who poured his entire life into his work.

486
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,249
But that incident happened,

487
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,253
and I hurt the professor
I respected the most.

488
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,423
But he said he's waiting for you.

489
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,296
<i>If Matsuno really said that,
then I'll meet with him.</i>

490
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,631
Thank you very much.

491
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,001
We would like to keep
the media in the dark,

492
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,871
so could you keep his release a secret?

493
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,938
<i>Of course.</i>

494
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,573
Professor Sakagami…

495
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,680
I'm so grateful.

496
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,990
Let's go, Mr. Matsuno.

497
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,026
Please stop taking photos
with your phones.

498
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,864
-We'll leave through the kitchen.
-Okay.

499
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,367
Sorry, thanks for the food!

500
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,769
-Take care.
-We'll come again.

501
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,387
This is 01.

502
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,656
I'm entering the audience's seats.

503
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,612
This is 03.

504
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,248
A man with long hair in his twenties

505
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,518
is approaching the target
while checking the audience's seats.

506
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,620
This is 01. Understood. Please confirm.

507
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,788
This is 02. I'm on it.

508
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:37,889
Switching places with 05.

509
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,090
This is 05. Understood.

510
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,827
Excuse me, but could you please
present your staff pass?

511
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:43,895
Why would I need one?

512
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,830
What is with you?

513
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,565
Oh, you're here, Tamotsu!

514
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,268
He's my second son.

515
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,170
Why did you stop him?

516
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,207
I was instructed that anyone passing by
should present their staff pass.

517
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,076
-Do not talk back--
-I am really sorry!

518
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,011
You're really rude!

519
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,146
You're just a bodyguard.
Who do you think you are?

520
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,858
Don't show what you're thinking
on your face.

521
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,893
You must always obey the client.

522
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,530
Even if the clients themselves
do not observe the rules?

523
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,100
That's a given.

524
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,803
Bodyguards are
part of the service industry.

525
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,507
Fawning over clients will not allow us
to get rid of threats.

526
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,876
Don't be so conceited.

527
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,580
Do you think you're special
just because you're from the JSDF?

528
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,685
It's no wonder why
you've been overtaken by a woman.

529
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,791
Takanashi.

530
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,594
It's just a joke.

531
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,532
Let's be careful with
our words and actions.

532
00:33:55,333 --> 00:34:00,671
If you don't want
to end up like Shimazaki, that is.

533
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:01,706
What?

534
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,076
Didn't Shimazaki resign on his own accord?

535
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,412
Resume your duties.

536
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,392
Here's your ticket.

537
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,227
This way.

538
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,363
The departure time is 12:10 p.m.

539
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,231
We'll reach Kamakura after 3:00 p.m.

540
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,868
I've made reservations at a cheap hotel
near the university.

541
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,936
Thank you very much.

542
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,116
Hey. Isn't that Matsuno?

543
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,287
Please excuse me.

544
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,689
It seems like there are
news reporters and cameramen.

545
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,224
What? Was my release leaked to the press?

546
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,358
Don't look back!

547
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,527
-Mr. Matsuno?
-You're Mr. Matsuno, right?

548
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,462
Please excuse us.

549
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,630
Could you have a talk with us?

550
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,531
You're in the way!

551
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,501
-Mr. Matsuno?
-Please say something!

552
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,236
-Mr. Matsuno?
-That's Mr. Matsuno, right?

553
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,271
Please hand over
all the photos you've taken.

554
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,006
What are you saying? Where is Matsuno?

555
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,442
Are you allowed to cover news here?
Do you have a permit?

556
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,510
What about your armbands?

557
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,912
Who are you?
You're not with the police, right?

558
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,049
Just let us interview Matsuno.
I'm sure he wants to say something!

559
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,684
Why aren't you addressing him politely?

560
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,456
He has atoned for his sins
and has a future ahead of him.

561
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,960
He's not someone you can talk down on.

562
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,661
Please hand over the photos.

563
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,730
You're going against the regulations here!

564
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,401
-Give it to him.
-Are you serious?

565
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:38,736
Just give it to him!

566
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,977
Damn it.

567
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,880
-I can't accept it!
-Just forget it!

568
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,850
Sorry to keep you waiting.

569
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,725
Let's go.

570
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,051
You're Shun Shimazaki, right?

571
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,387
Yes.

572
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:33,925
I'm Takanashi, a colleague of your father
at his workplace.

573
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,394
Ex-colleague, you mean?

574
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,530
I see. So you know
that he resigned from his work.

575
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,632
Where is your father right now?

576
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:47,905
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

577
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,210
Please.

578
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,082
It appears that
our movement is being leaked,

579
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,717
so we'll have to stay here tonight.

580
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
Even so,

581
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,789
I've only just rented this place,
so there's nothing.

582
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,790
It's all right.

583
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,826
Compared to prison,
this place feels like heaven.

584
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,297
Oh, you should have a shower
if you would like to.

585
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,132
I'll turn on the hot water supply.

586
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,269
Let me take out a towel.

587
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,175
If you don't mind,
you can change into these.

588
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,643
Oh, thank you very much.

589
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,625
-Hello?
-Hello.

590
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,494
I'm working now,
so I'll just get to the point.

591
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,396
I'm staying out for the night.

592
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,499
There's gratin in the fridge,

593
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,968
so eat that, and make sure
the doors are all closed before you sleep.

594
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,471
Are you listening?

595
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,308
Make sure you're not late
for school tomorrow.

596
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,479
Also, don't call me
if there's nothing important.

597
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,380
Bye.

598
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,950
He said he's not coming home tonight
because of work.

599
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,652
Work…

600
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,487
He's always messing around.

601
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,188
He gave me this right after he resigned.

602
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,724
I see.

603
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,494
You're right, he's messing around.

604
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,796
Isn't it impossible to survive
as a freelance bodyguard?

605
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,865
He should think about his age!

606
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,566
You're right, he should.

607
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,036
Can't you tell him off, Mr. Takanashi?

608
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,172
Tell him to quit being a bodyguard
and get a proper job instead.

609
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,709
Are you really fine
with him quitting as a bodyguard?

610
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,110
I'm all for it, in fact.

611
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,845
I mean, it's a dangerous job.

612
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,548
There are times
when our work makes someone happy.

613
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,183
But you guys earn too little
to justify that.

614
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,385
But food tastes so much better
when you finish your work.

615
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,188
Then are you telling him
to continue his work?

616
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,324
I'm not saying that…

617
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,491
Make yourself clear!

618
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,626
You talk too much.

619
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,628
There are things in life
that can't be made clear.

620
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,930
You don't act like an adult,
Mr. Takanashi.

621
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,532
I don't want a kid like you
to tell me that!

622
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,034
What's so funny?

623
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,003
I think I like you, Mr. Takanashi.

624
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,709
Thanks.

625
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:07,845
I'm done.

626
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,046
Oh, thanks.

627
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:09,947
Please go ahead.

628
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,149
Oh, I'm all right.

629
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,984
I won't be able to protect you
if I'm naked.

630
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,857
That phone call just now…
Did you call your child?

631
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,227
Oh, sorry. It was a personal call.

632
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,496
I'm divorced,

633
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,299
so I'm living with my son.

634
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,302
I'm envious.

635
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,373
I might've had a family of my own
if this incident hadn't happened.

636
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,577
I'm from Café Junction!

637
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,580
It's okay. I asked the shop downstairs
to deliver some food.

638
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,715
I'm coming!

639
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,290
-I've brought what you requested!
-You don't have to come in.

640
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,527
-Give me that.
-I'm glad you got your first assignment!

641
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,697
I never thought that someone would
actually need a bodyguard.

642
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,634
It wouldn't be a job in the first place
if no one needed it.

643
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,069
-Here's 3,800 yen.
-Okay.

644
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,472
If you have any additional purchases,
you can pay altogether.

645
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,473
Additional purchases?

646
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,476
There's a man outside the building
who keeps looking up over here.

647
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,911
No additional purchases.

648
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,312
-Oh, all right.
-Thank you.

649
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,781
-Thank you--
-Thanks!

650
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,187
Did the media find out about this?

651
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,191
Don't worry.

652
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,126
I won't let them in here.

653
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,328
Please have a seat.

654
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:37,768
Mr. Matsuno.

655
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,571
Can I ask you something?

656
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,206
Sure.

657
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,477
Was it really just an accident?

658
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,182
No, I'm not doubting you.

659
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,286
But if I don't know the truth,

660
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,055
I won't know the best way to protect you.

661
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:03,427
I promise not to tell anyone,
so could you please tell me?

662
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,264
My duty

663
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,901
is to prevent any potential problems
from happening.

664
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,105
I believe this is one
of the potential problems.

665
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,286
It was an accident.

666
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,955
Yes.

667
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:36,126
It was before Professor Sakagami
made his research presentation.

668
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,963
My days were just full of
nothing but lab experiments,

669
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,866
and I was really exhausted
from pulling consecutive all-nighters.

670
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,169
<i>We were doing research</i>

671
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,939
<i>on bacteria found within an ice pillar
that we brought back from the South Pole.</i>

672
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:53,544
<i>We spent a huge amount of money
in order to obtain that ice pillar.</i>

673
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,483
<i>However, the cold room
in the laboratory malfunctioned…</i>

674
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,953
<i>And the ice pillar began to melt.</i>

675
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:04,922
-Itami.
-Yes?

676
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,390
Gather all the liquid nitrogen we have.

677
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,192
Yes, I understand!

678
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,528
<i>In a panic to cool down
the room immediately,</i>

679
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,664
<i>I asked Itami to release
liquid nitrogen into the cold room.</i>

680
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,534
-I'll call Professor Sakagami!
-Please do!

681
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:28,178
<i>Because of that,
the oxygen in the cold room depleted.</i>

682
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,516
<i>As I was on my way
to notify Professor Sakagami,</i>

683
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,585
<i>I didn't notice that she was in danger.</i>

684
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,353
<i>Because of that accident,</i>

685
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,757
<i>Professor Sakagami's research
was frowned upon by society.</i>

686
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:45,296
That's why I have to meet him,
no matter what.

687
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,566
Thank you very much.

688
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,470
I will put my faith in you, Mr. Matsuno.

689
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,540
Please.

690
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,484
Sorry.

691
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,988
We might have been followed
from the bus terminal.

692
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,591
Could you please check
if it's an acquaintance of yours?

693
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,372
What are you doing?

694
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,541
Stay back.

695
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,812
I must talk to Matsuno!

696
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,181
-Who is this?
-Ms. Itami's younger brother.

697
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,183
You can talk to me instead.

698
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,851
Matsuno, you lucky bastard.

699
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,252
You actually got a bodyguard and all?

700
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,288
Mr. Matsuno has
atoned for his sins properly!

701
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,223
How could he have atoned
when all he did was lie?

702
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,859
It's not too late, Matsuno.

703
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,260
Tell me the truth!

704
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,564
I received a call from my sister
before the incident!

705
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,400
<i>There's a problem at the lab,
so I'll be home late.</i>

706
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,103
<i>Please let Mom know
so that she won't get worried.</i>

707
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,138
What problem are you talking about?

708
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,339
<i>It's all right.</i>

709
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,909
<i>I'm going to sue him.</i>

710
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,312
It wasn't brought up during the trial,

711
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,180
but she was referring to you!

712
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,750
<i>That photo was the evidence!</i>

713
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,520
<i>That was definitely no accident!</i>

714
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,122
You killed her!

715
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,090
Tell us the truth!

716
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,158
Please stop.

717
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,693
Move aside!

718
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,905
Let go! I'm dead serious!

719
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,374
I'll never forgive you!

720
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:42,980
It's the signal…

721
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,986
Open the door as hard as you can!

722
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,994
What a run-down office.

723
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,265
He's an ex-colleague of mine.

724
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,133
He won't report it to the police.

725
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,536
Oh, no. You can call the police.

726
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,337
I'm the one at fault after all.

727
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,275
Why are you guys protecting
a murderer like him?

728
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,377
Do you protect anyone
as long as they give you money…

729
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,679
Damn it!

730
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,217
Why did you open the door?

731
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,189
I thought that if it was a reporter,
I would tell them to stop following us.

732
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,624
So I just opened it without thinking.
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:39,770
I'm closing the door.

734
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,040
CHUO WARD, TOKYO
APRIL 16, THURSDAY

735
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,680
What are you doing?

736
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:51,515
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,451
The company's going to be mad at you
if they find out you're helping me!

738
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,720
I'm not helping you.
I'm helping the client.

739
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:58,956
Let's hurry up.

740
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,158
The client's safety
is our responsibility, right?

741
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,101
Estimated time to reach
Sasano Town, Kamakura City is 1:00 p.m.

742
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,970
The time now is 11:35 a.m.

743
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,371
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

744
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,313
KANTO UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY

745
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,955
-We've arrived, Mr. Matsuno.
-Okay.

746
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,757
We're news reporters,
and we would like to know

747
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,493
-about the incident in the cold room…
-So they came here, anyway…

748
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,228
I'll go fill up the visitor's form.

749
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,931
I heard that Shinsuke Matsuno
has been released from prison.

750
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,099
Is that so?

751
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,736
<i>We can't stay here any longer.
Let's go through the back of the building.</i>

752
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,005
Understood.

753
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,474
Please lower your head, Mr. Matsuno.

754
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,118
Let's do this.

755
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,054
Change places, Takanashi.

756
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,996
Sorry, but we'll climb all the way
to the seventh floor.

757
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,115
Professor Sakagami's research lab
is up ahead.

758
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,886
If we enter now,
students and staff members will notice us.

759
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,155
We have no choice.

760
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,423
What?

761
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,893
Mr. Matsuno wants that exactly.

762
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,527
Am I wrong?

763
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:23,533
I've been thinking about how the media
got info about your release so soon.

764
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,238
Didn't you leak the information
using your phone?

765
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,377
You turned your face toward the reporters
at the bus terminal, didn't you?

766
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:37,080
And you opened the door without asking
back in my office.

767
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,882
Even just now,
you deliberately lifted your head

768
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,751
so that others would notice you, right?

769
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,222
Your actions don't seem like
you're afraid of the press.

770
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,324
In fact, you were waiting for them.

771
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,227
What exactly do you want?

772
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,769
There's no way I would tell everything
to mere bodyguards!

773
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,507
I guess you're right.

774
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,849
In fact, there's something that
I've been hiding from you as well.

775
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,954
I said I resigned from my company
because I wanted more freedom,

776
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,088
but that was a lie.

777
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:19,756
The truth is…

778
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,226
I was fired
because I talked back to my boss.

779
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,899
"Whether it's an ex-convict or not,
we should help those in need."

780
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:29,967
That's what I told him.

781
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,138
However…

782
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,575
I don't regret my decision now.

783
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,981
I…

784
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,617
I don't belong to any organization.

785
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,287
As long as you tell me the truth,

786
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,557
I intend to protect you to the very end,
even if it means breaking the law.

787
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,167
-Mr. Matsuno!
-I'll deal with the guard.

788
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,955
It's been a while, Professor Sakagami.

789
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,327
I'm Shimazaki, his bodyguard.

790
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,162
Please allow me to stay here.

791
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,766
Please leave. I have something important
to tell Professor Sakagami.

792
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,771
Please move aside.

793
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,707
Move!

794
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,909
You want to know the truth, right?

795
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,712
He was the one who let Ms. Itami die!

796
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,389
It's over…

797
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:04,461
There goes your dream as a researcher too…

798
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,498
<i>Professor Sakagami ordered Itami
to release the liquid nitrogen!</i>

799
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,436
<i>I took the blame to protect his research!</i>

800
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,741
<i>But when those photos appeared on my desk,
I realized the truth.</i>

801
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,877
Professor Sakagami was the one
who took the photos.

802
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:22,746
Wasn't it?

803
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,749
The dirt on your camera lens appeared
on the photos!

804
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,720
<i>You were the one who tried to
approach Ms. Itami,</i>

805
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,656
<i>weren't you, Professor Sakagami?</i>

806
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,058
<i>That was no accident!</i>

807
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,927
She said she was going to sue you!

808
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,629
You were the one who killed her!

809
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,401
Professor Sakagami…

810
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,437
The media is waiting
right at the front gate.

811
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,341
Reveal the truth in front of the cameras,

812
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,778
and apologize for the fact
that you robbed her of her future!

813
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,614
So you want revenge?

814
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:58,648
Yes.

815
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,884
If you don't reveal the truth,

816
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:02,853
then I'll kill you.

817
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,692
-You…
-Is this what you were planning?

818
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,293
Yes!

819
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,463
I gathered the press because
I wanted Professor Sakagami to confess!

820
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:14,998
I hired you because

821
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,369
I wanted you to protect me
in case someone gets in the way!

822
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,906
Are you running away, Professor Sakagami?

823
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,641
Get off me!

824
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:30,747
Hey!

825
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,884
Why are you running away?

826
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:36,720
Professor Sakagami!

827
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,825
I've adjusted the settings
for the door lock,

828
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,693
<i>so it won't open from the inside.</i>

829
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,030
I also told staff members
not to come to the lab today.

830
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,799
If I have to tarnish my own reputation,

831
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,402
I would rather choose to die.

832
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,840
Ever since I heard you were coming,

833
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,042
I had planned to do this.

834
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,343
Wait a minute.

835
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:04,781
You're planning to die with Mr. Matsuno
just to silence him?

836
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,751
I have the responsibility
of protecting this lab.

837
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,186
Don't worry.

838
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,924
You'll start to feel sleepy
after 30 minutes.

839
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,193
You won't feel any pain.

842
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,145
Takanashi.

843
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,215
-Takanashi.
-You won't reach him!

844
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,417
You won't be able to hear anything
from outside either.

845
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,988
We spent millions on this security system
to protect the valuable ice pillar!

846
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,428
I'm in front of the laboratory.
Where are you?

847
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,196
Can you hear me?

850
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:19,522
You're just sacrificing the lives of
others for your own reputation!

851
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:20,690
You know, Matsuno…

852
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,629
researchers are all egoists.

853
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,299
Sakagami!

854
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,534
Can you hear me, Shimazaki?

855
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,137
Shimazaki?

856
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,408
Where the hell are you, Akira Shimazaki?

857
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:41,411
I came here with the determination
to kill him, so let me do it!

858
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,514
My duty is to protect you.

859
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,583
I'm going to die anyway!

860
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,418
You too!

861
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,555
Please excuse me.

862
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,597
I'm not going to give up.

863
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,769
I still haven't received my pay from you.

864
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:39,803
Shimazaki?

865
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,909
Shimazaki!

Mr. Matsuno!

872
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:32,889
It's frozen tight.

873
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:46,770
That's…

874
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:36,619
Professor Sakagami…

875
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,323
Could you please turn yourself in?

876
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,399
Mr. Matsuno did not come here
to exact revenge.

877
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,669
As someone he once respected,
I believe he came here

878
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,971
because he wanted to
place his trust in you again.

879
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,629
-What is that?
-What's going on?

880
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,031
-He's handcuffed?
-Let's go!

KANAGAWA POLICE

-Take pictures!
-Hey!

883
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,116
Well, how much is the payment?

884
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,417
You're asking that now?

885
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,124
It's for 30 hours,
so it'll be 150,000 yen.

886
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,692
You don't have to pay any taxes.

887
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:52,962
Here's the receipt.

888
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:56,933
The amount is correct.

889
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,770
Mr. Shimazaki.

890
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,941
You really are a fool.

891
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,113
You realized what I planned to do,

892
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,050
yet you followed me to the very end.

893
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,054
I'm your bodyguard after all.

894
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,395
You protected my future.

895
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:31,301
Thank you for stopping me.

896
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,577
We would like to invite you
for a questioning.

897
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:08,071
<i>Really? I never expected that to happen.</i>

898
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,072
Yes.

899
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,741
I never thought that Shimazaki
and even Takanashi would be there.

900
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,844
They went against your expectations.

901
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,147
-I'm truly sorry.
-It's fine.

902
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,786
This would probably be
their last assignment as bodyguards.

903
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,724
I'll overlook it.

904

NORTH KAMAKURA STATION,

That hurts…

906
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,001
I sprained my waist.

907
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,003
Of course, you did, you old geezer.

908
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,305
You're almost an old geezer too.

909
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,041
-When did you realize Mr. Matsuno's plan?
-What?

910
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,478
Don't tell me you knew everything
from the start?

911
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,914
Well, I thought that it'll be dangerous,

912
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,516
-so…
-Unbelievable.

913
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,919
You were about to sacrifice your own life
for a single client!

914
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,454
There was no choice!

915
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,390
I'm a bodyguard.

916
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,562
I heard you went against the president.

917
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,197
Tell me about it.

918
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,167
Is it just me,
or have you been talking down on me?

919
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,635
You're not my superior now.

920
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,606
As expected of an ex-SDF officer.
You're so strict with hierarchy.

921
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,341
Stop joking and tell me.

922
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,143
What happened
between you and the president?

923
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,077
Thanks for today.

924
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,713
In fact,

925
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,016
I should say you saved me.

926
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,661
Hello.

927
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,130
You might get yourself fired
for violating service regulations!

928
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,866
Why did you keep this from me?

929
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,736
I wanted to know.

930
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,338
<i>About what?</i>

931
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,210
<i>I can't be in a relationship with you
like this.</i>

932
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,145
Let's end it.

933
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,817
-I understand.
-What?

934
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,019
You don't have to look after
a child like me anymore.

935
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:07,724
He's joking, right?

936
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,994
I'll never forgive him!

937
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,400
Takanashi has finally done it…

938
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:22,905
Good work today!

939
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:26,876
That was dangerous.

940
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:28,878
What now?

941
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,315
What's up?

942
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,487
Hey!

943
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,557
I'm not a taxi driver, you know…

944
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,536
<i>She's a blind pianist.</i>

945
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,305
You think that it's a pain trying
to protect a selfish girl like me.

946
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,775
-Do you really plan to work with me?
-<i>Don't make me repeat myself.</i>

947
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,143
<i>The two of them are working together.</i>

948
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,746
Being blind is nothing special.
I don't want to use it to my advantage.

949
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:04,947
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.

950
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:05,848
Watch out!

951
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,216
