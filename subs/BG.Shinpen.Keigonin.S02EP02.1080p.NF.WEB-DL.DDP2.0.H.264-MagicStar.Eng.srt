1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,691
What? You left Kicks Guard,
and now, you want to join my office?

2
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,760
Yes. I've decided that I'll join you.

3
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,962
Hey, don't just make
that decision on your own!

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031
But there's no place for me
in Kicks Guard anymore.

5
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:32,999
What?

6
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:40,140
Oh, was it because you helped me
with that last assignment?

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,109
I'll call the chief

8
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:50,150
and tell them that
I was the one who forced you to help,

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,651
so just go along and bow your head down.

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,392
Don't just act on impulse!

11
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,430
Didn't you fight with the president
and resign on impulse too?

12
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,365
-We didn't exactly fight.
-So what happened?

13
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,733
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,169
If you tell me the reason,
I won't mind bowing my head down to them.

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,237
It wasn't even anything serious… What?

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,205
Isn't that strange?

17
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,807
"I won't mind"?

18
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,141
This concerns you, you know?

19
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,924
MAYU SUGANUMA
BODYGUARD, KICKS GUARD

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,826
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI
BODYGUARD, KICKS GUARD

21
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,135
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,404
Are you a new employee
of Shimazaki Security?

23
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,305
No.

24
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,376
Anyway, don't underestimate
the rent in this building--

25
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,145
-I'm not.
-You're not?

26
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,182
This place is old,
but it's still quite expensive.

27
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,683
You should promote your business more.

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,253
-Thanks for your kind advice.
-By the way…

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,788
I major in Computer Science
at my university.

30
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,825
Just let me know if you want
to set up a company website.

31
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,494
I'll help you set one up
for a cheap consultation fee.

32
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,170
Hey, could you read the room?

33
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,908
I'm not in a position
to employ anyone at the moment.

34
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,380
Particularly someone who is
entirely brawny and tactless like you

35
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,116
will be of no help
to a small company like mine.

36
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,518
-Do you get me?
-Are you sure you can do it alone?

37
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,089
I just have no choice but to make do
with small assignments

38
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,958
that don't require much manpower.

39
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,660
Shun was worried.

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,695
He doesn't know
what is going to happen to him.

41
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,031
I'll make sure he has
nothing to worry about… What?

42
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,732
Just what did you talk about with Shun?

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,378
Ema.

44
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,981
You didn't put your heart into the music.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,783
I'm glad that wasn't
the actual performance.

46
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,994
The car is this way.

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,532
Please take one step down.

48
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,980
It was a wonderful performance.

49
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,315
I'm sure you'll win
the international piano competition.

50
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,819
Please.

51
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,593
-Ema!
-It's dangerous!

52
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,306
Mr. Takanashi?

53
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,674
We talked a lot.

54
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,010
He brought me some adzuki bean jelly too.

55
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,045
I see… It wasn't meat buns.

56
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,813
He's interesting.

57
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,549
That Takanashi actually said
something interesting?

58
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,918
No, he didn't.

59
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,987
That's why he's interesting.

60
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,691
My homeroom teacher tries so hard
to be funny that it's painful to watch.

61
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,662
-You're quite harsh on people.
-Not really.

62
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,898
Hey.

63
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,970
Everything will be fine, Shun.

64
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,406
You told Takanashi, right?

65
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,975
You were worried about
what is going to happen from now on.

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,912
Well, we'll survive somehow.

67
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,448
But I guess saying "somehow"
sounds very irresponsible.

68
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,950
I'll do something about it.

69
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,357
I mean, I do have 25 years of experience
being a bodyguard, after all.

70
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,159
So…

71
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,695
I'm finally independent after establishing

72
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,997
-a management outlook in my office--
-How discouraging.

73
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,801
A blind person
is aiming to be the world's best.

74
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,570
I wonder what I'm even doing here.

75
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,471
Wait.

76
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,208
-You still have a long road ahead of you.
-No way.

77
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,279
My parent is a divorcee,
and he just resigned from his job.

78
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,314
<i>Her music has surpassed
500,000 downloads online.</i>

79
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,083
I know my place in the world.

80
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,452
-Thanks for the food.
<i>-She will be leaving for Poland next week.</i>

81
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>Will she be able to
overcome her visual handicap</i>

82
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,358
<i>and realize her dream of being
the world's best pianist?</i>

83
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,625
APRIL 15
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

84
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,511
What?

85
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,386
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

86
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,156
I was so surprised
since you left without saying anything.

87
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,495
So this is your office.

88
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,798
It's not exactly retro,

89
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,733
but your office does have
a certain atmosphere to it.

90
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,172
-It has been a while.
-Yes.

91
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,874
I asked Takanashi for your address.

92
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,008
I see.

93
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,879
So, did he go back to Kicks Guard?

94
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:53,946
Yes, he did.

95
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,382
But the chief was angry at him.

96
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,519
What am I supposed to think about
you helping someone who left our company?

97
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,455
Is he talking about Shimazaki?

98
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:05,958
Takanashi.

99
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,762
You're an employee of Kicks Guard, right?

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,768
So…

101
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,637
are you here to spy on me today?

102
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,906
It's not that!

103
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm here to give you some work.

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,343
You? Giving me work?

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,013
Are you sure you want
to talk to me like that?

106
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,015
Here. She's a VIP.

107
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,149
VIP? Who?

108
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,384
Ema Morio.

109
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,019
-Oh, that pianist?
-Yes.

110
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,389
The blind pianist they dubbed as
"the Cinderella of the classical world."

111
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,959
Well, I'm grateful, but…

112
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,696
it's impossible for me
since I'm working alone.

113
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,431
Actually,

114
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,668
she was originally under our protection
in Kicks Guard.

115
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,003
But well, we decided to drop her.

116
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,906
No one is willing to take over from us,

117
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,609
so the chief suggested
that we pass it over to you.

118
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,743
Wait.

119
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,580
So Kicks Guard dropped her?

120
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,182
-But no one wants to take over?
-Yes.

121
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,551
Why? Isn't she a famous pianist?

122
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,654
That's… something I can't reveal.

123
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,024
Please ask the client directly.

124
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,496
INVESTIGATION REPORT

125
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,865
The International Piano Competition
is drawing near.

126
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,200
Everyone expects you to
win the competition.

127
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,568
Are you confident?

128
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,804
I'm not confident at all.

129
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,139
Oh, you're really humble!

130
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,675
I'm Shimazaki.

131
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,245
I came here
for Ema Morio's bodyguard request.

132
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,212
Please give me a moment.

133
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,947
-Sure.
-I'm Takanashi, here on the same request.

134
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,783
Our representative will meet you.

135
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,851
This way.

136
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,752
-Yes.
-Yes.

137
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,755
Leave.

138
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,459
They canceled my contract
before I could bow down my head to them.

139
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,461
I don't regret anything.

140
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,964
That company only knows
how to fawn over women.

141
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,166
Don't worry.
I know how to smile, at least.

142
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,436
Just get on the elevator quickly.

143
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,606
I'm Shimazaki.

144
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,841
Thank you for the name card.

145
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,778
-You're Mr. Shimazaki, and you're…
-I'm Takanashi.

146
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,046
Mr. Takanashi.

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,483
I'm Miwa Moria, Ema's older sister.

148
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,886
I'm the company president, and I oversee
Ema's management as an artist.

149
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,155
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

150
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,726
I heard you've left Kicks Guard
to set up your own office.

151
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,131
I'm sorry, but will it really be possible
with just the two of you?

152
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,833
Oh, I understand
what you're worried about.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,469
But we don't have strict rules
unlike the big companies,

154
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,906
so we'll be able to deal with
all types of situations accordingly.

155
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,942
I see.

156
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,113
Ema will leave on the 22nd
for the International Piano Competition.

157
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,284
Can I trust you to protect her
until she returns from Poland?

158
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,621
We'll pay you the same amount
as we offered to the big companies.

159
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,691
Before we accept this assignment,
can I ask you something?

160
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,692
Go ahead.

161
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,895
I heard that Kicks Guard terminated
the bodyguard request.

162
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,233
And if I recall, even Guard Tech
rejected the request as well.

163
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,973
Will you accept the request,
no matter what I tell you?

164
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,846
It's just a joke. I'm sorry.

165
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,582
But since you requested
for bodyguard services,

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,286
then you must perceive that
she is in some sort of danger.

167
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,190
-Yes.
-Is she being targeted by someone?

168
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,292
Do you know who it could be?

169
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,894
Yes.

170
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,063
Who is it?

171
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,566
Have you contacted the police?

172
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,868
-No.
-Who is it?

173
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,473
If you don't tell us, we won't know
how to deal with the situation.

174
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,743
It's…

175
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,511
Ema herself.

176
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,386
There are cases where visually-impaired
pianists have won in competitions,

177
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,821
but not in the case of
international competitions.

178
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,424
If you win, you will be writing
a new page in history.

179
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,593
How do you feel about that?

180
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,629
There is no way I would answer
a ridiculous question like that.

181
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,535
What's the matter, Ema?

182
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,971
You're in the middle of an interview…
Watch out!

183
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,540
You can't injure your fingers!

184
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,474
Get away from me.

185
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,747
It's as you've seen.

186
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,717
She would leave without her guiding stick

187
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,920
and has even tried to
kill herself multiple times.

188
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,955
Kicks Guard told us that

189
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,760
they cannot protect someone who
constantly tries to put herself in danger.

190
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,129
Is there any reason why
she has been trying to kill herself?

191
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,598
It's probably because of

192
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,368
the overwhelming pressure that
she deals with due to her fame.

193
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,272
But it has been her dream to participate
in the International Piano Competition.

194
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,474
If she doesn't overcome this,

195
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,810
she won't be able to survive as a pianist.

196
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,246
Could you please
take her to Poland safely?

197
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,349
I understand. We will accept your request.

198
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,160
Are you crazy?

199
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,363
Bodyguards protect their clients
from external threats.

200
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,033
I've never heard of a case where
the clients themselves are the threat.

201
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,035
It doesn't change the fact that
we need to protect them.

202
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,304
We're bodyguards.

203
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,940
If you don't like this, then leave!

204
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,043
With skills like yours,
any company would gladly welcome you.

205
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,485
Ms. Ema!

206
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,920
Who are you?

207
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,523
I received your bodyguard request
from your sister.

208
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,391
I'm your bodyguard, Shimazaki.

209
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,726
I'm Takanashi.

210
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,662
I said I don't need a bodyguard.

211
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,700
It's just exhausting to have
someone unrelated following me around.

212
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,601
But…

213
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,337
it's important to keep you safe
before the competition.

214
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,673
Say something.

215
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
You know…

216
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,013
Let's realize your dreams in Poland.

217
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,282
Don't say things you don't mean!

218
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,051
It's easy to tell what you think
from your tone.

219
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,021
You…

220
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,525
You think that it's a pain trying
to protect a selfish girl like me.

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,361
And as for you,

222
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,664
you're confident that you'll be able to
tame anyone, no matter who it is.

223
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,202
Do you guys think that
blind people can't see for real?

224
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,571
It's the opposite.

225
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,740
We can see exactly because we're blind.

226
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,409
Everything, in fact.

227
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,977
About Ema Morio,

228
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,815
Shimazaki and Takanashi have
accepted her bodyguard request.

229
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,283
I see.

230
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,652
In the end,
the two of them are working together.

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,989
Isn't it wonderful?
You helped your seniors.

232
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,491
Yes.

233
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,262
I wanted to be with her
until she left for Poland.

234
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,533
But the client tried to kill herself
right before your eyes.

235
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,903
I protected her
and averted the crisis immediately.

236
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,905
I had the confidence to protect her

237
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,440
-until our contract was up.
-Hey.

238
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,277
Don't get ahead of yourself just because
you're appointed as the new leader.

239
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,381
President Ryu terminated her contract
for your sake.

240
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,050
For our sake?

241
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,719
If something happened
to a famous pianist like her,

242
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,388
not only will the company's reputation
be tarnished,

243
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,190
the bodyguards themselves
will be under fire too.

244
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,393
Protecting your future

245
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,129
is my responsibility
as the CEO of the company.

246
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,932
Shouldn't protecting the client be
our top priority instead?

247
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,468
COMMERCIAL LAW CASE STUDIES

248
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,474
It doesn't matter if
it's Shimazaki or Takanashi…

249
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,312
you bodyguards from Hinode Security
are really interesting.

250
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,147
I'm truly sorry.

251
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,817
They are capable,

252
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,253
but they lack manners.

253
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,455
-I will educate them accordingly.
-No, it's fine.

254
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,057
I love energetic employees.

255
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,328
I'll make an exception
and tell you my thoughts.

256
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,598
In business,
it's important to avoid risks.

257
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,967
It's no exception
in the security industry.

258
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,670
If there are potential risks
in an assignment,

259
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,573
just throw it to a subcontractor.

260
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,608
A subcontractor…

261
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,396
We have our meals over here.

262
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,431
I usually make breakfast,

263
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,334
and the part-time housekeeper
makes lunch and dinner.

264
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,770
As for the location of objects,

265
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,638
please relay it to her
in terms of clock position.

266
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,275
For example, "Your scores are
at your 12 o'clock position."

267
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,244
I understand.

268
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,414
These drawers…

269
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,186
Is this for suicide prevention?

270
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,557
No. I can't allow her hands
to get injured,

271
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,760
so we usually lock up any drawers
that could potentially cause injury.

272
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,166
If I recall, your mother passed away
three years ago?

273
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,233
Yes.

274
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,604
Ema got into an accident
when she was five years old.

275
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,342
Our father passed away from the accident,
and she lost her vision.

276
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,912
Putting her own life on the line,
our mother spent her entire life

277
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,382
bringing Ema up to be a skillful pianist
despite her visual impairment.

278
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,086
-Do you play the piano as well, Ms. Miwa?
-Yes.

279
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,756
I attended piano lessons at the church
up until middle school.

280
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,192
The piano sounds Ema heard
during my practice

281
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,594
was the reason why
she became interested in playing it.

282
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,298
Good morning, Ms. Ema.

283
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,201
Today, you'll be having your final lesson
at the conservatory,

284
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,403
and then your send-off party
will be held later tonight.

285
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,705
We'll be with you.

286
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,543
Please rest assured.

287
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,079
I don't need the stick
in places I'm familiar with.

288
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,118
I'm sorry. Please show us the way then.

289
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,076
-We've arrived at the conservatory.
-I know.

290
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,112
The piano faculty is over this way.

291
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,049
It's dangerous, so please
hold the stick while you're outdoors.

292
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,584
Isn't it your job
to protect me from danger?

293
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,688
There's an elevated step
in your 12 o'clock position.

294
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,728
There's a group of people
in your 11 o'clock position.

295
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,833
You're doing quite well for someone
who did last-minute cramming.

296
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,638
Bodyguards often use the clock position
when protecting our clients.

297
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,240
The clock is
a universal concept, after all.

298
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,346
Hey, Ema Morio is here.

299
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,183
-Hey, don't you think she can see?
-She must've been lying!

300
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,552
Ema!

301
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,654
Who is this man?

302
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,721
Everyone is waiting for you.

303
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,990
You're her bodyguards, right?

304
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,525
I heard from Ms. Miwa.

305
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,695
I'm Sakurai. I used to teach Ema.

306
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,163
This way, please.

307
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:20,966
Please.

308
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,447
Oh, Ema!

309
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,321
The day is finally here, Ema.

310
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,760
The International Piano Competition
values expressive artists.

311
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,599
Please forget about your handicap
and play to your heart's content.

312
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,401
What's the matter, Ema?

313
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,871
Your professor
is offering kind words of advice to you.

314
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,345
I'll take your bag.

315
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,729
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY TALENT!

316
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,001
Now, please play
as if you're at the actual event.

317
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,870
What was that paper?

318
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,642
It was a message of encouragement.

319
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,745
Please read it, Mr. Sakurai.

320
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,013
What?

321
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,084
Please perform to
the best of your abilities!

322
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,786
We're cheering you on.

323
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,454
You're lying.

324
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,957
It probably says that
I'm given special treatment

325
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,158
because of my handicap, right?

326
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,395
It's what you and all the students
think of me.

327
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,018
Are you all right?

328
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,721
Don't pity me.

329
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,390
That was my fault.

330
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,760
So why would you ask if I'm all right?
That's a strange thing to say.

331
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,295
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,533
You're right. I said that out of habit.
Please forgive me.

333
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,134
There's a place I want to go to.

334
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,338
-Where is it?
-Shibuya.

335
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,472
Why?

336
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,274
You have a send-off party tonight.

337
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,342
No particular reason.

338
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,377
I like the smell of the streets there.

339
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,022
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,359
I…

341
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,263
I outsourced a dangerous job
to Shimazaki and Takanashi.

342
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,599
Why are you apologizing to me?

343
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,501
I have nothing to do with them anymore.

344
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,636
But somehow,

345
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,804
don't you think it's strange?

346
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,806
That when the president

347
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,409
talked about Shimazaki and Takanashi…

348
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,711
he sounded very cold.

349
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,814
The security industry
is already lacking manpower,

350
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,517
yet he doesn't even make them stay,
even though they're so capable.

351
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,353
-It's really strange.
-I'm surprised.

352
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,889
So you aren't just
goody two-shoes after all.

353
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,760
There's no need to say
that you're surprised.

354
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,896
<i>This is 03. The client is leaving. Over.</i>

355
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,599
-This is 01. Understood.
-This is 02. Understood.

356
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,974
-That was amazing, sir.
-I'm glad to hear that.

357
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,576
-It was wonderful.
-Thank you.

358
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,312
-I hope I can create another masterpiece.
-Yes.

359
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,847
There's an elevated step.

360
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,422
How much is this?

361
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,691
It's 10,800 yen.

362
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,592
Does it look good on me?

363
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,227
Yes, it does.

364
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,862
Don't just answer without thinking.

365
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,331
You guys can see.

366
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,367
I believe that looks good as well,

367
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,703
but for you, Ms. Ema…

368
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,872
I believe this would suit you better.

369
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,607
You can feel the fabric for yourself.

370
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,744
Is this an objective opinion?

371
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,412
Or your subjective opinion?

372
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,349
I'm sorry. That was my own preference.

373
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,250
Then I can trust what you say.

374
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,986
Excuse me. I'll have this.

375
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,421
Yes.

376
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:39,891
It's almost time.

377
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,060
Let's head to the send-off party
after making the payment.

378
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,497
I'm hungry. I want to have a steak.

379
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,775
I understand. This way, please.

380
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,844
It might be a little late,

381
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,713
but don't you think Professor Ivanov's
teaching methods aren't suited for Ema?

382
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,716
Mr. Ivanov has connections
with the judging panel.

383
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,586
We need him in order to claim first place
in the competition.

384
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,554
There are things that are
more important than lobbying!

385
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,697
Could you please let me tutor Ema again?

386
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,099
As someone
who has known her for a long time,

387
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,901
it would help to stabilize
Ema's emotions as well.

388
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,071
She's aiming for international fame,
so it's normal to feel tormented.

389
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,306
I'll be honest with you.

390
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,675
I won't allow you to teach Ema anymore.

391
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,879
Don't get the wrong idea.

392
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,715
It wasn't because we broke up.

393
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,518
It's all for the sake of Ema's talent.

394
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,326
<i>I'm Takanashi, Ms. Ema's bodyguard.</i>

395
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,595
At Ms. Ema's request,

396
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,331
we're currently in a restaurant named
Bonne Femme located in Omotesando.

397
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,766
Bonne Femme?

398
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,835
Yes.

399
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,937
The send-off party starts at 6:30 p.m.

400
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,339
The conservatory's president
will be there,

401
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,642
as well as the vice-minister of
the Agency for Cultural Affairs,

402
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,279
-so make sure you bring her there on time.
-<i>We'll take her there after her meal.</i>

403
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,953
Hello.

404
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,087
<i>That place you're at,</i>

405
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,957
<i>I heard that Ms. Ema and Ms. Miwa
used to frequent that restaurant</i>

406
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,159
<i>together with their mother
before she passed away.</i>

407
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,065
Did you come here
when she was under your watch?

408
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,234
No. Ms. Ema made a promise

409
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,438
that she will not go to that restaurant
until she wins the competition.

410
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,606
What?

411
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,708
Doesn't that mean she already
gave up on the competition,

412
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,910
and that she doesn't want to
go to Poland anymore?

413
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,480
If she really killed herself,

414
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,783
you guys would gain a bad reputation
for failing to protect your client.

415
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,819
I'm hanging up
if you're just here to ridicule me.

416
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,888
Do you know why
she's running away from the piano?

417
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,993
The problem lies with her sister,
who is managing her.

418
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,697
She only tries to put herself in danger
in front of her sister.

419
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,233
I can understand her
since I have a sister.

420
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,636
Some sisters share a strange relationship.

421
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,204
Stop beating around the bush.

422
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,906
Just make yourself clear.

423
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,509
Human relationships cannot be
made clear with words alone,

424
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,045
not between siblings,
and not between a man and a woman!

425
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,491
Please excuse me.

426
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,595
I told your sister that we'll bring you
to the party after your meal.

427
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,899
You didn't tell my sister,
but the president, did you?

428
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,536
Do you always call her that?

429
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,440
I feel at ease
when I don't see her as my sibling,

430
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,109
but rather as a president
managing her artist.

431
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,152
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

432
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,154
Can I have a glass of red wine?

433
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,489
Understood.

434
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,358
Isn't it better to just have it
as an aperitif?

435
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,428
I heard that you're not allowed to have
alcohol until the competition is over.

436
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,429
This much is fine.

437
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,633
SUGANUMA THINKS IT'S A RELATIONSHIP ISSUE
BETWEEN THE SISTERS.

438
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,139
What are you reading?

439
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,342
When someone keeps quiet in front of me,

440
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,345
it's when they're reading something
that they don't want me to know.

441
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,149
We were having a discussion,
and we believe that

442
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,651
you don't have a good relationship
with your sister.

443
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,656
I'm sorry that I lied to you
back at the conservatory.

444
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,726
I believe it's for the best
if I tell you everything from now on.

445
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,128
You made the right decision.

446
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,130
I'll answer you.

447
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,001
I don't trust the president.

448
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,838
But she set up a company for you, Ms. Ema,

449
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,374
and she wishes for your success
more than anyone else.

450
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,411
Do you know this song?

451
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,217
Is this Schumann?

452
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,486
So you know your stuff.

453
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,722
I played the piano when I was young.

454
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,094
Is there anything weird about that?

455
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:10,962
No.

456
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:12,998
This piece…

457
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,700
I made a mistake
when I performed it at my last recital.

458
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,804
The president reprimanded me
and said I wasn't giving it my all.

459
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,307
In that person's eyes,

460
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,476
I'm just an asset in her work.

461
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,080
But…

462
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,783
Ms. Miwa said that

463
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,920
she wants to realize your dream of winning
the International Piano Competition.

464
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,124
If I win the competition,

465
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,792
do you know what people will say?

466
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,098
"Ema Moria, the visually-impaired artist,
wins first place."

467
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,401
"It's a remarkable achievement
as the first blind pianist to win

468
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,769
the International Piano Competition."

469
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,106
That's not my dream,

470
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,810
yet during my interviews and promotion,

471
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,312
the president kept emphasizing
my visual impairment.

472
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,851
My visual impairment is not the reason
why I can play the piano.

473
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,189
Being blind is nothing special.
I don't want to use it to my advantage.

474
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:15,727
I understand.

475
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:17,729
Please excuse me.

476
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.
This is the <i>wagyu</i> steak you ordered.

477
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,904
Please excuse me.

478
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:28,907
Smells good.

479
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,110
Aren't you two eating?

480
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,879
We're not allowed to eat on duty.

481
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,682
We sure are some troublesome customers.

482
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,285
I've apologized to the restaurant.
I'll cut the steak for you.

483
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,186
Don't!

484
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,587
You know,

485
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,622
steak tastes better
when you cut it yourself.

486
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,210
There's a long flight of stairs ahead,

487
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,712
-so please hold on to me.
-Don't touch me.

488
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,281
I don't want anyone's help
just to get down a flight of stairs.

489
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,824
-Excuse me.
-What is going on?

490
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,581
Can you see the perpetrator
from there, Takanashi?

491
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,849
I think they're using a slingshot.

492
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,385
It's a guy, probably around 180cm tall.

493
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,321
-Back me up.
-Understood!

494
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,302
Don't worry. When the time comes…

495
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,537
When the time comes,

496
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,006
I'll cover you and we'll run
toward your two o'clock.

497
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,750
Let's move!

498
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,639
Ms. Ema…

499
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,874
Can you stand up?

500
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,748
Please get in.

501
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,661
Mr. Sakurai?

502
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,030
Let me go…

503
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,911
It doesn't seem like there is any
physical or nerve injury in her fingers.

504
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,383
Are you feeling any pain?

505
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,218
No.

506
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:05,857
I'm glad.

507
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,459
You're Japan's treasure, after all.

508
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,234
Let's take an echocardiogram,
just in case.

509
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:18,970
Okay.

510
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,241
I'll leave it to you, Kobayashi.

511
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,149
Sorry that I had to ask for your help
while you're off-duty, Dr. Kasamatsu.

512
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,483
It's all right.

513
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,987
I stayed back to do
some administrative work anyway.

514
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,892
-What about you, Mr. Shimazaki?
-What?

515
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,128
Your back.

516
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,863
Those bruises must be quite a pain.

517
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,565
I can tell just by looking at you.

518
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,735
I'll visit you after I'm done with
this assignment. It's rather painful.

519
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,938
You should ask your company
for some hazard pay.

520
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,910
Oh, I'm sorry to inform you so late,
but I already resigned from my company.

521
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,045
Oh, I see.

522
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,348
What?

523
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,317
I followed your advice
and gave my superior a good kick.

524
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,686
-No way…
-Now, I've gone independent

525
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,754
and set my up own office.

526
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,494
Then this is quite
a big assignment for you.

527
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,998
You know,

528
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,867
humans instinctively stretch out
their hands when they fall over.

529
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,637
Even more so for those
who are visually impaired. But she…

530
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,506
She covered her hands as she fell.

531
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,679
This means that you've done a good job
protecting her hands,

532
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,981
<i>the part of her body that
she valued the most, Mr. Shimazaki.</i>

533
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,134
Let's go, Ms. Ema.

534
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,269
The send-off party is starting soon.

535
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,706
I…

536
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,741
won't participate in the competition.

537
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,644
Everyone will be unhappy if I go.

538
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,649
Mr. Sakurai…

539
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,718
He used to be a good person.

540
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,120
He taught me passionately.

541
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,291
But ever since he stopped teaching me,

542
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,561
he didn't like the idea of me
growing as an artist.

543
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,265
<i>-That's why he did that.
-Not only that.</i>

544
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,535
I think the reason why
he didn't marry the president

545
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,504
-was because of me too.
-He was together with your sister?

546
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,574
The president…

547
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,177
rejected Mr. Sakurai's proposal.

548
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,680
She said that
in order to realize my dream,

549
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,083
she cannot afford to get married.

550
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,820
I didn't want this.

551
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,157
One should only play the piano
to make people happy.

552
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,130
The one who taught me
the joy of playing the piano…

553
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,999
was that person.

554
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:10,908
What's the matter?

555
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,746
Are you afraid of dying now?

556
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,681
No!

557
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,228
-Let's go.
-I don't want to go back!

558
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,362
We won't go back.

559
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,597
What?

560
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,966
Where are we going?

561
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,036
The time is 6:47 p.m.

562
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,740
We've arrested the suspect on grounds
of assault and property damage.

563
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,677
-The weapon is a hunting slingshot, and…
-Will you be filing a police report?

564
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,046
We'll contact you again
after consulting with the victim.

565
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,249
As if you'll file one.
It's going to be a huge scandal!

566
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,150
Hey!

567
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:57,221
POLICE

568
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,725
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

569
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,629
Hello? I'm done handing the guy
over to the police.

570
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,631
Where are you?

571
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,940
You don't know where Ema is?

572
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,676
-Are you joking?
-I'm really sorry.

573
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,146
I know that she went to the hospital
with Shimazaki, but after that…

574
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,315
I'm unable to reach them by phone.

575
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,750
Unbelievable.

576
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,953
How can a bodyguard take their client out
without permission?

577
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
I'm truly sorry.

578
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,724
I was surprised by
what Mr. Sakurai had done.

579
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,327
I'm sure Ema must be
even more shocked by that.

580
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,996
-I'm calling the police!
-Please wait.

581
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,066
I believe there must be a reason.

582
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,334
What reason would it be?

583
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,437
-This is an abduction!
-I'm angry too.

584
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,108
However, Shimazaki always
takes any action as a bodyguard.

585
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,879
He is not someone
who just abandons his duties.

586
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,391
This place…

587
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,195
So you know.

588
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,466
That's because I can hear
the weather vane.

589
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,437
So it was never fixed.

590
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:21,872
Please come out.

591
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,118
-Please excuse me.
-What?

592
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,886
Hey, wait!

593
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,190
<i>I never expected you to visit us again.</i>

594
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:40,891
It's an honor.

595
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,463
You're leaving for Poland soon, right?

596
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,899
Along with the children,
I'm looking forward to your performance.

597
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,426
Why did you bring me here?

598
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,632
I wanted to bring you here, to the place
where you first started playing the piano.

599
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,269
This isn't part of a bodyguard's job.

600
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,806
Your sister told me

601
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,878
to protect you so that you can perform
at your best during the competition.

602
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,647
So what?

603
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,950
You think my feelings will change
from such a cheap tactic?

604
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,486
I'm not that simple-minded.

605
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,794
You said you didn't want to use
your blindness to your advantage, right?

606
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,999
But you walk around
without a guiding stick

607
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,203
and jump in front of cars,
worrying your sister and those around you.

608
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,006
-Shut up.
-Aren't you using it to your advantage?

609
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,012
<i>If Ema is unable to join the competition,</i>

610
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,414
do you know how much trouble
it will cause other people?

611
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,482
How much trouble?

612
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,284
What?

613
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,219
Please give me a detailed explanation.

614
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,556
The music association,

615
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,659
our sponsors, publishers,
and record companies…

616
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,931
Those supporting her would incur losses,
and we would betray their expectations.

617
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,898
What about you, Ms. Miwa?

618
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,335
What do you think?

619
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,444
Please excuse me.

620
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,613
Hello. What are you doing?

621
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,216
<i>Ms. Miwa said that
she's going to call the police!</i>

622
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,417
I thought so.

623
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:47,852
<i>What?</i>

624
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,021
<i>We'll return Ms. Ema to her
once she agrees to our condition.</i>

625
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,823
<i>Please relay that message to her.</i>

626
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,191
Stop joking around!

627
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,394
The location is Setagaya Malfa Church.

628
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,929
The current time is 7:46 p.m.

629
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,003
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

630
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,639
SETAGAYA MALFA CHURCH

631
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,941
What are you doing?

632
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,075
Let's go back, Ema!

633
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,478
The VIPs are waiting for you.

634
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,014
-We have to greet them!
-Can I state my condition?

635
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,217
I don't really want to hear
what you have to say,

636
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,652
but what is it?

637
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,721
Ms. Ema wants you

638
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,091
to resign from your position
as the president of the company.

639
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,893
If you agree to that,

640
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,296
then she will do her best
in the competition.

641
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,998
I don't understand what you're getting at.

642
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,504
Ms. Ema.

643
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,184
Please stop working for my sake.

644
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,054
What are you saying?

645
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,556
You can't do anything without me!

646
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,626
-You're not normal!
-I am normal!

647
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,295
I know everything.

648
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,565
You injured your own hands deliberately.

649
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,670
You told Mom that you quit the piano
because I asked you to?

650
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,572
I never asked that of you!

651
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,909
I was so torn.

652
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,645
I had no choice but to listen to you.

653
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,281
But not anymore.

654
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,285
It doesn't make me happy to win
a competition by sacrificing others!

655
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,055
Marry someone you like,

656
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,624
and get a job you love!

657
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,993
I want to do this alone!

658
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,829
I hate you, Miwa!

659
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,071
Ema…

660
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,774
When I heard you playing the piano,

661
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:25,976
I…

662
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,979
realized that I had no talent.

663
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,415
That's why I ran from it.

664
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,318
I was miserable.

665
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,654
I wanted to die.

666
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,422
But now,

667
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,024
I really want

668
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,826
to help you realize your dream, Ema.

669
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,263
And I would do anything

670
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,065
to achieve that.

671
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,102
If you can't even tell what I feel,

672
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,473
how would you be able to play anything
that moves people's hearts?

673
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:20,998
Ms. Ema.

674
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,169
If you truly think that
being blind is nothing special,

675
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,571
then isn't it fine to be brazen

676
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:33,010
and ask someone for help
to realize your dream?

677
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,613
Ms. Ema, I believe

678
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,382
you don't need to use anything
to your advantage.

679
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,548
Will you really be fine alone?

680
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,516
You're persistent.

681
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,953
I knew you would say that.

682
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,888
Wishing you all the best.

683
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,463
Thank you, Mr. Shimazaki.

684
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:34,998
You…

685
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:37,701
Yes?

686
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,580
Nothing.

687
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,082
See you.

688
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,331
I am indebted to you.

689
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,567
As I was talking to Mr. Takanashi,

690
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770
I remembered some things
that I had forgotten.

691
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,271
Oh, right.

692
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,740
In fact, I forgot something too.

693
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,943
-This is the invoice. If you may.
-You shouldn't give it to her now.

694
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,614
SECURITY SERVICES FOR MS. EMA MORIO
TOTAL AMOUNT: 368,000 YEN

695
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,683
Didn't Mr. Shimazaki get hurt?

696
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,586
-What about his medical fees?
-It's fine. It's nothing serious.

697
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,091
-You two make a good combination.
-Really?

698
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,425
I guess.

699
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,562
You two bicker
and don't seem to get along,

700
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,931
but you both know
what each other is thinking.

701
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,102
I understand what Ema is thinking too.

702
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:46,970
Just now…

703
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,773
I think Ema wanted to tell you this,
Mr. Shimazaki.

704
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,877
"Thank you for protecting my dream."

705
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,018
Well then, we'll be taking our leave.

706
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,054
<i>-How are you feeling now?</i>
-So she left safely.

707
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,289
<i>-I feel quite relaxed.</i>
-I'm glad.

708
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,724
As expected of Zaki and Nashi.

709
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,727
Maybe I should join
Shimazaki Security too.

710
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,597
You're going to get it from me
the next time I hear that.

711
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,400
-Oh, you're leaving early today?
-Good work.

712
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,734
Good work.

713
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,511
I'M DOING OVERTIME TODAY.
I'LL BE 30 MINUTES LATE…

714
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,580
THAT'S OKAY. THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO CHECK ON ANYWAY.

715
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,249
SEE YOU LATER THEN!

716
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,118
SURE

717
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,525
KOUMEI RYU

718
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,787
This spells trouble.

719
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,398
-I only have plain water. Is that fine?
-Yes.

720
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,303
Good work.

721
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,907
That client was extremely exhausting.

722
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,111
I never expected you to learn the piano.

723
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,113
I only learned for two years, though.

724
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,785
-Do you really plan to work with me?
-Don't make me repeat myself.

725
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,186
But you know,

726
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,090
we won't just be receiving normal clients
as we did back in Kicks Guard,

727
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,026
and there might be
more dangerous assignments.

728
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,061
I'll be fine as long as you keep me fed.

729
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,967
Then I guess I should let you know

730
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,272
the real reason why I left Kicks Guard.

731
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,612
Do not reveal it to anymore.

732
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,414
Can you promise me that?

733
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
If necessary, yes.

734
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,554
Well, it also involves

735
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,023
Suganuma and Sawaguchi,
who are still in Kicks Guard.

736
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,761
It's also to protect the position
of bodyguards like us in society.

737
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,466
<i>In order to garner
sympathy votes for Mr. Kuwata</i>

738
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,735
<i>and to promote your own company,</i>

739
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,471
<i>did you two come up
with that ridiculous plan?</i>

740
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,406
<i>And you decided not to target Mr. Kuwata,</i>

741
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,942
<i>but Sawaguchi, the most inexperienced
in our division?</i>

742
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,812
<i>But if you don't agree with my methods,</i>

743
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,547
you are free to leave.

744
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,048
Please promise that

745
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,452
you will never do anything to mess with
the bodyguards working on-site ever again.

746
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,820
Otherwise…

747
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,824
I will expose everything that
you and Mr. Kuwata have done.

748
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,259
The man that supposedly
attacked the assemblyman

749
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,662
came to the restaurant yesterday.

750
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,733
He might be targeting you.

751
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,669
Are you fine with that?

752
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,746
Yes.

753
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,854
The two of them
are remarkable, aren't they?

754
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,889
I'm glad that we handed over
the assignment to them.

755
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,960
Wasn't it different
from what you intended?

756
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,232
You guys really are interesting.

757
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,668
Today,

758
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,705
I have something important
to tell you, Suganuma.

759
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,977
I believe that it is my duty
to change the uncouth image

760
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,979
that people have of the security industry.

761
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,981
To achieve that,

762
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,949
I require the power of a woman like you.

763
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,185
Yes.

764
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,587
How about this?

765
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,023
Would you like to join me
in managing the company?

766
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,160
What? Management?

767
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,795
I would like to prepare you

768
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,064
to become an executive member
of our company.

769
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,500
I want to help you.

770
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,004
In private matters too, if possible.

771
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,707
I've already investigated
your relationship with Takanashi.

772
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:21,411
It doesn't seem like you're in
a constructive relationship right now.

773
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,653
I always do a thorough investigation
of what I want.

774
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,489
That is how I do things.

775
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,224
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI

776
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,127
I see that she won second place.

777
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,997
It was all worth it that you pulled off
a <i>Shinsengumi</i> on her, Mr. Shimazaki.

778
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,265
A "<i>Shinsengumi</i>"?

779
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,501
The Ikedaya stair-tumbling act.

780
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:45,569
I see.

781
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,971
For the record, I don't think
it's a commendable act as a doctor.

782
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,073
I'm sorry.

783
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,210
I knew this would happen,
but I just couldn't help it and…

784
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,045
And what?

785
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,714
Nothing. When it comes to my work…

786
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,383
That hurts… I just tend to go all out.

787
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,922
You really are a bodyguard,
through and through.

788
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,161
-Okay, all done.
-Thank you.

789
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,344
Yes?

790
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,580
You left Kicks Guard, right?

791
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:32,549
Yes.

792
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,684
-And you're working as a freelancer?
-Yes.

793
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:40,924
Actually,

794
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,260
I know someone
who is looking for a bodyguard.

795
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,996
Are you interested
in learning more about it?

796
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,432
What?

797
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,469
I think you should be able to receive
a huge sum as a reward.

798
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:56,806
However, it's quite dangerous
in various ways.

799
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,811
I mean, this is
a high-risk occupation after all--

800
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:02,946
It's very dangerous.

801
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,622
<i>I wasn't able to contact her,
and she wasn't in her room too.</i>

802
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:13,990
<i>Assist me!</i>

803
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,260
He has guts. Do your best to protect me.

804
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,929
<i>You think I asked him to follow you?</i>

805
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,131
<i>That man is treading on a dangerous path.</i>

806
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,167
Stop playing around
with the lives of bodyguards!

807
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,302
