1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,369
<i>I'm currently in front of
Akaruzaka Police Station.</i>

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,705
<i>Mr. Saburo Michioka, who was arrested
on suspected investment fraud,</i>

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>has been released due to
insufficient evidence for an indictment.</i>

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,713
-Mr. Michioka!
-Please say something, Mr. Michioka!

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,218
Please comment, Mr. Michoka!

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,687
Anything will do!

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,856
That wasn't the truth, right?

8
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,725
What actually happened?

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,869
No one's following us, President.

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,644
Michioka! Are you going to run away?

11
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,112
Michioka!

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,015
-Michioka…
-Listen up.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,786
There are risks involved in investing.
Didn't I tell you that?

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,188
And you still insisted on joining in.

15
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,790
Even if the law lets you run free,

16
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,591
I will never forgive you!

17
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,993
Oh, is that so?

18
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,162
Kill me if you dare.

19
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,065
Damn you!

20
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,134
You bastard…

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,075
President!

22
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,278
<i>Mr. Saburou Michioka is suspected of
using the money he swindled from victims</i>

23
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,313
<i>to provide benefits to
Lower House assemblymen.</i>

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>There is increasing dissent over
his non-indictment.</i>

25
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,085
Saburo Michioka.

26
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,321
He has been admitted to our hospital
in the utmost secrecy.

27
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,357
He ruptured his Achilles tendon

28
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,594
and I was supposed to be
the surgeon in charge of his operation,

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,996
but now, the higher-ups are hesitating.

30
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,165
So they don't want to treat people
who are public enemies?

31
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,968
If he is attacked again
during his stay there,

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,803
they're worried that
it'll affect their reputation.

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,272
So the higher-ups now state his security

34
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,341
as part of the requirements
for his admission.

35
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,579
I just need you to protect him
during his two-week stay.

36
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,082
Could you please accept
his bodyguard request?

37
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,385
I would be more than happy to,
but why did you come to us?

38
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
I mean, with someone of his background,

39
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,389
he could have requested a bigger company…

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,657
Mr. Michioka…

41
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,893
Even though his secretary tried
to restrain him,

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,361
he broke free and provoked the attacker.

43
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,829
He told the guy, "Kill me if you dare."

44
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,030
"Kill me if you dare"?

45
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,835
All the big companies got scared
when they heard that.

46
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,905
Even Kicks Guard,
the company you two were in.

47
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,343
Who is it?

48
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,310
Oh, I'll get it.

49
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,845
Excuse me. Yes?

50
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,151
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Thank you. Just put it on the table.

51
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,319
Is the consultation going well?

52
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,591
You might be worried
that there's only two of them,

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,493
but because of this,
they can focus on a single task.

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,761
I do think this is cost-effective.

55
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,329
Please don't go prattling unnecessarily.

56
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,798
-What?
-Thanks. You don't have to promote us.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,902
-Thanks for your patronage.
-Sure.

58
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,305
He seems to be really worried about you.

59
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,178
You can expect
to earn a huge sum from this.

60
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,215
-Yes.
-Please let us consider the assignment.

61
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,053
We can't protect the client
if they actively provoke people.

62
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,225
But if we reject him,
no one else will accept his request.

63
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,827
People are going to point at you
and say that you're protecting a villain

64
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,995
-just for the money…
-Villain?

65
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,698
You haven't even met the guy,
and you already know him? Impressive.

66
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,268
That's huge!

67
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,337
Another dangerous assignment?

68
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,271
I guess.

69
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,073
How difficult is it this time?

70
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,710
As difficult as getting
into an elite school, sorry.

71
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,245
I don't really mind,

72
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,013
but don't you have safer tasks?

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,749
Safer ones? That's hard to come across.

74
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,219
If it's safe, they wouldn't even hire
a bodyguard in the first place.

75
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,587
I see.

76
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:42,956
I guess so.

77
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,091
That's hot.

78
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,360
My friend from the soccer club said that

79
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,096
he's aiming for medical school
since his parents are doctors.

80
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,599
But I can never be a bodyguard.

81
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,499
Why not?

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,868
I guess I just want a job that I enjoy

83
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,804
while allowing me to have
ample time for myself

84
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,639
without any danger involved.

85
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,107
You can go for any job you want,

86
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,509
but are there really any jobs
that have no risks involved?

87
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,278
Normal jobs aren't dangerous.

88
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,846
I'm digging in.

89
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,216
-Do you want some ketchup?
-I'm not a kid.

90
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll have it,
even though I'm 47 years old.

91
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,562
<i>Mr. Saburo Michioka, an investor
arrested on suspicion of fraud,</i>

92
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>has been released
from Akaruzaka Police Station.</i>

93
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>Mr. Michioka then left the police station
in a private vehicle,</i>

94
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,974
<i>but a scam victim ambushed him
near the police station</i>

95
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>-and assaulted the investor.</i>
-Mr. Saburo Michioka's bodyguard request

96
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,679
has been accepted by Shimazaki Security.

97
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,781
Will they be fine?
There's only the two of them.

98
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,218
-I mean, Michioka is--
-It's them, they'll be fine.

99
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,086
Even President Ryu was glad

100
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,924
and said that it's a good thing for them
to be proactive in assignments like these.

101
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,963
Does he really feel that way?

102
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,199
If they keep
accepting jobs that we reject,

103
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,834
I can't help but
get a bad feeling from that.

104
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,803
Maybe the president
just doesn't view them as a threat.

105
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,077
You know, I…

106
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,549
I wonder if Shimazaki quit because
he had some conflict with the president.

107
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,217
Why the president?

108
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,922
I mean, it must be really serious
since Takanashi left as well.

109
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,823
Hey.

110
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,827
If you have time to poke your nose
into where it doesn't belong,

111
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,862
go have your medical checkup instead.

112
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,798
I'm leaving for the inspection.

113
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:33,866
Have a safe trip!

114
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:34,867
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,542
Good morning.

116
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,544
What are you doing?

117
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,483
I'll get in the car first.

118
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,129
What do you want from me?

119
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,164
There's no need for us to meet

120
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,033
unless we have business
with each other, is there?

121
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,568
So what is it?

122
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,605
You should reject
Saburo Michioka's bodyguard request.

123
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,173
Tell that to Shimazaki.

124
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,612
He requested our services
in Kicks Guard too,

125
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,680
but we rejected his request,

126
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,415
since his threat level
was the maximum, Level 5.

127
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,019
He is not just targeted by his victims.

128
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,188
That man is treading on a dangerous path.

129
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,225
It won't be surprising
if you get caught in his affairs

130
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,893
-and get silenced--
-We already accepted it.

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,696
Hey. Don't tell me

132
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,798
you plan to go against
your former employer?

133
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,737
I still don't know the real reason
why you and Shimazaki left.

134
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,140
Why would I bother with everything
that Kicks Guard does?

135
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,142
What's with that attitude?
I was just worried about you!

136
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,577
I can't be bothered to listen
to what an old flame tells me.

137
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,347
"An old flame"?

138
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,916
Fine!

139
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,291
There's still time, go chase after her.

140
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,195
She's not the kind to apologize first.

141
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,165
-Your relationship's really going to end.
-I don't want to hear this from you.

142
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,234
I'm your senior
when it comes to romantic relationships.

143
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,570
-That's coming from a divorcee?
-That's exactly why I know!

144
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,205
Just go already!

145
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,673
Oh, my!

146
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,859
-You really know your stuff, sir.
-And you acted too late, my boy!

147
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,266
I'm Shimazaki. Pleased to meet you.

148
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,869
I'm Kogure, Mr. Michioka's secretary.
Pleased to meet you.

149
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,371
-Thank you for the business card.
-Likewise, I'm Takanashi.

150
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm Kogure. Pleased to meet you.

151
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,810
So you were from Kicks Guard?

152
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,580
Yes. We left the company.

153
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,248
I see.

154
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,083
Will I be safe with you guys?

155
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,819
I can't help but think
that you must've gotten into trouble

156
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,154
if you resigned from a good company.

157
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,389
Please don't worry.
I left because my contract ended.

158
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,991
You can't fool me.

159
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,860
I've seen all kinds of hell after all.

160
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,133
My name has been blacklisted
by security companies,

161
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,569
so I can't afford to be choosy.

162
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,505
But you're a little old to be a bodyguard.

163
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,843
And you over there, you're not suited
for the service industry.

164
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
On top of that, you guys have
no sense of teamwork, right?

165
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,648
Thank you for your criticisms.

166
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,618
We will work on these flaws and
cater to your security needs accordingly.

167
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,152
Oh, and also…

168
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,823
Don't expect to get paid a lot.

169
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,058
I only engaged you
because of the hospital's request.

170
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,127
I'll only pay the lowest rate possible.

171
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,032
They're not particular about money.

172
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,400
Right?

173
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,606
I've incurred the wrath of many people.

174
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,708
I don't know when I'll be killed.

175
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,945
But I won't hide.

176
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,581
"Kill me if you dare."
That's what I always say.

177
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,851
-Prepare yourselves.
-Yes, sir!

178
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,490
However, the duty of a bodyguard
doesn't include locking up their client.

179
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,992
We'll be with you,
be it in heaven or in hell.

180
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,165
He has guts.

181
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,467
Well, I guess…

182
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,437
Do your best to protect me.

183
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,339
Yes.

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,628
I understand. Thank you.

185
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,198
The special ward is only on the 9th floor,

186
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,734
so there's probably a low chance
of it being attacked from the outside.

187
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,104
If we were to consider
any possible ambushes…

188
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,940
There would only be two routes,
via the elevator or the emergency stairs.

189
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,943
We'll be able to prevent it completely
if we're on standby outside the door.

190
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,512
But if we stand outside the ward door,

191
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,549
the fact that Mr. Michioka
has been hospitalized will be revealed.

192
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,017
It would be dangerous instead.

193
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,586
Good morning!

194
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,854
Good morning.

195
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,223
I've heard rumors about you two.

196
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,326
You're bodyguards for the patient
in the special ward, right?

197
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:29,862
Yes.

198
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,431
How cool!

199
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,101
It's my first time meeting bodyguards!

200
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,335
Here you go, a free sample!

201
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,670
-No, thank you.
-We're on duty, so…

202
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,205
It's all right!

203
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,607
Anyway, tell me
who was admitted to the ward!

204
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,942
I won't tell anyone!

205
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,577
Is it a celebrity? A politician?

206
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,112
-There's no way we'll tell you!
-Sorry.

207
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,881
We're not allowed
to consume food while on duty.

208
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,149
Please excuse us.

209
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,084
I'm always here during the weekdays,

210
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,986
-so feel free to talk to me!
-Please excuse us.

211
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,600
MICHIOKA SECRETLY ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL?
A VILLAIN'S DISAPPEARING ACT

212
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,702
BRIBES OFFERED TO ASSEMBLYMAN WAKINAGA
SHROUDED IN MYSTERY

213
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,172
"It wouldn't be strange
to receive the death penalty," they say.

214
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,407
This is awesome.

215
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,710
Dissent has been increasing
ever since your non-indictment.

216
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,779
I think it's best
not to read the comments.

217
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,148
Why would I care about
what people say on the Internet?

218
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,283
Don't put me on the same level as you,
you good-for-nothing!

219
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,251
Please excuse us.

220
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
Excuse me.

221
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,054
Sorry to interrupt you.

222
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,823
It's fine. I was just giving pointers
to my employee.

223
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,429
While we're on duty,
we'll be on standby here.

224
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,497
So we'll immediately know
if someone approaches you.

225
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,865
-Please rest assured.
-What? Wait!

226
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,168
You guys will be there all the time?

227
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,903
That feels so gloomy!

228
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,571
Please excuse me.

229
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,709
Please stop complaining, Mr. Michioka.

230
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,343
Oh, Dr. Takako.

231
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,947
The hospital as well as Mr. Shimazaki
are doing their best to protect you.

232
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:55,881
I got it already.

233
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,349
Anyway, Dr. Takako…

234
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,419
you resemble a teacher I had a crush on
back in elementary school.

235
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,788
The operation will be
at 3:00 p.m tomorrow.

236
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,391
You will start your rehabilitation
the day after.

237
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm in charge of your rehabilitation.
My name is Yukawa. Pleased to meet you.

238
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,197
A young lad, aren't you…

239
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,132
Don't you have more experienced ones?

240
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,001
Yukawa is a passionate physiotherapist.

241
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,070
He offered to help you this time.

242
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,107
I may not meet your expectations,
but I'll do my best for you.

243
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,341
Let's do this together!

244
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,743
"Let's do this together!"

245
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,246
Do you think I'll actually say that?

246
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,448
That's your job, isn't it?

247
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,683
Yes.

248
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,151
The doctor operates.

249
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,520
The physiotherapist is
in charge of the rehabilitation.

250
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,322
And the bodyguards place
their lives on the line.

251
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,723
And my job

252
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,293
is to earn money
and be hated by everyone else.

253
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,329
Isn't it?

254
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,802
Excuse me.

255
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,471
Hello?

256
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,441
What?

257
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,563
Actually, we received this.

258
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,366
I WON'T FORGIVE
THE DOCTOR TREATING MICHIOKA.

259
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,901
THEY WILL BE EXECUTED.

260
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,502
A death threat.

261
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,506
It seems that Mr. Michioka's admission
has been leaked.

262
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,943
Perhaps we should
reconsider his treatment here.

263
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,546
It may not just be an empty threat.

264
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,817
But didn't we engage excellent bodyguards
for that very purpose?

265
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,152
We're not a public hospital.

266
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,521
This might sound ugly,

267
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,457
but we're not obligated
to help someone like him.

268
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,327
I don't like him either.

269
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,898
But no matter who they are, we help those
in need to the best of our ability…

270
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,100
Isn't that what professional doctors do?

271
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,468
That is indeed a wonderful mindset,

272
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,307
but aren't you the deputy chief
of the orthopedic department?

273
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,444
You have to think about
the business aspect of our hospital too.

274
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,246
Excuse me.

275
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,251
If news of Mr. Michioka's admission
was leaked,

276
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,454
then news of the hospital rejecting
his treatment would also be leaked, right?

277
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,292
I mean, it would sound really bad
for a hospital

278
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,728
if people knew they rejected patients.

279
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,063
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,448
Who is it?

281
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,285
My name is Suzuki.

282
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,493
May I know your full name?

283
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,031
He'll know once you tell him my surname.

284
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,074
I'm surprised you actually found me.

285
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,177
As expected from Assemblyman Wakinaga.

286
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,750
Could the two of you please leave?

287
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,554
I am obliged to protect
my client's confidentiality.

288
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,723
It's related to a complicated issue.

289
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,993
Hey.

290
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,029
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,181
Mr. Wakinaga says…

292
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,654
he bears no relation to you at all.

293
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,425
I seek your understanding.

294
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,296
That's so cold all of a sudden.

295
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,202
All this time, I've given so much
assistance to Mr. Wakinaga.

296
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,539
Even this book sold well, didn't it?

297
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,879
I hope your injuries heal soon.

298
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,221
What are you doing?

299
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,995
Hey, be careful.

300
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,263
He's Assemblyman Wakinaga's rabid lap dog.

301
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,717
This is quite a lively visit.

302
00:16:59,151 --> 00:16:59,985
Please step back.

303
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,921
A bodyguard is not allowed
to attack people!

304
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,872
It was awesome, Dr. Takako!

305
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,208
I felt like I was watching
a kickboxing competition

306
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,644
in the middle of the ring itself.

307
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,913
That's very rude of you, Mr. Michioka.

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,816
You should be thankful that you're safe.

309
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,390
That hurt…

310
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:43,862
Sorry about that.

311
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,598
But it wasn't that bad.

312
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,568
As if. You were serious.

313
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,237
If I was serious,
your shoulder would've been dislocated.

314
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,972
Maybe it really got dislocated.

315
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,575
We're in the middle of our duty now!

316
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,377
I was kidding.

317
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,148
He really must be a bad person.

318
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,453
I don't know if we should continue
our bodyguard assignment.

319
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,157
You're right, he might be an evil person.

320
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,195
But I don't want to
choose clients based on that.

321
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,967
We would be the same as Kicks Guard,
which only chooses VIPs as clients.

322
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,769
What?

323
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,271
So it's just your obstinacy talking here?

324
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,409
If all you want is to accept jobs
that President Ryu rejected,

325
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,977
I won't be able to stay with you.

326
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,948
Oh, my, are you two fighting?

327
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,749
No, we're just having a briefing.

328
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,486
You have to get along!

329
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,122
You never know
what's going to happen in life!

330
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,125
Oh, would you like a drink of this?

331
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,495
-Oh, no…
-This is a present from my son.

332
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,630
He bought it for me
using his first paycheck.

333
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,399
Sorry, but we're not allowed to drink
while we're on duty.

334
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,801
Hey!

335
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,469
Could you tell me who is the patient

336
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,304
-in the special ward?
-I'm sorry.

337
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,140
-Just tell me if it's a man or a woman!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,307
Or just their initials will do!

339
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,980
I see.

340
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,549
So this is the Personal Security Division,

341
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,818
where the bodyguards are.

342
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,658
The departure of Shimazaki and Takanashi,
two of our veteran bodyguards,

343
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,393
pains my heart, but…

344
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,096
this could be a chance for us to change

345
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,431
the old-fashioned ways
of the security industry.

346
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,934
Let's reform our organization,

347
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,503
and aim to expand our business further.

348
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,071
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

349
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,640
In order to achieve that…

350
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,043
I especially require the power of women.

351
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,779
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,314
Suganuma,

353
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,251
I'll be waiting for your reply
to that request.

354
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,808
COLD

355
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,491
I'll take over.

356
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,659
I can still go on.

357
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,895
You should get some rest for tomorrow.

358
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,250
As for my reply to what you said earlier…

359
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,155
I wasn't trying to be stubborn.

360
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,791
Really.

361
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,171
You fall asleep quicker than Nobita.

362
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,244
Once I've decided to protect someone,
I don't want to go back on my word.

363
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,515
Since I'm a bodyguard.

364
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,153
-Hey.
-Yes.

365
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,025
What is it?

366
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,528
Could you open the curtains?

367
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,430
I want to see the sky.

368
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,099
Yes.

369
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,942
It's a full moon.

370
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,715
So tomorrow is the operation,

371
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,583
I'm scared.

372
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,154
I don't really care if people hate me,

373
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,256
but I'm scared of injections.

374
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,659
You have to do it
if you want to walk again.

375
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,630
But I've already traveled
all over the world.

376
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,933
The only place I haven't been to is hell.

377
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,416
Come in.

378
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,452
The operation room is ready.

379
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,586
I'll be there to observe.

380
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,488
-Got it. I'm counting on you.
-Likewise.

381
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,762
Please be careful.

382
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,897
I'll be covering you with a cloth.

383
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,365
Please excuse me.

384
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,634
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,837
It seems that Dr. Kasamatsu
is taking some time to get prepared,

386
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,572
so could you please wait a moment?

387
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,274
-What?
-I'm sorry.

388
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,575
Hey, wait a minute…

389
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,344
Hey!

390
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,080
Excuse me!

391
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,984
Did something happen to Dr. Kasamatsu?

392
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:39,951
Well…

393
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,854
I wasn't able to contact her,
and she wasn't in her room too.

394
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,691
Understood. Thank you.

395
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,063
<i>Actually, we received this.</i>

396
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,698
I WON'T FORGIVE
THE DOCTOR TREATING MICHIOKA.

397
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,885
The route to the operating room is…

398
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,499
ORTHOPEDICS DEPUTY CHIEF
TAKAKO KASAMATSU

399
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,164
Hey!

400
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,970
Dr. Kasamatsu. Are you all right?

401
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,640
-Mr. Shimazaki…
-Are you injured?

402
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,245
They suddenly charged at me.

403
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,649
I really thought
I was going to be executed.

404
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,150
Did you see their face?

405
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,786
They were wearing a mask, so…

406
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,054
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

407
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,363
I'm fine already, so you can go.

408
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,735
You don't have to worry anymore.

409
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,271
What…

410
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,839
Stop that.

411
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,642
I won't be scared
over something like this.

412
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,977
I'm fine, I see blood every day.

413
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,451
You're my client's important doctor.

414
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,154
I have to protect you.

415
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:57,756
Here.

416
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,773
All right!

417
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,107
Let's go.

418
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,751
We will now begin
the Achilles tendon repair surgery.

419
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,019
-Scapel.
-Yes.

420
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,789
-Gauze.
-Yes.

421
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,229
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

422
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,966
They couldn't find anyone from
the security room's surveillance cameras.

423
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:41,967
They couldn't find anyone?

424
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,401
Really?

425
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,340
So was it done by someone
who knows the location of the cameras?

426
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,541
Could it be that guy?

427
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,347
That would be too reckless.
He's a politician's underling.

428
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,249
Would he even try something like that?

429
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,317
Then who could it be?

430
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,457
What?

431
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:08,927
Hello?

432
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,495
<i>Hello, it's Sawaguchi.</i>

433
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,030
<i>Are you on duty at the moment?</i>

434
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:17,369
No, I guess I'm taking
a short break right now.

435
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,269
What's up?

436
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,807
I want to know the reason
why you left Kicks Guard, Shimazaki.

437
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,444
-What's up with that so suddenly?
-<i>Well…</i>

438
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,512
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:29,981
It's been on my mind for a while.

440
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,952
Well, there was an assault here
in the hospital,

441
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,387
so I'm a little busy at the moment.

442
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,855
Did someone attack Michioka?

443
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,391
-No, they went after his doctor.
-<i>That is really bad.</i>

444
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,259
I understand. I'll investigate that too.

445
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,862
We received some information
when he came to us, so…

446
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,502
Don't forget that
confidentiality is part of our job.

447
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,570
Yes, sir.

448
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,041
What?

449
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,643
Did he hang up the phone?

450
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,278
-Skin stapler.
-Yes.

451
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,458
We're done.

452
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,593
-Good work.
-Good work.

453
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,304
Mr. Michioka? How are you feeling?

454
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,306
I feel like crap.

455
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,578
What's left is your rehabilitation.
Please do your best.

456
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,247
-I'm leaving it to you.
-Yes.

457
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,718
Let's try to move your body,
starting tomorrow.

458
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,620
Try to do light exercises now,

459
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,589
so that the muscles around your tendon
won't harden up.

460
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,858
I just woke up, for god's sake.

461
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,760
Let's do this later.

462
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:49,661
President.

463
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,696
It's important to do it immediately.

464
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,931
What is with you?

465
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,501
I told you not to come over.

466
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,535
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,537
I was very worried about the operation.

468
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,876
My injury won't heal
if I look at your unlucky face.

469
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,678
Just go back when I tell you to!

470
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:09,848
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,296
SPECIAL WARD

472
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,235
Is it possible that Mr. Kogure,
Mr. Michioka's secretary,

473
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,736
attacked Dr. Kasamatsu?

474
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,638
It's not surprising
that he would hold a grudge

475
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,206
after being mistreated like that.

476
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,943
In a sense, he's the first victim
of Michioka's actions.

477
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,850
MICHIOKA ASSAULTED AFTER RELEASE,
HOSPITALIZED DUE TO SERIOUS INJURIES

478
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,726
What are you doing in secret?

479
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,397
I was just doing some revision
for tomorrow's assignment.

480
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,700
For two shady men?

481
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,672
I'll help.

482
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,044
But it'll be the first and last time.

483
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,013
Thank you.

484
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,823
PLEASE GO TO THE EMERGENCY DESK
TO VISIT PATIENTS DURING HOLIDAYS

485
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,426
Next, let's try to walk
using the parallel bars.

486
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,262
I feel so sluggish.

487
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,931
I'm not doing this.

488
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,534
President, you have to do it.

489
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,036
Why are you here?

490
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,905
I told you not to come,
you piece of trash!

491
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,043
You have to get better soon
and resume work quickly.

492
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,513
So you want me to do more bad deeds?

493
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:50,949
No.

494
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,219
Not everything you do is bad.

495
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,888
Stop getting ahead of yourself!

496
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,894
I don't need a secretary
who speaks out of his place.

497
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,597
Quit, you piece of trash.

498
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,332
I won't resign.

499
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,068
Oh, is that so?

500
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:17,542
If that's the case,
bring over the thing that I want the most.

501
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,478
And what is that?

502
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,916
I won't tell you.

503
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,386
If you're my secretary,
then you should know!

504
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,922
You don't want to quit, right?

505
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,031
Can you do this alone?

506
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,466
I won't let anyone pass.

507
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,368
I'll be back
right after I'm done talking to him.

508
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,370
The current time is 2:56 p.m.

509
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,905
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

510
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,174
Mr. Kogure!

511
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,980
Do you know what
Mr. Michioka was referring to?

512
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,918
No. I'll head back to the company
and think about it.

513
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,454
Well, when did you start working
for Mr. Michioka?

514
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,192
It was 11 years ago.

515
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,163
I had some personal issues
with my previous company,

516
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,866
and I met Mr. Michioka
at one of his seminars.

517
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,569
When I heard him speak,

518
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,973
I felt like even I had some potential.

519
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,410
So I begged him to take me in.

520
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,381
So your life changed
after meeting Mr. Michioka.

521
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,117
What are you trying to say?

522
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,285
Oh, please pardon me.

523
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,155
It's just that there are times
when I can't help but feel that

524
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,091
I've changed the lives of those who are
with me after I set up my own office.

525
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,592
Mr. Shimazaki.

526
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,997
I don't regret my decision.

527
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,207
Mr. Shimazaki!

528
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,042
Why are you here, Sawaguchi?

529
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,446
Please take a look at this.

530
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,650
This…

531
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,520
Are you in the rehab room, Takanashi?

532
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,421
No.

533
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,858
Mr. Yukawa wanted the rehab session
to be conducted on the rooftop,

534
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,926
so we're currently here.

535
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,562
He's the one we should be careful of.

536
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,799
Yukawa's sister

537
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,335
<i>was a victim of Michioka's scam…</i>

538
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,603
SUICIDE

539
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,571
…and killed herself!

540
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,207
-Sorry!
-Good afternoon!

541
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,275
-Have you two made up--
-I'm in a rush now, so…

542
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,444
Thank you for working hard
even on a Sunday.

543
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,148
Sunday?

544
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,987
<i>I'll separate the client from the threat.</i>

545
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,689
Don't try anything too rough.

546
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,491
He might have a knife with him.

547
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,725
Understood.

548
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,765
The weather got a little cold,

549
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,833
so shall we return to the ward?

550
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,102
I'm helping him manage
his body temperature.

551
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,072
-You can return first if you like.
-I can't do that.

552
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,812
It looks like Mr. Michioka
doesn't look very well, so…

553
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,147
I'm fine.

554
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,150
The wind feels good.

555
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,886
We're taking too much time here.

556
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,259
What's wrong?
You're making such a scary face.

557
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:25,997
Excuse me!

558
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,633
Sorry, he's not very good
at expressing himself.

559
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,702
How are you feeling?

560
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,304
Well, it hurts,

561
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,872
but I was able to walk a little.

562
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,174
That's incredible!

563
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,508
Yes.

564
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,312
I have to escape from those
who hold a grudge against me.

565
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,588
Let him go.

566
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,856
That's impossible.

567
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,293
I mean, he became my therapist
just to kill me.

568
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,261
You knew?

569
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,064
Your sister killed herself
because I swindled her, right?

570
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,433
I saw her at the victims' association.

571
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,470
Just do it.

572
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,873
I said no fighting, right?

573
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,408
Please stay back.

574
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,642
No one is allowed to come here

575
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,278
-except for related personnel--
-No. She's related, right?

576
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,686
She's the mother of Kazuya Yoshimura,
who died because of your actions!

577
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,793
So the bereaved families
teamed up to kill me?

578
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,965
How much should I pay
to earn your forgiveness?

579
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,001
I don't need a single cent from you!

580
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,803
Atone for your sins!

581
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,572
Turn yourself in to the police
along with the evidence!

582
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,908
Reveal the entire truth!

583
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,243
Listen up.

584
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,378
If you have time to blame me,

585
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,148
why not blame your sister
or your stupid son?

586
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,985
My father…

587
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,388
He had to pay his friend's loans
and was fired by his company.

588
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,792
As a child, I learned to lie
in order to survive,

589
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,961
and that's how I became rich today!

590
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,034
It's a given that there are risks
either in investment or in our lives!

591
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,638
Those that end their own lives
just because they were deceived

592
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,239
are nothing but losers!

593
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,741
Shut the hell up!

594
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,216
Let go of me!

595
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,119
I'll kill him!

596
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,322
Don't use your son's gift
for something like this!

597
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,970
Mr. Michioka.

598
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,707
Do you really want to die that badly?

599
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,212
Even the fight you had
near the police station…

600
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,813
Kill me if you dare.

601
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,948
<i>…was the same as now.</i>

602
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,951
You came out front on your own accord.

603
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,254
You would rather be killed.

604
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,922
Is that what you really want?

605
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,597
I believe the President
wanted someone to stop him.

606
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,632
Don't talk as if you know me!

607
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,168
I've brought it over.

608
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,807
This is the thing
you want the most, President.

609
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,577
The evidence related to your scam.

610
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,614
You even wrote down

611
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,682
Assemblyman Wakinaga's involvement
in the case!

612
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,490
Mr. Michioka.

613
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,861
No one's going to stop you anymore.

614
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,765
Didn't you say it yourself?

615
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,635
I don't know when I'll be killed.

616
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,436
But I won't hide.

617
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,310
I was involved
in Mr. Michioka's scam as well.

618
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,680
I'm very sorry!

619
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,619
This is your last task.

620
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,125
Take me to the police station.

621
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,331
Understood.

622
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:19,824
OUTPATIENT RELEASING

623
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,833
You've been a great help, Dr. Takako.

624
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,605
You'll be resuming your rehabilitation
in the detention center, Mr. Michioka.

625
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,840
Please don't skip them.

626
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,843
Sounds nice. That's what I like about you.

627
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,081
I'm closing the door.

628
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:46,817
We're leaving.

629
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,053
Mr. Shimazaki.

630
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,721
I…

631
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,259
Good work. I'm leaving my patient to you.

632
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,161
Yes.

633
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,131
Are you all right, Dr. Kasamatsu?

634
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,503
Please keep that a secret.

635
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,612
I'll keep that in mind.

636
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,348
Oh, the injury on your hand.

637
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,321
I'll wait for you.

638
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,958
I'm counting on you.

639
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,367
Right. I haven't paid
for your services yet.

640
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,838
Well, it was for 52 hours,
so it'll be 520,000 yen in total.

641
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,174
That's cheap.

642
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,642
It's the lowest rate.

643
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,748
But my entire fortune was given
to the victims to pay back their loans.

644
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,318
Can I pay it back
after leaving the detention center?

645
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:58,823
Sure.

646
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,491
I'll pay you, I promise.

647
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,794
And to do that, I'll work my way up again.

648
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,264
Yes.

649
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,799
Thank you.

650
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,872
You protected my ambition.

651
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,179
Let's go.

652
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,444
<i>Mr. Saburo Michioka,
who was previously released</i>

653
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,648
<i>due to insufficient evidence
on suspicion of investment fraud,</i>

654
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:01,151
<i>has turned himself in once again
at Akaruzaka Police Station.</i>

655
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,221
<i>The police commented that…</i>

656
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,724
That's great, isn't it?

657
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,061
Although the chief doesn't look
very happy right now.

658
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,140
Regarding what you discussed
with me before,

659
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,045
I'll accept your offer.

660
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,880
You're indeed wise.

661
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,650
I knew you would say that.

662
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,988
To commemorate this day,
why don't I talk about myself?

663
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,225
Yourself?

664
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:46,063
The real reason why I started focusing
on the security industry.

665
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:51,468
Of course, no one else
in the company knows about this.

666
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,872
Please excuse me.

667
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,476
President.

668
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,363
Do you feel like returning now?

669
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,033
I've never considered that.

670
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,604
What a shame.

671
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,206
I would've welcomed you with open arms.

672
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,944
That man has been following me.

673
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,147
I'm not mistaken
since it's part of my work.

674
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,650
"That man"?

675
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,922
The waiter that I stopped
when you engaged him to injure Sawaguchi!

676
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,730
Don't tell me…
You think I asked him to follow you?

677
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,199
I'm not that free.

678
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,301
You must have incurred
someone else's wrath.

679
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,672
That's part of the risk
when working as a bodyguard.

680
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,474
If you don't know anything
about him, that's fine.

681
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:04,675
However,

682
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,977
I'm sure I told you.

683
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,449
I'll overlook what you have done.

684
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:17,388
In return, stop playing around
with the lives of bodyguards!

685
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,091
Please don't ever forget that.

686
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:23,794
Shimazaki.

687
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,467
Your beloved occupation as a bodyguard…

688
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,873
I sure hope you can continue it forever.

689
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,119
<i>I heard he's an unemployed
middle-aged man.</i>

690
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,821
You'll put your lives on the line, right?

691
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:51,989
<i>I'm being targeted.</i>

692
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,057
<i>I'm worried.</i>

693
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,992
Just go to the class reunion
with your head held high!

694
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,560
You have no right to talk to me like that!

695
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,029
You shouldn't judge me
using normal standards.

696
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,431
<i>Let's refuse this request.</i>

697
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,398
<i>I trust my client.</i>

698
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,599
