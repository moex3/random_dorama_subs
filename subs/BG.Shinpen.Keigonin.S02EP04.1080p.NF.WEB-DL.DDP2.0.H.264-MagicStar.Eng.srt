SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

2
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,716
My god, that's some bad design.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,318
No one will come to us
with words like that!

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,987
That's all I can come up with
for a budget of 30,000 yen!

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,689
But this too provocative!

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,691
Being truthful is very important
as a bodyguard.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,292
But it's important to create some buzz!

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,194
-It's important to stand out online.
-"Buzz"?

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,764
You know, bodyguards are just there
to support others behind the scenes.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,032
MASAYA TAKANASHI
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,133
But you got one.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,501
See? It's a customer.

13
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,702
-It says "Urgent."
-Move aside.

14
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,708
That means everything's going to be fine
if you follow my suggestions.

15
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,277
If you secure a client with my ad,
make sure to give me my share.

16
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,112
"Please save me!"

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,547
"I'm being targeted by someone!"

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,882
"I can't move!"

19
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,116
"Daisuke Ikuta."

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,851
It doesn't seem like a prank mail.

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,823
Hello? Are you Mr. Ikuta?

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,225
This is Shimazaki Security.

23
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,097
Could you please hear me out?

24
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,401
I'm going to ask you some questions.

25
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,604
Please answer either "Yes" or "No."

26
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,806
By the way,

27
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,674
are you able to talk now?

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,844
<i>Yes.</i>

29
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,046
Is it a life-threatening situation?

30
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,015
<i>Yes.</i>

31
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,318
Are you being confined somewhere?

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,154
<i>Yes.</i>

33
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,789
Are you injured?

34
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,524
No.

35
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,893
<i>So is someone keeping watch over you?</i>

36
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:35,962
Yes.

37
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,731
We'll send help right away.
Could you tell me your current location?

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,137
Machidashi, Fujinomiya, 5-3-2.

39
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,805
The room facing south on the second floor.

40
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,774
Please don't inform the police.

41
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,311
ETA: 40 MINUTES

42
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,346
We'll need around 40 minutes to get there.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,323
The client does not want the police
to interfere in this matter.

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,693
There are clients who are
unable to reveal their entire situation.

45
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,763
If the situation looks suspicious,
contact the company immediately

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,066
-and wait for our decision.
-Yes, ma'am!

47
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,635
All okay.

48
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,304
-All right!
-Okay!

49
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,440
That was amazing, Ms. Suganuma!

50
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,341
Thank you.

51
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,942
Next, the group over there!

52
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,181
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI
BODYGUARD, KICKS GUARD

53
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,349
You were impressive.

54
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,917
If you have time to tease me,

55
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,052
-go write up your training report!
-Okay…

56
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,954
The same goes for everyone else!

57
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,224
-Yes.
-We'll be placing a camera here.

58
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,026
Hey!

59
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,228
Sorry about that.

60
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,097
All right.

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,866
<i>I don't think it's good
to rely so much on Suganuma.</i>

62
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,334
What do you think?

63
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,869
KOUMEI RYU
PRESIDENT, KICKS CORP.

64
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,439
She's young and a woman no less.

65
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,508
And she was suddenly promoted too.

66
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,210
You can be direct with me.

67
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,349
There are rumors spreading
that I'm favoring her, right?

68
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,651
As a woman.

69
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,654
No, I haven't heard any of that.

70
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,023
I wonder…

71
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,928
I'm interested in her
in a personal capacity.

72
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,965
And that serves as
a form of motivation in my work.

73
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,568
I'm making good use of her in my business.

74
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,640
-Check the container's surroundings.
-Got it.

75
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,613
No suspicious vehicles.

76
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,884
No suspicious people around the building.

77
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,153
I see the curtains in the southern room
on the second floor.

78
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,488
Commencing contact.

79
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,734
Who is this?

80
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,836
Excuse me. My name is Shimazaki.

81
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,907
Is Mr. Daisuke in?

82
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,410
Do you need anything from Daisuke?

83
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,478
He's in, right?

84
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,719
-We're heading up to the second floor.
-Who the hell are you guys?

85
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:13,820
Hey, wait!

86
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,291
This is Shimazaki Security.

87
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,361
NO ENTRY
DAISUKE IKUTA

88
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,011
I'm Ikuta.

89
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,681
-I'm Shimazaki from Shimazaki Security.
-I'm Takanashi.

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,082
Nice to meet you.

91
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,387
I chose the smallest security company
I could find on the Internet.

92
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,356
If it's a big company,
they might charge more.

93
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,892
They probably wouldn't protect me either.

94
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,162
You said you're being confined.

95
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,033
I thought you guys
would come immediately if I said that.

96
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,467
Excuse me.

97
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,605
why did you request our services?

98
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,908
There's a place I have to go.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,077
I want you to protect me
until I reach that place.

100
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,114
I can't stay outside for too long.

101
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,949
"For too long"?

102
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,054
Excuse me, but what's your occupation?

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,555
I've never worked before.

104
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,826
I have a home,
and my parents cook food for me.

105
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,494
I can live even without a job.

106
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,663
I'm not proud of it,

107
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,833
but I've been like this since the summer
of my second year in high school,

108
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,669
so this marks the 20th anniversary
of me being unemployed.

109
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,638
But I'm not embarrassed.

110
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,607
As you can see,
I'm connected to the world.

111
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,783
Excuse me, but where is your destination?

112
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,087
Please excuse me.

113
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,290
My elementary school is closing down
since fewer children are attending,

114
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,225
so they wanted to have one as a memory.

115
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,828
I'm impressed that they came up
with something like this at this age.

116
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,929
A class reunion.

117
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,197
It's tomorrow.

118
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,299
Let me put this straight.
I don't want to attend.

119
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,534
The problem is…

120
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,205
It's written at the bottom of
the card, right?

121
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,641
-Time capsule?
-All the students had those.

122
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,578
Everyone wrote their dreams for the future
and placed them into a box

123
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,912
to commemorate our graduation.

124
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,949
I would rather die than have my letter
read in front of everyone else.

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,753
That's why I'm going there
to ask my teacher

126
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,254
if I can retrieve my letter first.

127
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,690
What did you write in it?

128
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,093
I wanted to be
a top player in the J.League.

129
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,130
-That's a great dream as a child.
-You're annoying.

130
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,099
-I don't want it to be read.
-I'm sorry.

131
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,701
You know…

132
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,836
I'm being targeted.

133
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,573
Is that so?

134
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,810
Could you tell us the details?

135
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,113
Someone punctured the tires of my bicycle

136
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,250
and even pushed me from the back
in front of the railway crossing.

137
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,053
When did those happen? Could you give us
specific dates and times?

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,523
The bicycle incident was around the 20th,

139
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,126
and the railway crossing incident
was around the 30th, I think.

140
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,263
About bodyguards…

141
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,032
You'll be my shield, right?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,335
You'll put your lives on the line, right?

143
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,872
I'm counting on you.

144
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,394
Oh, so he's being targeted?

145
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,463
What bullshit.

146
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,068
He's just coming up with nonsense
because he doesn't want to work.

147
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,437
He's just the boy who cried wolf,
except that he's in his forties!

148
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,505
Stop it, dear.

149
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,640
Daisuke is struggling too.

150
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,143
Isn't it all because
you buy everything for him,

151
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,611
that now, he's a parasite at home?

152
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,379
It's your fault, to begin with!

153
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,850
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,953
-It has nothing to do with you.
-No…

155
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:13,860
But 20 years…
It must have felt extremely long

156
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,729
for Mr. Daisuke,
as well as the two of you.

157
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,506
Are you a train operator, Mr. Ikuta?

158
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,476
I was just made to
retire early from my job.

159
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,379
Corporations are cold-hearted.

160
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,816
When I think about seeing
my middle-aged son

161
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:44,724
and living with him
in this small house up till now…

162
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,159
sometimes I even think about
killing Daisuke

163
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,130
and ending my own life as well.

164
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,138
Excuse me, but I'm counting on you.

165
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,042
If he meets his old friends
from the class reunion,

166
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
it might create some opportunity for him.

167
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,680
-I'll pay the money.
-No.

168
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,551
We'll receive the payment from Mr. Daisuke
since he's the client.

169
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,089
<i>There's no way he can pay.</i>

170
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,357
You saw him.

171
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,193
He's using a children's desk,
and all those toys…

172
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,296
People like that are called
"parasite singles."

173
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,164
But he's the client, right?

174
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,767
There's no way we can receive
the money from his family.

175
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,102
Then let's refuse this request.

176
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,004
It's just like what his father said

177
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,206
about him being targeted
as complete bullshit.

178
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,975
I trust my client.

179
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,311
What if we don't receive
any payment this time either?

180
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,546
-Aren't you going to keep us fed?
-That might be impossible…

181
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,115
-Maybe you should leave while you can.
-What?

182
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,885
Why are you saying
such irresponsible things now?

183
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,359
-Did you call him?
-I didn't.

184
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,428
That guy…

185
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,232
Sushi delivery!

186
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,435
We didn't call for one.

187
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,037
You're so cold as usual.
It's a present from me.

188
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,772
Aren't you guys hungry?

189
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,541
I welcome such generosity with open arms.

190
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,875
-How is this?
-It looks delicious!

191
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,913
It feels suspicious
that you're treating us.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,881
Well, just think of it as a celebration.

193
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,084
-For what?
-For Suganuma.

194
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,587
Suganuma has been promoted
to executive officer.

195
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,222
With President Ryu's
recommendation, that is.

196
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,026
Why should we celebrate?

197
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,829
What? I thought
I should let you know, Takanashi.

198
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,730
About what?

199
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,766
Rumors have been spreading
around the company.

200
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,103
People say President Ryu and Suganuma
seem suspicious.

201
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,542
-<i>Is it a life-threatening situation?</i>
-This will be good PR for us.

202
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,779
-I'm glad that I recommended you.
<i>-To secure the position of bodyguards,</i>

203
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,347
<i>you need appropriate judgment</i>

204
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,716
<i>-and make your move based on that.</i>
-Can I ask you something?

205
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,351
Right…

206
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,554
My story was interrupted the last time.

207
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:03,262
For today, let's talk about why
I'm interested in the security industry.

208
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,297
Yes.

209
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,068
I lost the woman I loved to violence.

210
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,505
Five years ago,

211
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,208
a burglar entered my home in Los Angeles,

212
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,744
and my fiancé was shot by a gun.

213
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,282
Three months later, she died.

214
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,588
Actually, I had engaged a bodyguard then.

215
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,124
But that guy…

216
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,727
he didn't prevent her from getting shot.

217
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,265
And that's why
you thought about training bodyguards?

218
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,300
Unfortunately, no.

219
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,336
After that incident,

220
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,606
I realized that even if
bodyguards fail to protect their clients,

221
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,041
they aren't held accountable.

222
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,611
So I thought to myself that
this would be a profitable business.

223
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,613
Your fiancé…

224
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,450
you loved her, right?

225
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,554
This and that are different.

226
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,358
You shouldn't judge me
using normal standards.

227
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,163
The destination
is Fujinomiya Elementary School.

228
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,632
The class reunion commences at 1:00 p.m.

229
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,101
The distance is approximately 2km.

230
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,870
This is the shortest distance
we ever had to cover in a job.

231
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,006
Excuse me.

232
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,410
We're not yet on duty.
You can take it if it's a personal call.

233
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,712
Shimazaki, please call Shun's school.

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,714
It seems like he got injured.

235
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,282
What?

236
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,085
I'm really sorry!

237
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,721
It appears that he had a conflict
with one of his classmates.

238
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,789
Is that so?

239
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,191
How is he now?

240
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,360
He bruised his elbow.

241
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,662
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

242
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,766
-I'll check if he's being bullied--
-Give me the phone.

243
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,933
What?

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,101
SHUN SHIMAZAKI
AKIRA'S SON

245
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,402
This is nothing. I'm fine.

246
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,037
<i>You should go get checked at the hospital.</i>

247
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,708
Right. In Shiroyama General Hospital,
there's a doctor called Ms. Kasamatsu.

248
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,543
You can count on her.

249
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,577
What?

250
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,412
<i>See you.</i>

251
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,887
He said it's nothing.

252
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,257
Are you really his father?

253
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,092
Hey,

254
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,394
why would he have your contact details?

255
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,129
We talk sometimes.

256
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,465
What? I've never heard about this.

257
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,801
Why would he be honest
with an irresponsible father?

258
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,970
-Hey, that hurt.
-Oh, sorry.

259
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,739
It's time!

260
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,974
It's 10:51 a.m.

261
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,710
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

262
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,748
-Mr. Ikuta.
-Yes?

263
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,349
Let's go.

264
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,419
If we don't hurry,
everyone else is going to arrive first.

265
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,687
Oh, if you like…

266
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Please wear this.

267
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,691
Don't do things I didn't tell you to do!

268
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,359
This attire…

269
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,362
-I'm fine with it.
-Please excuse me.

270
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,946
Please wear these, if you like.

271
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,721
How did you know my shoe size?

272
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,489
I checked it yesterday.

273
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,293
Is that also a bodyguard's job?

274
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,062
Daisuke…

275
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,299
You always look
as if I'm giving you two trouble.

276
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,102
I'll check the surroundings.

277
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,905
IKUTA

278
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,979
We're going in through the rear,
you handle the front.

279
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,880
Understood.

280
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,093
Let's go.

281
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,039
We're keeping a close look all around you.
You have nothing to worry about.

282
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,310
I look just like an ex-convict
who was just released after 20 years.

283
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,446
No, quiet!

284
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,848
You can't do that!

285
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,953
Aren't you the boy from Ikuta's place…

286
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,854
Daisuke?

287
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,958
Oh, my…
I haven't seen you for a long time,

288
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,894
so I was really worried!

289
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,562
How have you been?

290
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,164
How sarcastic.

291
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,300
I know everyone in this neighborhood
makes fun of me!

292
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,401
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Good boy.

294
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,324
Is this where you were pushed?

295
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,696
You probably think I'm lying,
but it's true.

296
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,101
Were you looking at the train?

297
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,270
Why do you think so?

298
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,007
That's the train
your father used to operate, right?

299
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,909
You did your research.

300
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,547
I was staring at his train,
wondering if I should jump in front of it.

301
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,916
Being the ostentatious person he is,

302
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,985
he thinks I'm a shame to the family.

303
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,420
So…

304
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,456
I thought about doing him that favor
in the best manner.

305
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,793
However…

306
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,763
I suddenly realized something
after I was pushed.

307
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,966
Even parasites have the right to live.

308
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
Isn't the school over there?

309
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,902
It's been a while,
so I want to take the long route.

310
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,141
It's not broken.

311
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,010
-Your elbow's just swollen.
-Yes.

312
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,580
You can go home after applying a compress.

313
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,848
No medications?

314
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,153
You're still young.
You don't need any pain relievers.

315
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,427
Now I understand why my dad told me
to come to you.

316
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,262
Why?

317
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,597
Because you don't seem like a doctor.

318
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,501
My dad's a bodyguard,
but he hates going to the hospital.

319
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,136
He's scared of injections and medicines.

320
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,638
Really? That's surprising.

321
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,142
I thought your father
wasn't afraid of anything.

322
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,244
He's a different person when he's working.

323
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,779
I see.

324
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,682
Is he weak at home?

325
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,586
He's weak, lame, and pathetic.

326
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,688
That's why Mom left him.

327
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:11,924
I see.

328
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,893
-So he was abandoned.
-Right! With no hesitation!

329
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,728
I feel sorry for him.

330
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,197
He deserved it.

331
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,865
After he gets tired from work,

332
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,500
he just comes home looking all cold.

333
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,938
Well, his job requires a lot of
physical and emotional energy.

334
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,440
But it's wrong to bring it
into your personal life.

335
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,312
But he isn't the kind to cut corners,
personality-wise.

336
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,520
You know my dad very well.

337
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,023
Hey. Take care of yourself.

338
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,294
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

339
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,498
What?

340
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,600
You're Ikuta, aren't you?

341
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,368
It's been a while!

342
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,238
I'm Taniguchi! Tani!

343
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,774
Hey!

344
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,978
This is my wife and son.

345
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,816
I left home after I got employed,

346
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,352
but I returned for the class reunion.

347
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,087
You're going too, right?

348
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,955
Hey. Shall we go together?

349
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,925
Who are these people?

350
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,196
They're my bodyguards.

351
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,031
What?

352
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,099
Bodyguards?

353
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,669
I deal with stocks, and I earn
an annual income of 2 billion yen…

354
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,339
so things can get dangerous around me.

355
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,188
Things are too different between us!

356
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,158
He found a job,
and even has a wife and kid.

357
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,194
As if I could talk with someone like that!

358
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,698
Getting married doesn't put you
on higher ground.

359
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,534
I'm not married either.

360
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,702
So what?

361
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,537
I'm just stating facts.

362
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,905
You know…

363
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,375
You're really bad at consolation.
How are you still in the service industry?

364
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,443
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,880
-We're moving to the underpass.
-Understood.

366
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,783
He even lied just to get away from me.

367
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,018
It must have really scarred him.

368
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,622
He said he's earning
an annual income of 2 billion yen.

369
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,556
That was a lie, right?

370
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,558
I can't reveal anything.

371
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,796
That Ikuta…

372
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,533
He didn't go to university
or even work a part-time job.

373
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,469
You seem to know him very well.

374
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,706
I thought of myself as his best friend.

375
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,842
Could you please relay my message?

376
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,311
Tell him to attend the class reunion.

377
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,880
I understand.

378
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,282
Please excuse me.

379
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,483
I'm heading over now.

380
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,556
I'm over here!

381
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,324
Papa!

382
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,995
Mr. Taniguchi wanted to attend
the class reunion together with you.

383
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,831
Now he's suddenly acting like my friend.

384
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,899
I don't need his pity!

385
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,035
No, but he thinks of you
as a close friend…

386
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,904
Suspicious person spotted at 12 o'clock.

387
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,608
I see him.

388
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,377
What? Is someone following us?

389
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,811
I'll check it, just in case.

390
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,000
I lost the suspicious person.

391
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,902
-<i>Tracking aborted.</i>
-Understood.

392
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,737
It's fine now.

393
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:47,973
I'm going home.

394
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,042
What about the time capsule?

395
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,176
I don't care anymore.

396
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,412
I knew it. I'm being targeted.

397
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,213
No… What?

398
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,817
-Mr. Ikuta…
-Daisuke!

399
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,323
And he returned after 30 minutes.

400
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,831
Oh, you can leave now.

401
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,901
Our mission is not complete yet.

402
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,573
To think that an unemployed person
would request bodyguard services…

403
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,874
How laughable.

404
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,512
Pardon me, but…

405
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,681
are you really that short on cash

406
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,017
that you would be the bodyguard
of a piece of trash like him?

407
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,686
Please do not say that about my client.

408
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,989
I've been betrayed so much by him.

409
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,593
You never know.

410
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,231
You know,

411
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,267
because of my family's circumstances,

412
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,971
I wasn't able to attend university.

413
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,875
I was proud of my work
as a train operator.

414
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,146
However, I wished for my son
to attend university,

415
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,782
wear a white shirt,

416
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,218
a neat necktie,

417
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,689
and become someone capable
of changing the world.

418
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,391
<i>That's why,</i>

419
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,960
<i>I taught him as much as I could.</i>

420
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,496
<i>I even brought him everywhere.</i>

421
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,399
I understand
your expectations for your son.

422
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,033
Don't say it like you mean it.

423
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,001
No.

424
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,837
I also have a son myself, so…

425
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,641
if Mr. Daisuke requested
bodyguard services,

426
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,376
doesn't that mean

427
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,880
he does want to leave the house,
even for a little?

428
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,483
You're right.
It was just 30 minutes for you.

429
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,319
But to your son,

430
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,357
I believe it might have been
a tiring adventure for him.

431
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,927
<i>That's the end of your mission.</i>

432
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,462
You can go home now.

433
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,132
-But we haven't done anything yet.
-What?

434
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,237
We accepted your request
because you sent an SOS message to us.

435
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,809
-Just leave him alone!
-Mr. Ikuta…

436
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,546
No matter what he does, it's useless!

437
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,515
Please don't refer to him so rudely!

438
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,785
You know…

439
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,887
He's a liar.

440
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,823
He's irresponsible.

441
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,759
And there's nothing you can do about him!

442
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,696
Listen up.

443
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,902
Stop trying to hide
what you put in the time capsule.

444
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,339
Just go to the class reunion
with your head held high!

445
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,444
You're just worried about appearances.

446
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,316
Are you really that scared
of everyone laughing at you?

447
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,919
Please go back, you two.

448
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,223
As his parent, I'll pay for him.

449
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,225
You'll be fine with that, right?

450
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,626
-Just--
-Shut up.

451
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,464
You have no right to talk to me like that!

452
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,399
Mr. Ikuta…

453
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,301
Mr. Ikuta!

454
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,940
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,344
You had to play the part of the bad guy.

456
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,780
Excuse me.

457
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,417
Will he…

458
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,988
really be able to take a step out?

459
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,833
FUJINOMIYA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GRADE 6 CLASS 3 REUNION, 1995 GRADUATES

460
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,775
If you're worried about your attire,
I can find you one.

461
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,112
That's fine.

462
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,014
I don't think I should be here.

463
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,460
I haven't been to a class reunion
or an alumni meeting myself either.

464
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,663
What?

465
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,831
When I was young,

466
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,435
I thought get-together sessions
like this were dumb.

467
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,205
And when I was in my thirties,

468
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,008
I made a huge blunder in my work
and didn't want to see anyone.

469
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,813
Now that I'm in my forties,
I started to feel nostalgic,

470
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,415
but it feels too strange
to attend one now.

471
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,717
I attended one a few years ago.

472
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,785
So you attend these things?

473
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,987
But I went home immediately.

474
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,289
Some people didn't remember me,

475
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,625
and that hurt my pride.

476
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,828
I've been waiting for you.

477
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,463
Ikuta.

478
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,568
Shall we go to the science lab together
before everyone else arrives?

479
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:46,938
Sure.

480
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,373
Come on, let's go!

481
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,446
What?

482
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,514
Are the bodyguards coming along?

483
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:58,817
Well…

484
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,921
Just here is fine.

485
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,123
-Let us escort you to the lab.
-Here is fine.

486
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,892
Your work is done.

487
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,662
I'll transfer the money to you later.

488
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,034
-Let's go. Come on.
-Okay.

489
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,938
Aren't you curious?

490
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,874
Yes, I am.

491
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,746
Oh, it's the anatomical model.

492
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,681
I used to be scared of this.

493
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,217
That was during your lower years, right?

494
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,787
Back in sixth grade,
you destroyed the lab specimens

495
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,955
and were reprimanded harshly.

496
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,390
Did that happen?

497
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,358
I don't remember that at all.

498
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,162
You stole some hydrochloric acid

499
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,464
and caused a huge ruckus back then too.

500
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,502
It felt like that happened…

501
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,971
I remember it all too well.

502
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,708
It's over here.

503
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,679
I stole it because you made me.

504
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,947
You lost in the punishment game,

505
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,283
so I want you to steal
the hydrochloric acid in the science lab.

506
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,790
HYDROCHLORIC ACID

507
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,129
You really don't remember that?

508
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,965
The police even came,
and it caused such a huge fuss.

509
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,767
You know you shouldn't do that, right?

510
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,569
But you…

511
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,538
Until the end,

512
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,641
you never confessed
that you ordered me to do it.

513
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,713
So you finally remembered.

514
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,383
Because of that incident,

515
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,786
I flunked my middle school exams.

516
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,623
I had to go to cram school
and study harder.

517
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,761
After that, my mother

518
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,597
became mentally ill.

519
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,600
And during my high school years,

520
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,903
she committed suicide.

521
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,775
And you just forgot about that?

522
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,478
Do you think

523
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,713
that I will ever forgive you?

524
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,416
Apologize.

525
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,952
Apologize! Come on!

526
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,353
Apologize!

527
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,455
What are you doing?

528
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,760
Just some entertainment
before the class reunion.

529
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,696
Just go back. Your work is done, right?

530
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,697
We can't go back.

531
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,901
It appears that Mr. Ikuta
was being targeted by someone.

532
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,537
Do you have any idea who it could be?

533
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,907
Are you suspecting me?

534
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,410
You seem very knowledgeable about
Mr. Ikuta's circumstances post-graduation.

535
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,080
In fact, you seem to know too much
for a mere classmate.

536
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,015
I'm his best friend.

537
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,917
So I tracked him down.

538
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,619
And that's why you followed him today?

539
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,387
Today?

540
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,623
I didn't today.

541
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,393
But I did give him a few surprises.

542
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,371
<i>Of course, I would!</i>

543
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,006
Because of you,

544
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,741
my life is in shambles!

545
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,044
But don't you have your family?

546
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,513
I…

547
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,549
I divorced my wife a year ago.

548
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,885
I was just supposed
to meet my child today.

549
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,156
Ever since you deceived me that day,

550
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,393
I had been unable to trust anyone!

551
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,262
Personal relationships…

552
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,299
It never went well for me ever since!

553
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,668
And yet

554
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,469
you pretend as if nothing happened,

555
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,605
and live as a shut-in!

556
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,475
I don't think I can forgive you
unless I punch you!

557
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,145
If that's the case,
you can punch me instead.

558
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,147
This has nothing to do with you!

559
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,283
Please go ahead.

560
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,266
Have you ever punched someone?

561
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,535
You have to clench your fist tight.

562
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,638
And aim here.

563
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,641
But let me say just one thing.

564
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,812
It wasn't Mr. Ikuta's fault
that you couldn't trust anyone.

565
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,114
The problem lies with you!

566
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,519
Shut up!

567
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,735
Stop it.

568
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,069
Stop!

569
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,638
Stop!

570
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,007
Please stop!

571
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,708
Please…

572
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,684
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,224
I didn't know anything.

574
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,562
I'm sorry!

575
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm sorry that I forgot!

576
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,716
If you want to,

577
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,787
then punch me.

578
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,782
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,490
I'm sorry!

580
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,898
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,175
It's been a while, Taniguchi!

582
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,511
How long has it been?

583
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,380
You seem flashy as usual.

584
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,448
And you don't hold back, as usual!

585
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,184
-You've changed a lot!
-You haven't changed one bit.

586
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,620
-Hey, Yuki.
-Look over there.

587
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,821
Isn't that him?

588
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,892
-That's…
-It's amazing.

589
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,761
Look at how he's dressed.

590
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:53,164
No way! How disappointing!

591
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,399
Hey, Ikuta!

592
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,201
What's with that getup?

593
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,603
Are you trying to make us laugh?

594
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,373
Oh, right!

595
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,741
He always tried to joke around!

596
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,276
You…

597
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,812
You always wanted to stand out,
didn't you?

598
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,915
-Yes, he's right!
-All he did was just mess around.

599
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,650
-He was always like that!
-Yes.

600
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,218
He's just weird that way.

601
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey! The time capsule is here!

602
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,034
Ikuta!

603
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
This is yours!

604
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,682
TO ME, 25 YEARS LATER

605
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,313
Please excuse us.

606
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,683
Please look at this.

607
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:27,792
TO ME, 25 YEARS LATER

608
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,134
I'M A REGULAR MEMBER OF THE SOCCER CLUB.

609
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,303
WILL I BE ABLE TO CONTINUE PLAYING
IN THE FUTURE?

610
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,107
I LOVE LOOKING AT DAD'S TRAIN.
HE'S SO COOL WHEN HE OPERATES HIS TRAIN.

611
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,042
I WANT TO BE A COOL TRAIN OPERATOR
LIKE MY DAD.

612
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,111
I'LL DRIVE MOM AND DAD AROUND
IN THE TRAIN.

613
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,183
<i>I said I wanted to jump
in front of my father's train,</i>

614
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,851
<i>but that was a lie.</i>

615
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,053
I…

616
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,590
As long as I had time,

617
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,027
I always went to look at his train.

618
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,400
Dad!

619
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,636
Dad!

620
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,580
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

621
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,216
<i>I looked up to my father's profession.</i>

622
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,754
However, my father told me

623
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,124
to study hard and enter a good company.

624
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,327
He said that instead of moving trains,

625
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,197
I should become someone capable
of moving people.

626
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,866
He was so stern,
I couldn't say what I felt.

627
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,602
That's why…

628
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,307
I always lied and said
I wanted to be a J.Leaguer.

629
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,712
That was the only time I went against him.

630
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,550
But in the time capsule,

631
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,486
you wrote down
what you really felt, didn't you?

632
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,259
I didn't want to lie
to my future self after all.

633
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,508
The one who was hung up about appearances

634
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,612
was me.

635
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:33,818
I'm sorry.

636
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,689
What's with this all of a sudden?

637
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:44,929
Daisuke,

638
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,299
you should

639
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,534
leave this house.

640
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,819
<i>Daisuke!</i>

641
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,911
How much was it?

642
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,881
It was eight hours,
so it'll be 80,000 yen.

643
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,017
Oh, I see…

644
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,319
It's quite expensive.

645
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,554
You can pay in installments too.

646
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,923
Oh, it's fine. I…

647
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,928
I brought my entire savings here.

648
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,335
Ever since I was young,
I saved up all my New Year allowances.

649
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:37,975
Here, 80,000 yen.

650
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,543
I've received the payment.

651
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,348
Excuse me…

652
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,821
Thank you.

653
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,928
You protected my memories.

654
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm sorry.

655
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,391
-For what?
-About Mr. Ikuta.

656
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,593
He didn't lie.

657
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,428
You won.

658
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,364
It wasn't about winning or losing.

659
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,900
I'm concerned about one thing.

660
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,002
What?

661
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,473
If Mr. Taniguchi wasn't following him,

662
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,408
then who was it?

663
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,053
It's him, right?

664
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,521
Why did you keep quiet about it?

665
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,624
I sowed the seeds, so I'll reap the--

666
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,493
-Stop that!
-What?

667
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,062
I didn't follow you here
just to keep myself fed.

668
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,197
Then what? You ran here
because you were dumped by a woman?

669
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,069
-You really know everything about me.
-You're easy to read.

670
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,070
What?

671
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,876
Just shut up and finish your work!

672
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,213
<i>Thanks to Ms. Suganuma's contribution,</i>

673
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,016
<i>we've received a bodyguard request
from the governor Sakiko Takabe.</i>

674
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,353
<i>I look forward to your performance.</i>

675
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,854
Do your best too, everyone.

676
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,788
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

677
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,105
Dr. Kasamatsu treated my injuries.

678
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,309
You aren't asleep yet?

679
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,913
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.

680
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,515
That doctor's quite rough.

681
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,984
I guess all surgeons are like that.

682
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,855
But she was worried about you.

683
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:39,857
What?

684
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,659
I think she's really conscious of you.

685
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,032
What in the world are you saying?

686
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,233
Go to sleep.

687
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,576
DR. KASAMATSU

688
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,882
Hello?

689
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,784
How is Shun?

690
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,853
I think the swelling should subside soon.

691
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,356
Oh, thank you for taking care of my son.

692
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,290
It's fine.

693
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,860
That was payback for last time.

694
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,301
I…

695
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,103
<i>Yes?</i>

696
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,708
Are you currently outside now?

697
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,910
In a ramen shop, perhaps?

698
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,778
What? How do you know?

699
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,948
<i>Well, it's just an occupational habit.</i>

700
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,284
<i>I just heard a waiter saying "Welcome."</i>

701
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,458
At this hour, there is no suitable place
for a woman to be alone.

702
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,395
I…

703
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,698
Then next time…

704
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,773
shall we eat together?

705
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,108
<i>My treat.</i>

706
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,379
Don't misunderstand.

707
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,914
I wasn't trying to invite you.

708
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,483
Goodbye.

709
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,485
What?

710
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,866
Thank you for waiting.
Here is your extra-special ramen!

711
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,688
<i>Stalking is a despicable act.</i>

712
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,258
<i>I did my best
to become a first-class secretary.</i>

713
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,226
I don't want to give up
because of something like this.

714
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,494
<i>You still haven't apologized!</i>

715
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:58,996
<i>What have you been saying?</i>

716
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,799
<i>It feels much more intense than hate.</i>

717
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,733
<i>I'm always prepared.</i>

718
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,901
