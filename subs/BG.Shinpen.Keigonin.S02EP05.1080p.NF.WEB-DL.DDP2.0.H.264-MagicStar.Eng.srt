1
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,905
DANGER!
DON'T RUN INSIDE THE HOSPITAL!

2
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,610
You don't need to rush.

3
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,046
Your legs are just scraped.

4
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,082
The bone on your right wrist is fine too.

5
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,885
I think they should heal in two weeks.

6
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,753
I see…

7
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,455
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,991
-I'm glad.
-Thank you.

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,859
TAKAKO KASAMATSU
SURGEON, SHIROYAMA GENERAL HOSPITAL

10
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,994
Your girlfriend, Sawaguchi?

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,996
What? I…

12
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,198
Yes.

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,903
Well, Nagiko is the ace
of the Kicks Corp secretarial team.

14
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,538
It'll be our sixth month together soon.

15
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,574
I can hear you from the corridor.

16
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,043
-You should be embarrassed.
-You're here.

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,578
It's been a while since I came here.

18
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,679
Thank you.

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,148
I'm glad that
you're close to Dr. Kasamatsu.

20
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,084
"Close"? You're being rude.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,152
She just took care of my injuries,
that's all.

22
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,554
What?

23
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,355
So was it a purse snatcher?

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
-Yes.
-You must've been scared. Are you fine?

25
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,892
Have you called the police?

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,495
I called them over to the crime scene.

27
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,299
Also, Nagiko's cell phone was stolen,
so I reported that as well.

28
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,801
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you apologizing?

29
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:42,869
Of course, I should do that.

30
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,275
-Hey.
-What?

31
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,611
-Shouldn't you two get going now?
-Oh, sorry!

32
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,213
Let's go.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,717
Please excuse us. Thank you very much.

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,452
-I'll call you later.
-Got it.

35
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,590
Sorry to bother you at this time.

36
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,293
You really call me a lot

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,429
for someone
who's just taking care of your injuries.

38
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,397
No, I…

39
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,033
I think you really need
to treat me this time.

40
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,170
Oh, okay. Sure.

41
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,039
-All jokes aside…
-Joke?

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,144
she said she was chased
by a purse snatcher.

43
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,881
-But I don't think it was the first time.
-What?

44
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,284
She had three buzzers with her.

45
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,418
Three?

46
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,489
There was a time when I had four of them.

47
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,159
If you're a bodyguard,

48
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,862
the reason why a woman
would have so many buzzers with her…

49
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,166
is so easy to tell, right?

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,283
How was it?

51
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,985
Well, I was touched. It was impressive.

52
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,560
Hello?

53
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,797
Oh, it's you.

54
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,534
KOUMEI RYU
PRESIDENT, KICKS CORP.

55
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,704
What you said just sobered me up.

56
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,573
<i>Three months ago?</i>

57
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,441
Yes.

58
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,213
Actually, I had been targeted
by a stalker since then.

59
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,848
So who is that stalker?

60
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,317
That's…

61
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,853
I don't know who they are.

62
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,925
They followed me
and even waited in front of my apartment,

63
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,461
but I was so scared,
I couldn't take close look on their face.

64
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,800
Do you have any idea who it could be?

65
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,867
Not at all.

66
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,239
But this means that
her address has been discovered, right?

67
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,010
-Man, I'm so thirsty.
-So you came, Takanashi?

68
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,212
What? Actually, I didn't intend
to come here anymore.

69
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,113
I knew it.

70
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,483
-Don't tell me you two had a fight?
-What?

71
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,553
No way. We're adults. Right?

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,489
Do you use social media?

73
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,890
Oh, yes.

74
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,695
Log in to your account.

75
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,969
NAGIKO TSUNODA

76
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,639
There are many instances
wherein a victim's address was tracked

77
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,941
via their photos' background
or the reflections on their irises.

78
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,909
It might be better
to deactivate your account for now.

79
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,378
So that's how it is.

80
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,784
So Shimazaki, Takanashi,

81
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,688
could I ask you both to protect Nagiko?

82
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,622
What?

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,259
Shimazaki and I?

84
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,193
Yes.

85
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,163
I'll be on duty tomorrow,
so I have to work at night.

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,200
I won't be able to
accompany her back home.

87
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,802
I mean…

88
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,041
you two should have more time, right?

89
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,176
-Are you saying that we have no jobs?
-No!

90
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,546
I don't mean that. What I'm saying is,

91
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,715
I believe that you two are capable

92
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,684
of stopping and handing the culprit
over to the police.

93
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,153
I mean…

94
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:26,059
please help Nagiko so that she could
live her life with peace of mind.

95
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
You don't have to do so much for me!

96
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,930
I just tripped over myself this time.

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,565
They didn't hit me!

98
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,101
What are you saying?
You might be assaulted next time!

99
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,236
What will I do
if something happens to you?

100
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,440
Please. I beg you…

101
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,142
I plan to marry her.

102
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,278
Sei?

103
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,847
Hey, don't propose to her
in a place like this.

104
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,981
I mean it! Nagiko…

105
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,918
She's pure, she's serious with her work,

106
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,320
and she's different from
all the flashy women I've been with!

107
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,756
Would you normally say things like that
in front of your girlfriend?

108
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,958
Anyway,

109
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,593
please…

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,830
I'll pay for the fees with my savings.

111
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,899
Do you really have savings, Sawaguchi?

112
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,234
Not your parents' savings, you hear?

113
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,169
My salary increased
after I went to Kicks Guard!

114
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,939
-Your salary increased?
-Yes.

115
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,175
-We've had risk allowances since April.
-Risk allowances?

116
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,243
Don't expect that from me.

117
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,778
Big corporations can afford that.

118
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,079
Sei…

119
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,949
It's fine. I don't care
what they say about me.

120
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,785
-All right?
-For now…

121
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,754
we're a weak and small company, so…

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,222
-No, I don't mean that!
-No…

123
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,125
I don't mean that. You're close to us,

124
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,627
so it'll be dangerous if you let
your guard down because of that.

125
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,663
Even so, would you still…

126
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,565
leave her protection with us

127
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,801
as an official job request?

128
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,202
Of course.

129
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,005
He's saying that he won't be giving you
any discounts, not even a single yen.

130
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,073
Not even a single yen?

131
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,709
For personal protection services,

132
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,178
there are two major types
you can choose from.

133
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,981
The first is to show the perpetrator
that you have bodyguards

134
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,551
to discourage them from attacking you.

135
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,722
The second is to let the bodyguards
protect you from the shadows.

136
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,492
Instead of suits, we'll wear
casual clothing to catch them off-guard

137
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,494
and effectively capture them.

138
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,599
If you want to catch the stalker,
I believe the latter is better.

139
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,801
Would that be fine?

140
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,703
Yes.

141
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm counting on you.

142
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,617
It's a new pattern.

143
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,586
It's good to have rice
for breakfast, isn't it?

144
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,824
At Mom's place, she makes miso soup,
grilled fish, and preserved pickles.

145
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,829
Hey, you feel like going back there now?

146
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,263
Not at all.

147
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,331
SHUN SHIMAZAKI
AKIRA'S SON

148
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,866
There's nothing more irritating

149
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,035
than seeing your mom getting
all chummy with her new husband.

150
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,473
I see. So they're all chummy.

151
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,974
Don't tell me you're hurt now?

152
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,479
Well then, shall we have some seaweed?

153
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,083
I mean, things are going well
between you and Dr. Kasamatsu, right?

154
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,587
-Hey, she's a doctor, you know?
-Occupation has nothing to do with it.

155
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,021
Where was it again?

156
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,224
Somewhere on the top rack on the right.

157
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,199
What? I can't open it.

158
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,135
Hey. Let me say this.

159
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,973
You know, I…

160
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,577
I don't plan on deepening
my relationship with any woman.

161
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,180
My work has a lot
of unknown factors after all.

162
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,182
-That won't make you popular.
-What?

163
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,219
You know, women like men
with the courage to jump over high walls.

164
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,188
You sure talk a lot.

165
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,957
-Oh, it opened.
-It sure did.

166
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,528
President Ryu will be
in the company today.

167
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,664
Tonight, he'll be having an interview
at the Freundschaft Hotel.

168
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,566
I'll be with him.

169
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,001
Ms. Yamashita,

170
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,570
can you call the hotel to let them know
we'll be arriving tonight?

171
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,471
Yes, sir.

172
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,206
Well then, I'm counting on everyone.

173
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,207
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

174
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,012
-Excuse me, Iwata.
-Yes?

175
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,648
As for the previous security plan,

176
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,817
the president has placed me in charge.

177
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,153
Understood. I will be counting on you.

178
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,723
We'll finish it as quickly as possible.

179
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,792
Rest assured.

180
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,563
What's this?

181
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,731
Are you injured?

182
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, I just tripped.

183
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,603
As expected of
the Security Division Chief!

184
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,273
I'm sorry that I didn't notice it,
Ms. Tsunoda.

185
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,543
Please let me know
if there are any inconveniences.

186
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,078
Thank you very much.

187
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,223
Please allow me to explain.

188
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,160
Assemblyman Kuwata has been appointed

189
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,362
as Special Aide to the Prime Minister
as of June 1st.

190
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,197
Apparently, he leaked rumors
that his predecessor,

191
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,999
Assemblyman Otonari,
conducted acts of dishonesty,

192
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,567
and is now being hounded
by the mass media.

193
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,837
But if we are able to
protect him perfectly,

194
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,373
it could be a chance to strengthen
Kicks Guard's reputation.

195
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,442
Please exercise extreme caution.

196
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,776
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

197
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,680
I will be the BG.
Backups will be Shirai, Kawazu,

198
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,415
-and Sawaguchi.
-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,850
The corresponding B Team will also…

200
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,318
She's like the president.

201
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,386
Keep quiet.

202
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,520
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

203
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,594
-Well then, I'm counting on everyone.
-Yes, ma'am.

204
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,363
This is 02.

205
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,798
No suspicious person detected
en route to the train station.

206
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,101
This is 01. Understood.

207
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,902
You can go back if you don't like this.

208
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,237
Who's the kid now?

209
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,573
You can't protect her alone.

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,642
It's not impossible.

211
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,123
Hello? This is Tsunoda.

212
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,190
<i>This is Shimazaki.</i>

213
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,427
Can we call you on this cell phone?

214
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,495
Yes.

215
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,164
I've contacted the police,

216
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,366
but my cell phone wasn't returned to them.

217
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,367
I see.

218
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,405
Just forget that we're around
and proceed with your daily activities.

219
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,174
We've checked the route back to your home.

220
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,110
Takanashi and I will take turns
to protect you

221
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,579
while trying not to attract any attention,
so we're counting on you.

222
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,381
I understand.

223
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:32,024
300M TO TRAIN STATION (4 MINUTES)

224
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,012
LEFT TURN IN 37M
WALK STRAIGHT FOR 120M

225
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,581
120M FROM TRAIN STATION
TO GREEN BELT (3 MINUTES)

226
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,920
BACKUP ALWAYS CHECKS THE REAR

227
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,167
She's leaving.

228
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,795
It's strange.

229
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,830
You think so too?

230
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,667
She wasn't scared when she heard
those footsteps behind her just now.

231
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,302
What do you think is the reason?

232
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,539
She feels safe that we're protecting her.

233
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,107
At least that's what I want to believe.

234
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,108
I don't think so.

235
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,644
In the case of stalker victims,

236
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:04,216
they're usually in fear around the clock
as long as the stalker hasn't been caught.

237
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,085
<i>Maybe she knows.</i>

238
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,520
She knows?

239
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,789
That the stalker won't come?

240
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,024
She knows who the stalker is.

241
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,754
Are you all right?

242
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,657
A suspicious person wearing
work clothes is headed to you.

243
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,458
<i>Understood.</i>

244
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm tracking him.

245
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,016
GOURYOU SHRINE

246
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,633
Have a seat.

247
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,370
It's rather cramped here.

248
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,975
Can you really protect someone
in a place like this?

249
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,443
Thank you for your concern.

250
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,646
We're a small company,
so it works in our favor.

251
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,852
Don't you have coffee?
I'm fine with black.

252
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,188
Ms. Tsunoda is
being targeted by a stalker.

253
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,927
Judging from the situation,
the stalker would be you, Mr. Omata.

254
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,995
No way.

255
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,064
I'm not that shameless.

256
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,966
I don't think your actions
are befitting of someone

257
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,769
who used to work as the chief of
the SP division of police HQ.

258
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:08,440
You deliberately disguised yourself
and loitered around her apartment.

259
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,709
It's not a coincidence, right?

260
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,681
Mayu Suganuma became
an executive officer before you,

261
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,983
so you're tailing female employees
out of spite now?

262
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,221
I'm not such a petty person.

263
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,557
To me,

264
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,728
now you're just a middle-aged man
under suspicion of stalking activities.

265
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,938
Wow, you're so sneaky, Takanashi!
You brought a pretty lady here.

266
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
I'm working.

267
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,776
Stop spouting nonsense
and just go already.

268
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,445
It may be business,
but it's etiquette to praise a lady!

269
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,647
I'm sorry that he's so insensitive.

270
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,482
You're annoying. Just go already.

271
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,126
Sawaguchi will be here soon.

272
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,130
Could you please let Chief Omata go?

273
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,999
Don't tell Sei either.

274
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,534
Why?

275
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,403
He was waiting in ambush for you.

276
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,605
But he didn't do anything to me.

277
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,874
Why do you want to cover for him?

278
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,943
Do you have a reason for that?

279
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,244
There's nothing like that.

280
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,680
He is Sawaguchi's superior,

281
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,016
so I don't think it's good to act rashly.

282
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,919
Welcome.

283
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,822
If you're my bodyguard,

284
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,124
then please listen to my orders.

285
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,794
Are you all right?

286
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,731
Thank you, Takanashi.

287
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,799
Is it true that
there was someone suspicious?

288
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,434
Yes.

289
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,540
But we didn't have any proof,
so we couldn't do anything.

290
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,542
What?

291
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,712
Why couldn't you detain him?

292
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,616
You could've just handed him over
to the police.

293
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,284
I'm fine.

294
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,321
You know, I don't think
I really need bodyguards.

295
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,057
-Let's end the contract.
-Wait a minute!

296
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,492
Thank you so much.

297
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,395
Please give my regards
to Mr. Shimazaki as well.

298
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
Please excuse me.

299
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,505
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

300
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,777
So I'm free to go, right?

301
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,913
I'm very sorry.

302
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,281
You don't have to apologize.

303
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,616
It's true that he was at the scene.

304
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,652
If we treat him like a criminal
while the client says otherwise,

305
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,054
then it's proper manners to apologize.

306
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,833
I owe you big time.

307
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,273
Jeez, that hurt.

308
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,345
If you let him off now,
it'll all be for nothing.

309
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,781
She must be trying to hide something.

310
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,352
That must've been why she said
she encountered a purse snatcher.

311
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,687
And you're going to leave it be?

312
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,891
Bodyguards can retaliate from assaults,
but they cannot take the first strike.

313
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,160
Even if you say that,

314
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,596
you're actually scared, right?

315
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,033
As I said before,

316
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,303
-I can't protect anyone if I'm not scared.
-Stop trying to fool me!

317
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,440
You're scared of getting involved
with Kicks Guard…

318
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,211
no, with President Ryu, aren't you?

319
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,848
That's because you can't stay calm.

320
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,883
You won't be able to control yourself!

321
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,653
You're afraid of yourself, aren't you?

322
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,777
I'm here today as Sawaguchi's friend.

323
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,980
I just can't keep quiet about it.

324
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,682
What are you hiding?

325
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,485
Nothing, just as I said.

326
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,223
Good morning.

327
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,692
Ms. Nagiko.

328
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,728
Sawaguchi…

329
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,666
requested our services because
he wanted you to have peace of mind.

330
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,969
Allow me to tell you this
as your bodyguard.

331
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,539
Our mission isn't over yet.

332
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,810
The stalker isn't Chief Omata.

333
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,079
It's my superior.

334
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,015
Your superior?

335
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,451
It's Mr. Iwata, the chief secretary.

336
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,188
Mr. Iwata? If I recall,

337
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,089
he's an excellent secretary, isn't he?

338
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:51,990
-Ninomiya.
-Yes?

339
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,060
-Check out the meeting room.
-<i>President Ryu favors him…</i>

340
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,696
-Please contact the company.
-<i>and was specially selected for the post.</i>

341
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,065
-Please prepare the slides.
-<i>Just because he's excellent at work,</i>

342
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,135
it doesn't mean
that he never makes mistakes.

343
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,771
How did you know?

344
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,579
You're working hard.

345
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,647
Good work.

346
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,451
If you would like to, how about
having dinner together after this?

347
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,453
-I'm sorry.
-<i>When I stayed back alone to work,</i>

348
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>he invited me to be alone with him.</i>

349
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,193
<i>I rejected him and told him that
I was already going out with someone.</i>

350
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,837
<i>From then on, there were times
I found my locker unlocked.</i>

351
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,416
<i>There were also traces of someone
logging into my email account.</i>

352
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,517
LOGGED IN WITH ANOTHER DEVICE

353
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,021
<i>I think he took my cell phone
out of revenge for rejecting him.</i>

354
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,558
<i>I believe he asked Chief Omata
to make sure I won't spill it.</i>

355
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,260
We'll finish it as quickly as possible…

356
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,262
<i>If this matter is exposed,</i>

357
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,866
it won't be just mine,
but even Sei's job will be in jeopardy.

358
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,103
Is that really the reason?

359
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,575
Sawaguchi may get ahead
of himself at times,

360
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,112
but he's not someone
who's scared of things like this.

361
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,681
Even you…

362
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,218
you're going out with Sawaguchi
because you like that part of him, right?

363
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,391
You said that bodyguards
should listen to their clients, right?

364
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,696
Protecting secrets is also part
of a bodyguard's duty.

365
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,636
He threatened to reveal everything.

366
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,276
Please stop this! Get out!

367
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,645
I like you!

368
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,881
I said I like you!

369
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm calling the police!

370
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,498
If you report this to the police,

371
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,400
then Sawaguchi will also find out

372
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,769
that I kissed you.

373
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,274
<i>I didn't want Sei to know.</i>

374
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,311
If he started to think
that it didn't end with just a kiss,

375
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,913
what am I going to do?

376
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,317
The stalker won't give up
even if you keep quiet.

377
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,685
Not to mention…

378
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,954
if Chief Omata

379
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,291
took action to make sure you stay silent,

380
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,794
then they have done
something unforgivable as an organization.

381
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,834
Let's fight back properly.

382
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,002
For Sawaguchi's sake too.

383
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,173
Can someone like me

384
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,542
even fight back?

385
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,782
Anyone can fight back.

386
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,524
NAGIKO TSUNODA

387
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,634
NAGIKO TSUNODA
YOU HAVE A VOICE MESSAGE.

388
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,604
<i>This is Nagiko Tsunoda.</i>

389
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,373
<i>I would like to speak to you, Mr. Iwata.</i>

390
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,377
I'll be waiting for you
in Conference Room B.

391
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,746
You have to come over.

392
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,785
The target is Chief Secretary Iwata.
ETA, 30 minutes.

393
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,923
-Current time, 13:01. Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

394
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,168
Please make it before 4:30 p.m.

395
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,335
Also…

396
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,672
What?

397
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,808
What's going on?

398
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,710
I'm on duty.

399
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,346
Duty? For what?

400
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,649
It's confidential!

401
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,588
A high-ranking secretary
stalking his subordinate…

402
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,660
For a company that is advancing
into the security industry,

403
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,728
this could be a fatal scandal for us.

404
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,163
I'm very sorry!

405
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,767
I didn't intend to cause you trouble,
Mr. President.

406
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,204
What should we do?

407
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,240
Shimazaki is an excellent bodyguard.

408
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,314
Today, let's show him

409
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,349
what a real bodyguard is all about.

410
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,686
I can feel myself getting nervous.

411
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,222
We're with you.

412
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,357
Yes.

413
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,633
It's five minutes past the ETA.

414
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,603
Mr. Iwata is late.

415
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,741
Maybe he got lost. I'll go fetch him.

416
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,815
Please be careful.

417
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,851
She can be considered a bomb
to Kicks Guard at the moment.

418
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,286
It's dangerous to let emotions affect--

419
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,687
I'm different from you.

420
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,322
I don't let emotions affect me
while on duty.

421
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,293
You actually said that? I'll remember it.

422
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,697
I know you can hear me!

423
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,302
Hey.

424
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,005
Just now on the ground floor,

425
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,741
-I saw Shimazaki and Takanashi.
-Here?

426
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,911
They said they were on duty.
They were with your girlfriend.

427
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,046
That's…

428
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,548
What's wrong?

429
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,250
Never mind, it's nothing.

430
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,185
Hey, isn't that Shimazaki?

431
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,623
Hey!

432
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,392
-Thanks.
-It's been a while.

433
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,128
Shimazaki, over here!

434
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,832
-What's the matter? Is Nagiko--
-She's fine.

435
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,435
It's been a while.

436
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,940
Could you please call
Chief Secretary Iwata?

437
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,543
-I would like to meet him--
-You don't have permission to enter!

438
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,211
This is trespassing!

439
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,528
Yes.

440
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:39,864
What?

441
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,668
I understand.

442
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,816
<i>What's going on?</i>

443
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,184
Just come with me!

444
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,785
Orders from the president.

445
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,523
Please excuse us.

446
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,059
Oh, Shimazaki.

447
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:09,828
Please come in.

448
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,170
I was the one who appointed Iwata
as Chief Secretary.

449
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,206
You can talk to me.

450
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,877
I would like to talk
to Mr. Iwata directly.

451
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,946
Please let us meet Mr. Iwata.

452
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,983
For her sake,

453
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,020
I think it would be best
to settle this amicably.

454
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,168
What's the meaning of this?

455
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,870
We expected some sort of trouble to occur.

456
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,074
That's why we had our bodyguards with him.

457
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,378
Please let Sawaguchi leave the room.

458
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,548
I'm sure you know that
he's in a relationship with Ms. Tsunoda.

459
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,450
Mr. Shimazaki.

460
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,353
I'll be fine.

461
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,030
<i>All this time,</i>

462
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,599
I did my best to become
a first-class secretary.

463
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,036
I don't want to give up
because of something like this.

464
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,842
Please promise that
you won't follow me around anymore.

465
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,313
Also, please return my cell phone!

466
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,684
The cell phone not only contains
my private photos,

467
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,822
it also contains backups of important data
for your work, Mr. Iwata.

468
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,659
They're both important to me.

469
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,562
Iwata.

470
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,399
You don't know when to give up, do you?

471
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,837
Stalking is a despicable act.

472
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,040
I'll have you resign
from your position as Chief Secretary.

473
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,814
I'll contact you for a follow-up.
Until then, you have to stay at home.

474
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,549
Sawaguchi.

475
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,587
I will send him off, President.

476
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,124
I will be on duty
for Assemblyman Kuwata after this.

477
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,529
-Let's go.
-Wait!

478
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,732
Are you fine with that?

479
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
Is it all over
after he received his punishment?

480
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,071
You've changed a lot.

481
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,007
You still haven't apologized!

482
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:43,248
If you don't apologize and promise
not to stalk her anymore,

483
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,350
she won't be at ease.

484
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,856
Why should I apologize?

485
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,629
I'm only doing this for the president.

486
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,131
For the president?

487
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:01,933
What is the meaning of this?

488
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,570
I don't feel anything special toward her!

489
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,939
I just wanted to erase the evidence!

490
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,042
<i>Among the materials that
I've given you permission to access,</i>

491
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,812
<i>there were some files showing
that President Ryu handed over</i>

492
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,881
<i>security data involving politicians
to Assemblyman Kuwata!</i>

493
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,186
If word about this gets out,
things will become a mess!

494
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,590
The reason I followed her
and pushed her down,

495
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,525
it was all pretense!

496
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,964
If it was stalking,
it would just be an individual issue!

497
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,066
Hey!

498
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,836
-What have you been saying?
-Sawaguchi!

499
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,674
You're on duty!

500
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,183
Did you know how scared she was?

501
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,423
Stalking forces one-sided feelings
on another person, that's unforgivable.

502
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,328
But inflicting fear on someone that
you hold no feelings for is even crueler.

503
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,799
This… and that…

504
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,869
It's all for the president!

505
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,472
What shallow thinking…

506
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,273
Mr. Iwata!

507
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,680
There's no way I would do something
so uncouth in the first place!

508
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,452
-Leave with her!
-Stop!

509
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,957
Let go!

510
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,343
<i>What are you doing?</i>

511
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,646
Luckily, it was cold coffee.

512
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,283
But if it was hot coffee
or some other chemical product,

513
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,419
I would've died.

514
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,387
I'm sorry.

515
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,424
Forget it.

516
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,761
That's what bodyguards amount to, anyway.

517
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,341
"It's fine if they are put in danger."

518
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,743
Is it?

519
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,449
What are you talking about?

520
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,387
The reason why Shimazaki left Kicks Guard

521
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,025
<i>was that he found out
I planned the attack during that event.</i>

522
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,829
He was angry that you were attacked,

523
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,466
so he left the company.

524
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:28,106
He criticized me and told me
to never put you guys in danger again.

525
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,977
Isn't he an amazing senior?

526
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,447
However,

527
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,351
I still don't think I'm in the wrong.

528
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,924
Japanese people have
no sense of urgency at all.

529
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,927
But I want to let them know
the danger around them

530
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,563
so that they'll realize
the need for personal protection.

531
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,200
I cannot agree with your methods
of exposing people to danger

532
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,802
in order to promote your own company.

533
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:03,107
That day, Sawaguchi and I put our lives
on the line to protect the scene.

534
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,443
You put your lives on the line?

535
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,248
Anyone can say that much.

536
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,088
When a real gun is pointed at you,

537
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,323
can you still stand right where you are?

538
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,531
I'm always prepared to be
my client's shield.

539
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,533
And it's not just me.

540
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,302
Takanashi, Suganuma,
and even Sawaguchi would too.

541
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,145
Five years ago,

542
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,515
a person I loved was killed
during a burglary

543
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,850
at my home in Los Angeles.

544
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,521
The brawny bodyguard I employed then

545
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,058
ran away.

546
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,528
I wanted to forget about the incident,

547
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,597
so I set up this company.

548
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,367
Just when I felt
I had started on a new path,

549
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,002
I suddenly thought to myself,

550
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,608
"Is it really right to
forget the sorrow I felt?"

551
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,882
That's why I decided
to join the security industry.

552
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,321
I don't bear a grudge
toward the bodyguard who ran off.

553
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,857
That's how humans are.

554
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,892
In fact,

555
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,395
humans are incapable of anything.

556
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,600
Yet those who say they'll put their lives
on the line and become shields…

557
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,506
I hate people who say that.

558
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,512
I'm truly sorry.

559
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,449
We weren't able to help you achieve
what you wanted to do.

560
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,956
I gained confidence just from doing that.

561
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,994
I'm resigning from the company.

562
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,601
Thank you. You protected my determination.

563
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,249
You did everything yourself.

564
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,120
How cool.

565
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,195
Hey.

566
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,300
You didn't even tell me anything.

567
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,071
I feel so lonely.

568
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,513
I wanted you to rely on me.

569
00:36:59,083 --> 00:36:59,951
Hey.

570
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,287
Should we take some time off for now?

571
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,328
I wanted to protect you, Sei.

572
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,098
That's why I couldn't say it.

573
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:21,672
I wanted you to rely on me too.

574
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,360
<i>Sawaguchi must have been shocked.</i>

575
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,432
Sorry.

576
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,334
For what?

577
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,471
I went overboard.

578
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,510
It's just as you said.
I let my emotions get the better of me.

579
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,748
That's not a bad thing actually.

580
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,918
Everyone gets angry
and loses sight of themselves at times.

581
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,553
How is that not a bad thing?

582
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,957
If I get influenced by my emotions,

583
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,227
it'll be better to just quit this job.

584
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,162
Be a little more honest with yourself,
will you?

585
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,830
Hey.

586
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,900
Why are you putting up a guard around you?

587
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,236
That's because I'm a bodyguard.

588
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,471
That…

589
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,840
isn't funny at all.

590
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,647
<i>Oh, Assemblyman Kuwata.</i>

591
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,616
Thank you for all your help.

592
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,652
<i>Is anything the matter?</i>

593
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,587
We've reached the location…

594
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>Did our bodyguards offend you in any way?</i>

595
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,192
<i>About the previous incident,</i>

596
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,095
because of your secretary's carelessness,

597
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,565
the data might be leaked, right?

598
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,467
Where did you hear that from?

599
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,137
<i>I can't tell you that.
But if it comes out,</i>

600
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,140
it'll tarnish the Prime Minister's image
since he was the one who appointed me.

601
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,276
Even if the Prime Minister falls,

602
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,446
your name is sure to remain in history,
Assemblyman Kuwata.

603
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,847
What do you mean?

604
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,515
I won't say a word.

605
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,385
I will put my life on the line

606
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,387
and protect you, Assemblyman Kuwata.

607
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,359
What the hell is that?

608
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,294
Who does he think he is?

609
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,996
It's just as you said, Assemblyman.

610
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,301
You cannot trust that man.

611
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,605
That man

612
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,942
only thinks of everyone else as his tools.

613
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,480
Hey.

614
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,849
Good work today.

615
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,252
Please allow me to resign.

616
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,321
You don't have to quit.

617
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,958
I'll assign Iwata to another position
at Kicks Corp. Hong Kong.

618
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,798
President,

619
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,369
you said that

620
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,772
you don't hate bodyguards.

621
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,110
However, I can't help but think
that you despise us.

622
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,213
You're right.

623
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,018
I hate bodyguards.

624
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,188
But it's different from holding a grudge.

625
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,491
Hate can be turned into motivation.

626
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,596
You would probably understand
since you've been in love.

627
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,866
Compared to the lukewarm feeling of love,

628
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,304
hate feels way more intense than that.

629
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,773
If you focus your energy
into that feeling,

630
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,410
you can turn it
into a business of your own.

631
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,147
Welcome!

632
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,387
Sorry to call you so suddenly.

633
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,490
I never expected you to treat me for real.

634
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,325
Well…

635
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,028
are you really fine
with conveyor belt sushi?

636
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:08,365
Fatty tuna, sea urchin, fluke fin,
prawn, and squid sushi, please!

637
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,900
-That's a lot.
-Thank you!

638
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,936
Surgeons get hungry easily.

639
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,271
All right!

640
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,074
-I'm digging in.
-Please go ahead.

641
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,046
The stalker…

642
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,614
-Did you get him?
-Oh, yes.

643
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,921
I didn't have a bodyguard with me then,

644
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,191
but my husband protected me.

645
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,426
Oh, your husband.

646
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,627
What?

647
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,497
I'm single now.

648
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,434
Oh then…

649
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,236
we're the same.

650
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,540
He was really cool

651
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,709
and really strong.

652
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,978
Maybe even stronger than you, Shimazaki.

653
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,780
It doesn't feel nice
to hear that directly…

654
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,350
He's not someone you can win against--

655
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,551
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

656
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:05,556
Let's see… sea urchin, prawn, squid,

657
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,959
-fluke fin, and fatty tuna, please.
-Thank you!

658
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,230
Are you angry?

659
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,699
Quite.

660
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,540
It's nice to be angry.

661
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,276
You can only get angry
because you're alive.

662
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,750
I don't like to beat around the bush,
so I'll give it to you straight up.

663
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,754
My husband was a police officer,

664
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,056
but he died

665
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,028
just three months after we got married.

666
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,430
What a cruel man.

667
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,302
He suddenly left you at a time

668
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,404
when the two of you should be
enjoying your lives together.

669
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,377
It's the first time
I heard someone say that.

670
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,581
Everyone at the police station

671
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,751
told me that he died an honorable death

672
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,254
and that I should do my best
to inherit his resolve.

673
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,690
But in reality,

674
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,925
I was so angry.

675
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,928
I thought,
"What the hell are they saying?"

676
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,240
I'm glad I told you this, Shimazaki.

677
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:38,148
As expected from someone
whose life is always in danger.

678
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,695
Sorry, but please head to the station.

679
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,464
Don't follow me, no matter what.

680
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,129
I'm used to people taking revenge.

681
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,097
Stop this already!

682
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,182
I've seen that man somewhere before.

683
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,425
Please! Protect our curry!

684
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,727
-Where is your husband?
-He was killed.

685
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,729
Be extremely cautious of him.

686
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,765
<i>I know you're dealing with
something very dangerous.</i>

687
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,667
<i>This case is much more troublesome
than we expected.</i>

688
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,270
You're a bodyguard that protects
his clients, no matter who they may be.

689
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,171
