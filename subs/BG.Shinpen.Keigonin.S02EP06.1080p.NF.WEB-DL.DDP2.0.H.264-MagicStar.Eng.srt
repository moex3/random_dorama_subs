1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:23,957
<i>You chased him away?</i>

00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,325
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

3
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,127
Yes. I gave him a stern warning.

4
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,368
I'm used to people taking revenge.

5
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,437
Stop this already!

6
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,473
If you provoke him,
he's only going to take it further.

7
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,943
They're getting closer to us.

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,747
It's better to increase protection
around people close to you, to be safe.

9
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,850
This person never listens to anyone.

10
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,985
-What?
-Yes?

11
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,287
Make yourself clear
if you have something to say.

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,589
I do listen to my employee's opinions.

13
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,258
I have nothing in particular.

14
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,261
I'm glad that Shun is safe.

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,996
Oh, don't worry about that.

16
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,898
I wasn't with Shun.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,499
What?

18
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,803
Well…

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,971
in other words…

20
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,576
I was eating with Dr. Kasamatsu.

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,180
"In other words"?
Just say you were with her.

22
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,350
Don't be embarrassed, Mr. Divorcee.

23
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,320
-I don't want to hear that from you.
-Dr. Kasamatsu, right?

24
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,788
I see…

25
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,391
Hey, about that Napolitan…

26
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,263
-What did you order again?
-I didn't!

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,101
Sorry to keep you from waiting.
I'm from Junction Café!

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,271
You guys haven't had lunch yet, right?

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,574
This is spicy cheese curry.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,242
We didn't order any curry.

31
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,844
This is a takeout menu item.

32
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,946
You know, I stopped searching for
an office position

33
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,014
and started working in cafés
immediately after graduation.

34
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,683
In this era,

35
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,918
getting an office job
doesn't guarantee security anyway.

36
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,353
When I look at you guys,

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,522
-I think freelancers sure have it easy.
-We have it easy?

38
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,525
It's quite hard, you know. I have to
think about my employees and such.

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,428
If you don't get along with your partner,
it feels like nothing but hell.

40
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,531
Don't worry.
I'm good at personal relationships.

41
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,234
Give me your feedback on it later!

42
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,637
-Go ahead.
-Have it.

43
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,305
-No, you.
-You go.

44
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,174
-Then I'll--
-I'll have it then.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,811
There's nothing else…

46
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,717
-Thank you.
-Give me some too.

47
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,789
Actually, there's something
I've been thinking about.

48
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,297
I've seen that man somewhere before.

49
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,335
Maybe he was following you
and appeared near the hospital.

50
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,672
He's not that dumb
to get himself discovered.

51
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,745
Please.

52
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,950
Hello, this is Shimazaki Security.

53
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,419
<i>Oh, hello?</i>

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,622
<i>Are you a bodyguard?</i>

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,524
Yes.

56
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,862
We receive requests
for personal protection.

57
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,267
<i>Can I request for your service
even without a referral?</i>

58
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,269
Yes, that's fine.

59
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,171
<i>Even if I'm not rich?</i>

60
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,944
Can I hear about your request first?

61
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,679
<i>Then can you come over to my house?</i>

62
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,983
<i>I'm really bothered that
I can't make any curry.</i>

63
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,155
Curry, you say?

64
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,206
Over there.

65
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,277

Are you the bodyguards?

68
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes. We're from Shimazaki Security.

69
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,797
It's horrible, right?

70
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,499
No matter how many I tear down,

71
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,501
they'll put them up again.

72

SHIROYAMA GENERAL HOSPITAL

75
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,247
<i>Stop it already!</i>

76
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,659
-Come in.
-Excuse me.

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,462
-Here are your afternoon appointments.
-Good work.

78
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,764
Hey.

79
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,601
Do you remember
if we had a patient in his thirties,

80
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,239
around 180cm in height, with a big build,

81
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,409
and has a slight scary expression on him?

82
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,179
Dr. Kasamatsu, do you know
how many patients we see every day?

83
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,515
There are more than
100 of them that fit the bill!

84
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
I guess she's right.

85
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,191
Please come in.

86
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,826
-Please excuse us.
-Come in.

87
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,329
-Sorry that this place's a little cramped.
-Excuse us.

88
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,299
This shop is really well-decorated.

89
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,635
I've been making curry here

90
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,904
for the past 40 years.

91
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,473
Oh, this jar stinks.

92
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,275
Are those sour-sweet pickles?

93
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,345
Yes, it's a secret recipe from my husband.

94
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,516
I've had customers scoffing at me,
saying, "The curry is nothing much,

95
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,486
but the pickles are incredibly good."

96
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,056
Where is your husband?

97
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,328
He was killed.

98
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,000
I might end up like him too.

99
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,505
Excuse me.

100
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,809
Can I ask how your husband passed away?

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,115
Last month,

102
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,018
he was talking to the landlord's son…

103
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,522
and he suddenly had a heart attack.

104
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,392
He died so suddenly.

105
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,863
What? You said he was killed,

106
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,132
but there was no violence, was there?

107
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,067
There was violence!

108
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,736
Those people, they kept on cornering us,

109
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,972
telling us to get out.

110
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,608
That was the reason
why he had a heart attack!

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,209
My husband was killed!

112
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,111
So he was cornered,

113
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,347
and that cost him his life.

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,521
This place…

115
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,723
It's a rented space.

116
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,992
-I see.
-But…

117
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,463
we've never failed to pay
our monthly rent these past 40 years.

118
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:15,168
That's why the landlord told us,
"You can stay here forever."

119
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,371
Their family often came here to eat curry.

120
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,474
And those pickles too?

121
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,912
Their son, who was still in kindergarten,

122
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,216
even laughed and said
the pickles were delicious.

123
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,121
However, when the landlord died

124
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,690
and his son took over…

125
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,692
he told my husband

126
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,429
that he was going to sell off
this building and the land.

127
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,766
It was quite a shock.

128
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,570
He said he won't renew
our rental contract.

129
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,572
There was even a lawsuit.

130
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,142
And by tomorrow…

131
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,278
I have to move out.

132
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,316
All the shops
around this area have closed…

133
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,087
The ramen shop, bakery,
and even the café…

134
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,192
They all cried and left
after the sudden notice.

135
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,297
But my husband bowed and begged them.

136
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,167
"This is different
from what we discussed."

137
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,372
"Please let us continue to stay here!"
He begged over and over.

138
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,574
And then…

139
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,144
that incident happened.

140
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,050
Are you still there, old lady?

141
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,955
Let's abide by the laws, okay?

142
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,294
We'll be in trouble if you don't come out!

143
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,229
Is the tallest one the landlord's son?

144
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,931
-Yes.
-How long are you going to stay there?

145
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,699
He went down the wrong path,

146
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,401
and the landlord was really upset.

147
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,204
He even got in trouble
with the police a few times.

148
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,672
Hey…

149
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,009
You can't even make curry alone, right?

150
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,646
They're acting like
those old-fashioned land sharks.

151
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,048
It's better to report it to the police.

152
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,484
The police won't do anything!

153
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,453
They just told us to discuss it
with the other party!

154
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,155
I don't mean to be rude,

155
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,691
but do you have any other family members
that you can confide in?

156
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,994
We didn't have any children.

157
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,100
My husband and I got this far,
just the two of us.

158
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,740
Please, my husband
protected this place with his life.

159
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,344
Please! Protect our curry!

160
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,115
Hey, old lady!

161
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,619
We'll have to file a claim
if you don't listen to us!

162
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,588
Hey!

163
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,424
Come out now!

164
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,325
What the…

165
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,493
Hey, what are you doing?

166
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,830
Aren't you guys committing
an illegal act here?

167
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,731
Shut up!

168
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,034
Tomorrow's the eviction deadline.

169
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,736
-Deadline?
-Hey, pass me my bag.

170
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,574
If she doesn't leave,
we're allowed to destroy the building.

171
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,347
It's useless clinging on
to this small restaurant.

172
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,716
Let's continue.

173
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,250
Old lady!

174
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,421
BODYGUARD REQUEST
TAKASHI KUWATA

175
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,557
The house of Mr. Kuwata,
Special Aide to the Prime Minister,

176
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,558
is 660 square meters wide.

177
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,460
There are a total of four exit points.

178
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,630
There are windows facing the road.
It has a Level 2 risk.

179
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,567
It's a casual meeting with journalists,
so there will be many outsiders.

180
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,035
Please exercise extra caution.

181
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,603
-Yes.
-Yes.

182
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,105
About this…

183
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,173
SEITARO SAWAGUCHI
BODYGUARD, KICKS GUARD

184
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,910
Why would he want to hold
the press conference at his residence?

185
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,614
Wouldn't it be safer if Mr. Kuwata
held the event at his headquarters?

186
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,417
Rumors are spreading that in order to
become the Prime Minister's special aide,

187
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,021
Mr. Kuwata deliberately leaked the scandal
regarding Assemblyman Otonari's wife.

188
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,358
He's having this close-up interview
in order to prove his innocence.

189
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,627
That's just a front.

190
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,667
He's treating them to some delicacies
in his house,

191
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,702
and ask them to write
something positive about him.

192
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,404
KOUMEI RYU
PRESIDENT, KICKS CORP.

193
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,607
This is Mr. Kuwata's forte.

194
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,146
The mass media…

195
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,815
They're all gathered there.

196
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,852
So if we do a good job of protecting him,
it'll help build our reputation.

197
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,387
Is that so?

198
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,522
Exactly.

199
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,792
You've shown remarkable progress,
Sawaguchi.

200
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,631
Only huge companies can be hired
for the ruling party's personal security.

201
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,468
I'm expecting good results.

202
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,538
Yes, sir. I'll be careful.

203
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,848
-Please excuse us.
-Excuse us.

204
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,755
This is tough.

205
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,892
The law is on the landlord's side.

206
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,894
If we obstruct the progress,

207
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,996
we'll be arrested
for breaking the law too.

208
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,332
It smelled really good.

209
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,069
-You mean the curry?
-No, the pickles.

210
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,172
I would like to try it someday.

211
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,974
Why are you being so nonchalant?

212
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,711
-You might be attacked here!
-I won't let them have the chance.

213
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,914
But if anything happens,
I'll leave it to you.

214
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:29,982
What?

215
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,219
-No. I refuse.
-I was joking.

216
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:34,920
I won't actually need your help.

217
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,188
Yes.

218
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:13,626
AKITO SASAKI'S FUNERAL CEREMONY

219
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,871
We're having curry in the morning?

220
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,272
You can tell?

221
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,774
The smell's so strong.

222
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,376
I made this from scratch using spices.

223
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,946
It's authentic curry.

224
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,747
Is your work really that dangerous?

225
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,283
You should choose your work.

226
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,652
I'm digging in.

227
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,491
Let me say this first.

228
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,861
Now…

229
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,796
I'm being targeted by a man.

230
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,867
It might be someone who had a grudge
over my past assignments.

231
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,804
This is what he looks like.

232
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,039
I don't know much about him though.

233
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,443
You should make sure to close the doors
and be careful when going home.

234
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,812
He looks pretty strong.

235
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,514
Can I take him down?

236
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,385
I learned karate online
during my school vacation.

237
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,154
-They taught quite well.
-Online…

238
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,929
What is he doing…

239
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,697
I wonder if he'll come for me?

240
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,838
I'll defeat him and help
your weak security office!

241
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,283
Try hitting me.

242
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,524
If I was that man,

243
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
I would just continue with this
and render you unconscious.

244
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,630
-Do you get it?
-What do you mean…

245
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,734
Human bodies are extremely susceptible
to sudden movements. Remember that.

246
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,770
I got it already!

247
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,473
Just eat your breakfast.

248
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,047
Don't open it immediately.

249
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,383
It's Dr. Kasamatsu!

250
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,619
What kind of joke is that?

251
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,954
I'm telling the truth!

252
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,124
Just stop it already!

253
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,098
What the…

254
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,600
Shouldn't you open the door?

255
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,573
I'm trying to understand what's going on!

256
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,609
So much for an adult…

257
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,553
-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning.

258
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,854
Sorry to come here suddenly.

259
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,689
-What's the matter?
-Well…

260
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,925
-I just passed by, so I came to visit.
-I see.

261
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,461
Oh, this is for Shun.

262
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,895
Thanks, you didn't have to.

263
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,765
This is farm-fresh with no preservatives

264
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,867
and comes with vitamins C and K,
both essential for growth.

265
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,235
-Oh, since he's still growing…
-Yes.

266
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,738
You're here to see Dad, right,
Dr. Kasamatsu?

267
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,172
-What?
-Good going for you!

268
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,340
What are you saying, you idiot?

269
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,641
Well, I'm off to school.

270
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,343
-Please make yourself at home.
-Hey!

271
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,046
-The curry was delicious.
-I'm glad.

272
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,917
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,522
But as Shun said,

274
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,058
I'm here to see you, Shimazaki.

275
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,928
There's something I would like to say,
which is hard to convey via phone.

276
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,564
Sure.

277
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,244
-Excuse me…
-We'll be starting soon.

278
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,848
I hope that all of you
treat the journalists kindly.

279
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,383
-Yes.
-Yes.

280
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,019
Thank you for waiting.

281
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,062
Please come over here.

282
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,500
-I'll take over.
-Thank you.

283
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,912
Sorry. My place is a little untidy, so…

284
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:00,946
It's fine.

285
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,782
I see…

286
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,118
You really had curry early in the morning.
Smells good.

287
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,988
Well, I came across
a curry restaurant while working,

288
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,790
so I thought of letting Shun
have some curry.

289
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,226
Oh, I would like to have some too.

290
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,230
Well… sure.

291
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,566
Before that…

292
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,268
Oh, sorry… the main topic.

293
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,839
Well, it's about the man we saw last time.

294
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,942
I see…

295
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,743
Here you go.

296
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,648
-I said I saw him somewhere before, right?
-Yes.

297
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,252
I thought he might have been my patient…

298
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,055
Did you remember something?

299
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,356
Yes.

300
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,127
He came to my husband's funeral.

301
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,062
Your husband's funeral?

302
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,466
Hey. Did something happen
between you two, Shimazaki?

303
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,802
-I can help you investigate his--
-No.

304
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,070
Please don't do that.

305
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,206
I can't tell you any details,

306
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,876
but it's quite dangerous.

307
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,814
I was a police officer's wife.
I'm not scared.

308
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,350
But you were so scared back then…

309
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,721
Oh, that's because it was too sudden.

310
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,857
I'm asking you nicely here,
so how about you being nicer?

311
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,759
Don't pressure me with that.

312
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,896
It's my problem and
it's got nothing to do with you.

313
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,632
Don't be so full of yourself!

314
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,635
I'm not thinking of
being in a relationship with you.

315
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,805
Wait… I didn't say anything about
going into a relationship with you.

316
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,008
-Isn't it the same?
-It's very different.

317
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,378
"Going into a relationship…"
What was that about?

318
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,646
-I'm digging in.
-Please.

319
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,150
Please excuse me.

320
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,486
Hello?

321
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,955
I arrived at the place earlier
just in case…

322
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,824
This case is much more troublesome
than we expected.

323
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,093
What?

324
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,676
Ms. Sakuma!

325
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,844
Old lady!

326
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,214
Ms. Sakuma!

327
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,816
Old lady!

328
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,752
It's the promised deadline!

329
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,421
Ms. Hanae Sakuma!

330
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,424
In accordance with the court ruling,

331
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,894
you are required
to vacate this place by today!

332
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,430
I'm Nakano, an attorney!

333
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,133
I represent Mr. Mitsuru Tamai,
the owner of this land.

334
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,737
Did you hear me?

335
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,939
EVICTION NOTICE
THE CURRY HERE IS ILLEGAL

336
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,976
-Hey.
-Got it.

337
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,144
Wait a minute!

338
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,748
-Isn't this too sudden?
-It's not sudden at all!

339
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,317
I've been telling her to leave.

340
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,020
She was the one who ignored the law.

341
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,856
Excuse me, but are you
Mrs. Sakuma's representative?

342
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,493
I've never seen you before.
Which law office are you from?

343
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,862
I'm Shimazaki. I'm not an attorney.

344
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,200
I work as a bodyguard
for Ms. Hanae Sakuma and her late husband.

345
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
A bodyguard?

346
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,207
When a law is in effect,

347
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,809
mere bodyguards
can't do anything about it.

348
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,879
Or are you going to
chase us away by force?

349
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,215
Ms. Hanae is all alone.

350
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,318
We are here to
help facilitate negotiations.

351
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,586
Don't misunderstand.

352
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,656
There is no room for any negotiations.

353
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,127
Good morning.

354
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,033
Are they really planning to
destroy this building?

355
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,169
Those guys are capable of doing anything!

356
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,439
I will not cave in to their threats!

357
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,343
If I can't fulfill our promise
with the previous landlord…

358
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,578
I refuse to take a single step out!

359
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,983
What the… Hey!

360
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,284
Hey, old lady!

361
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,221
CURRY CAFETERIA SAKUMA

362
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,423
Hey, why did you close the shop?

363
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,791
Open up!

364
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,626
Hey!

365
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,532
This is just like a siege.

366
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,903
If I want them to understand,
I have to show them my determination!

367
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,673
You two will be with me, right?

368
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,854
What the hell are you doing?

369
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,489
Open up!

370
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,659
Hey!

371
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,874
I appreciate everyone coming here.

372
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:01,580
Today, I intend to answer every question
with full transparency.

373
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,482
Please do not hold back.

374
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,350
-Please begin.
-Yes.

375
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,385
Please go ahead.

376
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,687
This is Ezaki from <i>Maicho News</i>.

377
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,793
There's an article stating that
Mr. Kuwata is responsible

378
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,461
for leaking the scandal
on Mr. Otonari's wife.

379
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,063
I read the article.

380
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,566
It pains me to hear that my appointment

381
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,202
has led to such a misunderstanding.

382
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,174
But this is completely untrue.

383
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,378
Regarding Mr. Otonari's
wife's private life…

384
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,086
…there is no way
I would know about that.

385
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,821
Also…

386
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,025
Is something troubling you, 04?

387
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,695
Is your vision failing, 01?

388
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,172
This is 01.
I'm leaving my position for a moment.

389
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,744
Say something, old lady!

390
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,947
I'm not extending the deadline any longer!

391
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,318
KANAGAWA POLICE

392
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,520
We received a complaint call
from the neighboring area.

393
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,422
Who's the one in charge of this area?

394
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,724
Oh, go complain to the old lady
who holed herself inside.

395
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,794
We're doing this
in accordance with the law.

396
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,539
Who are you?

397
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,943
I'm just a mere bodyguard,
and my name is Shimazaki.

398
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,514
The Sakuma couple have been operating
their curry restaurant here

399
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,216
for the past 40 years.

400
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,518
We seek your understanding that

401
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,954
she is unable to come to terms
with the sudden eviction notice.

402
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,089
And like I said, it's impossible!

403
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,492
Do you still not understand?

404
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,662
We applied for an eviction notice
through legal means!

405
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,865
The one taking reckless action
is Ms. Sakuma!

406
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,900
It may be true, based on the law.

407
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:07,072
However, Ms. Sakuma came this far
based on a promise with your father.

408
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,109
At least let her have a chance
to negotiate, please.

409
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,614
You're not even her attorney, so stop
interfering with other people's matters!

410
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,584
Any further act of barbarity

411
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,487
would only destroy the image that
the restaurant worked hard to build up,

412
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,256
don't you think so?

413
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,532
OWNER OF LONG-ESTABLISHED CURRY SHOP
STAGES A SIEGE!

414
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,600
AN EVICTION PROTEST?

415
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,014
-Good work as always.
<i>-This is Suganuma.</i>

416
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,316
A concerning individual has appeared

417
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,318
at Assemblyman Kuwata's press conference.

418
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,987
<i>Is he troublesome to deal with?</i>

419
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,424
He was the one who tried
to attack Assemblyman Kuwata

420
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,027
<i>during his 20th-anniversary celebration.</i>

421
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,563
<i>I heard everything from Sawaguchi.</i>

422
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,334
The reason why Shimazaki left Kicks Guard

423
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:14,372
was that he found out
I planned the attack during that event.

424
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,777
President…

425
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,580
Don't tell me you're planning
the same thing again?

426
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,615
You really don't know how to hold back.

427
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,685
As expected of the woman I acknowledge,

428
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,154
as a bodyguard and as a woman.

429
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,423
Is this the time to joke?

430
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,358
Please tell me.

431
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,794
Why is that man here?

432
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,029
Unfortunately, I don't know.

433
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,634
Be extremely cautious of him.

434
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:43,868
However,

435
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,172
do not let the other bodyguards
know about this.

436
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,141
President! Just who is he?

437
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,743
You don't have to know.

438
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,729
GUESTBOOK

439
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,145
POLICE-RELATED VISITOR LIST

440
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,279
Thank you very much.

441
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,348
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

442
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,517
It got a little hot there.

443
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,887
How was it? I hope all of you liked it.

444
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:36,921
-Yes.
-Yes.

445
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,757
Well then, we'll end it here for today.

446
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,091
-Thank you.
-Please excuse me.

447
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,861
Oh, please take the souvenirs!

448
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,663
Wow, thank you!

449
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,464
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

450
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,666
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

451
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,135
Here you go.

452
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,604
You think you could actually
bribe people with these?

453
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,605
Please step back.

454
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,574
Assemblyman.

455
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,344
Did you buy information with money?

456
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,781
This battle could have been easily won
if you knew about their private lives.

457
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:04,983
Please tell us the truth.

458
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:06,951
Please come over here.

459
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,487
It's fine.

460
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,555
But…

461
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,425
It seems like you have something to say.

462
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,326
Shall we talk?

463
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,495
It's dangerous. Please stay back.

464
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,964
It'll be fine.

465
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,700
If we have a good talk,

466
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,601
the misunderstanding will be cleared up.

467
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,936
All right. Over here.

468
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,711
Assemblyman…

469
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,584
Isn't your eviction method too coercive?

470
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,719
It's not.

471
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,822
I heard that this restaurant has
a good reputation around this area.

472
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,093
Don't you feel that it's too cruel to
do this to the owner so suddenly?

473
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,228
We're bothered by it too.

474
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,364
If we can't sell this place,
I can't pay my taxes.

475
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,167
Stop making us
look like the bad guys here!

476
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,402
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,336
Come over!

478
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,804
What's up?

479
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,272
-You should go back!
-What?

480
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,807
I'll deal with the rest.

481
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,876
I got it already.

482
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,049
It won't do us any good
to continue this siege any longer.

483
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,186
Not yet! I won't lose to them!

484
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,824
There are people
who understand how I feel, right?

485
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,026
People might be sympathizing with you now,

486
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,763
but you don't know
when it'll turn into criticism.

487
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,333
People might say that you're trying to
force them into caving in.

488
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,602
It's almost summer…

489
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,537
What?

490
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,039
I mean, if I recall,

491
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,711
the season for pickles
is almost over, isn't it?

492
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,948
Yet you didn't make any this year.

493
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,452
Ms. Sakuma.

494
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,489
Haven't you already accepted that

495
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,491
you can't continue to operate
the restaurant any longer?

496
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,630
I mean, you didn't even prepare
any curry either.

497
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,334
And what's wrong with that?

498
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,836
Oh, I'm sorry if I was wrong.

499
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:10,809
But didn't you stage this siege
in order to create a commotion?

500
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,184
Mr. Bodyguard…

501
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:24,389
I thought you were just
all brawn and no brains…

502
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,093
but surprisingly, you have good intuition.

503
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,132
It's my job to take a close look
at my clients after all.

504
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,305
That's right.

505
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,208
I wanted them to know.

506
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,614
Please excuse me.

507
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,050
This place belongs to me,
so I'm coming in.

508
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,588
Wow, as expected of a bodyguard!

509
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,122
You guys look strong!

510
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,959
If you try anything reckless,
I'm calling the police!

511
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,894
Your late father would be sad!

512
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,030
-Hey.
-Got it.

513
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,036
Oh, I'm not doing anything reckless here.

514
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,438
We're just doing a search.

515
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,540
Excuse me.

516
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,911
This place belongs to me.

517
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,680
So I'm free to do whatever I want here.

518
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:23,882
Young sir…

519
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,585
Please look at this!

520
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,122
That time, you and your father…

521
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,791
the two of you complimented
this place happily, didn't you?

522
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,927
I was happy.

523
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,132
My husband and I wanted to see
the smiles on our customers.

524
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,768
That's why we did our best for 40 years!

525
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,905
No matter what, rain or shine,

526
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,174
we would prepare
the curry and the pickles.

527
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,344
No, it wasn't just us.

528
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,681
The same goes for everyone
who had their shops here too!

529
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,884
But then,

530
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,986
our everyday lives
were taken away from us.

531
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,888
It was so hard on all of us.

532
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,495
I'm not doing this
just for my own restaurant!

533
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:16,234
I wanted someone… anyone to
understand how we shop owners felt!

534
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,640
Wow, how admirable!

535
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,543
But it's not good to lie.

536
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,346
Old lady!

537
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,583
You went to the Sugihara Law Office
in the shopping district, didn't you?

538
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,355
Did something happen
between you and that attorney?

539
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,658
I'll say it then.

540
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,664
She asked how to get the maximum
compensation in the event of an eviction.

541
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,633
Then the attorney told her to
just kick up a fuss

542
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,002
and refuse all negotiations.

543
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:51,903
Am I wrong?

544
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,208
It must be hard on you two
since you don't know what's going on.

545
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,109
This old lady?

546
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,778
She doesn't care about
this run-down place!

547
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,147
She was after the money!

548
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,500
Stop… Please stop!

549
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,570
No matter what our client is after,

550
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,972
our duty is to protect them.

551
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,278
-Please stop this!
-Let go!

552
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:50,762
Takanashi!

553
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,210
Enough already…

554
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,159
If people knew that

555
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,995
all I wanted was
just to receive more compensation,

556
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,433
it would bring shame to my late husband.

557
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,537
I'm closing…

558
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,006
the restaurant.

559
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,811
So you finally get it.

560
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,880
Get out of this place now.

561
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:45,650
Yes.

562
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,954
Please give me until the evening

563
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,756
to pack my belongings.

564
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,094
If you continue to stay after that,

565
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,396
I won't let you off so easily.

566
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,199
Let's go.

567
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,333
Got it.

568
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,634
Hurry up.

569
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,304
Dammit…

570
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,174
Stop staring.

571
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,079
Are you really fine with that?

572
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,518
You never had the intention of trying to
get more compensation, did you?

573
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,255
You just wanted to grab at any chance

574
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,058
in the hope that you would get to
stay here forever, right?

575
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,964
How amateurs like you think…

576
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,733
It's just no good.

577
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,770
It's all over.

578
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,543
I did my best until now…

579
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,646
My husband…

580
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,182
I'm sure he'll forgive me.

581
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,995
Why are you giving up?

582
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,898
Even if the place changes,

583
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,766
your husband's cooking
can still continue elsewhere.

584
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,670
What are you saying?

585
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,672
I'm already over 70!

586
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,507
It's impossible for me to
open up a new restaurant!

587
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,109
You said it yourself, Ms. Sakuma.

588
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,313
"Please! Protect our curry."

589
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,058
It doesn't matter where you set up shop.

590
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,962
It doesn't matter who eats it.

591
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,033
Your everyday life, making curry…

592
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,769
can still continue.

593
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,227
Have some curry, you two.

594
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,963
I'm sorry there are no more pickles.

595
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,532
The two of you did well.

596
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,037
I'll treat you both to
our restaurant's curry.

597
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,508
We'll just accept your thoughts.
We can't eat while we're on duty, so…

598
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,244
And you call yourselves bodyguards?

599
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,880
It's your job to listen to orders, right?

600
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,771
There, it's done!

601
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,007
Sakuma-style curry!

602
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,476
What are you doing? Go on, sit down!

603
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,579
-No, we really can't eat while--
-Yes, ma'am.

604
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,750
-Here you go!
-I've been a bodyguard for 25 years,

605
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,886
and I've never eaten while I'm on duty.

606
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,857
-You don't know when to give up.
-What are you saying?

607
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,261
"You're on duty"?
What the hell are you saying?

608
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,065
You're just a geezer
who doesn't want to break the rules.

609
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,234
You're such a stickler for rules.

610
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,104
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,246
All right, good. Here you go.

612
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,881
Please eat it while it's hot.

613
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,916
Mission complete.

614
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,056
Current time, 11:30.

615
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,927
Time, 11:30. Synchronized.

616
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,930
Sync…

617
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,933
Synchronized.

618
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,938
-Mission complete…
-I'm digging in.

619
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,340
Mission complete…

620
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,542
-I'm digging in!
-Delicious!

621
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,477
It's good.

622
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,449
The carrot's really good.

623
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:14,985
It's delicious.

624
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,625
You two really make a good combination.

625
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,761
-No, not at all.
-It's the complete opposite.

626
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,869
I'll try making curry seriously
for a month,

627
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,772
and see how it goes.

628
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,044
Thank you, Mr. Bodyguards.

629
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,482
You protected my everyday life.

630
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,228
Can I have a second helping?

631
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,295
Of course!

632
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,865
-You finished already?
-Hey, you're still eating!

633
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:06,370
CURRY CAFETERIA SAKUMA

634
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,508
It's getting late.

635
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,380
-Assemblyman!
-Assemblyman!

636
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,449
Are you all right, Assemblyman Kuwata?

637
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,818
Behind you!

638
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:24,822
Stop him!

639
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,892
-Please check on Assemblyman Kuwata!
-Yes!

640
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,194
-I'll take the other exit!
-Assemblyman Kuwata!

641
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,306
Stay still!

642
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:45,609
I…

643
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,546
was asked by President Ryu to do this.

644
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,481
He told me to silence Kuwata.

645
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,830
-Suganuma!
-I'm fine. Go after him!

646
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:06,730
Yes!

647
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,772
We were talking about
some political issues.

648
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,709
I don't know what irritated him,
but he just suddenly charged at me!

649
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,845
So I started to fight back.

650
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,350
What were his bodyguards doing?

651
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,722
-I'm truly sorry.
-No, it's fine.

652
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,527
They did a really good job.

653
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,762
I…

654
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,000
This happened because of
my selfish request.

655
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,504
You were the last one who saw him, right?

656
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,240
Did you notice anything?

657
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,013
You have to be honest here.

658
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,851
He said it was a request.

659
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,320
He was told to assault Mr. Kuwata.

660
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,056
It was a request? By whom?

661
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,362
Ms. Suganuma. Are you all right?

662
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,467
By President Ryu.

663
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,779
Welcome back.

664
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,619
President Koumei Ryu, I presume?

665
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,154
Yes.

666
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,691
We would like to speak with you.
Please accompany us to the police station.

667
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,260
And may I ask by what right?

668
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,563
I've been paying my taxes.

669
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,233
In Assemblyman Kuwata's assault incident,
the perpetrator said that

670
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,569
you requested him to do so.

671
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:59,510
And I'm the president of the company
that provided him with personal security.

672
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,712
We're just going to have a talk
to understand the details.

673
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,881
-Please.
-This is ridiculous.

674
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,050
-This is a request.
-Mr. Ryu!

675
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,321
Hey, stop!

676
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,989
What are you doing?

677
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,594
Hey, hold up!

678
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,895
Stop!

679
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,138
POLICE SCANDALS - 2017

680
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:32,209
APRIL 18: METRO POLICE SP-AFFILIATED MALE
ASSAULTS, SERIOUSLY INJURES SUPERIOR

681
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:43,887
Hello?

682
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,763
Sorry to call while you're not on duty.

683
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,666
Are you injured again?

684
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,702
Oh, I'm not injured today.

685
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,673
This morning…

686
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,510
I was too arrogant.

687
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,181
So you're here to reflect
on your mistakes?

688
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,150
In my line of work,

689
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,788
there are some things that I have to say

690
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,790
while I can still say them.

691
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,794
I see.

692
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,201
I have to apologize too. I'm sorry.

693
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,639
You stopped me,
but I still did my own investigation.

694
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,708
About that man, I mean.

695
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,012
It doesn't seem like

696
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,115
he was close to my late husband,

697
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:46,684
but…

698
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,652
he was his junior at work.

699
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,189
Which means, he was a police officer.

700
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,466
Seems like he was a passionate individual
in the Security Police Division.

701
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,836
However, he resigned three years ago
due to an incident.

702
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,640
Thank you.

703
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,776
But…

704
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,447
please forget about this matter.

705
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:19,717
I got it.

706
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,419
I won't ask any further.

707
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,555
Sorry.

708
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,059
In exchange…

709
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,928
promise me.

710
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,298
Don't treat your life poorly.

711
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,671
I know you're dealing with
something very dangerous.

712
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:46,977
And I know you tend to be
really reckless as well.

713
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,222
As expected of my attending doctor.

714
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,262
That's right. I know you very well
since I'm your attending doctor.

715
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,333
You're not immortal.

716
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,670
Got it.

717
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,451
The curry this morning was delicious.

718
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,723
All right!

719
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,996
So that's how happy you feel.

720
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,766
Well, if that's the case…

721
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,806
maybe I should've made it
for my ex-wife at least once.

722
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,376
Oh, sorry.

723
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,046
I always talk about things in the past.

724
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,115
It's fine.

725
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,222
Me too.

726
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,892
I should have made some delicious curry
for my late husband too.

727
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,362
Isn't it fine?

728
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,732
Both you and I

729
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,136
are here because of our pasts.

730
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,377
It's beautiful.

731
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,548
I mean, look at that.

732
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,818
You can see the tip of the Tokyo Tower
poking out there.

733
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,094
Sorry.

734
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:46,830
What?

735
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,968
It's from a junior that
I have an estranged relationship with.

736
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,470
You have to take it.

737
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:55,672
Excuse me.

738
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,675
Hello?

739
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,979
I thought you wouldn't call me ever again.

740
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,682
I…

741
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,853
didn't plan on calling again.

742
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:11,622
But…

743
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,725
things have turned troublesome.

744
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,326
<i>What's the matter?</i>

745
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,262
It's still not out in the news yet.

746
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,932
Assemblyman Kuwata was attacked.

747
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,001
<i>The one who did it</i>

748
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,303
<i>was a man by the name of Kato.</i>

749
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,840
<i>He was the waiter from that incident.</i>

750
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,009
Before Kato escaped…

751
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,177
I was asked by President Ryu to do this.

752
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,179
He told me to silence Kuwata.

753
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,549
<i>The president was asked
to cooperate in the investigation,</i>

754
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,852
but he ran away.

755
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,691
News of President Ryu's escape
is not out yet.

756
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,459
So far, there's only
the article on Kuwata.

757
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,661
What is going on?

758
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,929
Could this be real?

759
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,631
President Ryu going
after Assemblyman Kuwata, I mean.

760
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,935
Hopefully, our prediction is wrong.

761
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,347
Hello.

762
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,315
It's me, Ryu.

763
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,421
I was just talking
with Takanashi about you.

764
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,789
Perfect timing.

765
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,291
I didn't do it.

766
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:22,960
But it seems like…

767
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,761
I know too much.

768
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,698
This may just be what I deserved.

769
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,667
Why are you calling me?

770
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,402
<i>There's only one reason.</i>

771
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,271
Protect me.

772
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,740
Protect you?

773
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,076
<i>Kuwata has connections
with the Metropolitan Police.</i>

774
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,545
<i>They probably won't believe
that I'm innocent.</i>

775
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,416
I plan to leave Japan.

776
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,518
I'm requesting you
for my personal security.

777
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,455
I'll give you as much money as you want.

778
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,160
Why would you request for my service,
when I don't like you?

779
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,297
I might report you to the police.

780
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,298
No.

781
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,333
You won't do that.

782
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:04,701
You…

783
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,839
You're a bodyguard that protects
his clients, no matter who they may be.

784
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,910
<i>Please reconsider this.</i>

785
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,549
I'll be waiting
at North Toyosu Park at 11 p.m.

786
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:32,863
Don't tell me…

787
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,132
you're going to accept his request?

788
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:40,103
-He betrayed us bodyguards!
-But he needs help now.

789
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,372
I'm opposed to this assignment.

790
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,143
-It might be a trap.
-We don't know until we go.

791
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:52,115
Today…

792
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,153
at the curry restaurant,

793
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,723
when you chased those guys away,

794
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,197
it was frustratingly easy
to keep up with you.

795
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,602
I thought that

796
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,640
it meant we could really work together.

797
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,610
It was the first time I felt that way.

798
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:23,914
I see.

799
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,827
If you're going to protect President Ryu,

800
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,765
I will resign from this office.

801
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:09,719
Let's go!

802
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,455
-Over there!
-After him!

803
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,091
Search for him!

804
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,526
Search thoroughly!

805
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,332
<i>The last episode!</i>

806
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:26,036
<i>Prove to me that bodyguards
can really become their client's shield.</i>

807
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,104
<i>He's back, right? Let me talk to him.</i>

808
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,606
Get rid of him.

809
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:30,941
<i>You should tell the truth.</i>

810
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,375
<i>This is an order from your client.</i>
