1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:02,469
-Assemblyman!
-Assemblyman!

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,371
<i>Assemblyman Kuwata was attacked.</i>

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,039
<i>The one who did it</i>

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,574
<i>was a man by the name of Kato.</i>

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,909
I was asked by President Ryu to do this.

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>He told me to silence Kuwata.</i>

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,280
Seems like he was a passionate individual
in the Security Police Division.

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,049
You're not immortal.

9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,384
<i>Could this be real?</i>

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,652
<i>President Ryu going
after Assemblyman Kuwata, I mean.</i>

11
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,721
<i>Hopefully, our prediction is wrong.</i>

12
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,956
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

13
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,391
Protect me.

14
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>I'm opposed to this assignment.</i>

15
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,194
-It might be a trap.
-We don't know until we go.

16
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,963
If you're going to protect President Ryu,

17
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,831
I will resign from this office.

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,276
Let's go!

19
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,444
-Over there!
-After him!

20
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,348
Search for him!

21
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,417
Search thoroughly!

22
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,953
Head over there!

23
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,389
Where are you going?

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,326
Please stop.

25
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,764
-Stop!
-Hey!

26
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,068
-He's getting away!
-Stop him!

27
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,409
We're at the east exit.

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,782
To the left!

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,654
The other side!

30
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,841
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,410
NO CALLER ID

32
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,112
This is Shimazaki.

33
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,082
If you're President Ryu,
please knock the receiver once.

34
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,652
The police are searching for you.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,088
Don't stay around the places you frequent.

36
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,658
Also, please make sure
the surveillance cameras can't see you.

37
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:13,933
YOU GOT A NEW MESSAGE

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,569
TO: AKIRA SHIMAZAKI
NO PROBLEM

39
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,338
KANTO KURI WAREHOUSE 2-A,
KACHIDOKI, 7:00 A.M.

40
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,806
Reach Kachidoki by 7:00 a.m?

41
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,710
MESSAGE DELETED

42
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:32,752
Excuse me…

43
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,255
the President…

44
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,659
Currently,

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,961
we are unable
to establish contact with him.

46
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,431
Is it true that he ordered the attack?

47
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,867
Indeed, the culprit said so.

48
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,570
But it doesn't mean that it's the truth.

49
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,575
Then why did he run away?

50
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,280
President Ryu should've known full well
not to interfere in an investigation.

51
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,915
What's going to happen to the company?

52
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,082
Won't our bodyguard licenses

53
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,718
-be suspended?
-No way!

54
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,954
-That's impossible!
-There's no way that's happening.

55
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,722
-But…
-Calm down!

56
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,792
Until we know the details,

57
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,428
everyone is to resume their duties
as a bodyguard of Kicks Guard.

58
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,365
Those who have bodyguard duties tomorrow
should focus on their assignments.

59
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,067
Concentrate on your work.

60
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,502
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,707
SHUN SHIMAZAKI
AKIRA'S SON

62
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,875
What?

63
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,111
Oh, sorry.
I'll be heading off to work now.

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,015
You don't have to tell me everything.

65
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,485
Hey, for breakfast…

66
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,388
have some raw egg with rice.

67
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,157
Just put one egg over white rice,

68
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,427
one teaspoon of soy sauce,
and five pieces of seaweed.

69
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,264
There's nothing better than this.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,401
Make sure to eat.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,722
A raw egg with rice is the best?

72
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,794
<i>Shimazaki?</i>

73
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,032
This is a video from a surveillance camera
in North Toyosu Park

74
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,668
we extracted from Koumei Ryu's phone GPS.

75
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,869
Over here, sir.

76
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,242
It really is Akira Shimazaki.

77
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,443
Why would he be there?

78
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,546
Could he be protecting Ryu?

79
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,714
Impossible.

80
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,950
Shimazaki resigned from Kicks Guard
after a conflict with President Ryu!

81
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,721
However,

82
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,290
for better or worse,

83
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,026
he's a pretty gutsy bodyguard.

84
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,598
<i>I've heard about the Civil Party incident
two years ago.</i>

85
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,803
Koumei Ryu is a man who would employ

86
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,305
anyone useful to his own advantage.

87
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,843
I shall arrange for the Riot Squad
to deal with any unforeseen circumstances.

88
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,611
We'll capture him no matter what.

89
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,846
Please

90
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,216
make sure that everything
doesn't come out for anyone to see.

91
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,984
Yes, sir!

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,998
To think that the president of
a 60-billion-yen company would run away…

93
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,239
Now that it has come to this,
I would rather him die as a fugitive.

94
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,375
It'll help wrap things up easier.

95
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,848
The Prime Minister would be very furious

96
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,850
if I had to resign at a time like this.

97
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,487
The same goes for you too, right?

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,194
Hello?

99
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,600
Assemblyman Kuwata told me
to call this number.

100
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,969
I'm sorry,

101
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,239
but he asked me to cooperate with you.

102
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,508
<i>I…</i>

103
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,877
<i>don't know where President Ryu is.</i>

104
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,211
Are you scared?

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,817
You haven't changed.

106
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,653
<i>Not since you've been the chief
of the Security Police Division.</i>

107
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,902
CHUO WARD, TOKYO
KURI WAREHOUSE, KACHIDOKI

108
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,597
MASAYA TAKANASHI

109
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,570
Oh, sorry about this.

110
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,972
You're sleeping, right?

111
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,709
<i>Of course.
I'm not even wearing anything now.</i>

112
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,544
What?

113
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,381
I see, you sleep naked. How wild.

114
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,951
Are you with President Ryu?

115
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,118
<i>Not yet. Soon though.</i>

116
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,589
Where are you?

117
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,591
MASAYA TAKANASHI
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

118
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,493
Though I have no intention of helping.

119
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,961
Takanashi…

120
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,765
thanks for everything.

121
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,637
You've been a reliable help. I mean it.

122
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,839
What the hell is that?

123
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>Also, I've calculated your salary so far.</i>

124
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,112
<i>Well, it's nothing like severance pay…</i>

125
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,080
SALARY

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,948
<i>…but I've included as much as I could.</i>

127
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,584
Listen,

128
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,721
I didn't come with you to help you.

129
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,290
<i>I couldn't make up my mind.</i>

130
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,926
<i>Things in the SDF didn't go well,</i>

131
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,329
<i>and I never thought
that I was meant to be a bodyguard.</i>

132
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,099
That's why I wanted to know the reason

133
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,234
why you're able to do this job
without any hesitation.

134
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,005
<i>So why did you accept that job?</i>

135
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,341
<i>Any incidents involving politicians
always put you in harm's way.</i>

136
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,543
Or worse, you may end up dead!

137
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,913
<i>Have you forgotten…</i>

138
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,949
what happened to Chief Murata?

139
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,954
There's no way I would forget.

140
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,722
I wish us all success.

141
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:18,958
Boss!

142
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,959
Are you all right?

143
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,963
Mr. Murata!

144
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,734
Don't you think it's stupid to
expose yourself to danger for your enemy?

145
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,737
Don't tell me you're after the money.

146
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,545
-Sorry, it's time to work.
-<i>Hey.</i>

147
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,348
<i>No one ever comes back
to life after death!</i>

148
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,051
-<i>Well then…</i>
-"Well, then"? What do you mean?

149
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,219
How would I know what you want to say
if you don't finish it?

150
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,055
<i>Hey, Akira Shimazaki…</i>

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,724
just go die if you want to!

152
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,109
KOUMEI RYU
PRESIDENT, KICKS CORP.

153
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,611
Not a bad disguise, right?

154
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,046
From a bodyguard's standpoint…

155
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,317
wearing clothes that don't suit you
makes you stand out instead.

156
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,586
I see.

157
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,789
Then teach me, as a professional.

158
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,958
I still haven't accepted your request.

159
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,933
Indeed, I'm coercive
when it comes to business, but…

160
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,069
I've never exacted violence
in that manner!

161
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,172
Then why did Kato lie?

162
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,110
That man…

163
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,947
He resigned from the police force
after getting injured

164
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,849
and was picked up by Assemblyman Kuwata.

165
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,485
He is used to doing dirty work.

166
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,253
This time…

167
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,556
he was probably used to set me up.

168
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,358
Set you up?

169
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,294
Of all methods, why do you think

170
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,331
Assembly Kuwata used
the same as the one back then?

171
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,069
<i>He did it to show
that I was the one who devised the plan.</i>

172
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,070
<i>It was a warning.</i>

173
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>Nothing surprising,
coming from the world of politics.</i>

174
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,209
<i>He's probably planning to shake off</i>

175
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,944
<i>all the benefits I've given to him.</i>

176
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,747
I'm sure you can understand.

177
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,183
As a bodyguard,

178
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,654
you must know how those in power think.

179
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,824
But if you're innocent,

180
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,127
you could have just proven it.

181
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,263
It's so unlike you to run away.

182
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,433
If I were to be arrested,

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,003
I don't think
I would receive fair treatment.

184
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,442
In the past, when there was a huge scandal
surrounding Kuwata's public office,

185
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,380
one of the secretaries killed himself
during a public announcement.

186
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,619
Do you really intend to escape overseas?

187
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,121
I…

188
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,224
don't have Japanese citizenship.

189
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,262
And while Japan is my mother's homeland,

190
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,900
it gave me nothing other than money.

191
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,537
I don't think the police
would be the only ones after you.

192
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,943
One of my acquaintances has prepared

193
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,179
a small airplane for me
in one of their private airports.

194
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,682
You just need to take me there.

195
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,954
What's wrong?

196
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,958
Don't you accept all requests,
no matter who the client is?

197
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,527
If I manage to escape safely,

198
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,831
I'll reveal to the public
that I've leaked security data.

199
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,301
And you…

200
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:54,807
why don't you prove that bodyguards
can really become their client's shield?

201
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,754
You're asking me to prove it,

202
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,624
but I have no interest
in things like this.

203
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,460
However,

204
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,963
your life is in danger,

205
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,198
so I'll accept the request...

206
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,568
as a bodyguard.

207
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,913
OMOTO, MIYAGUCHI

208
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,651
After his escape, all we know is that

209
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,887
he hid in an apartment he purchased.

210
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,723
Well, I'm just an employee.

211
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,959
I don't know anything.

212
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,264
I heard that
you were close to President Ryu.

213
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,933
Only as a subordinate.

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,402
-I've been serving him closely.
-Suganuma.

215
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,404
The president is a suspect on the run.

216
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,242
You would be breaking the law
if you're covering for him.

217
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,610
I really don't know!

218
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,389
You surprised me.

219
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,225
That's my line.

220
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,693
Sorry to pop by so suddenly.

221
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,927
The door was open, so…

222
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,763
You're not with my dad?

223
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,600
Yes, I guess.

224
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,637
I thought bodyguards
were supposed to have a buddy system?

225
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,942
Don't tell me you quit?

226
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,779
You're easy to read, Mr. Takanashi.

227
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,515
What do you want?

228
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,818
It's the first time I'm seeing you here.

229
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,953
He seemed strange this morning.

230
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,190
It's like we're never going to
see each other again.

231
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,558
Did he say that?

232
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:53,926
No.

233
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,096
He prepared a raw egg with rice
for breakfast,

234
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,164
and even made freshly-cooked rice.

235
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,568
I think you probably don't understand,
Mr. Takanashi,

236
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,838
but he only prepares a good breakfast
when he's on a dangerous task.

237
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,041
It was a simple breakfast,
but it still felt a little strange…

238
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,975
You're right.

239
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,445
This time, it's…

240
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,180
a very dangerous task.

241
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,752
You would actually tell me it's dangerous
when I'm his son?

242
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,087
I'm easy to read either way, right?

243
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,723
How dangerous is it?

244
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,460
Assuming that the average score is 50,

245
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,829
is it around 60 to 70 points?

246
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,566
It's over 90.

247
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,737
I see.

248
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,007
But with that said, it doesn't mean
anything will happen for sure.

249
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,009
As a bodyguard,

250
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,011
your father is highly experienced
and highly skilled.

251
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,780
You don't have to cheer me up.

252
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,182
If he dies, I'll just go to Mom.

253
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,818
See you.

254
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,824
Shun!

255
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,904
My apologies
if I had to conceal you there.

256
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,007
We can be tracked using the N System
if we use the expressway,

257
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,109
so I'm opting
for the public highways instead.

258
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,447
HANDLE WITH CARE
PRECISION MACHINERY

259
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,682
I came to Japan
and made my company grow so big,

260
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,086
and to think that
I have to escape in such a small box…

261
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,822
Life is truly interesting.

262
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,558
Please bear with it a little longer.

263
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,861
<i>By the way, what happened to Takanashi?</i>

264
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,597
<i>Talk to me to kill some time.</i>

265
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,468
He resigned.

266
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,304
Was it because of my request?

267
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,078
I should have released him sooner.

268
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,547
He's still young.

269
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,784
Instead of doing small jobs with me,

270
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,887
he should be pursuing
that bright future ahead of him.

271
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,657
I should be impressed by your friendship,

272
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,127
but it's useless.

273
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,130
<i>I know that when humans
get in contact with one another,</i>

274
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,465
<i>all they want is to benefit themselves.</i>

275
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,801
And that is the reason why

276
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,970
I made use of people.

277
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,609
-Dr. Kasamatsu?
-Yes?

278
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,378
A patient insists
on having a consultation with you.

279
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,281
Since it's outside your duty hours,
should I just reject him?

280
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,749
The person's name is Shimazaki.

281
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,452
What? Now?

282
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,390
I see.

283
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,197
What's the matter?

284
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,504
Dr. Kasamatsu,
what do you think about my dad?

285
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,806
What?

286
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,009
I'm sorry to ask
something so strange suddenly.

287
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,111
But I want to hear the answer now.

288
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,381
Let's see…

289
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,750
Well…

290
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,954
He's passionate about his job
and is a good father.

291
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,489
No, I don't mean as a father!

292
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,525
Do you like him? Or is he not your type?

293
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,828
Hey, Shun! What's the matter?

294
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,930
I'll put this straight.

295
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,432
My dad is on a dangerous job now.

296
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,167
He might die.

297
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,072
If you like my dad,

298
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,141
maybe you should stop him.

299
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,778
That's all I wanted to say.

300
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,291
AKIRA SHIMAZAKI

301
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,862
<i>The number you are trying to reach</i>

302
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,797
<i>is unavailable…</i>

303
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,902
He said he'll help us.

304
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
Takanashi, I mean.

305
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,610
Someone from Shimazaki Security will help?

306
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,380
I can no longer follow
Shimazaki's beliefs.

307
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,949
That guy…

308
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,821
Do you know if he's with President Ryu?

309
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,692
I resigned because we were conflicted
over President Ryu's request.

310
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,330
-Conflict?
-Do you know where they are now?

311
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,632
No.

312
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,470
But both Shimazaki and President Ryu
are the worst.

313
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,407
They bring shame upon our occupation.

314
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,883
The police predict that President Ryu
will be escaping overseas,

315
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,586
so they have stationed forces
at both Narita and Haneda Airports.

316
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,721
They are also conducting
inspection checks in Shizuoka.

317
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,789
FUJIGAWA

318
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:51,723
What do you think?

319
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,693
There are some airports in Shizuoka.

320
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,630
I've used those a few times
while I was still with the SDF.

321
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,599
These are airports that can accommodate

322
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,868
small planes for private use.

323
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,737
It sounds like something
the president would use.

324
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,306
All right.

325
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,775
-Gather all available personnel now!
-Please wait.

326
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,778
You're dealing with Akira Shimazaki.

327
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,047
Even if you outnumber him,

328
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,949
he still knows what you're planning.

329
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:18,884
If so…

330
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,955
Are you going to track him,
even though he's your friend?

331
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,956
That's in the past.

332
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,225
I'm borrowing a wireless transmitter.

333
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,430
Takanashi.

334
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,599
If you find both of them,

335
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,235
contact me first.

336
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,070
There are people within the police

337
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,905
that cannot be trusted.

338
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,574
In order to protect the company,

339
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,111
I'll hand them over to someone reliable.

340
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,446
Got it?

341
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,756
NEW MESSAGE
NAGIKO TSUNODA

342
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,125
NAGIKO: ARE YOU OKAY? I SAW THE NEWS.
SEI: YES. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

343
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,927
NAGIKO: DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

344
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,233
OKITSU

345
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
It's a police checkpoint.

346
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,114
They must have realized that
you might be heading for Suruga Airfield.

347
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,651
Japanese police are quick to think.

348
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,754
<i>Are they tracing your GPS?</i>

349
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,757
3 MISSED CALLS
DR. KASAMATSU

00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,662
LOCATION SERVICES: OFF

351
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,599
Please relax.
I've already turned off mine.

352
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,836
I don't intend
to start a car chase with this vehicle.

353
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,912
Hey! Stop!

354
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:56,948
Turn around!

355
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,483
Please stop!

356
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,120
STOP

357
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,325
-Good work.
-Your license, please.

358
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,126
Sure.

359
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,834
May I know your occupation?

360
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,237
Oh, I have a delivery company
called Shimazaki Transport.

361
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,839
I'm currently on a delivery,

362
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,775
but I kind of lost my way
and I'm not sure where to go, so…

363
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,577
Could you let us

364
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,946
check the contents of your delivery?

365
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,348
Sure.

366
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,827
These are combustible products
with their inspection reports,

367
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,161
as well as some medical supplies.

368
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,599
They are rather bulky.

369
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,167
These, well…

370
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,969
It's medical machinery.

371
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,072
Could you let us check the contents?

372
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,842
No, I was told that this kind of machinery

373
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,578
is extremely sensitive
to conditions like tremors,

374
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:00,946
so I'm not allowed to open it.

375
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,848
It's true, I'm telling you!

376
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,484
This scary doctor warned me
countless times.

377
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,287
Wait, just take a look at this.

378
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,495
Here, I'll show you the number.

379
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,866
She's Dr. Kasamatsu,
a surgeon from Shiroyama General Hospital.

380
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,674
<i>What? From the police?</i>

381
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,613
Hello? This is Dr. Kasamatsu.

382
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,349
This is Ogawa, a police officer
conducting an inspection at Shizuoka.

383
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,153
Did you request Shimazaki Transport
to deliver some medical machinery?

384
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,390
Oh, right!

385
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,526
Shimazaki Transport, right?

386
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,261
Yes, I did.

387
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,498
Is it true that it's a precision machine
that cannot be opened?

388
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,234
Oh, I see…

389
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,038
It's a large precision machine, right?
I need that for an experiment.

390
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,442
If it's damaged,
it'll cost a few hundred million.

391
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,244
-Thank you, that's enough.
-Oh, please excuse me!

392
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,881
Hello? Good work today.

393
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,317
-Hello--
-<i>Sorry to bother you, Dr. Kasamatsu.</i>

394
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,387
-Hey, where are you--
-Okay, I'll deliver it safely. Yes.

395
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,889
-What?
-Sorry, I was held up at the inspection.

396
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,025
-Where are you--
-<i>Got it. Please excuse me.</i>

397
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,361
I'm closing the trunk.

398
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,904
It's safe now.

399
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,182
From my experiences in Hinode Security,

400
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,586
you're being watched by the police
as well as private security.

401
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,222
<i>It's only a matter of time
before you get exposed.</i>

402
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,959
-That was a mistake.
-Sorry.

403
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,961
We're abandoning this vehicle.

404
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,516
Suruga Airfield is just
at the other end of that tunnel.

405
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,984
-Let's hurry.
-Wait.

406
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,653
Maybe it's because
I've been cramped inside for a long time,

407
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,054
but I can't move my legs.

408
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,090
Please hold on to me.

409
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,694
DEAD END FOR WHEELED VEHICLES

410
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,563
To think that my last memory in Japan

411
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,165
would be of you protecting me…

412
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,568
It's too late to regret that.

413
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,337
I never regret what I do.

414
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,377
Money never smiles upon
those who look back after all.

415
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,880
It's just that…

416
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,417
there's something
I haven't accomplished yet.

417
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,455
That is, I failed to woo Mayu Suganuma.

418
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,194
You can report me for sexual harassment.

419
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,696
I won't.

420
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,598
SAFETY FIRST

421
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,568
God shows his love upon the virtuous…

422
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,705
but you and I…

423
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,109
we're nothing but pathetic beings
abandoned by God.

424
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,080
After this job is completed,

425
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,283
you should go play with a woman.

426
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,321
I have a woman I like.

427
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,122
Is that so?

428
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,224
Sorry about that.

429
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,927
She's an unpretentious and honest woman.

430
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,588
Please get behind me.

431
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,914
Please run!

432
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,218
The police are right behind us.

433
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,586
You guys won't escape.

434
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,725
The same goes for you too.

435
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,430
Pardon me.

436
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,832
No, it's fine.

437
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:54,833
President Ryu!

438
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,002
Please go to the police with me.

439
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,004
You should reveal the truth.

440
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,341
I'm not going to the police.

441
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,079
If you run away…

442
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,683
What will happen to Kicks Corp.
if you run away?

443
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,220
At the very least,
the bodyguards won't get paid.

444
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,624
You might be able
to set up another company.

445
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,962
But what about the bodyguards?
They'll lose their jobs!

446
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,234
This "business" you speak of,

447
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:31,836
is this how it works?

448
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,241
-Shimazaki.
-Yes.

449
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,010
Get rid of him.

450
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,051
This is an order from your client.

451
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:52,891
Hey…

452
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,797
That hurts. What the hell--

453
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,734
What is with you?

454
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,469
What?

455
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,612
President.

456
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,983
Let's silence him.

457
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,133
Hey…

458
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,535
Has Takanashi contacted you?

459
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,171
I've called him a number of times…

460
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,474
I knew it was a bad idea to trust him!

461
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,444
Wait, we still don't know
if he betrayed us. Please don't panic!

462
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,347
We have to find them before the police,
no matter what!

463
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,761
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.
I TOOK TAKANASHI'S LIFE.

464
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,530
EVERYONE WON'T FORGIVE ME.
PREPARE HIM A FUNERAL.

465
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,698
SING A SONG THAT HE LIKED. RYU.

466
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,199
I TOOK TAKANASHI'S LIFE.

467
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,778
Suganuma knows something.

468
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,716
Sawaguchi.

469
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,986
You always look at the bigger picture.

470
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,390
You know what you should do, right?

471
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,031
Please wait.

472
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,141
Please keep your body low.

473
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,179
Let's split up!

474
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,843
92-18…

475
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,180
92-18… There you are.

Hello?

479
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,753
What was that call just now?

480
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,223
You used me,
and you're not going to explain yourself?

481
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,525
I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of work, so…

482
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,594
I'll apologize to you on another day.

483
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,497
Let's have proper sushi next time,
not conveyor belt ones.

484
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:21,866
Shun came over.

485
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,970
-He asked if I liked you.
-What?

486
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,041
What is that kid doing skipping classes?

487
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,175
<i>Wait, don't get mad.</i>

488
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,113
He told me that you're on a dangerous job,

489
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,448
and that I should stop you if I like you.

490
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,819
I guess I couldn't give him
a proper answer.

491
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,288
<i>Well, that's a given.</i>

492
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,526
I'm sorry. Really.

493
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,661
Shimazaki…

494
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,297
don't be reckless.

495
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,902
I have the right to say this.

496
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,807
Losing your life while working…

497
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,544
<i>is just the worst.</i>

498
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,786
I apologize
if I'm getting ahead of myself.

499
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,221
It's more important

500
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,692
to have sushi with a girl you like,
rather than prioritize your job.

501
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,164
You aren't getting ahead of yourself.

502
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,470
Thanks.

503
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,407
I gained a lot of courage from that.

504
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,609
<i>Wait, I didn't say that
to boost your courage!</i>

505
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,778
That courage won't help with anything!

506
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,180
But for me right now…

507
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,285
it's extremely important.

508
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,552
You're way too bad with tailing!

509
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,889
I know that
you've been following me by car.

510
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,493
It was deliberate.

511
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,762
I didn't want to use
any underhanded means.

512
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,600
And in that sense, you've matured.

513
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,208
What's this?

514
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,577
This must be a lie.

515
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,713
There's no way that Takanashi is dead.

516
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,348
I can't accept the fact if I'm alone.

517
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,484
Would you come with me?

518
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,567
The coordinates point to this area, but…

519
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,695
You were really rough…

520
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,764
Shimazaki.

521
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,532
That's what I usually do, President.

522
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,567
Enough with this.

523
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,905
If you guys hadn't come,

524
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,474
I would've been in deep trouble.

525
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,210
This.

526
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,012
The first character of each line
says "dummy,"

527
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,280
meaning a decoy.

528
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,152
<i>We used this back in Hinode Security
when we were protecting a popular singer.</i>

529
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,887
It's a code we use.

530
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,623
Just what in the world is happening?

531
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,962
<i>Shimazaki.</i>

532
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,630
Get rid of him.

533
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:13,931
Hey.

534
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,508
Don't fall, okay?

535
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,318
President.

536
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,654
Let's silence him.

537
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,467
You'll switch with Takanashi.

538
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,902
Please leave this place.

539
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,072
I've requested Suganuma to assist us.

540
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,844
How considerate of him
to arrange a last meeting with you.

541
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,680
As expected of him.

542
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,416
Bodyguards are indeed
in the service industry.

543
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,954
I…

544
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,058
didn't want to meet you in this manner.

545
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,963
Don't say that.

546
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,903
These words, at the very least,

547
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,072
I wanted to say them myself.

548
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,914
I'll be leaving Japan.

549
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,652
If everything goes well,

550
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,722
I'll probably never return.

551
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,962
Take me to the location
Shimazaki has prepared.

552
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,366
Is that…

553
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,469
an order?

554
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,340
Yes.

555
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,942
What else could it be?

556
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,723
SURUGA AIRFIELD
OFF LIMITS

557
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,864
SHIZUOKA CITY, SHIZUOKA PREFECTURE
SURUGA AIRFIELD, SHIMIZU WARD

558
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:35,873
Sorry for all the trouble.

559
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,275
We have 20 minutes
until the aircraft arrives.

560
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,078
I'm sure the police must have
their sights set on this place too.

561
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,414
We'll keep watch to the very end

562
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,516
and escort you to the plane
immediately when it arrives.

563
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,951
-I'm counting on you.
-Pardon me.

564
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,820
Are you really going to do this?

565
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,556
Me too.

566
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,694
I just happened to come along,
but I can't accept it.

567
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,097
Are you really going to escape, President?

568
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,501
The President promised
to reveal the truth behind the data leak

569
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,035
once he returns to Los Angeles.

570
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,238
Are you stupid?

571
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,176
I don't believe that
President Ryu will reveal it willingly.

572
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,179
He swore to do that,
and that's why I accepted his request.

573
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,047
He's not someone you can trust.

574
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,317
I'm leaving.

575
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,086
Takanashi.

576
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,988
You should leave too
if you don't agree with it.

577
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:24,889
Takanashi.

578
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,293
You wanted to ask me, right?

579
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,364
The reason I get so serious
about being a bodyguard.

580
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,334
Probably…

581
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,239
because this job questions
whether I can trust another person or not.

582
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,111
I mean, we meet
different clients every time,

583
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,914
and we do our best to believe in them,
no matter if we like it or not.

584
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:51,949
Even if…

585
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,984
that person could be our enemy.

586
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,456
To believe and protect them…

587
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,827
By protecting our clients,
we protect their future.

588
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,361
Isn't that what our job means?

589
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,430
Though I still don't really know.

590
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,766
But if he betrays our trust,
we would be covering for a criminal!

591
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,667
This is just reckless.

592
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,902
He has lost his trust in bodyguards.

593
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,072
If this backfires,
we may be forced to resign.

594
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,407
You trust everyone so easily.

595
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,443
Aren't you the one underestimating
our job, Shimazaki?

596
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,247
It seems like
you're at a disadvantage, Shimazaki.

597
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,651
So you'll trust someone if they're serious
and have a good reputation?

598
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,623
You'll trust someone
if they're nice and kind to you?

599
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,430
You'll trust someone
if they've never done anything wrong?

600
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,368
We never know if they're lying or not.

601
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,471
That's why we have
no choice but to trust them!

602
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,473
Otherwise…

603
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,010
we won't be able to
protect them with our lives.

604
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,553
Shall we leave it at that?

605
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,236
Can I change my request?

606
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,876
I won't run away.

607
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,745
I'm changing my destination.

608
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,952
That is,
if all of you are willing to find out

609
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,922
if I'm a person
that can be trusted or not.

610
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,263
I will follow my client's orders.

611
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,194
Shimazaki will be the BG,
and Takanashi will be the backup.

612
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,164
We will take the lead,
and Sawaguchi will do a route check.

613
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,433
Suganuma,
you're on standby at the destination.

614
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,401
-Understood.
-Understood.

615
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,537
Check your transmitters.

616
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,407
Be on alert. Please communicate in secret.

617
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,877
We'll be leaving
the onsite decision-making to you.

618
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,817
It's been a while.

619
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,954
The estimated time
is 4 hours and 30 minutes from now.

620
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,056
The current time is 3:40 p.m.

621
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,424
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

622
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,792
-Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

623
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,632
I wish us all success.

624
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:55,933
-Yes.
-Yes.

625
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,487
What? You lost them?

626
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,557
I caught up with their car when they broke
their way through the police checkpoint

627
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,792
and I went ahead to cut them off,

628
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,261
but they never showed up at the airfield.

629
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,931
I'm also sorry
for leaving a scratch on your car.

630
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,135
-What about Takanashi and Suganuma?
-<i>I don't know.</i>

631
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,871
It's possible that they pretended
to head toward Suruga Airfield

632
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,241
-but went somewhere else instead.
-Find them immediately!

633
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,577
I'm very sorry!

634
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,346
I entrusted that task to him.

635
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,617
How could you trust your subordinate?

636
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:52,823
This was the reason you couldn't
go up the ranks back in the police force.

637
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,160
I will not let things end like this.

638
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,597
I have my own pride too.

639
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,640
We've arrived, President.

640
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,609
-Good work.
-I'll check on the situation.

641
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,246
This is 02, to 03. What's the situation?

642
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,414
This is 03.

643
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,417
There's no one stationed
around the rear car park.

644
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,388
Only Chief Omata's company vehicle
is parked here.

645
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,422
This is 04.

646
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,891
I'm on the lookout near the courtyard.

647
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,861
It seems like there is no one
watching over or patrolling the area.

648
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:31,962
<i>This is 02. Acknowledged.</i>

649
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,964
Assemblyman Kuwata is at home.

650
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,500
There are two police officers
at the entrance.

651
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,737
I believe he has been inside
ever since the assault incident.

652
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,505
I see.

653
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,609
President, will you enter from the rear,

654
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,945
or from the front?

655
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,252
What would you choose if it was you?

656
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,957
If you're prepared
to meet the police later,

657
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,826
it would be wiser to take the front.

658
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,964
I would take the rear.

659
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,135
No matter what place, it's always easier
to enter from the rear entrance.

660
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,470
That is what I learned in life.

661
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,074
However,

662
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,377
we must always be aggressive
when it comes to business.

663
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,780
You better pray.

664
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,661
Everything's fine here.

665
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,164
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

666
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,265
What's wrong with your neck?

667
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,203
My neighbor's cat scratched my neck.

668
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,505
Is Assemblyman Kuwata at home?

669
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,473
What?

670
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,008
Shimazaki is…

671
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,380
Assemblyman, sorry for approaching you
without an appointment.

672
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,783
I happen to be with that person,

673
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,485
so I was wondering if we could meet you.

674
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,820
<i>I see.</i>

675
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,556
I was thinking
of having a talk with him too.

676
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,425
Please wait at the nearby car park.

677
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,195
<i>Someone will show you the way
after five minutes.</i>

678
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,099
Please let the police know
that private security is sufficient

679
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,868
and tell them to go back.

680
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,637
Also…

681
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,920
<i>This is 02. We'll be entering.</i>

682
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,692
To achieve his own objectives,

683
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,328
that man thinks of
other people's lives as nothing.

684
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,098
I understand that
because I'm similar to him.

685
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,068
But Assemblyman Kuwata…

686
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,704
says that he would like to meet you.

687
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,712
Let's proceed.

688
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,119
Please.

689
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,026
Gunshots heard coming from eleven o'clock.

690
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,294
It's not the police.

691
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,930
So the front gate
wasn't open to me after all.

692
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,865
-Please wait here.
-What are you planning to do?

693
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,902
He's back, right? Let me talk to him.

694
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,738
He's an ex-police officer.
He's familiar with firearms.

695
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,072
-I'll go.
-I'll go!

696
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,308
You have Shun to think about.

697
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,511
-Dr. Kasamatsu too--
-You have Suganuma too!

698
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,680
She's already…

699
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,849
No. She always…

700
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,884
<i>had you in her heart, Takanashi.</i>

701
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,053
Shimazaki.

702
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:44,955
You should go.

703
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,865
-You'll put your life on the line, right?
-Please wait!

704
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,401
I've been thinking about this.

705
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,871
Why did you ask Shimazaki to protect you?

706
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,741
Don't tell me your motive
is to expose him to danger!

707
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:11,848
You're wrong.

708
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,952
That's because…

709
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,088
I believe in Shimazaki too.

710
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,098
-Protect him.
-Shimazaki!

711
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,975
Hey, can we talk for a bit?

712
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,281
Haven't we known each other long enough?

713
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,755
He fell for it all right.

714
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,859
I heard that…

715
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,862
you were quite the passionate person
back in the SP, Kato.

716
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,569
I don't know what happened to you
when you were with the police,

717
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:12,009
but don't do anything
that goes against your own feelings.

718
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:19,750
Let us pass.

719
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,320
I'm begging you, Kato.

720
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,890
Don't call me by that name!

721
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,667
What are you waiting for?

722
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,970
I know! I'm a former police officer!

723
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:20,710
Takanashi!

724
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,612
This is 02. We're heading in!

725
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,932
We…

726
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,535
couldn't win against
the unarmed guys, even in the end.

727
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,260
Excuse us.

728
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,400
Please go ahead.

729
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,447
Why did you come back here?

730
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,082
It's a little late, but…

731
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,318
I wanted someone
to place their trust in me.

732
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:44,361
The crime that you and I committed
is stored right here.

733
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:49,366
I will be turning myself in to the police.

734
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,403
Won't you come with me, Assemblyman?

735
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,338
Or rather…

736
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,843
the fact that
I'm standing here and talking with you…

737
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,280
proves that you've lost.

738
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,382
Do you know what you're saying?

739
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,485
This is going
to implicate the Prime Minister!

740
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,452
Assemblyman.

741
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,091
You're not seeing anything.

742
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,862
Allow me to warn you…

743
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,498
as a friend.

744
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,891
-Shimazaki?
-Shimazaki!

745
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,426
Are you all right?

746
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,860
I'll call for an ambulance!

747
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,129
Hey, Shimazaki!

748
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,331
-This is an emergency.
-I'm fine.

749
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,600
-I'm at Setagaya…
-Shimazaki?

750
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,635
-Shimazaki!
-…Akira Shimazaki.

751
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,238
-Shimazaki!
-Isn't it cold here?

752
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,707
It's likely that he collapsed

753
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,842
-due to a gunshot wound on his leg.
-Shimazaki!

754
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,943
Shimazaki!

755
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,212
Hey! Akira Shimazaki!

756
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,581
-Hey!
-Please hold on!

757
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,092
-We're entering the room now.
-Yes.

758
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:29,933
Oh, you came?

759
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,469
-Mr. Takanashi called me.
-I see.

760
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,138
What the heck?
Your complexion looks way too good.

761
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,041
The bullet…

762
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,945
kind of went through my leg, so there was
no need for serious surgery or anything.

763
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,381
You had serious surgery, you know?

764
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,683
A gunshot wound to your left thigh…

765
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,652
If the wound was just off by 1cm,

766
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,821
you might have suffered
from major blood loss.

767
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,623
Please give him a good scolding!

768
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:54,891
Sure, leave it to me.

769
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,262
Also…

770
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,534
please take care of him forever,
if you can,

771
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,036
Dr. Kasamatsu.

772
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,471
See you.

773
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,016
Sorry.

774
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,623
Once I'm discharged,

775
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,859
let's have sushi, not conveyor belt ones.

776
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,300
I'm fine with conveyor belt sushi.

777
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,640
Isn't that good enough for us?

778
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,947
I'm saying that
we don't need further progress.

779
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,585
You're angry, right?

780
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,493
I've come to understand…

781
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:10,233
that I'll never be able to tie down
a man like you.

782
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,140
Do whatever you want.

783
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,710
But…

784
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,547
make sure you don't die.

785
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:37,861
Got it.

786
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:47,170
The police questioning
is going to be troublesome later.

787
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,705
Oh, that goes for you too, Dr. Kasamatsu.

788
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,173
I'm sorry about that.

789
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,675
Seriously…

790
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,678
-What? No way!
-You're so troublesome.

791
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,579
That hurts!

792
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,281
Hey…

793
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:04,587
<i>Yesterday, Special Aide Takashi Kuwata
of the Civil Party turned himself in,</i>

794
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,256
<i>and after police interrogation,</i>

795
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,057
<i>has admitted to all his crimes,</i>

796
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,959
<i>including the assault
during his press conference,</i>

797
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,662
<i>as well as the misuse of political funds.</i>

798
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,432
<i>This morning, he submitted
a letter of resignation--</i>

799
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,068
<i>The suspect behind Assemblyman Kuwata's
assault during his press conference</i>

800
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,804
<i>has been arrested
and identified as Kazuma Kato,</i>

801
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,806
<i>a former officer
in the MPD's Security Police Division.</i>

802
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,909
<i>He is also suspected
of being involved in an assault incident</i>

803
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,610
<i>during Assemblyman Kuwata's
20th anniversary…</i>

804
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,778
Oh, you're here.

805
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,346
Have you seen it?

806
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:31,581
Seen what?

807
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,385
<i>As a way of atoning for my sins,</i>

808
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,789
<i>I wish to further my business
based on this entire experience.</i>

809
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,692
<i>As I got myself involved
in the security industry,</i>

810
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,594
I learned that there are bodyguards

811
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,531
who will risk their lives
to protect their clients.

812
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,067
Knowing that people like them exist…

813
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,070
was an invaluable experience for me.

814
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,473
Well…

815
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,375
I guess that's part of their job,

816
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,445
<i>but I hope to thank them</i>

817
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,348
<i>personally someday.</i>

818
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,382
Thank us now.

819
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,617
And in person too.

820
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,553
Oh, and Sawaguchi
already transferred the money to you.

821
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,956
-Oh, for Ms. Tsunoda's case?
-Yes.

822
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,527
It seems like Sawaguchi and Suganuma
will be staying in Kicks Guard,

823
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,863
but the company owner will be changed.

824
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,633
Omata managed to get himself a job
in another security company too.

825
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,401
I see. What about you?

826
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,071
It has nothing to do with you.

827
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,305
I guess so, right?

828
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,244
This is Junction Café!

829
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,212
-Did you order something?
-I didn't.

830
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,515
We didn't order anything.

831
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,117
I quit my job,
so here's a farewell present.

832
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,318
You quit?

833
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,921
Weren't you betting your entire life
on opening up a café?

834
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,590
It's hard to make a living
as a freelancer during these times.

835
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,626
I'm looking to find work
in a listed company.

836
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,495
-You change really fast.
-I had no choice.

837
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,431
My girlfriend said she would break up
with me if I didn't have a stable income.

838
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,700
Thanks for everything. Take care!

839
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,974
So that's how youngsters
in the Reiwa era are.

840
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,242
Scary, indeed.

841
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:13,583
Testing.

842
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,160
All good here.

843
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,332
I'm staying here.

844
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,235
Oh, you have no right to refuse,
by the way.

845
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,637
All this talk about "rights" again…

846
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:36,973
Copy.

847
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,210
Let's expand our work scope
from here on out.

848
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,279
We could cooperate with big companies

849
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,014
and that could give us
more possibilities too.

850
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,284
And you're suddenly giving orders
like you're some big shot here?

851
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,086
That Reiwa-era youngster mentioned it.

852
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,890
I would need a stable income
to settle down.

853
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,025
Hey, wait. Really? With whom?

854
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,860
-Suganuma?
-Wait…

855
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,129
-It hasn't been decided--
-That's great! Congratulations!

856
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,464
-Congr--
-It hasn't been decided yet.

857
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,467
Well, it's just my imagination as usual.

858
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,737
Imagination? That's sad.

859
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:09,706
In any case…

860
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,375
this is the situation I'm in.

861
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,111
And that's precisely why

862
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,348
I should be able to work
by being useful to others.

863
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,388
Your reply?

864
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,361
-This is 01. Synchronized.
-Synchronized.

865
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,336
SHIMAZAKI SECURITY

866
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,305
The pizza's just sitting out here,
it's unsanitary.

867
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,506
NEW MESSAGE
RE: BODYGUARD REQUEST

868
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,081
I will check the positions
for today's assignment.

869
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,683
-Bodyguard is 01, Sawaguchi.
-Yes.

870
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,251
Backup is 02, Suganuma.

871
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,719
-Side is 03, Kawazu.
-Yes.

872
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,221
-04, Shirai.
-Yes.

873
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:01,424
B1 will proceed first
and check the interior of the building.

874
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,358
Yes.

875
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,128
And as additional support,

876
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,197
we will be cooperating
with Shimazaki Security this time.

877
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,166
Please guide us.

878
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,969
-We'll do our best not to get in the way.
-Same here.

879
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,306
It's almost time.

880
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,575
-Well then, I'm counting on everyone.
-Understood.

881
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,891
We will be in charge
of your personal security today.

882
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,160
-I look forward to working with you.
-Pleased to meet you.

883
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,670
-We're in position.
-Understood.

884
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,571
We'll lead the way.

885
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,243
This is 01.
Mr. Ichikawa has entered the main hall.

886
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,244
Congratulations!

887
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,946
Team C will switch with B2.

888
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,049
Please move to the rear entrance
and proceed with your security duties.

889
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:33,950
Understood.

890
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,754
THE WORLD CHANGES DRASTICALLY OVERNIGHT.

891
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,890
THOSE WHO CAN STAND UP TO IT

892
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:44,427
ARE PROFESSIONALS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS.

893
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:50,800
THE NEED FOR PROTECTORS HAS ARRIVED.

894
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,703
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.

895
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,638
