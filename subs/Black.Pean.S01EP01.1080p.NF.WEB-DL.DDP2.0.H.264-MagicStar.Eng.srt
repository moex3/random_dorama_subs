1
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,992
I'm from Teika University.

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,294
Welcome. Please proceed
to the front entrance.

3
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,938
Yes. Okay.

4
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,206
Understood.

5
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,642
They're here.

6
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,014
Right, understood. I'm on my way.

7
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,251
They've entered the building.

8
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,254
Listen up! We only have five minutes!

9
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,257
<i>Tojo University Hospital.</i>

10
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,325
<i>Known in the Tokai region,</i>

11
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,995
<i>but barely recognized on a national scale.</i>

12
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>But today,</i>
<i>from the towering heights of Tokyo,</i>

13
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,270
<i>the giants of Teika University</i>
<i>are here on reconnaissance.</i>

14
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,673
Professor Nishizaki, we welcome you.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,277
It is my wish to learn all I can
from your university.

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,413
A great doctor as yourself?
Don't be silly.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,684
<i>What business do they have</i>
<i>with a small regional hospital like ours?</i>

18
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,789
<i>Teika University, with its cutting-edge</i>
<i>cardiac surgery technology…</i>

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,157
THE RACE FOR CARDIAC GLORY

20
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,726
<i>…and Tojo's own skilled surgeons</i>

21
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>are in fierce competition.</i>

22
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,398
TEIKA UNIVERSITY VS TOJO UNIVERSITY

23
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,067
<i>The cardiac surgery department</i>
<i>where I work</i>

24
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:45,638
<i>attracts patients from all over Japan,</i>
<i>and even the world,</i>

25
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,208
<i>seeking the expertise of Dr. Seigo Saeki.</i>

26
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,911
<i>There's one more reason</i>
<i>for the competition.</i>

27
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,248
<i>The approaching elections</i>
<i>for the Chairman of the Surgical Society.</i>

28
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,149
ELECTIONS FOR CHAIRMAN

29
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,684
Professor, it's time.

30
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,954
To earn the position to stand at the top
of 40.000 surgeons

31
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,757
<i>Tojo's Dr. Saeki and Teika's Dr. Nishizaki</i>

32
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,825
<i>go head-to-head.</i>

33
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,726
SAEKI VS NISHIZAKI

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,761
<i>It's unclear why,</i>

35
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,763
<i>but today,</i>

36
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>they will perform surgery on a patient</i>

37
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:20,006
<i>who suffers conditions usually deemed</i>
<i>to be ineligible for surgery.</i>

38
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,409
<i>They've come to watch us fail, I presume.</i>

39
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,579
<i>Dr. Saeki has risen to the challenge.</i>

40
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,184
<i>For Tojo University,</i>
<i>failure is not an option.</i>

41
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,220
Dr. Saeki's operation will begin shortly.

42
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,723
Would you kindly fill me in

43
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,058
on the tools he will be using?

44
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,126
Much obliged.

45
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,631
Give us a close-up of the surgical tools.

46
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,532
<i>Okay.</i>

47
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,307
Those are Dr. Saeki's…

48
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,543
black forceps.

49
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,979
Here's the doctor.

50
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,574
The heart-lung machine
is functioning well.

51
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,412
You got this far in 20 minutes.
Dr. Yokoyama, you've improved.

52
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,413
Thank you.

53
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,095
Don't stop the heart.

54
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,698
The Saeki Method on this case?

55
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,434
I thought he would stop the heart.

56
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,074
We will now proceed
with the on-pump mitral valve surgery.

57
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,478
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

58
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,914
-Debakey.
-Here.

59
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,616
Cooley hook to Dr. Yokoyama.

60
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,924
-Metz scissors.
-Here.

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,797
The method that shook the world.

62
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,000
The Saeki Method.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,601
<i>The Saeki Method.</i>

64
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,739
<i>Unlike traditional heart surgery</i>
<i>that stops the heart,</i>

65
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,942
<i>it is performed while the heart</i>
<i>is still beating.</i>

66
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,511
<i>It reduces the time needed,</i>

67
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,913
<i>and it is easier on the patient.</i>

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,751
<i>It's also said to be</i>
<i>a hundred times more difficult.</i>

69
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,786
<i>He's able to apply stitches</i>

70
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,023
<i>while the heart continues to beat.</i>

71
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,492
Incredible.

72
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,071
Yes?

73
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,778
Here's the Solulact.

74
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,479
-Call Dr. Saeki.
-Okay.

75
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,316
You'll be okay. We've administered the IV.

76
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,851
All ready. Don't worry.

77
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,587
Excuse me, miss.

78
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,759
-Hayata.
-Yes.

79
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,170
All set.

80
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,474
Mr. Miyazaki has experienced
an aortic dissection.

81
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,643
He's scheduled for tomorrow.

82
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,081
Miyazaki? His tissue is weak.
Take him to Operating Room three.

83
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,117
-I'll go there soon.
-You're going to operate?

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,053
This surgery lasts three more hours.
Should we ask someone else?

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,856
We have visitors today. Don't make a fuss.

86
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,926
Dr. Yokoyama, you go.
Take over until I get there.

87
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,897
Understood.
This is a crucial operation for you.

88
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,966
-Leave it to me.
-Thanks.

89
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,535
-Dr. Kakitani, be the lead assistant.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,537
-Hayata.
-Yes?

91
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,574
Prepare the intercom
and monitor for Room three.

92
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,176
<i>Dr. Yokoyama is my supervisor,</i>

93
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,579
<i>and as Dr. Saeki's top pupil,</i>

94
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,581
<i>he is expected to take his place.</i>

95
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,482
ROOM 3

96
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,418
Did you get the pump? Pick up the pace.

97
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,222
Dr. Sera, go help in Operating Room three.

98
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,990
Understood.

99
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,029
What's all the fuss? Did something happen?

100
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,265
No problem at all.

101
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,735
Please observe
Professor Saeki's operation.

102
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,973
-We're here.
-You're late.

103
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,041
-Forgive us.
-Get the valve.

104
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,010
-Yes, sir.
-You two, camera on.

105
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,311
Right.

106
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,947
Get Dr. Saeki on the line.

107
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,216
Understood. Excuse me.

108
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,052
-We're at 24 milliliters.
-You're connected now.

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,655
<i>This is Dr. Yokoyama. Take a look.</i>

110
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,224
<i>We've halted circulation.</i>

111
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,097
-So, it was an aortic dissection.
-All right.

112
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,432
Scalpel.

113
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:17,103
Dr. Saeki is monitoring a second surgery
as he performs his own.

114
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,872
He's superhuman.

115
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,007
<i>Observe.</i>

116
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,911
There's a tear in the ascending aorta.

117
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,580
-Replace it, Yokoyama.
<i>-Understood.</i>

118
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,682
We'll now apply prosthesis.

119
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,251
-It's on you.
-Understood.

120
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,521
-Intercom.
-Right away.

121
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,956
-Monitor off.
-Okay.

122
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,357
-Sound up.
-Okay.

123
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,394
<i>-And now the real fun begins.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

124
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,129
<i>Suction.</i>

125
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,833
<i>Be careful with the Cooley hook.</i>
<i>Yes, like that.</i>

126
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,168
Next, we perform the aortic replacement.

127
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,606
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir!

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,615
It's PSVT.

129
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,055
-Should we halt the operation?
-Calm down.

130
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,124
We'll continue like this.

131
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,697
Continue the surgery?
With heart contractions like that?

132
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,232
You don't need to worry.

133
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,902
Dr. Saeki does not make mistakes.

134
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,904
He knows exactly what he's doing.

135
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,740
No mistakes, you say?

136
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,175
It's a matter of discipline.

137
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,779
Dr. Saeki is the only man on earth
who's able to perform the Saeki Method.

138
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,883
The only one.

139
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,293
How's Dr. Yokoyama doing?

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,796
We should be getting a signal
from the doctor.

141
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,768
May I be excused for a moment?

142
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,005
Aortal replacement complete.

143
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,973
-Reduce blood flow.
-Right.

144
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,642
Blood flow reduced.

145
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,377
Blockage removed.

146
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,485
The heart is beating again.

147
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,199
-Transfusion!
-We need albumin.

148
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,301
Can we stop the heart?

149
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,504
I was given orders to perform aortal
replacement. It should be fine.

150
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,705
Can we contact the doctor?

151
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,374
He's in the middle of surgery.

152
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,510
Transfusion, hurry.

153
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,212
-Interns, transfusion.
-Okay!

154
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,349
Stop the blood! More gauze!

155
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,187
It's not there.
Go to the transfusion room.

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,156
-Four packs of RBC.
-Got it!

157
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:52,959
Miwa.

158
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,560
Get the Cooley hook.

159
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,064
The Cooley hook?

160
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,403
This is not the time to sleep.

161
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,839
Wake up.

162
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,242
-Room three!
-Right!

163
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,269
Dr. Saeki in operating room one.

164
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,739
In room three…

165
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,280
<i>-More! More! Hurry!</i>
<i>-All right!</i>

166
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,549
<i>Where is it leaking from? Here?</i>

167
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,985
<i>Where's my transfusion?</i>

168
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,454
That's what's going on.

169
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,062
-Transfusion is ready!
-Hurry!

170
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,931
There's no pressure. We're losing blood.

171
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,068
There's too much blood!
I can't locate the source!

172
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,405
This is Dr. Saeki's patient.
If you let him die…

173
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,809
Do you think I don't know that?

174
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,178
We have to call the professor.

175
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,320
We can't let Teika University
see what we've done here!

176
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,488
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

177
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,559
-More suction!
-Okay!

178
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,262
It's ventricular fibrillation!

179
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,197
Get me the DC.

180
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,665
-Right away.
-Right away.

181
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,735
Nekota…

182
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,872
The tubes, hurry.

183
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,075
Should we call… him?

184
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,681
-He can't be trusted.
-But…

185
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,317
He's the only one who can help us!

186
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,620
You know what will happen
if we rely on a man like that.

187
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,689
A man like that?

188
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,131
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

189
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,934
<i>-If it means getting the help we need--</i>
<i>-Quiet!</i>

190
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,902
Stay back, Intern!

191
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,042
Nekota, the Cooley hook.

192
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,280
Nekota! I have no use for that!

193
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,660
Tokai…

194
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,647
Who called him?

195
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,150
Was it you?

196
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,485
-Gown.
-Yes, right.

197
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,099
Out of my way.

198
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,875
What are you doing here?

199
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,378
You're not needed here. Get out!

200
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,481
Why have you only done
an aortal replacement?

201
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,751
Come on, tell me.

202
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,122
-Orders from Dr. Saeki.
-Is that so?

203
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,025
Was leaving a tear
in the base of the heart

204
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,160
an order as well?

205
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,162
What the hell are you saying?

206
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,464
Are you saying there has been a mistake?

207
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,866
A big mistake.

208
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,503
It was the monitor.

209
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,739
He was only looking
at the ascending aorta,

210
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,409
and he missed this tear
at the base of the heart.

211
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,779
He's right. I can't see it.

212
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,814
That why he gave the orders…

213
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,218
The problem lies with the surgeon
who has continued operating,

214
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,820
blindly following orders without checking

215
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,622
for damage at the base of the heart.

216
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,558
Did you just want to save face?

217
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,829
Instead, your foolish mistake
has made the situation much worse.

218
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,433
This is what happens
when ignorant doctors take up the knife.

219
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,071
Pay me ten million
and I won't tell a soul.

220
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,442
You're kidding.

221
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,411
Ten million? You must be kidding me!

222
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,414
You better resign.

223
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,517
Hand over your severance pay

224
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,488
<i>and I'll make all this disappear.</i>

225
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,564
We still have ventricular fibrillation!

226
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,801
You're running out of time.

227
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,704
Doctor…

228
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,508
-Doctor!
-I know!

229
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,950
Help me… I'm begging you…

230
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,454
Let's reconstruct the base.

231
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,489
-Clamp.
-Here you go.

232
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,026
-You're in my way.
-Sorry.

233
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,397
-Electroscalpel. Prosthesis.
-Yes, sir.

234
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,438
Reconstruction complete. Remove occlusion.

235
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,013
The heart is beating.

236
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,321
Good. Next.

237
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,391
We'll perform
on-pump mitral valve surgery.

238
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,259
-You with the glasses.
-Yes.

239
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,228
You don't mean the Saeki Method?

240
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,530
-Debakey forceps. Cooley hook.
-Right away.

241
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,403
-Can you pull it off?
-How should I know?

242
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,239
But for ten million yen,

243
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,241
I'll give it my best shot.

244
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,614
-Pardon me.
-Okay. Let's begin.

245
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,786
There was only one man capable…

246
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,590
and now there could be two.

247
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,561
Metz scissors.

248
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,599
-Metz.
-Here.

249
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,770
-Removing heart-lung machine.
-Okay.

250
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,706
-Black forceps, please.
-Yes, sir.

251
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,185
Black forceps?

252
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,656
The special surgical forceps
that Dr. Saeki uses to finish operations.

253
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,626
It's like a ritual.

254
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,996
It means the operation was a success.

255
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,466
Dr. Kitajima, go tell the family.

256
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,869
Tell them that Dr. Saeki
used the black forceps.

257
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,943
I'm off to Operating Room three.

258
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,246
-I'll leave you to stop the bleeding.
-Right.

259
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,817
Three hours and ten minutes.

260
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,820
-Faster than usual.
-Yes.

261
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,690
He's like God himself.

262
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,629
Ten million yen it is.

263
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,866
You can finish up.

264
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,503
Move it.

265
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,208
-Take over.
-Okay.

266
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,609
-Take these off.
-Right.

267
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,850
Two hours and fifty minutes…

268
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,558
Tokai.

269
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,772
That was truly something.

270
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,642
I couldn't replicate it if I tried.

271
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,514
A dangerous operation like that…

272
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,453
Director Moriya,
we'll discuss things later.

273
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,354
Right.

274
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,890
Until next time.

275
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,391
Thank you very much.

276
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,263
Dr. Saeki is indeed a skilled surgeon.

277
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,366
But he's just a small-town craftsman.

278
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,171
A man like him can't be entrusted
with the future of Japanese medicine.

279
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm counting on you, Dr. Takashina.

280
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,143
Understood.

281
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,453
So Dr. Yokoyama's transfer
was because of that operation?

282
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,121
That's right.

283
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,890
He was your mentor.

284
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,060
But now, you'll be working with Dr. Tokai.

285
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,831
-This way.
-What?

286
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,867
-As for Dr. Tokai…
-Yes?

287
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,438
He's in that room.
In fact, he lives there.

288
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,240
It's our nap room.

289
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,776
But since Dr. Tokai moved in,
it's like he's made it his own room.

290
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,079
Excuse me.

291
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,657
Pardon me.

292
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,597
What is it?

293
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,867
Taking a nap?

294
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,801
No, I…

295
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,739
You were in the operating room
the other day.

296
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,875
-I was.
-I'm Dr. Sera. An intern.

297
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,747
What kind of person is Dr. Tokai?

298
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,018
It's incredible
that he was able to save that patient.

299
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,720
And using the Saeki Method…

300
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,524
-Taking money--
-Are you going to quit too?

301
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,827
Unskilled doctors are better off dead.

302
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,063
Dr. Tokai, I…

303
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,065
-About Dr. Yokoyama's patient--
-Out of my way.

304
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,035
It's a patient handover request.

305
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,803
Move it.

306
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>Your physician, Dr. Tokai…</i>

307
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,211
He's busy today
and he won't be able to see you.

308
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,113
I see.

309
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,284
<i>My first patient. Ms. Taeko Minagawa.</i>

310
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,188
<i>Her husband died young.</i>
<i>She has no family to visit her.</i>

311
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,991
<i>Diagnosed with mitral regurgitation,</i>

312
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,026
<i>she has to undergo surgery by Dr. Saeki.</i>

313
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,762
<i>Ensuring her peace and comfort</i>

314
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,431
<i>is my duty, above all.</i>

315
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,800
It's almost time for your check-up.

316
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,768
-Here's the machine.
-Thanks.

317
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,271
-I'll take this.
-What?

318
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,207
What is this thing?

319
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,277
-It's the new examination machine.
-What?

320
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,113
Dr. Tokai has asked us
to use this from now on.

321
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,682
Wait a minute.

322
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,718
Hold on. What?

323
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,853
-Don't you know how to use it?
-I…

324
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,122
It's no good.

325
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,861
It's the new trial equipment
Dr. Saeki brought in.

326
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,229
He told you, didn't he?

327
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,765
Not a word. I'm serious.

328
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,569
I mean it.
And then the patients think I'm no good.

329
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,304
You were just unlucky.

330
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,472
About Dr. Tokai…

331
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,407
Apparently, his interns are quitting.

332
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,342
Dropping like flies, one by one.

333
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,077
My condolences.

334
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,817
TOJO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

335
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,720
Yes, this is Dr. Sera.

336
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,191
It's about your operation report
from the other day.

337
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,761
-It's awful.
-What?

338
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:20,098
It says here that Dr. Tokai
took over operations from Dr. Yokoyama

339
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,034
and even performed the Saeki Method.

340
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,837
-That's right.
-Were you even there?

341
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,738
What?

342
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:32,344
They were fixing the conditions
for Dr. Saeki to operate. Nothing more.

343
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,680
-Isn't that right?
-So I heard from Nekota.

344
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,350
-I'm certain of it.
-What?

345
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,185
Got it?

346
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,053
The Saeki Method

347
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,358
is Tojo's groundbreaking
surgical technique

348
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,794
proudly featured
in the <i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>.

349
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,429
And you think

350
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,198
a veteran like Dr. Yokoyama
was pushed aside

351
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,636
by a low-brow surgeon like Tokai?

352
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,539
Impossible.

353
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:02,808
No.

354
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,977
It should never be mentioned.

355
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,448
Rewrite it.

356
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,056
Anything can happen in a place like this.

357
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,896
Dr. Tokai doesn't deal with publications

358
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,832
and he will never be promoted.

359
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,967
As far as rank, he's below even me.

360
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,337
-But…
-But he's good. The best.

361
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,541
We have no choice
but to follow him when operating.

362
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,977
Dr. Saeki knows this too.

363
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,450
This was supposed to be
Dr. Sekikawa's operation.

364
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,719
But it's Dr. Tokai doing the work.

365
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,588
<i>I'll now take a pericardial graft.</i>

366
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,590
<i>-No artificial valves.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

367
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,126
Not using artificial valves?
That's not part of the plan.

368
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,129
I'll do a valve formation
with pericardial graft.

369
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,299
-I decided so just now.
-You can't just…

370
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:05,704
It can heal naturally.
There's no use for artificial material.

371
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:07,439
Right…

372
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,175
<i>My apologies. You're in charge.</i>

373
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,743
<i>Take over.</i>

374
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,280
<i>-No, continue.</i>
<i>-Metz.</i>

375
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,817
Everyone here looks up to Dr. Saeki,

376
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,353
hoping to perform
the Saeki Method one day.

377
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,655
Training tirelessly day after day.

378
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,891
But no one can do it.

379
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,362
That Dr. Tokai can do it so nonchalantly…

380
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,531
Who will allow that?

381
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,070
Countless doctors have quit
because of him.

382
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,340
While his skills save patients,

383
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,676
he kills doctors.

384
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,346
<i>That man is the devil himself.</i>

385
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,986
It was Dr. Tokai's fussing, I presume?

386
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,922
Dr. Yokoyama's relocation.

387
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,223
It was his own choice.

388
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:03,495
Either way, the recent shortage
of personnel in cardiac is undeniable.

389
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,698
While patients increase,
the turnover rate drops.

390
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:11,770
So there's someone
I would like to introduce to you.

391
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,378
What are you planning?

392
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,517
This is Taeko Minagawa.
She's scheduled for mitral valve surgery.

393
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,519
Dr. Saeki will operate.

394
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,721
Dr. Tokai will assist.

395
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,657
Dr. Kakitani will be second assistant.

396
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,361
What's with the tone of voice?
The documents are a mess too.

397
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,997
-Dr. Saeki oversees this surgery.
-Sorry.

398
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,632
Enough.

399
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,568
Go over it again with Dr. Kakitani.

400
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,838
<i>You should be up there, not me.</i>

401
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,240
The editor-in-chief
of the <i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>,

402
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,811
Mr. Hideto Ikenaga, has requested
to observe the operation.

403
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,082
<i>In medical academia,</i>
<i>publishing in journals</i>

404
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,752
<i>can influence the Impact Factor, which</i>
<i>evaluates a doctor's accomplishments.</i>

405
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,755
<i>Among these journals,</i>
<i>the one that holds great influence</i>

406
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,358
<i>is the </i>Japan Surgical Journal<i>.</i>

407
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,761
<i>Its editor-in-chief wields great power,</i>
<i>even in elections.</i>

408
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,830
<i>Dr. Saeki currently leads by six points</i>

409
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:16,935
<i>with an Impact Factor of 77,</i>
<i>while Dr. Nishizaki follows closely at 71.</i>

410
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,504
A visit in preparation for the election?

411
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,874
This could gain Dr. Saeki
significant support.

412
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,909
That concludes my report. Professor.

413
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,747
Lastly, let me make an introduction.

414
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,450
As of yesterday, a new member has joined
our cardiovascular department

415
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,386
and he is here with us today.

416
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,654
Please come in.

417
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,327
Teika University's own Dr. Takashina.

418
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,098
He's an excellent doctor
who has studied medicine in America.

419
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,734
Due to our staff shortage,

420
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,338
Director Moriya has sent him to assist us.

421
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,608
So, Dr. Nishizaki asked for this.

422
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:02,347
Director Moriya will have a spot waiting
for him at Teika when he steps down.

423
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,083
But why bring a known enemy on board?

424
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,785
I'm Dr. Takashina.

425
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,022
I had the opportunity to observe
Dr. Saeki's operation

426
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,691
and I learned a great deal.

427
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,761
To return the favor to you all,

428
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,697
I have something to show you.

429
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,538
It's called the "Snipe."

430
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:31,843
It's a new medical device from America
and is yet to be used in Japan.

431
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,246
Its main application
is mitral valve surgery.

432
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:40,085
The goal is the same as the Saeki Method,
but the process is quite different.

433
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,555
With the flip of a switch,
the device can be used by anyone,

434
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,526
removing the need
for a surgeon's careful hand entirely.

435
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,296
<i>Dr. Saeki's Saeki Method</i>

436
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,667
<i>allows for the repair of the mitral valve</i>
<i>while the heart beats,</i>

437
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,837
<i>significantly reducing surgery time.</i>

438
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,173
<i>Similarly, the Snipe</i>
<i>involves inserting a catheter</i>

439
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,208
<i>from the tip of the heart</i>

440
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,443
<i>while it continues to beat,</i>

441
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,748
<i>replacing the damaged valve</i>
<i>with an artificial one.</i>

442
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,417
<i>Taking one-third the time</i>
<i>of the Saeki Method,</i>

443
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,419
<i>and removing the need</i>
<i>for a heart-lung machine,</i>

444
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,788
<i>this method is unparalleled</i>
<i>in Japanese medicine.</i>

445
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,525
Do you mean by using the Snipe,

446
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,562
the Saeki Method will become unnecessary?

447
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,630
I suppose it does.

448
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,065
How foolish!

449
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,533
Don't make a mockery of Dr. Saeki.

450
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,869
He's the best there is!

451
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,270
I have to ask.

452
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:36,074
Just how many people at Tojo University,
no, in the world,

453
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,177
are able to perform Dr. Saeki's method?

454
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,112
Correct.

455
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,149
Only one.

456
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,951
How useful is that method, then?

457
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,189
The Snipe, however, can be used by anyone.

458
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,092
It's equipped with micro-sensors

459
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,162
for automatic targeting
of the affected areas.

460
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:02,066
Dr. Saeki is indeed praised
for his perfectionism.

461
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,004
And that's exactly the reason
Dr. Saeki is so highly regarded.

462
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,074
This device allows for precision
that is a hundred times greater.

463
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,011
Humans have their limits.

464
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,015
But technology
will continue to evolve forever.

465
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,118
I see now. So that's your plan.

466
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,922
You plan to use the Snipe
to lure away our patients

467
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,326
who come here seeking hope
from the black forceps.

468
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:36,568
Dr. Saeki is only able to save one,
maybe two lives in a single day.

469
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,737
However, the Snipe can be used by anyone.

470
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,674
Think of the thousands of patients

471
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,709
eagerly awaiting your care.

472
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,046
They can receive that care right away
with the Snipe.

473
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,051
There is no longer a need
for the Hand of God.

474
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,531
Geez. Why? What's the reason?

475
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,666
She just doesn't want surgery.

476
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,270
-What should we do?
-Hospitals are full of surprises.

477
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,338
What should we do?

478
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:18,343
Even if the operation
does indeed save my life,

479
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,713
I'm still all alone.

480
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,683
Even if I continue to live--

481
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,085
Don't say that.

482
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,287
You have a chance here.

483
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:34,192
There are thousands of patients
hoping for surgery from Dr. Saeki.

484
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,228
I suppose that's right.

485
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,364
-Yes.
-That's right.

486
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,167
And why should I care?

487
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,071
It's no good.

488
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,917
Ms. Minagawa, what is it?

489
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,719
Ms. Minagawa, are you okay? What's wrong?

490
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,422
Doctor, your orders.

491
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,327
-Your orders, please!
-Right.

492
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,234
-Dopamine, please.
-Okay.

493
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,136
-And get Dr. Tokai!
-Right away.

494
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,806
-No, get Dr. Kakitani.
-He's out right now.

495
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,841
-We need a lead doctor.
-That's you.

496
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,476
Levels dropping.

497
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,411
She's in shock.

498
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,612
Doctor.

499
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,147
Doctor!

500
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,882
Get the respirator!

501
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,684
-Okay.
-Respirator!

502
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,452
Here.

503
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,796
Move it.

504
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,898
Taking over.

505
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,572
It's in. Ambu bag.

506
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,941
-Take over. Hurry.
-Right.

507
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,277
-Prepare ultrasound.
-Okay.

508
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,016
She needs an antibiotic drip.

509
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,851
-Needle, please.
-Right.

510
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,398
Blood pressure stabilized.

511
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,334
-Order a CT scan.
-Right.

512
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,137
-Take it from here.
-Okay.

513
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,207
<i>You did well today.</i>

514
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,642
<i>If that patient had died,</i>

515
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,811
it would have been the end for Tojo.

516
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,952
You are truly serving me well.

517
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,623
That surgery the other day,

518
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,594
was it to save me the burden?

519
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,230
You, somehow,

520
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,367
pulled off the Saeki Method.

521
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,436
What?

522
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,305
What do you mean?

523
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,808
It doesn't matter.

524
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,980
There is only one man

525
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,250
who can use the black forceps.

526
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,966
<i>I often dreamed of it as a kid.</i>

527
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,103
<i>Becoming a doctor, living that life.</i>

528
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,005
Saving patients' lives

529
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,708
with grace, never faltering.

530
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,080
I dreamed of it constantly.

531
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,083
But despite becoming a doctor…

532
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,285
That goes

533
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:49,921
for me too.

534
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,363
It's no good.

535
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,967
Just like Ms. Minagawa says.

536
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,206
Why is the curtain open?

537
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,241
What?

538
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,711
Speaking of,

539
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,115
Ms. Minagawa is always saying…

540
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,184
It's no good.

541
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,802
TAEKO MINAGAWA

542
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,077
MOM

543
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,980
What is it, Mom?

544
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,482
You finally answered.

545
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,918
So, did you get the rice I sent?

546
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,221
I got it. It's too much,
even if I eat it every day.

547
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,390
<i>Don't you have someone to enjoy it with?</i>

548
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,326
No. Just me as usual, unfortunately.

549
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,095
<i>How pitiful.</i>

550
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,530
After all, you're a doctor.

551
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,933
You should be seeing
five to six women regularly.

552
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,602
<i>-Why did you become a doctor?</i>
-Is that why you called?

553
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,938
-I'm hanging up.
<i>-Wait a second.</i>

554
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,275
How is Dr. Saeki doing?

555
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,711
<i>Your father would be proud.</i>

556
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,880
His son is working in the same hospital

557
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,450
as his former colleague.

558
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,587
Work hard for your old man.

559
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,556
Yes.

560
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,625
I'll send more rice.

561
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,993
-Wait.
<i>-Bye.</i>

562
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,580
I live to see another day.

563
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,383
Dr. Sera.

564
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,520
Ms. Minagawa. Would you please come here?

565
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,155
Look.

566
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,159
You've been watching that old tree,

567
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,294
hoping it will bloom, right?

568
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,964
Leaving the curtains open all day.

569
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,274
That sakura tree…

570
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,477
In the year I was born,

571
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,648
it was the very first to bloom.

572
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,285
What? You were born around here?

573
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:39,824
My house was just beyond
that apartment building over there.

574
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,860
-I see.
-I lived there for many years

575
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,296
until I got married and left home.

576
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,634
That sakura tree and I

577
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,904
lived during the same time

578
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,541
through the Showa and Heisei eras.

579
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,647
It bloomed beautifully last year,
but this year…

580
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:08,886
We are at the end of our short lives.

581
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,960
I went and had a look.

582
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,898
It's budding.

583
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,509
It is indeed withering,

584
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,945
but it hasn't given up just yet.

585
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,448
This is not the end.

586
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,117
The tree will bloom again.

587
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,299
I have to see it through

588
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,602
and watch it bloom.

589
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,172
That's right.

590
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,713
Maybe if the tree can do it,

591
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,715
so can I.

592
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,520
You can.

593
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,656
That's right.

594
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,194
<i>The patient was in shock before.</i>

595
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,563
This is not the time to operate.

596
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,365
What are you talking about?

597
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,300
Mr. Ikenaga from the <i>Journal </i>is here.

598
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,003
Do you think postponing
will help us in the election?

599
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,439
We'll be seen as irresponsible.

600
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,775
Operate on a different patient, perhaps?

601
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:41,879
I've already forwarded
the patient's info to Mr. Ikenaga.

602
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,482
What good is it if the patient dies?

603
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,052
The Saeki Method will be difficult
under these conditions.

604
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,089
But the patient
is only going to get worse.

605
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,293
At that point,
we would have to call it off altogether.

606
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,130
Oh, my.

607
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,366
This is quite the dilemma.

608
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:11,776
Dr. Takashina has an idea
about Ms. Minagawa's surgery.

609
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,881
He suggests we use the Snipe
instead of the Saeki Method.

610
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,551
Using a scalpel would cause
too much pain to the patient.

611
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,320
We can reduce that burden with the Snipe.

612
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:27,591
-Perfect conditions to use it.
-What about permission?

613
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,927
What about the Ministry of Health?

614
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:30,995
We must solve that first.

615
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:35,666
We only need permission
from the university's ethics committee.

616
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,902
Which is led by Dr. Saeki.

617
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,672
Do you plan to play into our weakness
and use us as your guinea pigs?

618
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,475
If you're still unsure,
should we call it off?

619
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,378
We couldn't…

620
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,782
We need to think about prioritiies.

621
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:57,121
Stubbornly halt the surgery
and crush Tojo's reputation,

622
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:02,760
or save the patient
and break new ground with the Snipe.

623
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,264
It may indeed bring about
the end of the Saeki Method.

624
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,335
But using the Snipe is our only option
to overcome this problem.

625
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,373
You should consider yourselves lucky
to have my help.

626
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,374
Lucky?

627
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,410
The chance for Tojo University

628
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,614
to introduce this new technology
to the world

629
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,616
is a grand opportunity, right?

630
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,685
We would only be assisting the enemy.

631
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,987
Leaving the surgery to someone else--

632
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,022
We can change the rules, if needed.

633
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,692
I have a motto.

634
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,760
"We must not waste life

635
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,564
being bound by petty rules."

636
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,933
I say…

637
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,705
we accept Dr. Takashina's offer.

638
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,676
We know where our priorities lie.

639
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,512
With our patients.

640
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,015
However, for the sake of our university,

641
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,918
we must not fail this surgery.

642
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,854
Dr. Tokai and I will assist.

643
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,591
Don't be ridiculous.
Having Dr. Tokai assist is fine.

644
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,628
-But you as well, Dr. Saeki?
-It doesn't matter to me.

645
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,297
This operation requires no assistance.

646
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,267
Just in case. Got it, Dr. Tokai?

647
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,335
Doctor's orders.

648
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,539
Just one thing.

649
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,544
If you ask me to take over,
even for a second,

650
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,981
I would like to ask that you submit
your letter of resignation.

651
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,419
What do you think?

652
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,121
What do you say?

653
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,657
Very well.

654
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,227
But, if I succeed…

655
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,330
You, Dr. Tokai,

656
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,300
will be the one resigning.

657
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,869
For Tojo's sake.

658
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,574
Based on what I've heard around,

659
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,277
you're quite the problem child.

660
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:05,916
I'll be there.

661
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,587
You better be too.

662
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,931
In other words, a surgery
that normally takes four hours

663
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,934
will be performed in less than one.

664
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,804
This will greatly reduce
the burden on your body.

665
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,472
I see.

666
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,907
If we have your permission,

667
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,675
please sign here.

668
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,944
Excuse me.

669
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,714
Dr. Sera.

670
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,117
Yes?

671
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,887
I would like to ask for your opinion.

672
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,891
-Me? No, I'm not…
-Answer her,

673
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,527
Dr. Sera.

674
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,807
I think…

675
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,878
you should accept.

676
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:13,751
You'll do great.

677
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,622
Have you made up your mind?

678
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,998
<i>Is this the right thing to do?</i>

679
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,868
What do you think, Dr. Tokai?

680
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,771
Doctor? Doctor.

681
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,340
I'm begging you. Say something.

682
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,042
She's your patient, right?

683
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,377
She's your patient!

684
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,745
-I'm going to change.
-Okay.

685
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,016
Excuse me. You're an intern, right?

686
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,217
That's right.

687
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,653
My name is Kinoshita.

688
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,656
KAORI KINOSHITA

689
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,358
Clinical trial coordinator.

690
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,194
How was the new genetics tester?

691
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,463
That new machine?

692
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,198
-Indeed.
-I see.

693
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,132
CLINICAL TRIAL COORDINATOR

694
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,035
It was a bit confusing at first,
but it worked out…

695
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,937
Thanks for your cooperation.

696
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,005
Sure.

697
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,907
Will you be going there?

698
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,443
-Yes, for a study group.
-Study group?

699
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,945
Pardon me.

700
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,147
All this French cuisine…

701
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,551
What kind of study group is this?

702
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,723
A laser scalpel,
invented by Daiichi Industries.

703
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,726
Utilizing an all-new CO2 laser technology,

704
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,794
allowing for improved incisions.

705
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,063
Just like that.

706
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,936
-Right. I'll try it on a few patients.
-Thank you.

707
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,638
Is it always like this?

708
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,575
-This is a study group.
-"Try it out"?

709
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,943
Patients are people.

710
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,011
They're things.

711
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,781
You…

712
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,318
Don't you have a heart?

713
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,786
Does having a heart…

714
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,288
save lives?

715
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,492
Truly skilled doctors…

716
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,331
can do whatever they want.

717
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,666
It's just like what Dr. Takashina says.

718
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,736
People like you shouldn't be doctors.

719
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,140
I'm leaving.

720
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,077
I'm going home.

721
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,084
-I have a question.
-Yes?

722
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,354
I would like you
to look into something for me.

723
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,430
<i>The fateful day finally arrived,</i>
<i>the day of the surgery.</i>

724
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,534
This way.

725
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,465
Why is Dr. Nishizaki here?

726
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,735
The editor-in-chief requested
that he join us.

727
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,907
Come on… pick up.

728
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,918
This is Taeko Minagawa. Thank you.

729
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,591
Dr. Tokai!

730
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,293
Dr. Tokai!

731
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,318
Isn't Dr. Saeki operating?

732
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:12,222
They'll be revealing a new procedure.

733
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,025
<i>Everyone is here.</i>

734
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,561
<i>Shall we introduce the Snipe?</i>

735
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,029
Snipe?

736
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,233
I'm grateful to be given this opportunity.

737
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,136
Surgery is surgery.
There is no changing that.

738
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,374
By the way,
there's no sign of Dr. Tokai yet.

739
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,079
-Dr. Sera!
-Where's Dr. Tokai?

740
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,648
He's nowhere to be found.

741
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,056
Forgive us. Dr. Tokai is absent.

742
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,293
We're out of time.
Dr. Kakitani will assist instead.

743
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,495
He's a pain in the ass as always.

744
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,097
There's no difference if he's here or not.

745
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,834
And now, Case 847.

746
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,271
Off-pump mitral valve surgery
using the Snipe.

747
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,908
Dr. Sera. Dr. Tokai
wasn't in the other ward.

748
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,843
I'll check the nap room again.

749
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,287
Assistance wasn't necessary after all.

750
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,524
Why don't you sit back and have some tea?

751
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,127
How kind of you.

752
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,099
Have you seen Dr. Tokai?

753
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,469
-He wasn't there.
-Look harder.

754
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,904
-What?
-The sofa.

755
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,372
-The sofa…
-The sofa?

756
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,909
Dr. Tokai! Dr. Tokai!

757
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,113
-What are you doing here? It has started!
-Keep it down.

758
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,349
-Are you afraid of losing the bet?
-What?

759
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,516
Are you running away?

760
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,319
-What the hell?
-Come on. We're going.

761
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,887
NEW MESSAGE
FROM KAORI KINOSHITA

762
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:53,890
What is it?

763
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,629
NOW PRINTING

764
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,366
-Where are you going?
-Move it.

765
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,805
Nekota, bring the document
to Dr. Kurosaki and the professor.

766
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:09,706
-Okay.
-Not from me.

767
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,774
Got it.

768
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,181
Let us introduce the Snipe.

769
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,289
Professor Nishizaki. Let's begin.

770
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,624
So that's the Snipe?

771
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,728
My pupil brought it back from America.

772
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,869
-This was just delivered.
-What is it?

773
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,546
Dr. Tokai, hurry!

774
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,794
The Snipe has entered the heart's apex.

775
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,864
<i>Through the left ventricle.</i>

776
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,249
<i>Almost at the mitral valve.</i>

777
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,124
This is Kurosaki.
Stop the operation, please.

778
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,860
What's the issue?

779
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,397
I've just received
new information on the Snipe.

780
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:44,501
According to these documents,
a number of problems have occurred

781
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,736
during Snipe surgeries in America.

782
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,673
Including death.

783
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,349
Excuse me. Professor, read this.

784
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,451
<i>This is news to me.</i>

785
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,387
<i>Dr. Takashina,</i>
<i>did you withhold information</i>

786
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,090
<i>from us and the patients?</i>

787
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,328
-What's this about?
-It's true there have been incidents.

788
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,763
We've looked into it.

789
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,765
Who told you?

790
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:23,740
Tokai.

791
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,143
Sorry, I'm late.

792
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,513
I see. So this was your doing.

793
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,781
-Nurse.
-Hayata.

794
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,783
Yes.

795
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,558
Why now? We're almost finished here.

796
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,895
I'll take over.
Take your little toy and get out.

797
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,031
She has no strength.
If we stop now, she'll die.

798
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,568
The professor and I will take over.
There's still time.

799
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,071
You plan to do the Saeki Method?

800
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,409
-The Snipe is safer.
-That thing has killed people.

801
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,146
This tool has a future
in saving thousands of lives.

802
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,082
Forget the future. I'm talking about now!

803
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,485
The Snipe is her only hope.

804
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,455
It will succeed. I have no doubt.

805
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,360
Continue the surgery.

806
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,064
Use the Snipe.

807
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,501
Dr. Tokai,
this is Dr. Takashina's operation.

808
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,536
I take full responsibility.

809
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,039
-Volume up.
-Yes, sir.

810
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,010
<i>Let us continue.</i>

811
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,112
Professor!

812
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,248
We're already finished.

813
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,084
A new era begins now.

814
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,491
Professor Nishizaki. We did it.

815
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,026
Excuse me.

816
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,866
Dr. Tokai, about the Snipe documents…

817
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,734
It was her, right?

818
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,238
The coordinator you met yesterday.

819
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,974
Well…

820
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,011
Are you really going to leave?

821
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,280
-Why?
-What?

822
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,082
It will be him who leaves.

823
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,551
What?

824
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,287
We saw the Snipe succeed.

825
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,124
You lost the bet.

826
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,028
You'll see soon enough.

827
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,969
Are you awake? The operation is all done.

828
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,638
It's a success.

829
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:46,142
You can rest without worry.

830
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,580
Where's Dr. Sera?

831
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,315
Dr. Sera?

832
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,516
What do you mean?

833
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,587
I'm telling you.
That old woman is going to die soon.

834
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,022
What? Why?

835
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,060
-What is it, Ms. Minagawa?
-It hurts…

836
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,930
-Where does it hurt?
-Here…

837
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,465
Why do you say that?

838
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,469
-What do you mean she'll die?
-Keep it down.

839
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,504
-What do you mean?
-Move it.

840
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:22,979
This.

841
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,786
A rookie like you wouldn't understand.

842
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,389
-Dr. Takashina.
-Hang in there.

843
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,391
He didn't do his homework.

844
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,532
-Dr. Sera!
-I told you.

845
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,435
-Is Dr. Sera there?
-Yes.

846
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,037
-Dr. Sera! Dr. Sera!
-Yes!

847
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:51,141
You have to hurry.
Ms. Minagawa is in pain.

848
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,109
Okay.

849
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,044
-Call the operating room.
-Right!

850
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,891
-Ms. Minagawa!
-It's only a little pain.

851
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,459
Painkillers.

852
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,664
-Ms. Minagawa.
-Dr. Sera!

853
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,301
-Are you okay?
-It hurts, doctor.

854
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,937
Hang in there, Ms. Minagawa.

855
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,205
Ms. Minagawa!

856
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,508
Dr. Sera…

857
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,779
-What's this?
-It's her CT scan results.

858
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,617
An aneurysm?

859
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,321
-Her spleen could burst.
-It already has.

860
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,459
She has abdominal hemorrhaging.

861
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,062
Ms. Minagawa.

862
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,497
-Call Dr. Saeki!
-Right.

863
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:51,234
-Ms. Minagawa.
-A hemorrhage? Why?

864
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,970
The operation was perfect.

865
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:55,872
On her heart, yes.

866
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,274
But that's all you saw.

867
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,211
Replacing bad valves with new ones.

868
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,280
You should know
that it can cause other issues.

869
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,082
That's why I had to stop you.

870
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,187
The case files had a similar story. Death.

871
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,891
You saw it, didn't you?

872
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,062
Before the surgery,

873
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,565
you saw her CT scan, didn't you?

874
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,902
You thought it was safe
to replace the valves.

875
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,510
If this woman dies, so do you.

876
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,651
I see. But that's your patient.

877
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,587
I'll leave it up to you.

878
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,129
Is there a problem?

879
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,266
It's nothing.

880
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,112
Hang in there, Ms. Minagawa.

881
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,246
Hang in there.

882
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,982
-Thank you.
-Yes.

883
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,988
-Here she is.
-One, two, three!

884
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,727
We'll perform emergency surgery.

885
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,896
-What's her blood pressure?
-Sixty.

886
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,565
-Antibiotics.
-Right.

887
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,666
-Drapes, too.
-Okay.

888
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:37,974
Electroscalpel.

889
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,355
There's too much blood. Suction!

890
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,656
More gauze!

891
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,025
-Transfusion!
-Right!

892
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,428
-Transfusion! Gauze!
-On it!

893
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,696
Bring gauze!

894
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,766
Damn it. She's losing too much blood!

895
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,002
-Gauze!
-Here.

896
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:07,704
Transfusion ready.

897
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,839
It's too late.

898
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:13,776
Gauze!

899
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:19,682
Blood pressure 50.

900
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,820
-Four-zero.
-Right.

901
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,038
Doctor…

902
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,015
Doctor!

903
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,524
Are you ready to give up?

904
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,133
Cough up your severance pay

905
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,735
and I'll help.

906
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:16,272
What are you talking about?
At a time like this!

907
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,810
Can't you see this?
She's losing too much blood.

908
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:24,147
If we don't stop the bleeding, she'll die!

909
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,953
Then do it yourself!

910
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,239
Damn it!

911
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:52,875
Gauze!

912
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,898
How much do you want?

913
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,802
What will it take for your help?

914
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,474
That woman is my patient.

915
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,977
Hoping to see the sakura bloom,

916
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,148
she believed me and accepted surgery.

917
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:38,154
It's my obligation as a doctor
to save her.

918
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,057
But…

919
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:43,693
But, I…

920
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,730
I'm a doctor, but I can't do anything.

921
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,637
As much as it hurts to say,
you're the only one who can help.

922
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,141
If it's money that you want,
I'll pay for it myself.

923
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,677
I'm begging you. Help this woman.

924
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,246
Please!

925
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,181
Please!

926
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,850
Please!

927
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,686
Please!

928
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:13,856
Please!

929
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,126
Please!

930
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,163
I'm begging you!

931
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,370
We don't have time. You'll help me.

932
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,109
He has no surgical experience!

933
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,748
-I'll do it.
-Wash your hands.

934
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,483
Yes, sir.

935
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,121
I see. So Dr. Tokai is taking over.

936
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,657
Understood.

937
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,425
Forgive me.

938
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,401
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

939
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,440
-Suction, hurry!
-Blood pressure 50!

940
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,008
-A big needle!
-Twenty-six.

941
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,743
-Put it in there!
-Right!

942
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,078
-More suction!
-Okay.

943
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,179
-More!
-Okay.

944
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,782
-Metz! Hold this.
-Twenty-six milliliters.

945
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:16,018
Blood pressure down to 49.
Getting lower.

946
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,187
Doctor, I can't find the wound.

947
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,824
Then why don't you
take the whole thing out?

948
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,536
-Hold it.
-What?

949
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,738
-Hold it!
-Yes, sir!

950
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:36,706
Hurry!

951
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,176
Needle.

952
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,431
-Metz.
-Right.

953
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,703
-Bleeding stopped.
-Blood pressure stabilized.

954
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:10,273
Sixty.

955
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:12,909
Seventy.

956
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:14,477
One hundred million.

957
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:16,946
What?

958
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,314
Until you pay me off,

959
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:23,819
you're stuck here working for me.

The splenic artery.

You knew, right?

964
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:34,457
But you let Dr. Takashina
use the Snipe anyway.

965
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,728
You expected it all along.

966
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,738
I suspect Takashina
will lie low for a while now.

967
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,612
You've done well, Tokai.

968
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,015
You truly are

969
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,218

01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,867
DOCTOR: ICHIRO TOKAI

973
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:53,769
Surgery is a gamble.

974
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,038
You live or you die.

975
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,773
I'm scared. Is that wrong?

976
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,741
<i>Do it.</i>

977
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,443
<i>You want to prove yourself, right?</i>

978
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,377
<i>Tomorrow…</i>

979
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,879
<i>Japanese medicine will change forever.</i>

980
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,382
<i>Will it be me who leaves? Or you?</i>

981
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,652
Everything is as I expected.

982
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,888
<i>Please come.</i>
<i>The patient is fighting for his life.</i>

983
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,323
<i>Just quit.</i>

984
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,324
And get out.

985
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:16,792
