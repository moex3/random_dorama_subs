1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:05,972
You better resign.

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,744
Hand over your severance pay
and I'll make all this disappear.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,712
<i>Dr. Seishiro Tokai.</i>

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,016
<i>Forcing doctors to resign and taking</i>
<i>their money. The devil himself.</i>

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,451
<i>And now he's my mentor.</i>

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,288
<i>I am working as an intern here.</i>

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,324
<i>At Tojo University Hospital.</i>

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,493
<i>Here, our cardiac surgeon,</i>
<i>Professor Saeki,</i>

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>performs surgeries without stopping</i>
<i>the heart with his Saeki Method.</i>

10
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,267
<i>It's a procedure not seen</i>
<i>anywhere else in the world.</i>

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>He and Dr. Nishizaki of Teika University</i>
<i>are in fierce competition of Impact Factor</i>

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,274
<i>for the position of Chairman.</i>

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,510
<i>Together with his pupil, Dr. Takashina,</i>

14
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,279
<i>he brought a new surgical tool, the Snipe.</i>

15
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,283
There is no longer a need
for the Hand of God.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,153
<i>Japan's very first Snipe operation</i>

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,455
<i>was performed on my patient.</i>

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,224
<i>The operation was a success</i>

19
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>and proved the Snipe's ability</i>
<i>to replace the need for human hands.</i>

20
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,332
<i>Soon after,</i>
<i>the patient took a turn for the worse.</i>

21
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>Dr. Takashina found himself</i>
<i>in a hopeless situation.</i>

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,071
Damn it!

23
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,240
<i>That's when Dr. Tokai arrived.</i>

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,178
I'm begging you. Help this woman. Please!

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,781
<i>But Dr. Tokai doesn't help out others</i>
<i>for free.</i>

26
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,283
One hundred million.

27
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,851
Until you pay me off,

28
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,187
you're stuck here working for me.

29
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>If Dr. Tokai hadn't been there,</i>

30
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,961
<i>Ms. Minagawa would have died.</i>

31
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,798
<i>There was nothing I could do.</i>

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,568
<i>I could have caused</i>

33
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,503
<i>my own patient's death.</i>

34
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,084
Who cares about the Snipe?

35
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,953
It's just a kid's toy.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,422
<i>After the Snipe operation,</i>

37
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>Dr. Takashina's standing at Tojo</i>

38
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,826
<i>took a turn for the worse.</i>

39
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,468
If the patient had died,

40
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,438
our image would have been spoiled forever.

41
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,142
What did he even come here for?
The trouble he caused…

42
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,146
He's not a doctor.
Just a lowly Snipe salesman.

43
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,381
-You nailed it.
-Right?

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,283
Out of my way.

45
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,889
Oh, excuse me.

46
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,391
Keep it down. I can't sleep.

47
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,360
Right…

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,464
I assume you're all able
to perform mitral surgery, right?

49
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,334
That salesman did it and succeeded.

50
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,409
What are you planning?

51
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,448
You want me to thank you?

52
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,618
Let me sleep.

53
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,957
<i>Ms. Minagawa underwent the procedure,</i>
<i>but the paper's publication was delayed.</i>

54
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:16,462
<i>This also had a large influence</i>
<i>in the fight for Impact Factor.</i>

55
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,131
Because of Dr. Takashina,

56
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,035
the Impact Factor we were hoping for
is out the window.

57
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,102
Don't worry.

58
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,473
Besides,
Japan's first Snipe surgery was a success.

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,976
We'll complete more cases in Japan

60
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,580
and submit a paper concerning
its high success rate.

61
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,581
Right.

62
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,583
We have the election
to think about as well,

63
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,552
so this will all work in our favor.

64
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,621
The most important thing now

65
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,657
is our Impact Factor.

66
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,931
A doctor's world is so mysterious.

67
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,032
Hmm?

68
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,537
From the patient's perspective,
a good doctor is one who can cure them.

69
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,906
But from your side,

70
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,409
a good doctor is one
who can write a good paper.

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,047
Why did you choose this restaurant?

72
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,149
Because it has a Michelin star.

73
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,385
It's the same for us.

74
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,756
This restaurant's value
is decided by one man's opinion.

75
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,993
It's a stressful reality,
but it's what everyone wants.

76
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,262
It must seem foolish from the outside.

77
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,330
Regardless,

78
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,699
all doctors strive for Impact Factor,

79
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,534
fighting for it in a blind rage.

80
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,638
It decides a doctor's worth. Their future.

81
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,574
In fact, it determines their entire life.

82
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,144
Is that also true
for the election for Chairman?

83
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,705
You scared me.

84
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,641
-Please excuse me.
-It's okay.

85
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,278
Here are the items for today's duty.

86
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,415
-Thank you.
-Forgive me.

87
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,583
You're still here practicing.

88
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
"Practice makes perfect."

89
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,757
Pelé's words.

90
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,459
Pelé?

91
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,262
Yes, the soccer star.

92
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,231
-That's Pelé.
-Okay.

93
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,568
-I see.
-Sorry.

94
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,903
No, forgive me.

95
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,276
It was frustrating.

96
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,980
Not being able to do anything back there.

97
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,020
I have to prove myself to Dr. Tokai.

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,225
I'll do my best
to become fully qualified too.

99
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,028
-Good night.
-Good night.

100
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,672
Okay.

101
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:32,859
Hello.

102
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,027
<i>Emergency transport</i>
<i>from Sakuranomiya Hospital.</i>

103
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,131
Male, sixties. Abdominal aortic aneurysm
about to rupture.

104
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,767
We believe he needs emergency surgery.

105
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,971
He's a mitral valve surgery patient,
scheduled for next month.

106
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,273
<i>-We're taking him to OR one.</i>
-Understood.

107
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,342
I'll tell Dr. Tokai.

108
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,678
Dr. Tokai.

109
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,782
-The cardiac surgeon has been contacted.
-Take him in.

110
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,783
Dr. Tokai.

111
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,626
Honey! Hang in there!

112
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,362
-We'll take over.
-Thank you.

113
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,164
Please, no.

114
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,366
Where are you?

115
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,103
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,373
-One, two, three.
-I'm taking off your glasses.

117
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,809
Damn it!

118
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,684
<i>Dr. Tokai isn't here.</i>
<i>I have to do it myself.</i>

119
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,554
<i>Calm down. I know the procedure.</i>

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,522
<i>I've practiced countless times.</i>

121
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,325
<i>Remove the renal vein</i>
<i>if bleeding is controlled.</i>

122
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,661
<i>Dislocate below the renal artery.</i>

123
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,363
<i>Then I'll have to block</i>
<i>the abdominal aorta.</i>

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,299
<i>And then… next…</i>

125
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>Impossible.</i>

126
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,272
<i>I can't do it.</i>

127
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,946
Spatula.

128
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,218
-Gauze.
-What are you doing?

129
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,453
-Bring the gauze.
-Sorry.

130
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,688
Hurry up.

131
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,491
Yes, sir!

132
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,726
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

133
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,529
Um, they're operating at this hour?

134
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,031
There was an emergency patient.

135
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,167
Dr. Tokai is operating.

136
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,805
-Suction.
-Okay.

137
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,274
-Don't mess up.
-Sorry.

138
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,809
-Deeper.
-Yes, sorry.

139
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,877
Metz.

140
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,785
Right prosthesis done. Next is left.

141
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
-Four-zero.
-Okay.

142
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,261
-I'm done.
-What?

143
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,099
Doctor, the left stitches…

144
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,367
Do it yourself.

145
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,437
-What?
-"Practice makes perfect."

146
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,740
You want to be Pelé, right?

147
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,311
-I…
-An old athlete like that…

148
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,581
-You don't know him, do you?
-I, well…

149
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,716
-It's just…
-Do it.

150
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,554
-You want to prove yourself, right?
-It's not like that.

151
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,661
-Dr. Sera…
-Hey, intern. Are you okay?

152
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,696
Those are my orders. Any problem?

153
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,498
No… Sorry.

154
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,847
Okay.

155
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,850
<i>Calm down.</i>

156
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,619
<i>They're only stitches.</i>

157
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,888
<i>I've practiced for this.</i>

158
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,836
Gauze!

159
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,139
Gauze! If we don't stop the bleeding,
she'll die!

160
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,326
Okay.

161
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,638
Metz, please.

162
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,572
Here.

163
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:46,912
I did it.

164
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,182
-Dr. Tokai.
-Forceps out.

165
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,917
Okay.

166
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,532
-Bring more gauze.
-Right.

167
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:09,835
Give me that.

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,975
You've killed a person.

169
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,344
No, sorry.

170
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,613
You've killed two.

171
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,919
Get out.

172
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,874
How dare you make light
of a patient's life.

173
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,043
Oh, you were watching?

174
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,145
Then why not do it yourself?

175
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,867
<i>I've got my training report.</i>

176
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,136
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

177
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,343
REPORT FORMS

178
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,649
<i>"Training relocation request form…"</i>

179
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,091
TRAINING RELOCATION REQUEST FORM

180
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,698
Dr. Sera!

181
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,201
Come with me, please.

182
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,436
Mr. Koyama is trying to leave
the hospital.

183
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,371
Coming.

184
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,207
-Listen to me!
-Excuse me.

185
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,111
Doctor. My husband won't listen
and he says he's leaving.

186
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,948
I'm losing business deals left and right
because I collapsed.

187
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,618
-If I stay here, my factory will go under.
-Please relax.

188
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,922
-Please, I won't overdo it.
-You leaving is overdoing it.

189
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,026
They told me
my something-something valve is no good,

190
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,562
but I'm telling you, I'm totally fine.

191
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,864
That's a separate issue.

192
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,867
You still need to undergo surgery
to fix the underlying issue.

193
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:59,505
-As soon as possible.
-I don't have time for surgery.

194
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,374
I have deadlines coming up.
Let me out of here.

195
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,009
-Sir, you see…
-Go ahead.

196
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,879
-I can go?
-Dr. Tokai…

197
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,783
If you leave now,
you'll die before you make any deadlines.

198
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,853
And even if you decide to stay here,

199
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,555
you'll be dead in a month anyway.

200
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,558
Isn't there something we can do?
Won't surgery fix it?

201
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,895
-We won't know unless we try.
-Unless you try?

202
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,330
Surgery is a gamble.

203
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,601
In the end, it's a 50-50 chance.

204
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,171
Heads or tails, you live or…

205
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,506
you die.

206
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,142
We won't know unless we try.

207
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,948
And if you still want to leave,

208
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,384
tell this guy.

209
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,794
We're scheduled to perform
aortic valve surgery this weekend.

210
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,798
That concludes the case report.
Any questions?

211
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,371
-If not…
-Excuse me.

212
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,240
What is it?

213
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,412
It's about Mr. Koyama,
the emergency patient in Room 403…

214
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,382
The patient who needs
mitral valve surgery?

215
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,283
Yes.

216
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:22,288
I just got word from the family
that they wish to undergo surgery.

217
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,725
You are aware that Dr. Saeki's schedule
is packed for the next two months.

218
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,728
We'll look into scheduling a date.

219
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,163
Thank you.

220
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,370
And when will that date be decided?

221
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,841
This patient might die tomorrow
and you can't make time for him?

222
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,911
Why not operate right away, Dr. Saeki?

223
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,214
Don't be rude.
We have many similar patients.

224
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,717
We can't play favorites.

225
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:57,323
But as a hospital, we simply can't afford
to allow our patients to die.

226
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,825
This is a problem.

227
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,830
Why not leave the patient with me?

228
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,268
-With you?
-I would like to perform Snipe surgery.

229
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,406
-Snipe surgery?
-That last patient almost died.

230
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,375
You've hardly used it.
How could you do it?

231
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,345
Who will take responsibility this time?

232
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,781
I will… take responsibility.

233
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,086
Ms. Minagawa's condition changed rapidly.

234
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,623
But that was a problem
separate from the mitral valve.

235
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,993
The Snipe showed no issues.

236
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,296
Regardless,
you still endangered the patient.

237
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,064
Forgive me for talking back,

238
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,635
but her condition wouldn't allow
for the Saeki method either.

239
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,905
Ms. Minagawa's life was saved,

240
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,575
thanks to the Snipe.

241
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,878
And she's not the only one.

242
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,246
By using the Snipe,

243
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,783
anyone can perform mitral valve surgery.

244
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,219
We can save more lives.

245
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,721
Change the rules if necessary.

246
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,691
Let's leave our petty criticisms behind

247
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,594
and work together.

248
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,666
Understood.

249
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,468
Go ahead.

250
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,538
Let us look past the last time.

251
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,208
Let's use the Snipe.
For the patient's sake.

252
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,280
Thank you. I'll get started right away.

253
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,649
There is just one condition.

254
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,951
Condition?

255
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,655
We let someone else perform the surgery.

256
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,060
You will not be allowed
in the operating room either.

257
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,696
What is your objective?

258
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,633
I believe you mentioned before

259
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,937
that with the Snipe,
anyone can perform mitral valve surgery.

260
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,542
So there should be no problem
in having our doctors give it a try.

261
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,644
That is true, but…

262
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,345
If your dream is realized,

263
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,749
and the Snipe becomes
the standard for Japanese surgery,

264
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,185
do you plan to be there to watch each one?

265
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,653
In other words,

266
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,722
this next surgery
is your dream coming true.

267
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,326
There's still time to back out
if you're uncertain.

268
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,732
Very well. I believe in the Snipe.

269
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,001
Then it's decided.

270
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,206
Now, who shall perform the surgery?

271
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,913
Hey, what are you doing?

272
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,723
Right. Let's have him do it.

273
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,459
You want to ask Sera?

274
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,230
-He's just an intern.
-You said anyone can use it.

275
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,333
Do you want to take back
what you just said?

276
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,737
I said it can be used by any surgeon.

277
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,939
Interns are not surgeons.

278
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,009
Please select someone with experience.

279
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,044
I was being hypothetical.

280
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,481
We'll leave the operation staff
to Dr. Kurosaki.

281
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,416
-Understood.
-Dr. Takashina,

282
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,919
get the patient's consent
for Snipe surgery.

283
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,522
-Understood.
-Do your best.

284
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,298
I seriously thought it would be Sera.

285
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,968
Cut it out.
It was just the professor joking around.

286
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,739
I would have been happy
even if it were a joke.

287
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,909
It seems like the professor
really likes you.

288
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,179
-Sera.
-Yes?

289
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,747
Can I talk to you?

290
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,782
Of course.

291
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,352
<i>Mr. Koyama was unwilling</i>
<i>to undergo Snipe surgery.</i>

292
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,457
Isn't there some way we can see Dr. Saeki?

293
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,127
The doctor's schedule is full.

294
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,530
So you're telling me
you want me to be a guinea pig

295
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,098
for that Snipe thing?

296
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,601
That's not what we mean.

297
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,703
Doctor.

298
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,976
I've brought our coordinator
to explain things in further detail.

299
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,079
Listen to her. Please come in.

300
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,885
Nice to meet you. My name is Kinoshita,
I'm a clinical trial coordinator.

301
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:24,389
-But why?
-She's an outstanding coordinator.

302
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll do my best to provide
the information you need

303
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,395
to put your worries to rest.

304
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,799
Let me start by explaining the situation.

305
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,335
<i>The Snipe is still in clinical trial.</i>

306
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,405
<i>The coordinator works</i>
<i>with the developer in America,</i>

307
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,041
<i>Tojo University's testing facilities,</i>

308
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,011
<i>and the patients themselves.</i>

309
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,046
<i>Research funds are given</i>

310
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,449
<i>by the developer to Tojo University,</i>

311
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,952
<i>as well as to the accepting patient.</i>

312
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,155
<i>This is called the "burden reduction fee."</i>

313
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,791
Please submit it promptly.

314
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,095
I hear you are in need of urgent care.

315
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:09,968
Three million yen?

316
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:14,373
Given to the patient by that coordinator
who comes here often.

317
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,174
She lives up to her shrewd reputation.

318
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,878
So that means
the Snipe surgery is a go, right?

319
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,560
Pardon me. I brought a souvenir.

320
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,031
Oh, no. Did we get the same thing?

321
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,769
<i>Daifuku </i>from Mizuho? Don't mind if I do.

322
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,771
You've heard of them, have you?

323
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,707
One of Tokyo's best bean <i>daifuku</i> shops.

324
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,777
About Mr. Koyama…

325
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,346
It seems he has accepted
the Snipe surgery.

326
00:21:55,514 --> 00:22:00,552
It is my duty to ensure
all parties profit from the situation.

327
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,488
I was able to negotiate twenty million

328
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,758
for your team's participation
in the trial.

329
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,329
That should benefit you as well, I think.

330
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,565
That is true.

331
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:18,537
But it also means you'll be doing
Dr. Nishizaki from Teika a favor as well.

332
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,908
When the results
of the Snipe surgery are published,

333
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,744
Dr. Nishizaki,
being in charge of the research,

334
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,447
will see his Impact Factor
grow significantly.

335
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,216
I'm sure it will also gain him

336
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,985
many votes in the election for Chairman.

337
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:38,390
Yes, but if research continues
without positive results,

338
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,727
Tojo will continue
to get research funding.

339
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,729
One man's failure

340
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,897
is another man's success.

341
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,668
Be it Impact Factor or money.

342
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,405
And I…

343
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,842
enjoy the fruits of their labor.

344
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,177
That's all.

345
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,181
I do have my doubts,

346
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,218
but it sounds like this is the only way.

347
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,954
Thanks to you, I'm finally ready.

348
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,423
Dear…

349
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,725
It's fine. Let's stay positive.

350
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,428
I get free surgery and even reward money.

351
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,830
I can pay off my debts.

352
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,166
What could be better?

353
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,501
Even so…

354
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,138
We'll give you full support
until the operation.

355
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,539
Please be at ease.

356
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,075
Excuse me. I'll feel your abdomen.

357
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,412
Pardon me.

358
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,983
You've killed a person.

359
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,055
Dr. Sera.

360
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,258
Sorry.

361
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,305
TRAINING RELOCATION REQUEST FORM
MASASHI SERA

362
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,141
Sera. Come here, please.

363
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,109
Coming.

364
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,984
<i>We received Mr. Koyama's consent</i>

365
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,787
<i>and selected the operation staff.</i>

366
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,956
I will now announce the staff.

367
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,092
Operating surgeon, Sekikawa.

368
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:23,895
Understood.

369
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,832
First assistant, Kakitani.

370
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes, sir.

371
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,202
Second assistant…

372
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,238
Sera.

373
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,906
-What?
-Dr. Sera?

374
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,807
Really?

375
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,142
Your answer?

376
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,344
Understood.

377
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,480
You may have your opinions,

378
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,649
but we won't accept failure
at Tojo University.

379
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:49,254
The selected members will begin
the preparation for surgery tomorrow.

380
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,188
That's all.

381
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,327
Dr. Kurosaki, please wait.

382
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,596
Why me?

383
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,164
It's your patient, right?

384
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,133
And being the one Dr. Saeki selected,

385
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,902
we can't leave you out.

386
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,204
Think of it as training.

387
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,011
In three days,
we will perform a Snipe surgery.

388
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,247
The operating nurse will be Nekota.

389
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,183
I will also ask Miyamoto and Hanabusa.

390
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,686
You newcomers need real-world experience.

391
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,424
Listen and learn from your superiors.

392
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,159
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

393
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,761
Got it, Nekota?

394
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,364
Nekota?

395
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,600
I know where she is.

396
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,680
Excuse me.

397
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,617
I think Nekota is in here…

398
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,354
Nekota.

399
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,257
Nurse Fujiwara is looking for you.

400
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,027
She wants you on the Snipe surgery team.

401
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,165
I came here to tell you about it.

402
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,413
<i>The next day, the team was assembled</i>

403
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,948
<i>and the lectures began.</i>

404
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,350
Upon hitting the mitral valve,

405
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,320
return this lever
to its original position.

406
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,656
Then, just pull the trigger.

407
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,259
That's it.

408
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,161
It really is easy.

409
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,129
That is the entire process.

410
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,399
Dr. Sekikawa, from the top.

411
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,635
Right.

412
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,408
About Nekota…

413
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,911
She only ever works with Dr. Tokai…

414
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,780
You should avoid interacting with her.

415
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,315
What?

416
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,620
I heard that
tons of nurses have quit because of her.

417
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,523
They call her the female Dr. Tokai.

418
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,662
Push the catheter control button

419
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,164
and advance the catheter
to the mitral valve.

420
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,934
Upon hitting the mitral valve,

421
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:20,505
return the lever to its original position.

422
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,401
This is a hospital.

423
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,102
Your shift is over, right?

424
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,940
I just finished mine too.

425
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,721
Please…

426
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,123
take me off the operating team.

427
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,299
Giving up on being a surgeon?

428
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,720
I…

429
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,390
I almost killed Mr. Koyama.

430
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,630
It was the same with Ms. Minagawa.

431
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,701
When I become a surgeon,

432
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,239
I might actually kill someone.

433
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,623
This is the number of people

434
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
I've killed during surgery.

435
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:26,197
But you, with your hands still clean,

436
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,299
you plan to back out?

437
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,104
I find that incredibly irresponsible.

438
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,641
Irresponsible?

439
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,212
I can still remember

440
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,449
each one of their faces.

441
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,888
Not a day has gone by
that it doesn't hurt me.

442
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,925
The only thing left for me to do

443
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,097
is to save hundreds
and thousands more lives instead.

444
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,074
You will become a surgeon too

445
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,912
and save hundreds and thousands of lives.

446
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,980
If you quit now,

447
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,883
it wouldn't be any different
than throwing away

448
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,286
thousands of precious lives.

449
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,056
You have one life to live

450
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,193
and it's your duty to become a surgeon.

451
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,766
You must not run away from it.

452
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,129
I hear all of your pupils
give up and quit on you.

453
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,800
It's true that your skill does save lives,

454
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,535
but it kills doctors.

455
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,037
Just what are you trying to do?

456
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,175
Doctors with bright futures,
hoping to save lives.

457
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,811
-You killed them.
-No, no.

458
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,949
It's the patients who would have
been killed by those doctors.

459
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,919
That's who I'm trying to save.

460
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,991
Truly skilled doctors

461
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,860
can do whatever they want.

462
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,796
Unskilled doctors…

463
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,367
are better off dead.

464
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,640
You and I are polar opposites.

465
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,310
Dr. Tokai.

466
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,181
Would you like to make a bet?

467
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,122
Will Dr. Sera quit or not?

468
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,726
I don't bet on cheap odds.

469
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,861
One hundred million.

470
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,465
Both of our severance payments.

471
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,840
I believe he has a future.

472
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,343
How about you?

473
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,465
<i>The staff worked tirelessly</i>

474
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,034
<i>preparing for the Snipe surgery.</i>

475
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,203
Passed the left ventricle.

476
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,805
<i>And I continued to wonder</i>

477
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,141
<i>if I really had the qualifications</i>
<i>to be there.</i>

478
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,984
<i>Now, entering the mitral valve.</i>

479
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,626
Dr. Sekikawa?

480
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,563
Yes, no problem.

481
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,767
I will now insert the prosthesis.

482
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,309
Finished.

483
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,649
<i>Next time, it will be the real thing.</i>

484
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,785
<i>Let's do our best.</i>

485
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,689
<i>Mr. Koyama's condition stabilized,</i>

486
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,292
<i>and his surgery was scheduled</i>
<i>for the next day.</i>

487
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,961
Excuse me.

488
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,465
Did you need me?

489
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,339
-Give this to the nurses.
-Okay.

490
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,612
Pardon me.

491
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,080
And one more thing.

492
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,882
Yes?

494
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,455
You forgot to write the reason.

495
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,492
-It's incomplete.
-Why do you have that?

496
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,327
Write it now.

497
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,331
I'll sign it for you.

498
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,234
Write it.

499
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:35,940
Fine.

500
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,227
Dr. Tokai.

501
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,298
How many patients
have you killed in surgery?

502
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,438
I know how skilled you are.

503
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,440
But I…

504
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,811
I can't treat lives
as mere things the way you do.

505
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,582
Dealing with human life…

506
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,853
I'm scared. Life is fragile.

507
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,654
Is that wrong?

508
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,161
Zero.

509
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,797
I have never…

510
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,500
killed a single patient.

511
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,944
If it's really so scary
that it makes you cry,

512
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,183
don't waste your time with relocation.

513
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,454
Just quit.

514
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,927
And get out.

515
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,415
Dr. Sera.

516
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,752
You're still here?

517
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,321
Yes.

518
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,624
I just can't relax.

519
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,499
"Practice makes perfect."

520
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,502
Those are nice words.

521
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,940
But practice isn't everything.

522
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,812
If it doesn't help you win the game,

523
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,281
it's meaningless.

524
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,021
<i>Dr. Tokai said that surgery</i>
<i>is like gambling.</i>

525
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,991
<i>If that's true,</i>

526
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,561
I'm the guy who keeps losing the game.

527
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,333
I can't take this anymore…

528
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,634
Then why don't you quit?

529
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,438
Nekota…

530
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,442
You think you're the one
who's the most afraid?

531
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,355
You caught me off guard.

532
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,893
You're here late.

533
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,965
I'm not allowed
in the operating room tomorrow,

534
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,968
so I thought I would do
what I can before I go.

535
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,438
It's like being a newbie doctor.

536
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,111
Tomorrow,

537
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,248
Japanese medicine will change forever.

538
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,685
Thanks to the Snipe.

539
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,391
It has been a while.

540
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,960
I've been so busy.

541
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:55,299
Playing nice with the professors
while also helping Teika.

542
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,001
No wonder you're busy.

543
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,473
I'm only trying to help everyone.

544
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,043
I enjoy working with the best in class.

545
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,348
The Snipe is undoubtedly
a top-class medical device.

546
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,850
Dr. Saeki is of course
a top-class surgeon.

547
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,486
And of course,

548
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,456
your skills are, too.

549
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,929
Would you like to observe
the operation with me tomorrow?

550
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,032
I would like to hear your opinion.

551
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,373
Dr. Takashina
will be out of here tomorrow.

552
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,413
Perhaps, I made the wrong choice?

553
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,051
See you.

Oh, dear.

564
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,491
Cut it out. What kind of face is that?

565
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,060
It's no big deal.

566
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,664
The doctor says
it will be over in no time.

567

I know, but…

568

Don't worry.

569
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,603
When we get out of here,

570
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,839
we'll take that money

571
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,142
and take everyone out to eat <i>yakiniku.</i>

572

How can you say that at a time like this?

You think you're the one
who's the most afraid?

574
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,690
There's nothing to worry about.

575
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,558
Right, doctor?

576
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,302
It will be okay.

577
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,384
See? Well, here I go.

578
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,657
-Bring him in.
-Okay.

579
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,746
I never thought Dr. Sekikawa
would do this kind of operation.

580
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,180
If this succeeds,

581
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,750
does that mean
we'll all start using the Snipe?

582
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,687
If that happened…

583

Dr. Tokai!

585
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,527
Unskilled doctors

586
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,430
will be performing surgery.

587
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,973
-Professor Saeki.
-What are you all doing here?

588
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,876
This is no time to relax. Get to work!

589
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,611
-Sorry!
-Yes, sir.

590
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,383
Tokai, why are you here?

591
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,253
To observe?

592
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,654
No.

593
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,724
I wanted to see you walk out.

594
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,360
Thought I would give you my best.

595
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,431
Your attention, please.

596
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,766
What you're about to watch

597
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,003
is the future I've been dreaming of.

598
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,974
It's about to begin.

599
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:42,886
We'll now begin the on-pump mitral valve
surgery with the Snipe.

600
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,356
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

601
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,690
Scalpel.

602
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:52,563
<i>Electroscalpel.</i>

603
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,170
You seem nervous.

604
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,040
It's not my style.

605
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,210
Sitting still while everyone else works.

606
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,481
That will be an issue
when you become a professor.

607
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,952
Would you make me a professor?

608
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,193
It will depend on how hard you work.

609
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,236
-Snipe.
-Here.

610
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,905
-He's sweating.
-Right.

611
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:36,807
Pardon me.

612
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,575
All right.

613
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,780
Time to insert the Snipe.

614
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,686
Inserting the Snipe.

615
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,661
Smooth sailing.

616
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,065
Now, through the left ventricle.

617
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,404
We're through the left ventricle.

618
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,511
Just like we practiced.

619
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,082
Next is the papillary muscle level.

620
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,385
Through the papillary muscle.

621
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,124
Good.

622
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,226
The final step.

623
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,065
We've reached the mitral valve.

624
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,074
We'll apply the prosthesis.

625
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:11,869
What's wrong?

626
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,639
I don't know. Something is stuck.

627
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,674
Did you apply prosthesis?

628
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,477
I'll try to remove it.

629
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,046
Take it easy.

630
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,551
The artificial valves have been dislodged!

631
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,020
Why?

632
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,556
Migration. What do we do?

633
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,325
What's going on?

634
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,529
What happened?

635
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,598
<i>I don't know. The valves were dislodged.</i>

636
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,267
How?

637
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,537
They were released at an unexpected angle.

638
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,306
Perhaps the problem was caused

639
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:53,010
by the doctor quickly switching the Snipe
into his dominant hand.

640
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,712
But why would he do that?

641
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,150
Dr. Sekikawa is left-handed.

642
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,922
Don't forget to switch the lever back.

643
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,658
It's his first Snipe surgery.

644
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,761
His nerves got the best of him.

645
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,436
Whenever Dr. Sekikawa performs
difficult operations,

646
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,106
<i>Dr. Tokai is always there</i>
<i>to take over for him.</i>

647
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,410
That means this is a human error.

648
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,146
<i>-Blood pressure dropping!</i>
<i>-More fluid!</i>

649
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,548
-We need saline and albumin!
-Right away!

650
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,151
Let's call Dr. Takashina.

651
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,455
Dr. Takashina!

652
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,390
<i>Dr. Takashina!</i>

653
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,860
<i>Dr. Takashina!</i>

654
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,796
Wait.

655
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,966
If you leave now…

656
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,073
you'll never get to use
that toy of yours again.

657
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,912
Follow the manual.

658
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,915
Use the retrieval device
and locate the valve.

659
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,386
-Right. Prepare the retrieval device!
-Okay!

660
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,488
At this point, we better remove the Snipe.

661
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,025
Dr. Sekikawa.

662
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,296
The professor is watching you.

663
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,665
If we don't get this right…

664
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,500
We have to fix this!

665
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,203
Damn it.

666
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,940
Dr. Takashina.

667
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,743
Dr. Takashina!

668
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,248
Dr. Takashina, are you watching?

669
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,617
We need help. Please help us.

670
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,953
<i>-Stop it, Dr. Sera!</i>
<i>-Dr. Takashina!</i>

671
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,088
The professor gave him the order.

672
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,057
Dr. Takashina won't come.

673
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,960
We'll solve this ourselves!

674
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,599
Hey.

675
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,034
Hey, Sera!

676
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,936
Hey!

677
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,691
-Sera.
-Dr. Takashina.

678
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,626
We need you.

679
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,295
We need your help.

680
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,763
Please.

681
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:42,846
Somewhere down the line,
in this future of yours,

682
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,717
this problem will happen again.

683
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,987
When it does,

684
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,622
do you plan to run to the rescue?

685
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,624
You said so.

686
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,628
This is the reality
of that dream of yours.

687
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,167
Dr. Takashina.

688
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,072
Dr. Sera.

689
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,844
It's just as Professor Saeki says.

690
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,446
Doctor…

691
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,851
I vowed to take

692
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,487
full responsibility.

693
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,531
-Where's the retrieval device?
-Two packs of saline.

694
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,599
Right!

695
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,105
<i>-Get the heart-lung machine ready.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

696
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,409
What are you doing? Go back.

697
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,580
For the sake of the future.

698
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,218
-Go back!
-And you won't regret it?

699
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,855
I don't want to regret it.

700
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,126
The patient is fighting for his life.

701
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,662
We must help him.

702
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,067
You told me yourself.

703
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,204
You can't walk away from a life in danger.

704
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,408
Dr. Takashina!

705
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,512
You're the one who's running away!

706
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,986
Why is this happening?

707
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,788
Hurry and take out the Snipe.

708
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,324
I brought the retrieval device.

709
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,926
Thank you.

710
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,404
-Dr. Takashina.
-Doctor…

711
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:26,776
Forgive me.

712
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,346
Just focus on saving the patient.

713
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,282
Calm down.

714
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,386
Follow the manual
and retrieve the artificial valve.

715
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,756
-Retrieval device.
-Here.

716
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,158
I'll take over.

717
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,741
It appears they're on the right track.

718
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,678
Everything should be okay now, right?

719
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,214
We'll see.

720
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,192
Almost at the artificial valve.

721
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,105
Blood pressure dropping!

722
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,242
A hemorrhage in the left ventricle?

723
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,210
A hemorrhage…

724
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:37,214
The artificial valve has embedded itself
and is tearing the muscle.

725
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,418
-Heart-lung machine!
-Right!

726
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,886
-Bring the transfusion tubes.
-Right.

727
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,221
-Transfusion!
-Right.

728
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,589
-Guidewire.
-Right.

729
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,457
Can they pull it off?

730
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,027
If they don't act soon,
the patient will bleed out.

731
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,765
-Dr. Sera, connect the veins.
-Right.

732
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,135
-Here you are.
-What's happening?

733
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,372
If you don't hurry, the heart will tear.

734
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,008
-You must retrieve it now.
-I can't.

735
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,344
Be careful or the tissue will tear.

736
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,679
I'm trying to stop the bleeding.

737
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,881
It won't hold!

738
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,352
What should we do?

739
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,321
Oh, no. There's no time.

740
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,090
Dr. Saeki.

741
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,160
Transfusion is no good.

742
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,130
We can't do it…

743
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,400
Damn it…

744
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,478
Where's Dr. Tokai?

745
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,120
Dr. Tokai…

746
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,061
I'll cover it up for ten million.

747
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,497
Write your resignation letter.

748
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,098
Then I'll help you.

749
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:06,436
What are you saying?
The artificial valve is stuck.

750
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,672
The patient is losing strength.

751
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,507
I can do it.

752
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,976
-How?
-Because it's me.

753
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,457
We're losing blood!

754
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:32,796
Understood.

755
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,565
Please go ahead.

756
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,403
-Take it out!
-Okay.

757
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,372
-Heart-lung machine engaged.
-Okay.

758
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,307
I'm going to sew him up.

759
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,976
-Starting from the outside. Scalpel.
-Here.

760
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,049
-Electroscalpel.
-Okay.

761
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,219
-Suction.
-Okay.

762
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,088
-Running out of time.
-Right.

763
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,056
-Thoracotomy device.
-Yes, sir.

764
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,324
-Two pieces of felt.
-Okay.

765
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,826
-Forceps.
-Okay.

766
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,595
All right. Four-zero.

767
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,907
Hang in there, dear.

768
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,243
Hang in there!

769
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,655
Metz.

770
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:35,892
Repair complete.

771
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,765
-He's so fast…
-The valve extraction was the issue.

772
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,601
One wrong move and the patient will die.

773
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,271
-Metz.
-Okay.

774
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,840
-Debakey.
-Here.

775
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,044
With a Debakey?

776
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,348
He plans on grabbing it directly?

777
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,520
Removing the valve like that…

778
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,723
Can he see the entanglement
just by looking at it?

779
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,965
Got it.

780
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,045
Okay. Removal complete.

781
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,047
Close it up.

782
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,216
Let's continue to the mitral valve.

783
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:38,121
What are you saying?
The patient's heart is weak.

784
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,323
It's too dangerous to carry on.

785
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,891
And whose fault is that?

786
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,494
Do you plan on closing him up?

787
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,364
His heart will stop if you close it.
He'll die.

788
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,401
If we don't operate now, he'll die.

789
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,604
Brain monitor levels dropping.

790
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,474
There's no time. Only ten minutes
until blood flow to the brain stops.

791
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,142
Let's do it on the beat.

792
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,278
At a time like this?

793
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,647
The Saeki Method?

794
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,519
-Let's open you up. Scalpel.
-Here.

795
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,360
-Broaden your field of view.
-Right.

796
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,428
We have five minutes.

797
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,196
-Five-zero.
-Here.

798
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,776
Only two minutes!

799
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,014
Repairing the valves
under these conditions…

800
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,616
Amazing.

801
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,718
<i>Brain monitor level dropping!</i>

802
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,686
Less than one minute left!

803
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,363
-Metz.
-Here.

804
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,065
Mitral valve repair complete.

805
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,908
He did it…

806
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,248
Dr. Tokai, what about the stitches?

807
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,920
You do it.

808
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,674
Right, doctor?

809
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,744
It will be okay.

810
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,381
Okay.

811
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,831
-Dr. Sera, let me--
-I'll do it.

812
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,677
Thank you.

813
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,019
All right.

814
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,221
Metz scissors, please.

815
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,122
Yes.

816
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,799
Dr. Tokai.

817
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,467
Take out the forceps.

818
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:14,937
Okay.

819
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:29,886
Blood pressure…

820
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,855
stabilized.

821
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,226
Suturing complete.

822
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,363
Dr. Tokai.

823
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,405
Well done, doctor.

824
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,539
You too.

825
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:47,563
SCHEDULED FOR RECONSTRUCTION

826
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,669
<i>I apologize for the damage I have caused.</i>

827
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,306
<i>I disobeyed the professor's orders</i>

828
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,076
and entered the operating room.

829
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,181
Professor Saeki,

830
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:09,318
did you know this would happen?

831
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,390
Even as technology advances,

832
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,327
there's always room for error
when the human hand is involved.

833
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,798
Everyone who is involved in medicine

834
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,367
must never forget this fact.

835
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,078
Everything is as I expected.

836
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,321
There is nothing perfect in this world.

837
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,191
Even so,

838
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,195
I plan to make the Snipe the perfect tool.

839
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:03,439
Dr. Takashina.

840
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,441
I…

841
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,277
Are you really leaving our hospital?

842
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,953
It was Dr. Tokai who saved Mr. Koyama.

843
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,690
But if you hadn't been there,

844
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,626
we couldn't have operated at all.

845
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,528
Forget about me.

846
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,397
What about you?

847
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:30,600
What?

848
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:33,803
What do you plan to do?

849
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,072
Going forward.

850
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,649
TRAINING RELOCATION REQUEST FORM

851
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,289
I plan…

852
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:55,658
to be prepared.

853
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:00,696
Thank you.

854
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,967
-What?
-Are you ready, then?

855
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,670
-Huh?
-Dr. Tokai?

856
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,441
We made a bet.

857
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:16,012
Our resignation letters and severance pay.

858
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,648
We bet on whether you would quit or not.

859
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:22,852
Dr. Tokai and I bet on this operation.

860
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,087
But…

861
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,191
You ruined the whole thing.

862
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:30,826
What?

863
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,396
What do you mean?

864
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:38,200
I'm glad you decided to stay, Dr. Sera.

865
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,335
That's not…

866
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,271
Well, either way you'll be fired.

867
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,272
Fired?

868
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:46,008
You went directly
against the professor's orders.

869
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,945
Oh, no…

870
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,047
What should I do?

871
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,250
-You should hurry and go apologize.
-Right!

872
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:56,652
Oh, no.

873
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:02,525
Dr. Tokai.

874
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,229
I would like to thank you.

875
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,166
You helped me find the Snipe's weak point.

876
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,702
You were just lucky this time.

877
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,538
You should get out of here.

878
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,540
When I finish my paper,

879
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,543
and the Snipe is put into practical use,

880
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,612
you'll be the one who's out of here
because all you have is skill.

881
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,216
You and I are truly polar opposites.

882
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,219
We cannot coexist in one place.

883
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,588
Two sides of the same coin.

884
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,291
Heads or tails, life or death.

885
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,060
Will it be me who leaves?

886
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,229
Or you?

887
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,799
That's all there is.

888
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:55,244
What will become of that intern?

889
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:56,746
Intern?

890
01:06:56,812 --> 01:07:00,916
The one who disobeyed your orders
and called for Dr. Takashina.

891
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:03,753
Pardon me.

892
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:06,689
What?

893
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,359
No one is here. What should I do?

894
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,560
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

895
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,764
Are we getting sushi tonight?

896
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,267
That's right.

897
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,770
A three-star restaurant.

898
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,332
<i>You know that there's only one route.</i>

899
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,602
<i>Touching the nerves could result in death.</i>

900
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,572
Stick it in the mitral valve
and pull the switch, right?

901
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,107
You have any problems with that?

902
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,341
<i>Don't mess with me!</i>

903
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,843
<i>If we fail…</i>

904
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,146
The Snipe will be
out of your hands completely.

905
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,682
<i>We're friends, not enemies.</i>

906
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,350
-We need assistance!
-Dear!

907
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,353
<i>Who will you save? Who will you kill?</i>

908
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,321
