1
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,243
Care to explain yourself, Dr. Takashina?

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,547
The paper on the success
of the Snipe surgery

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,217
should be here as the headlining article.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,453
I don't see a single article
regarding the Snipe

5
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,522
published in here.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,927
You've completed only two Snipe surgery
cases at Tojo University Hospital,

7
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,364
and the results
have been less than satisfying.

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,899
I'm very sorry.

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,169
There isn't much time left
until the election for Chairman.

10
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,039
What I need is Impact Factor, you know?

11
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,874
Impact. Factor.

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,578
If you can't get me results next time,

13
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,916
the Snipe will be
out of your hands completely.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,652
If you wish to stay in this business,

15
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,823
bring me some results.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,328
<i>After two Snipe surgery failures,</i>
<i>Dr. Takashina had few chances left,</i>

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,863
<i>and the pressure was on.</i>

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>And as no schedule was set</i>
<i>for the Snipe's next use,</i>

19
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,636
<i>he couldn't redeem himself.</i>

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,541
It seems there hasn't been
another Snipe surgery since last time.

21
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,684
There's someone
I would like to introduce to you.

22
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,123
<i>As the number of patients</i>
<i>hoping for Dr. Saeki's care rose,</i>

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,358
<i>there wasn't a day he didn't operate.</i>

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,896
<i>And I got to be caretaker</i>
<i>of two new patients.</i>

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,533
<i>The first,</i>
<i>scheduled for operation by Dr. Saeki,</i>

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,703
<i>is Mr. Hideo Kusunoki,</i>
<i>suffering from mitral stenosis.</i>

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,974
Dr. Tokai will be looking after you
until the operation.

28
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,843
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,247
<i>And my second patient</i>

30
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,317
<i>was brought in by the clinical</i>
<i>trial coordinator, Kinoshita.</i>

31
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,186
<i>Hayato Tamura, a music student.</i>

32
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,555
<i>He was diagnosed with mitral insufficiency</i>

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,059
<i>and he's volunteered</i>
<i>for an emergency Snipe surgery,</i>

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,062
<i>hoping to recover in time</i>
<i>for a piano contest in America.</i>

35
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,233
<i>The important thing to note is his father.</i>

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,269
If it isn't Mr. Tamura!

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,206
<i>A candidate for Vice Minister</i>
<i>of the Ministry of Health, Koji Tamura.</i>

38
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,178
If there are no problems in the test,
we can operate right away.

39
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,114
You can leave the hospital
about a week after we finish.

40
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,816
Thank you.

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,553
That Snipe tool is really something.

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,657
<i>The surgery that would save</i>
<i>Dr. Takashina's career was decided</i>

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,793
<i>and the preparation was soon underway.</i>

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,363
-Dr. Sera. Bring me a towel, would you?
-Okay.

45
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,634
What are you doing? Watch out!

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,835
Sorry.

47
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,802
Excuse me.

48
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,907
Dr. Takashina seems to be on edge lately.

49
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,376
This is the first Snipe surgery
in a while after all.

50
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,489
Excuse me.

51
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,892
These are Hayato's lab results
and echocardiogram.

52
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,228
The MRI results will be in tomorrow.

53
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,097
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

54
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,368
Sorry for getting angry with you earlier.

55
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,304
It's all right. I'm sorry.

56
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,274
Are you still working?

57
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,311
Given last time's issues,

58
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,580
I have to make many revisions to my paper.

59
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,184
-Anything else?
-No, sorry.

60
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,121
Dr. Tokai never writes papers.

61
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,957
This is new to me.

62
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,360
It's not enough to just write a paper.

63
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,998
What matters is where it's published.

64
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,333
Impact Factor, right?

65
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,905
The most influential Japanese publication,

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,709
The <i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>,
has an Impact Factor of seven.

67
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,747
Ten years ago, when Dr. Saeki
first performed the Saeki Method,

68
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,183
it was first published here.

69
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,085
And because of that,

70
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,021
Dr. Saeki became famous overnight.

71
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,725
<i>Since then, the doctor</i>
<i>has published many articles</i>

72
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,228
<i>sending his Impact Factor to 77.</i>

73
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,229
TOTAL POINTS: 77

74
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,300
<i>While Dr. Nishizaki's various papers</i>
<i>are also widely published,</i>

75
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>but his Impact Factor sits at 71.</i>

76
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,106
<i>In other words, despite his efforts,</i>

77
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,509
<i>Dr. Nishizaki's vast research</i>
<i>isn't enough to compete.</i>

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,746
Only the paper on the Saeki Method
puts Dr. Saeki ahead.

79
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,982
Tojo, an unknown hospital,

80
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,385
<i>became an authority</i>
<i>on cardiovascular surgery</i>

81
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,655
<i>and patients from all over the world</i>
<i>now gather here in Sakuranomiya City</i>

82
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,024
<i>to visit a local hospital.</i>

83
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,128
A single paper's Impact Factor

84
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,997
changed the world completely.

85
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,634
If I can complete the Snipe paper,

86
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,138
I'll be able to overtake
Dr. Saeki's Impact Factor.

87
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,042
And I'll do anything to achieve that.

88
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,015
But I still don't have enough
real-world cases to complete the paper.

89
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,452
I have to ensure the next one succeeds

90
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,487
to garner trust.

91
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,529
<i>By using the Snipe,</i>
<i>we can save more lives.</i>

92
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,634
Could you let me help you?

93
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,404
If the Snipe is put into regular use,

94
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,307
we'll be able to save lives
around the world, as you said.

95
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,309
I think that's a wonderful goal.

96
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,716
Sorry. I've said too much.

97
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,752
Excuse me.

98
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,790
Dr. Sera.

99
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,659
Yes?

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,895
Could you gather data for me?

101
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,064
It would be helpful.

102
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,867
Yes. Of course.

103
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,477
<i>However, the next day,</i>
<i>a critical problem was found…</i>

104
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,378
Dr. Takashina!

105
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,146
<i>…in Hayato Tamura's test.</i>

106
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,316
What is this?

107
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,021
It has come to light that Hayato
is afflicted by cardiomyopathy

108
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:34,060
and his heart has an unusual ventricular
structure, winding and complex

109
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,295
like a vast jungle.

110
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,463
MITRAL VALVE - HYPERTROPHY

111
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,599
This will make it difficult
to apply stitches

112
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,301
between heartbeats
and reach the mitral valve.

113
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,172
A slight mistake could induce arrhythmia

114
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,441
and kill the patient.

115
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,480
This is an extremely rare case
requiring delicate care.

116
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,618
Performing Snipe surgery on this patient--

117
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,320
Are you trying to say you can't do it?

118
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,825
Can you?

119
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,662
It's impossible.

120
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,433
Dr. Takashina, you finally had a chance!

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,401
It cannot be done.

122
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,738
We'll have someone else operate.

123
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,808
Enter.

124
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,414
Dr. Tokai…

125
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,185
Dr. Tokai, you'll handle
the Snipe surgery for us,

126
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,253
won't you?

127
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,756
As you say, sir.

128
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,237
<i>Dr. Tokai is taking on a Snipe surgery?</i>

129
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,907
<i>How is this going to end?</i>

130
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,779
Please wait.

131
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,682
I know Dr. Tokai is a skilled surgeon,

132
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,485
but entrusting him with Snipe surgery?

133
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,955
It's a delicate operation
requiring a steady hand.

134
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,657
I can't think of anyone
better for the job.

135
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,696
If you're unsure,
our only other option is to call it off.

136
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,133
I wonder what Dr. Nishizaki
would say about that?

137
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,038
You can act as Dr. Tokai's assistant.

138
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,144
Dr. Tokai as the starting surgeon?

139
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,780
-That's a first.
-I guess it is.

140
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,650
He's usually there as assistant.

141
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,720
-I wonder how it will turn out.
-Me too.

142
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,322
SAITAMA RICE

143
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,423
GROWN IN GYODA

144
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,665
Here's the Snipe's user manual.

145
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,102
Stick it in the mitral valve
and pull the switch, right?

146
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,305
You'll need to take
a complicated route this time.

147
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,941
It will require practice.

148
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,412
I know a guy who practiced
and practiced and he still failed.

149
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,915
Then, it's a waste of time.

150
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,855
<i>Without ever laying a finger on the Snipe,</i>

151
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,758
<i>the day of Dr. Tokai's operation arrived.</i>

152
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,138
We'll now begin mitral valve
replacement surgery with the Snipe.

153
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,005
Scalpel.

154
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,620
What is wrong?

155
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,256
I don't have the faintest idea…

156
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,993
Dr. Tokai, what's wrong?

157
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,030
-I'm done.
-What?

158
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,333
You're done?

159
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,602
Dr. Tokai?

160
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,905
<i>What does this mean?</i>

161
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,108
Well, I don't even… Mr. Kurosaki!

162
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,044
Let me check. I'll be right back.

163
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,248
What do you mean you're done?

164
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,186
That's what I've decided
as operating surgeon.

165
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,121
Explain yourself.

166
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,091
Both Hayato and we
have been preparing for this.

167
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,325
You're not prepared.

168
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,530
Did even pay attention to the
apical papillary muscles?

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,402
The apical papillary muscles…

170
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,373
There's nothing we can do.

171
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,742
It was his decision.

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,910
-But…
-The operating surgeon

173
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,246
is Dr. Tokai.

174
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,383
Get a test on the heart muscles.

175
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,387
-No changes in condition?
-Right.

176
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,991
<i>A surprising discovery</i>
<i>was made upon further examination.</i>

177
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,863
The apical papillary muscles
much weaker than usual.

178
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,932
We won't be able
to insert the Snipe as usual.

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,069
If we had tried back there,

180
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,171
the apex would have torn,

181
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,740
causing hemorrhaging.

182
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,944
<i>Seeing such subtle heart movements…</i>

183
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,980
<i>How did he notice that?</i>

184
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,764
What are you talking about?
You cannot cancel the surgery.

185
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,802
Allow Dr. Tokai to carry out
the operation.

186
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,140
If it succeeds, it will be the case
we need for the Snipe.

187
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,610
And it will save this paper.

188
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,779
But if we fail…

189
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,014
If you fail,

190
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,418
we make sure Tojo University
takes responsibility for it.

191
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,823
Oh, right.

192
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,296
The text is a bit small.

193
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,233
And use a Gothic font.

194
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,551
Dr. Takashina.

195
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,356
Is it really possible to operate on Hayato

196
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,158
using the Snipe?

197
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,535
Of course, it is.

198
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,537
But to do so,

199
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,341
we'll have to reach the mitral valve
without damaging the ventricle.

200
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,177
We have to find a new route.

201
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,880
Will you help me?

202
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,648
Yes.

203
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,322
We'll make an exact replica
of Hayato's heart with a 3D printer.

204
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,291
Amazing!

205
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,398
Incredible.

206
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,002
-It's just like the real thing.
-Yes.

207
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,507
Let's work around the apex
and find a new way in.

208
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,642
Understood.

209
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,485
Introducing Mr. Tamura,
the next Vice Minister…

210
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,856
It would appear you're quite the fan
of Dr. Nishizaki and Dr. Takashina.

211
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,926
A fan, you say?

212
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,561
Am I wrong?

213
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm a fan of the elite. That's all.

214
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,067
That's why I like Dr. Nishizaki,
and you as well.

215
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,869
A fan, as you say.

216
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,073
I may be out of line asking this,

217
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,609
but why, Dr. Saeki?

218
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,312
Why did you approve
of taking in Mr. Tamura?

219
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,152
On top of that,
you appointed Dr. Tokai as lead surgeon…

220
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,657
It would almost appear as if you
are taking a liking to the Snipe.

221
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,797
It's all for the sake of the patients.

222
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,418
It's no use.

223
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,589
Let's try 11 millimeters.

224
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,192
-From a 75-degree angle.
-Right.

225
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,563
<i>We continued our research</i>
<i>on a new route for the Snipe.</i>

226
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,267
<i>Finding an insertion point</i>
<i>by the millimeter away from the apex,</i>

227
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,069
<i>calculating the angle based on heartbeats.</i>

228
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,938
<i>We tried countless times.</i>

229
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,043
They're still at it?

230
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,314
Why the hell is Sera helping out
with Teika's research?

231
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,051
<i>Finally,</i>

232
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,958
-We finally found a route.
-Finally.

233
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,628
Now, we'll be able to use the Snipe.

234
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,668
There's only one thing left
that we can't anticipate.

235
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,736
<i>The surgeon.</i>

236
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
You called?

237
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,443
There isn't much time
until the competition.

238
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,946
We would like to operate
as soon as tomorrow.

239
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,248
When do you think it will be?

240
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,818
If that's the case, then we'll hurry.
Right, Dr. Tokai?

241
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,688
Before we do that, I have to ask.

242
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,391
Do you understand the Snipe surgery?

243
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,660
-What?
-Of course, they do.

244
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,163
I explained it myself.

245
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,598
It has been performed twice
at our hospital.

246
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,401
The first time,
the patient's splenic artery tore.

247
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,170
She almost died.

248
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:15,808
The second, the patient nearly bled
to death due to human error.

249
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,409
Bled to death?

250
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,413
That's the surgery you'll be undergoing.

251
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:26,685
As they say, "Third time's the charm."

252
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,654
There's a chance of success, however…

253
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,789
They also say, "History repeats itself."

254
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,128
Think it over.

255
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,267
-They had issues twice…
-What is this about?

256
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,937
We'll explain it again shortly.

257
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,143
What is this, Dr. Tokai?

258
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,779
-I just told them the truth.
-No.

259
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,548
You threatened them,
by the way you said it.

260
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,518
What will we do if they opt out?

261
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,753
We'll cancel the operation.

262
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,825
Like we said, it's either going to be
you or me who leaves.

263
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,428
If nobody undergoes Snipe surgery,

264
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,730
I will be kicked out of here.

265
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,899
Is that your goal?

266
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,038
To be quite frank,
I don't like the idea of you operating.

267
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,774
But as a team, we must cooperate.

268
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,510
Let's quit this bickering.

269
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,951
This is the new Snipe route
we've come up with for Hayato's surgery.

270
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,387
We'll be able to put this in the paper.

271
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,324
We'll follow this route for the Snipe
during the next operation.

272
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,564
HAYATO TAMURA
NEW SNIPE ROUTE

273
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,168
RECYCLE BIN

274
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,636
Wait, Dr. Tokai!

275
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,905
What did you just do?

276
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,140
I trashed it.

277
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,977
Don't mess with me!

278
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,612
Do you understand your job?

279
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,881
Dr. Takashina, stop. Please.

280
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,516
Please.

281
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,954
We don't need it.

282
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,157
I've already decided on a route.

283
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,597
I'll insert the Snipe
28 millimeters to the left from the apex.

284
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,966
Approaching from an 83-degree angle,

285
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,069
reaching the mitral valve
without damaging the left ventricle.

286
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,171
In fact, there is no other way.

287
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,211
You have any problems with that?

288
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,952
If papers could save people,
we wouldn't need doctors.

289
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,387
I do have a problem.

290
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,657
My pride as a doctor.

291
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,927
An unpublished doctor wouldn't understand.

292
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,331
You wouldn't know how much time
and effort we put into it.

293
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,503
If you had ever participated in research,
you would understand what you've done.

294
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,304
Papers are everything to us.

295
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,779
I recognize you're a skilled surgeon.

296
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,950
But without all the thought
that goes into it,

297
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,586
you're not a real doctor to me.

298
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,056
You're just a lowly craftsman.

299
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,862
You're giving me such praise.

300
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,398
You'll make me blush.

301
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,712
<i>We don't need it.</i>
<i>I've already decided on a route.</i>

302
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,713
NEW SNIPE ROUTE

303
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>I'll insert the Snipe</i>
<i>28 millimeters to the left from the apex.</i>

304
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,123
<i>Approaching from an 83-degree angle,</i>

305
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,126
<i>reaching the mitral valve</i>
<i>without damaging the left ventricle.</i>

306
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,094
<i>In fact, there is no other way.</i>

307
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,035
<i>We have worked so hard</i>
<i>to discover a new route,</i>

308
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,371
<i>but Dr. Tokai was able to do it easily.</i>

309
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,107
<i>What is this about, Dr. Nishizaki?</i>

310
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,009
We asked for urgent care.

311
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,746
If there is a chance of death,
we want to use the Saeki Method.

312
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,548
That Dr. Tokai

313
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,585
may have said something misleading,

314
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,653
but there is no problem.

315
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,426
I've entrusted my trusted colleague,
Dr. Takashina, to explain everything.

316
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,662
<i>Thanks to Dr. Takashina's</i>
<i>ardent persuasion,</i>

317
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,932
<i>Mr. Tamura once again</i>
<i>agreed on the Snipe surgery.</i>

318
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,867
Please read these documents.

319
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,738
Mr. Tamura has requested
that Hayato's operation

320
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,808
be performed this Sunday.

321
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,677
Dr. Saeki will be away
on business that day.

322
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,382
It's a direct request from the next
Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health.

323
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,284
It's all the same to me.

324
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,355
That schedule works for me.

325
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,957
Then it has been decided.

326
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,325
Thank you for your time.

327
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,805
Dr. Takashina.

328
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,513
You have a great responsibility.

329
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,815
What do you mean?

330
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:30,455
Dr. Nishizaki sees the Snipe
as a simple tool to win him the election.

331
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,459
Aren't you tired of him
always pestering you

332
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,861
for results for your paper?

333
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,398
Dr. Takashina.

334
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,869
I would like to offer you
an official position here.

335
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,009
You can continue your research and testing
on the Snipe as much as you would like

336
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,679
here at Tojo University.

337
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,482
But this is Dr. Nishizaki's research.

338
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,687
No, it's yours.

339
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,191
I want to support your research.

340
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,466
The Snipe currently still requires
a skilled surgeon.

341
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,769
Our hospital will help bring it to life.

342
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,307
Are you trying to poach me
along with the Snipe?

343
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,512
The name written at the end of your paper.

344
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,819
That name represents
the head of the research done.

345
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,625
All you need to do,
is write my name there.

346
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,765
Are you telling me to…

347
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,334
cut off Dr. Nishizaki?

348
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,940
We can change the rules, if necessary.

349
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,279
Wasn't it you who said that?

350
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,951
We're friends, not enemies.

351
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:14,760
<i>Meanwhile, preparations</i>
<i>for Mr. Kusunoki's surgery next week</i>

352
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,261
<i>were progressing steadily.</i>

353
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,430
Okay, we're done.

354
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,266
I feel so lucky to receive
your care, Dr. Saeki.

355
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,768
I'm extremely grateful.

356
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,906
I thought of checking on your condition
before my trip to Tokyo tomorrow.

357
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,908
Thank you so much.

358
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,650
Just in case, we'll take
a coronary angiogram next Monday.

359
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,785
Okay.

360
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,319
-Put it in the order.
-Yes.

361
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,362
I would like to offer you
an official position here.

362
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,134
<i>All you need to do,</i>
<i>is write my name there.</i>

363
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,332
<i>The fateful day finally arrived.</i>

364
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,169
Excuse me. It's about Mr. Kusunoki.

365
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,371
I scheduled a coronary angiogram.

366
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,407
-Orders from the professor?
-Yes.

367
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,710
He told me to hurry,
so I've set it for Monday.

368
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,579
-We'll do it after this.
-What?

369
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,813
Yes. Make preparations.

370
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,116
Wait. I'm not sure I can
on such short notice…

371
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,017
<i>Come in.</i>

372
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,788
A great success, I see.

373
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,492
As expected from you, Mr. Ikenaga,
as editor-in-chief.

374
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,294
Me? I haven't done a thing.

375
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,098
My predecessor did all the real work.

376
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,369
All of the <i>Journal</i>'s current editors
were selected

377
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,671
by the former editor-in-chief.

378
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,408
He's expected to make an appearance today.

379
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,178
I'll introduce him shortly.

380
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,947
Enjoy yourselves.

381
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,861
<i>It was almost time for a second try</i>
<i>on Hayato Tamura's Snipe surgery.</i>

382
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,867
We'll now perform mitral valve
replacement surgery with the Snipe.

383
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,902
-Scalpel.
-Here.

384
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,019
-Electroscalpel.
-Here.

385
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,922
Avoid the lungs after incision.

386
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,557
-Gauze ball.
-Right.

387
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,362
Here we go.

388
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,035
Dr. Nishizaki expressed zero concern.

389
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,269
Please observe.

390
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,470
-Tourniquet.
-Here.

391
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,342
Forceps.

392
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,615
-The Snipe is ready.
-I know.

393
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,523
MITRAL VALVE - HYPERTROPHY

394
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,159
-Inserting the Snipe.
-Keep it down.

395
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,129
<i>Twenty-eight millimeters to the left</i>
<i>from the apex.</i>

396
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,664
<i>At an 83-degree angle.</i>

397
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,435
<i>With such ease, Dr. Tokai is incredible.</i>

398
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,371
HIDEO KUSUNOKI

399
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,873
The Saeki Method.

400
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,044
While carrying my name,
it is a medical procedure

401
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,916
performed on the mitral valve
while the heart continues to beat,

402
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,150
"on beat," as we say.

403
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,118
Excuse me.

404
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,854
-Never before has…
-What is it?

405
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,991
Mr. Kusunoki in room 304 has gone
into shock. Ask Dr. Saeki what to do.

406
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,360
Cardiac tamponade…

407
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,929
CARDIAC TAMPONADE

408
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,764
He's giving a speech.
He can't give orders.

409
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,901
<i>This is Dr. Saeki's patient.</i>
<i>Don't let him die no matter what!</i>

410
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,203
What should we do?

411
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,840
Looking good.
We'll soon approach the hypertrophy.

412
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,375
MITRAL VALVE - HYPERTROPHY

413
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,679
This is where it gets tough.

414
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,633
<i>Amazing. In such a narrow route.</i>

415
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,636
<i>He's reading the heart's movement.</i>

416
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,841
-Dr. Sera.
-Right.

417
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,578
-Yes?
-It's Mr. Kusunoki in room 304.

418
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,580
He's in shock. Cardiac tamponade.

419
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,983
<i>Is there someone who can help?</i>
<i>We need assistance!</i>

420
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,352
Mr. Kusunoki is having
a cardiac tamponade.

421
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,856
It must be a ruptured aneurysm.

422
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,560
-How did you know?
-The professor ordered the test.

423
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,228
We'll take a coronary angiogram.

424
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,697
Right…

425
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,867
For it to happen now…

426
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,471
Give me that. We need emergency surgery.

427
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,107
Dr. Sekikawa can't do it.
And Dr. Saeki is out.

428
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,843
-He won't last 30 minutes.
-What should we do?

429
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,381
Dr. Tokai.

430
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,820
No. If we stop now,

431
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,155
we won't be able
to insert the Snipe again.

432
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,558
-This is the only route.
-But Mr. Kusunoki…

433
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,061
Dr. Tokai.

434
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,564
Nekota.

435
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,567
-Left side?
-Got it.

436
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,842
-Mr. Kusunoki, can you hear me?
-Dear!

437
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,610
This is bad. He'll die like this.

438
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,878
Doctor!

439
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,480
<i>Someone, hurry!</i>

440
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,417
What are you doing?
Continue the operation!

441
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,119
Dr. Tokai!

442
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,689
I can't be in two places at once,
so I can only save one of them.

443
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,494
Who will you save?

444
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,629
-What?
-No…

445
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,099
Who will you kill?

446
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,173
I can't make a decision like that.

447
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,675
If it were me,

448
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,546
I would save both.

449
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,283
<i>Both?</i>

450
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,184
How?

451
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,786
Tell them to bring him next to us.

452
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,988
-What?
-Tell them now!

453
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,390
Okay. Bring him to operating room two!

454
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,092
Okay. Dr. Sekikawa…

455
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,894
Nekota?

456
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,329
Operating Room 2 is ready.

457
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,864
Mr. Kusunoki?

458
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,300
-Hurry up!
-Right!

459
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:06,037
Are you going over there?
What will you do with this patient?

460
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,005
Take over.

461
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,874
You continue the operation.

462
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,343
I have to continue?

463
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,246
What's wrong?
Do you plan on just standing there

464
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,315
until I get back?

465
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,484
But…

466
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,619
You know that there's only one route.

467
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,424
If you continue with the right timing,
it'll work, right.

468
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,762
Continue with the right timing?
You know it's not that easy.

469
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,969
Aren't there any real doctors here?

470
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,241
No?

471
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,379
Aren't there any real doctors here?

472
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,100
Fine.

473
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,304
Dr. Takashina.

474
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,947
What are you doing?
Dr. Tokai, get back there!

475
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,116
<i>Do you plan on continuing?</i>

476
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,719
-These are the surgeon's orders.
-But…

477
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,455
The route only opens when the heart beats.

478
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,289
I know that!

479
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,726
We have to try.

480
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,897
Why from the left?
Incisions are done in the center.

481
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,333
Move it.

482
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,235
Opening from the left?

483
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,905
I'll start with
the coronary artery aneurysm.

484
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,306
-Scalpel.
-Here.

485
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,075
<i>Why open up from the left?</i>

486
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,578
<i>A median sternotomy is standard.</i>

487
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,247
<i>An incision in the center of the chest.</i>

488
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,950
<i>Why make it harder and go from the left?</i>

489
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,352
Hey.

490
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,787
Yes?

491
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,358
-Excuse me.
-Get that off. You do it.

492
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,327
Okay.

493
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,662
-Video.
-Okay.

494
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,532
It's on.

495
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,169
-Sternal retractor.
-Right.

496
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,979
OPERATING ROOM ONE

497
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,148
Monitor on.

498
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,020
It's taking longer than expected,
but it's under control.

499
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,755
I think we can do this.

500
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,493
We got PSVT!

501
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,366
PSVT in room one!

502
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,135
PSVT… Did they hit the muscle?

503
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,605
No. It's just arrhythmia.
Administer verapamil.

504
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,543
Dr. Tokai says to administer verapamil
since it's regular arrhythmia.

505
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,212
<i>We've been told to administer verapamil.</i>

506
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,082
Two surgeries at once?
What is this man capable of?

507
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,127
Here's the verapamil.

508
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,395
-Hurry!
-Right.

509
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,730
-Anesthesiologist, hurry.
-Right.

510
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,566
Damn it…

511
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,470
Dr. Takashina…

512
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,314
-Metz.
-Here.

513
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,052
Aneurysm suture complete.

514
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,787
-Already?
-Electroscalpel.

515
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,857
-Open him up. Raise the bed.
-Right.

516
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,498
<i>We'll bypass the aneurysm</i>
<i>and stabilize blood flow.</i>

517
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,500
This is a difficult operation.

518
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,635
What's going on there?

519
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,371
Irregular heartbeat…

520
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,842
If they miss by even one millimeter…

521
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,545
<i>They'll hit the muscle</i>
<i>and kill the patient.</i>

522
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,182
Dr. Takashina.

523
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,021
Metz.

524
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,794
-Bypass complete.
-Impossible. You're too fast.

525
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,797
-Bypass complete.
-Thank God.

526
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,032
-Blood pressure, 72.
-What?

527
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,435
It won't stabilize. Why?

528
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,072
Because of the patient's
narrow mitral valves.

529
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,674
To save him…

530
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,011
We'll need the Saeki Method.
Dr. Tokai can do it.

531
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,080
-Heart-lung machine.
-Right!

532
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,681
-Blood pump!
-Okay!

533
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,817
Room two. Bypass complete.

534
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,685
We'll perform the Saeki Method.

535
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,222
Blood pressure 70-40. Heart rate 110.

536
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,793
-Hurry.
-Right!

537
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,496
Wait.

538
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,976
Blood pressure 72. It won't stabilize.

539
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,912
Dr. Takashina.

540
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,216
If we continue like this,

541
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,885
the patient will surely die.

542
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,755
So you plan on just letting him die?

543
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,892
I can't do it.

544
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:33,164
I know the limits of my own abilities.

545
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,117
Gown.

546
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,085
-Dr. Tokai.
-Here.

547
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,421
How? What about the other operation?

548
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,656
I'll take over.

549
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,561
I got this one. You finish up over there.

550
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,032
-The Saeki Method? Me?
-No way.

551
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,436
Dr. Tokai. I've brought it.

552
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,071
Use the Snipe.

553
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,507
The Snipe?

554
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,911
I opened that patient up on the left.

555
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,413
Insert the Snipe from the apex.

556
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,517
That was your plan from the start?

557
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,286
<i>What is this about?</i>

558
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,455
He was planning on using the Snipe
from the beginning.

559
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,458
<i>With the standard central incision,</i>

560
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,027
<i>the apex isn't exposed</i>

561
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,729
and the Snipe can't be inserted.

562
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,732
But doing it with such ease…

563
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,034
What skill!

564
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,471
-How were you able to verify it--
-Do it.

565
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,678
Surgeon's orders.

566
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,334
Understood.

567
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,449
Dr. Takashina…

568
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:36,954
Dr. Takashina.

569
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,029
We'll perform mitral valve surgery
with the Snipe.

570
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,198
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

571
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,800
-We'll apply stitches to the apex first.
-Right.

572
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,845
MITRAL VALVE - HYPERTROPHY

573
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,927
-Snipe.
-Here.

574
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,934
Inserting the Snipe.

575
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,206
Using the Snipe on both patients…

576
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,570
It's in.

577
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,474
Blood gas analysis results. Here.

578
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,011
Approaching mitral valve.

579
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,650
We've made contact.

580
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,053
We're at the mitral valve.

581
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,903
Finished.

582
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,005
Finished.

583
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,280
They did it.

584
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,450
-It was a success!
-Thank you.

585
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,823
-Can you apply sutures?
-Yes.

586
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,343
A once-in-a-lifetime double Snipe surgery.

587
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,678
That man…

588
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,415
<i>has the devil's skills.</i>

589
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,856
I see. So it was on Dr. Tokai's orders?

590
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,159
And it seems both of them…

591
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,362
used the Snipe, apparently.

592
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,098
-The Snipe?
-Yes.

593
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,302
I see.

594
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,706
Thank you, Dr. Saeki.

595
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,942
-It's nothing.
-About my predecessor…

596
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,877
It appears he has fallen ill

597
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,046
and he won't be in attendance today.

598
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,881
He'll be better soon, I'm sure.

599
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,660
My son was saved by the Snipe.

600
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,062
As for the election,

601
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,899
my close relationship with the lobbyists
and voting board members

602
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,668
will benefit you.

603
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,205
That is very encouraging.
Please send them our regards.

604
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,739
Until next time.

605
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,283
Well done, Dr. Takashina.

606
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,322
Now, the real test begins.

607
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,994
I promise I will complete my paper soon.

608
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,433
For you, Dr. Nishizaki.

609
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,672
It's almost time.

610
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,410
Excuse me.

611
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,414
Dr. Tokai. Mr. Kusunoki is being released.

612
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,550
They're looking for you.

613
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,693
Thank you for everything, Dr. Saeki.

614
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,328
I'm glad you're feeling better.

615
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,298
I promise to repay you.

616
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,069
Thank you, everyone.

617
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,972
-Please take care.
-We will.

618
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,141
Excuse us.

619
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,384
<i>Why did they leave through the back door?</i>

620
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,953
Mr. Hideo Kusunoki.

621
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,723
He's the former editor-in-chief
of the <i>Japan Surgical Journal.</i>

622
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,763
The<i> Journal</i>'s editors
are greatly influenced by him.

623
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,768
If the Surgical Association finds out that
someone as influential as him

624
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:55,906
didn't go to Dr. Nishizaki for
heart surgery, but instead came to me…

625
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,276
it would lead to unfairness
in the elections.

626
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,745
You mean…

627
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:05,082
I would save both.

628
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,751
The reason Dr. Tokai saved both is…

629
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,658
No matter how well-written
your paper may be,

630
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,795
whether or not it ends up being published,

631
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,198
will depend entirely on whose name
is written at the end.

632
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,803
Will it be Dr. Nishizaki?

633
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,539
Or me?

634
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,519
I just realized Dr. Tokai didn't make
any demands this time, did he?

635
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,321
-What?
-It's just…

636
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,524
<i>He usually doesn't help without payment.</i>

637
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,659
Dr. Tokai.

638
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,563
Congratulations on a job well done.

639
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,568
You had your hand in not one,
but two Snipe surgeries.

640
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,343
Can I ask for your cooperation again?

641
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,348
Is he really such a bad guy?

642
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,851
Thanks to him, the patients were saved.

643
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,953
You don't get it. He's the devil.

644
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,529
Excuse me. Dr. Tokai?

645
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,799
I'm here for Mr. Igarashi's reports.

646
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,436
Excuse me.

647
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,200
Forceps?

648
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,204
This is…

649
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,886
If you don't need them anymore,
give them to me. Your black forceps.

650
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,388
You're no longer needed.

651
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,757
<i>Our biggest problem</i>
<i>is the blood transfusion.</i>

652
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,959
<i>The Snipe exists because of her.</i>

653
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,195
<i>I bet everything on this.</i>

654
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,831
<i>There's less than</i>
<i>a five-percent success rate.</i>

655
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,133
Is that why Dr. Tokai said no?

656
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,669
If we fail, we will just remove
Dr. Takashina's name.

657
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,771
<i>I will succeed for sure.</i>

658
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,407
You're the only one
who can help this patient.

659
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,475
Why don't you kill her?

660
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,211
<i>You heard what the doctor told me.</i>

661
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,913
With my current skill, it's impossible!

662
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,215
What will you do?

663
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,483
<i>Believe in me.</i>

664
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,717
Don't believe him.

665
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,185
