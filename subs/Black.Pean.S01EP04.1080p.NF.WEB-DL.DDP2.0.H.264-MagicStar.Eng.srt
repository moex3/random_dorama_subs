1
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,075
Forceps. This is…

2
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,779
Hanabusa.

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,851
Mr. Igarashi's reports were on my desk.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,520
-I'm sorry for misplacing them.
-It's okay.

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,956
-You may go back now.
-Thank you.

6
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,673
<i>Two simultaneous Snipe surgeries</i>
<i>were completed at Tojo University.</i>

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,842
-Finished.
-Finished.

8
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,411
<i>Everything changed.</i>

9
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,482
Lastly, at Dr. Takashina's request,

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,986
we will introduce 20 new Snipe units
to our facilities.

11
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,422
One unit costs three million yen.

12
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,392
Eventually, you will all be entrusted
to perform surgeries with it.

13
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,328
I want each of you to follow instructions
to prepare for this.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,631
<i>With Dr. Saeki's approval,</i>

15
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,467
<i>Tojo's promotion of the Snipe</i>

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,469
<i>was fully underway.</i>

17
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,273
We've reached the mitral valve.

18
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,345
Complete.

19
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,216
It's much faster than the Saeki Method

20
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,551
and it's so simple.

21
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,620
The need for skilled surgeons
might really be at its end.

22
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,223
<i>Dr. Takashina got his case data</i>

23
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,526
<i>and was nearing completion</i>
<i>of his Snipe paper.</i>

24
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,796
<i>But there was still one big problem.</i>

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,334
<i>The name of the author,</i>
<i>written in the introduction</i>

26
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,403
<i>and the name at the end</i>
<i>of the person in charge</i>

27
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,339
<i>indicate the most important</i>
<i>people involved in research.</i>

28
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,741
<i>The Impact Factor from a paper</i>

29
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,177
<i>is given solely to these two people.</i>

30
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>In conclusion,</i>
<i>the person at the end of the Snipe paper</i>

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,817
<i>would earn many Impact Factor points</i>

32
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,154
<i>and certainly win</i>
<i>the election for Chairman.</i>

33
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:13,066
If the former editor-in-chief,
Mr. Kusunoki, is backing you,

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,868
I cannot intervene.

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,771
I promise to repay you.

36
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,542
I can't publish the paper under your name

37
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,545
as things currently stand.

38
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,414
If that's the case,
then you don't need to worry.

39
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,217
Measures have already been taken.

40
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,419
<i>The battle over the Snipe paper</i>

41
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,421
<i>was nearing its final stage.</i>

42
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,125
<i>All the while,</i>
<i>an emergency conference was held</i>

43
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,528
<i>regarding a new patient's surgery.</i>

44
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:46,432
Koharu Shimano, seven years old.
Transferred from Teika University.

45
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,636
She was diagnosed
with mitral valve insufficiency.

46
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,306
However, the main problem
lies in her blood.

47
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,875
<i>Her platelet count is extremely low…</i>

48
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,776
It will be okay.

49
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>…making it difficult for her blood</i>
<i>to clot.</i>

50
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,781
With an allergy to blood transfusion

51
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,117
and irregular antibodies,

52
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,353
it's nearly impossible
to do a blood transfusion.

53
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,723
Open chest surgery
would cause heavy blood loss

54
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,392
and would kill her immediately.

55
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,261
Therefore,
the Saeki Method is out of the question.

56
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,599
Why did the professor
accept a patient like that?

57
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,002
I have something important to discuss.

58
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,909
She's a patient I previously cared for
at Teika University.

59
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,212
With repeated heart failures,

60
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,080
she only has a month to live.

61
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:39,152
Can I ask you to perform mitral valve
surgery on her at Tojo University?

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,687
I will consider it.

63
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,058
But for you, completing the paper

64
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,826
is your highest priority, right?

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,862
Introducing 20 new Snipe units.

66
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,132
I've supported you
in increasing case numbers.

67
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,404
There's another document.

68
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,106
A copy of a patient's chart.

69
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,641
CHIE KUSUNOKI

70
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,343
It's Mr. Kusunoki's wife.

71
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:08,648
Her results came back
showing a malignant tumor in her liver.

72
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,151
She's currently undergoing treatment
at Teika University

73
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,754
with a specialist
recommended by Dr. Nishizaki.

74
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,459
It's cutting-edge chemotherapy
only available at Teika University.

75
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,596
Mr. Kusunoki is indebted not only to you,

76
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,065
but now to Dr. Nishizaki as well.

77
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,168
It means that my paper will be published

78
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,306
whether it's your name
or Dr. Nishizaki's that I put at the end.

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,010
I'm sure you know what that means.

80
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,317
Won't Dr. Nishizaki help you?

81
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,020
Unfortunately,

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,624
-that's a risk I cannot afford to take.
-"That's a risk I cannot afford to take."

83
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,393
Am I right?

84
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,638
Operating to ensure a child's future.

85
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,907
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it.

86
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,309
Very well.

87
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,512
Bring her to Tojo University.

88
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,314
Thank you.

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,448
One condition.

90
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,154
I'm sure you get it.

91
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,656
About the paper.

92
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,494
I give you my word.

93
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,197
After verifying her situation,

94
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,933
I've decided to perform Snipe surgery.

95
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,203
The operating surgeon

96
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,339
will be Dr. Tokai.

97
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,775
Dr. Tokai again?

98
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,977
He is skilled, after all.
What did you expect?

99
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,781
Got it, Dr. Tokai?

100
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,122
I decline.

101
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,125
You decline?

102
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,695
The surgery can't be done with the Snipe.

103
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:08,000
But if there's no other choice
and you need my help,

104
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,871
would you instruct me
to use the Saeki Method?

105
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,206
I don't care what you want.

106
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,409
The professor has found
the Saeki Method to be too risky

107
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:21,247
and has decided on Snipe surgery.
Got it? This is an order!

108
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,148
What's that?

109
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,855
So this isn't Dr. Saeki's
surgical department.

110
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,157
It's Dr. Takashina's, isn't it?

111
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,295
At the department I know,
all of our mitral valve operations

112
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,798
are done using the Saeki Method.

113
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,067
Nobody was ready to make the switch

114
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,937
when you brought that new toy in.

115
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,141
-Toy?
-Make the switch?

116
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,042
You're all really something.

117
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,913
After all those objections
you had at first,

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,883
all I hear now is "Snipe."

119
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,986
You've all done your homework, I see.

120
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,155
-Shut your mouth, Tokai!
-Dr. Tokai…

121
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:07,026
Taking on difficult operations
and succeeding each time.

122
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,496
That's Dr. Seigo Saeki.
That's the Saeki Method.

123
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,599
If you're saying it can't be done
with the Saeki Method

124
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,270
but it would be possible with the Snipe…

125
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,109
-You've admitted defeat.
-Tokai!

126
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,279
If you don't need them anymore,
give them to me.

127
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,049
Your black forceps.

128
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,085
Tokai.

129
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,054
I understand.

130
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,896
You have some serious nerve

131
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,568
mocking me
and the black forceps like that.

132
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,971
I assume you came prepared
for the consequences.

133
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,788
You're no longer needed.

134
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,158
You will not be involved in any surgeries
after this.

135
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,293
You have no right to be here.

136
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,395
Get out,

137
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,732
Dr. Tokai.

138
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,604
If it's the doctor's orders…

139
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,141
SEISHIRO TOKAI

140
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,783
Now you're the only one who can operate.

141
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,619
Understood?

142
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,456
Yes.

143
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,127
<i>As for the punishment given to Dr. Tokai…</i>

144
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,862
<i>Pardon me.</i>

145
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,330
Dr. Tokai.

146
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,633
Director Moriya asked me to tell you

147
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,702
that you should clean up
and be out of here in a month.

148
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,874
They told me to help carry your stuff
to the medical office.

149
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,844
What should I take first?

150
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,379
Do whatever you want.

151
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,548
You're no help.

152
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,822
Why did you say all that?

153
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,129
It's so heavy.

154
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,703
Hey, wait. What's this?

155
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,805
You can take my stuff out too.

156
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,739
What?

157
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,808
Nekota, wait. What's this about?

158
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,512
That Dr. Tokai…

159
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,015
He's basically Dr. Saeki's right-hand man.

160
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,820
The surgical department
won't last long now with him gone.

161
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:52,024
Dr. Saeki has dug his own grave,
you could say.

162
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,862
This guarantees your landslide victory
in the election. In that case…

163
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,930
When I win,

164
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll leave you in charge of one
of my affiliated hospitals, Mr. Moriya.

165
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,937
It would be a great honor!
I'll be in your care.

166
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,406
-Hanabusa.
-Yes?

167
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,008
Give this to Dr. Tokai.

168
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,077
Me?

169
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,044
Please.

170
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,119
Excuse me.

171
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,500
Um, Dr. Tokai…

172
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,904
Want some?

173
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,343
No, thank you, I'm fine.

174
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,522
This is delicious.

175
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,392
Isn't it?

176
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,627
I didn't think rice could be so good.

177
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,532
They say Japanese bodies are made of rice.

178
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,409
Forceps?

179
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,921
<i>Dr. Takashina did countless simulations</i>

180
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,525
<i>in order to deal with Koharu's hemophilia.</i>

181
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,828
To prevent hemorrhaging,
the incision in the heart

182
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,264
must be as small as possible.

183
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,599
The standard is 20 millimeters.

184
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,069
We'll try 12.

185
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:43,969
Twelve millimeters.

186
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,307
It's the same size
as the Snipe's diameter.

187
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,776
That's our limit.

188
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,647
Even one small slip of the finger

189
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,350
will tear the muscle
and cause massive bleeding.

190
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,354
It can be done in theory.

191
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,659
We'll operate in one week.

192
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,396
Perform more tests
on her blood coagulation.

193
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,864
-Right.
-Okay.

194
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,446
The truth is…

195
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,383
there's less than
a five-percent success rate.

196
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,486
Five percent?

197
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,656
Before I finish my paper,

198
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,092
OVER LETHAL DOSE

199
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,193
we must save her.

200
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,999
No matter the cost.

201
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,039
-Soy sauce ramen.
-Looks great.

202
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,108
-Soy sauce<i> chashu </i>ramen.
-Thank you.

203
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,610
-Let's eat.
-Please enjoy.

204
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,479
So, no matter the results
of the operation,

205
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,249
your name will appear in the paper?

206
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,619
Yes. Those were my conditions.

207
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,089
Don't you think it's funny?

208
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,727
Elite adults like you would go
to such lengths for a single paper.

209
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,596
What we want isn't just the paper.

210
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,032
It's Impact Factor.

211
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,901
It really is true.

212
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,805
For a doctor, the Impact Factor
is really like your Michelin stars.

213
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,275
This restaurant became famous overnight

214
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,310
when it received its first star.

215
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,211
That's right.

216
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,649
But for us, those stars
also determine the chairman election.

217
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,286
That's why I'll do whatever it takes.

218
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,489
Even if it makes me look bad.

219
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,559
The winner takes all.

220
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,997
It's a good look. Scars and all.

221
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,871
TOJO HOSPITAL
DR. TOKAI

222
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,508
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

223
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,882
I have something to ask of you.

224
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,320
Twelve millimeters is impossible.

225
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,157
The procedure will damage
the surrounding blood vessels.

226
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,961
Theoretically, it can be done.

227
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,265
We have to try.

228
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,869
<i>In the days leading up</i>
<i>to Koharu's operation,</i>

229
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,638
<i>Dr. Takashina began to show his worry.</i>

230
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,745
Don't worry, Koharu.

231
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,081
I'll help you get better.

232
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,987
I promise.

233
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,463
Promise.

234
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,901
Yeah.

235
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,818
<i>Dr. Takashina is amazing.</i>

236
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,589
He's doing tests, verifications
and simulations all day long,

237
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,059
then writing the paper at night,
and more testing, on his own.

238
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,161
When does he sleep?

239
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,300
I respect him, honestly.

240
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,671
At first, I thought he was
just a smart-ass.

241
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,308
-But he's way tougher than both of us.
-You're right.

242
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,744
Unlike that sloth Tokai over there.

243
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,581
That's supposed to be our nap room.

244
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,616
You're right.

245
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,656
Which room?

246
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,624
This way!

247
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,228
-What happened?
-Doctor.

248
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,430
Sudden heart failure.

249
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,332
-We need oxygen and a diuretic.
-Okay.

250
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,733
-Mask, please.
-Take over.

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,802
-You'll be okay.
-Oxygen, hurry.

252
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,038
Acute MR.

253
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,073
MITRAL REGURGITATION

254
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,607
He needs emergency surgery.

255
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,678
-We'll use the Snipe.
-Right.

256
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,246
Take him to OR one.

257
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,681
I've contacted the head nurse.

258
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,582
-Right.
-Okay.

259
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,818
I've brought the Snipe.

260
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,721
Let's take a look at the mitral valve
with ultrasound.

261
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,622
On screen.

262
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,858
Preparing to insert the Snipe.

263
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,627
Wait. I can see vegetation
on the mitral valve.

264
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,695
VEGETATION = BACTERIAL MASS

265
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,332
If we use an artificial valve,
the bacteria will get damaged and spread.

266
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,503
-We can't use the Snipe.
-Then what should we do?

267
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,706
The large arteries have calcified.
We can't stop the heart.

268
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,142
We must use the Saeki Method.

269
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,411
Don't be absurd,
Dr. Saeki isn't here today!

270
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,814
Um, this patient… is Dr. Tokai's patient.

271
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,552
We must call him. He's the only one.

272
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,590
-Go now!
-Right.

273
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,360
We'll perform a central incision.
Get the heart-lung machine.

274
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,261
-Understood.
-Right.

275
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,596
-Take over.
-Miyamoto, take this.

276
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,999
Excuse me, Dr. Tokai!

277
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,736
There has been an emergency
in Operating Room one.

278
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,871
You have to come with me.

279
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,175
I decline.

280
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:24,910
What?

281
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,211
He won't come?

282
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,949
He says it's because he was ordered
not to get involved by the doctor.

283
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,086
-Can you put him on the line for me?
<i>-Okay.</i>

284
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,621
Excuse me…

285
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,794
I'll put it on speaker.

286
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,031
Dr. Tokai, can you hear me? Dr. Tokai?

287
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,900
Be quiet. It's the middle of the night.

288
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,669
It's Mr. Murakami from Room 314.

289
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,438
He's your patient.

290
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,775
He needs mitral valve surgery now.
But we can't use the Snipe.

291
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,611
We must perform the Saeki Method.
We need you.

292
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,382
I told you.
The doctor ordered me not to operate.

293
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,416
But…

294
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,086
You're the only one
who can help this patient.

295
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,588
-Blood pressure 50.
-He's in septic shock.

296
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,557
-Give him norepinephrine.
-Okay.

297
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,192
Dr. Tokai. I'm begging you to come.

298
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,960
Please, Dr. Tokai.

299
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,963
-Saline, hurry!
-Right.

300
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,551
Body temperature is at 39 degrees Celsius.

301
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,253
The vegetation is peeling off.

302
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,988
We must perform the Saeki Method now.

303
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,091
At this rate clumps of bacteria
will spread through the body.

304
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,760
We're out of time.

305
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,205
Dr. Saeki…

306
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,908
The head nurse…

307
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,376
-Miyamoto, a gown.
-Okay.

308
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,147
The doctor just returned from his seminar
and rushed over to assist us.

309
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,149
-Take over.
-Okay.

310
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,084
Fill me in.

311
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,953
Acute MR from infective endocarditis.

312
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,090
And vegetation on the mitral valve.

313
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,660
-That's why you can't use the Snipe.
-Yes, that's correct.

314
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,097
We'll remove the infected area
and repair the valves.

315
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,198
Pardon me.

316
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,301
-Scalpel.
-Clear the field.

317
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,471
-Where are those suctions?
-Sorry. Coming right away.

318
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,539
No need.

319
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,674
My finger will guide me.

320
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>The Saeki Method.</i>

321
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,347
Metz.

322
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,896
Metz.

323
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,436
-Black forceps.
-Right.

324
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,181
<i>Incredible.</i>

325
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,419
<i>This man really is a god.</i>

326
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>Compared to Dr. Tokai,</i>

327
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,024
<i>He's…</i>

328
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,673
Professor!

329
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,978
Thank you so much.

330
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,880
Sorry for the commotion.

331
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,150
We tried to call Dr. Tokai, but…

332
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,120
I told him to stay out of it.

333
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,855
There's no problem.

334
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,425
These were unforeseen circumstances.

335
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,661
You did everything you could.

336
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,763
Dr. Takashina.

337
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,133
Treatment doesn't always
go according to simulations.

338
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,477
If he's going to follow
the doctor's orders now,

339
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,747
I wish he would have agreed
to do Koharu's operation.

340
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,918
Dr. Tokai said
he has never let a patient die.

341
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,790
I was hopeful that Dr. Tokai

342
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,860
could take care
of Koharu's Snipe surgery as well.

343
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,897
Why did he decline that one order?

344
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,836
Isn't that why?

345
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:45,837
What?

346
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,043
Isn't that why Dr. Tokai said no?

347
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,654
MOM

348
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,391
What is it?

349
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,062
What's with you? Someone sounds sleepy.

350
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,197
Are you eating well?

351
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,498
Every day.

352
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,035
Japanese bodies are made out of rice.

353
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,971
How many times are you going to say that?
What do you want?

354
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,775
I sent some for you to give
to Dr. Saeki as well.

355
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,177
What?

356
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,746
He's taken good care of both
my husband and my son.

357
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,482
Make sure he gets it, will you?

358
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,484
<i>-Bye!</i>
-Hey, wait!

359
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,199
He's good.

360
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,234
He sure is. I bet you could do it too.

361
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,235
Hello, Koharu.

362
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,703
-Hello.
-Hello.

363
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,706
-Do you like soccer?
-Yes.

364
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,976
I'll be able to play soon, they said.

365
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,480
Dr. Takashina promised
to make me all better.

366
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,115
That's great.

367
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,751
When your surgery is done
and you're all better,

368
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,619
let's play soccer with Dr. Takashina.

369
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:08,920
Yeah.

370
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:26,171
So, as soon as the child's operation
is finished you'll have the paper, right?

371
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,874
Yes. I'm sure you'll be pleased.

372
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,742
Isn't it a dangerous operation?

373
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,145
If it fails,

374
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:37,048
Dr. Takashina will have to take
responsibility as operating surgeon.

375
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,251
The paper is nearly complete.

376
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,486
And so is Dr. Takashina's role.

377
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,555
<i>If it fails,</i>

378
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,693
we will just remove Dr. Takashina's name.

379
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,375
RICE

380
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,210
Why do you have so much rice?

381
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,755
Don't touch it.

382
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,591
Sorry.

383
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,551
<i>Koharu would die of blood loss</i>
<i>within 24 hours of surgery.</i>

384
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,014
<i>I'll help you get better.</i>

385
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,083
<i>I promise.</i>

386
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,020
<i>Promise.</i>

387
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,899
Dr. Tokai.

388
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,835
You're almost done with the paper, right?

389
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,274
If you are, I don't see the need
for doing this surgery.

390
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,713
It is true that whether we fail
or succeed,

391
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,249
it will not affect our seniors.

392
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,018
They only care about my paper.

393
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,355
I'm fully aware of it, too.

394
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,826
But this surgery…

395
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,968
Koharu was born
with a deficient mitral valve

396
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,437
<i>and I've seen her in pain.</i>

397
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:51,343
<i>As hard as I tried, I wasn't able</i>
<i>to give her the help she needed.</i>

398
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,380
The reason I first
took an interest in the Snipe

399
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,918
was my hope to save Koharu.

400
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,321
The Snipe exists because of her.

401
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,125
After bowing down
and begging the professor,

402
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,829
I was able to bring it to Japan.

403
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,368
This time, betraying the professor
and swearing loyalty to the enemy,

404
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,405
I've finally made it
to the deciding moment.

405
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,109
If I can't save her,

406
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,845
neither the Snipe nor the paper
will be complete.

407
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,150
I've finally made it this far.

408
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,922
I've practiced the operation 30 times.

409
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,526
And all 30 times,

410
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,863
I killed her.

411
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,833
While it's feasible in theory,

412
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,069
with my current skill,

413
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,571
it's impossible!

414
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,977
I thought if we had the Snipe,

415
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,646
if we had the newest technology,

416
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,382
we would be able to save her.

417
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,321
Koharu is counting on me.
She believes in me.

418
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,224
I promised…

419
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:15,760
I would save her.

420
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,598
But as things are,
I may not be able to save her.

421
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,335
I might end up…

422
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,373
taking her life.

423
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,785
Dr. Tokai.

424
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,122
Use the Snipe.

425
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,562
And help me.

426
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,309
That's some excuse.

427
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,680
Why don't you kill her?

428
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,349
Or how about…

429
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,085
you die yourself?

430
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,289
It's impossible with that Snipe.

431
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,429
Move it.

432
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,103
Dr. Tokai.

433
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,774
Why did you say it's impossible?

434
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,612
Do you mean to say

435
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,415
that even in your hands,
the Snipe would still fail?

436
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,086
No matter a surgeon's skill,

437
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,923
you can't operate with a dull knife.

438
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,296
The Snipe's blueprints.
Why do you have these?

439
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,901
The issue is that the body
of that thing is too large.

440
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,812
Those are Koharu's CT scans.

441
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,949
If we don't want to damage the veins,
we'll have to go through them.

442
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,051
Through the veins?

443
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,287
With a catheter?

444
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,891
If we enter the veins through her thighs,
we'll arrive at the heart.

445
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,595
<i>But that route will lead us</i>
<i>to the right atrium.</i>

446
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,462
RIGHT ATRIUM

447
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,364
<i>The mitral valve is near the left atrium.</i>

448
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,332
LEFT ATRIUM
MITRAL VALVE

449
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,402
<i>A catheter can't go</i>
<i>through the septum wall.</i>

450
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,439
<i>That's why the Snipe was developed</i>
<i>to reach the mitral valve directly.</i>

451
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,376
-Using a catheter is old-fashioned now.
-Listen to me.

452
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,545
We'll attach the Snipe…

453
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,381
…to the catheter.

454
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,219
The Snipe's artificial valve system
on a catheter?

455
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,624
There's a small tear in her septum wall.

456
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,562
<i>We'll go through there.</i>

457
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,734
If we can get to the mitral valve,
we'll only have to replace the valve.

458
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,771
Using a catheter like that…

459
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,275
What's the point of new technology
if it can't be used?

460
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,911
Old methods have their strengths.

461
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,615
Medicine isn't always
about progress alone.

462
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,086
But there's still one problem.

463
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,490
A complicated operation like this…

464
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,461
You're the only one who can do it.

465
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,865
I'm not allowed to.

466
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,003
You heard what the doctor told me.

467
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,876
So that's what this is.

468
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,679
From the very start,

469
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,583
you wanted to be the operating surgeon.

470
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,352
What will you do?

471
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,869
I have something
to talk to you about, professor.

472
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,374
I would like to request that Dr. Tokai

473
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,476
perform Koharu's Snipe surgery.

474
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:30,348
Please permit him to return
to the operating room.

475
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,587
Bowing your head for a man like that…

476
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,358
Wasn't it you who wanted him out?

477
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,131
Please permit Dr. Tokai
to be the operating surgeon.

478
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,302
It's fine by me.

479
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,671
It was me, after all,

480
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,741
who ordered him to operate
with the Snipe in the first place.

481
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,277
Dr. Tokai will do the surgery.

482
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,713
There should be no issue.

483
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,285
In medicine, having the right tools
is a necessity.

484
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,287
But so is having skill.

485
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,692
Be there to assist him
and give him your support.

486
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,563
Of course, I will.

487
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,000
I promise we will succeed.

488
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,238
<i>The fateful day finally arrived.</i>

489
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,774
-Has it started?
-Soon.

490
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,495
We will now perform off-pump
mitral valve surgery using the new Snipe.

491
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,729
-Ultrasound.
-Here.

492
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,699
-Bring that closer.
-Okay.

493
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,571
Okay.

494
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,573
Dr. Tokai is really the operating surgeon?

495
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,779
-Guidewire.
-Here.

496
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,592
Snipe preparations complete.

497
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,828
-New Snipe, please.
-Okay.

498
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,647
I'm going in.

499
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,353
It's in. Take over.

500
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,894
-Catheter.
-Here.

501
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,244
They attached the Snipe's artificial
valve system to the tip of a catheter.

502
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,546
That should help prevent hemorrhaging.

503
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,985
Did Tokai ask you to hand over
the Snipe blueprints?

504
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,290
I was only helping to make
this surgery a success.

505
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,565
Arriving at the right atrium soon.

506
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,336
RIGHT ATRIUM

507
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,737
Already in the right atrium?

508
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,607
Who knew he could use
a catheter as skillfully as that?

509
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,311
We reached the right atrium.

510
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,115
They're in.

511
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,818
Next is the hard part.

512
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,457
<i>They'll have to break through the wall</i>
<i>that connects to the left atrium.</i>

513
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:04,729
<i>It seems they planned on passing through</i>
<i>a small hole in the patient's heart,</i>

514
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,566
<i>but even a slight miscalculation</i>
<i>could cause a blockage</i>

515
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,835
<i>and lead to cardiac abnormalities.</i>

516
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,905
And in this case, even sudden death.

517
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,674
Can they really push it
through something so narrow?

518
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,342
Dr. Tokai.

519
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,578
Proceed through the septum wall

520
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,480
on my signal.

521
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,017
When the hole is at its widest point…

522
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,686
I'll give the signal.

523
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,566
SEPTUM - MITRAL VALVE

524
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,975
Not yet.

525
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,249
Not yet.

526
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,060
Now!

527
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,145
We're through.

528
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,680
SEPTUM - MITRAL VALVE

529
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,948
We're in the left atrium.

530
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,817
-Wow!
-They did it!

531
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,052
On top of Dr. Tokai's skills,

532
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,322
Dr. Takashina has the brains
and knows Koharu's condition best.

533
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,224
The best team.

534
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,262
All right. Now, to replace the valve.

535
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,166
We're at the mitral valve.

536
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,335
Dr. Tokai.

537
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,859
Valve replacement complete.

538
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,929
The valve is functioning!

539
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,198
-Yes!
-Amazing!

540
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,566
Amazing!

541
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,001
They did it.

542
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,383
I'll finish up.

543
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,690
Dr. Tokai.

544
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,027
Thank you.

545
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,873
We'll close up the septum hole.

546
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,542
-Take over.
-Okay.

547
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,561
What you said to me before,
is that how you really feel?

548
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,131
If you don't need them anymore,
give them to me.

549
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,933
Your black forceps.

550
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,509
Tojo University will be seeing
significant growth.

551
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,412
This is the transitional period.

552
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,715
You don't need to worry.

553
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,319
I just ask that you continue
to support me.

554
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,989
Believe in me.

555
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,959
I give you my deepest gratitude.

556
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,597
Do you understand it now?
It's more than just Teika's research.

557
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,667
Because of its practical use
at Tojo University,

558
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,502
the Snipe's potential has been realized.

559
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,072
If we work together,

560
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,141
your ideal world

561
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,278
where healthcare is provided
equally to everyone

562
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,580
can become a reality.

563
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,785
I will definitely make it work.

564
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,893
Believe in me.

565
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,999
I'll be looking forward to the paper.

566
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,748
Dr. Tokai.

567
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,022
Why is it that you're loyal
only to Dr. Saeki

568
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,358
and no one else?

569
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,395
Do you trust him that much?

570
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,266
Well, it doesn't matter.

571
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,036
So what will it be this time?

572
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,807
I'm ready to pay what you ask.

573
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,812
I'll lend it to you.

574
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,447
What?

575
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,182
Next time, it won't be money

576
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,852
that I'll ask you to pay with.

577
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:11,996
Don't believe him.

578
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,833
Dr. Seigo Saeki.

579
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,236
Don't believe him.

580
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,140
When he feels threatened,

581
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,077
that man won't hesitate
to cut ties with anyone

582
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,148
as he sees fit.

583
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,417
Anyone at all.

584
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,421
Even his closest allies.

585
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,066

JAPAN SURGICAL JOURNAL

587
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,567
Forgive me. But you must understand.

588
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,671
Whatever punishment you choose to give me

589
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:02,873
I will accept.

590
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,210
I'll be excused now.

591
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,756
So everything is going according to
your original plan?

592
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,991
I'm impressed.

593
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:27,064
Unfortunately, that's a risk
I cannot afford to take.

594
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:32,269
But I'm sure Dr. Saeki will accept.

595
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,139
Just pretend to go along
with their proposal.

596
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,008
Use them to your heart's desire.

597
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:42,312
If the operation succeeds,
we'll have a great case in our hands.

598
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,118
With that, you'll be ready
to finish the paper.

599
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,755
The Impact Factor
will go to Dr. Nishizaki,

600
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,391
and of course, to me.

601
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,530
That's it.

602
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,933
I have no more use for Tojo.

Show them the real strength
of Teika University.

607
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,814
It's showtime.

608
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:51,715
Let's go.

609
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,753
Koharu has always believed in you,
Dr. Takashina.

610
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,021
You said we can change the rules.
