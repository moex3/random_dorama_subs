1
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,947
Dr. Saeki will be hurting from this one.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,115
Either way,

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,553
I must thank you for helping me raise
my Impact Factor significantly.

4
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,458
<i>Dr. Takashina used Professor Saeki,</i>
<i>completed the Snipe surgery,</i>

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,329
<i>only to list Dr. Nishizaki's name</i>
<i>at the end of his paper.</i>

6
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,233
<i>With this, Dr. Nishizaki's Impact Factor</i>
<i>had overtaken Dr. Saeki's,</i>

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,970
<i>virtually guaranteeing his victory</i>
<i>in the chairman election.</i>

8
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,781
-I guess this makes you top of the class.
-Dr. Matsuoka.

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,350
I couldn't pull off what you did.

10
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,217
JIN MATSUOKA

11
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,254
Working at a two-bit hospital like Tojo,

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,658
sucking up to the local doctors
to gather new cases.

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,160
Don't get it twisted.

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,596
I was there to help patients.
Nothing more.

15
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,700
Without treatment,
there would be no research.

16
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,950
I bet they set up a special position
for you at Teika, right?

17
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,954
It will be sad to part ways,

18
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,424
but once Koharu Shimano is discharged,

19
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,926
I will also be leaving.

20
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,765
POSTOPERATIVE RESULTS

21
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,412
KOHARU SHIMANO

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,513
<i>Soccer?</i>

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,647
Yeah.

24
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,617
She made a promise with Dr. Sera

25
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,452
to play soccer together once she's better.

26
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,590
-Can we?
-Koharu, the doctors are busy.

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,660
Sure.

28
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,264
We'll play soccer soon.

29
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,833
It's a promise.

30
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,568
Yay!

31
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,505
-I'll do my best to get better.
-Good.

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,309
Oh, Koharu!

33
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,280
Is Dr. Takashina quitting Tojo University?

34
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,416
After what happened…

35
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,553
But the operation was a success.

36
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,189
Koharu looked so happy.

37
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,458
Hmm… I think

38
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,562
Dr. Takashina is a wonderful doctor
from the patient's perspective.

39
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,963
Isn't that enough?

40
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:49,636
I don't know much about research
or academic papers.

41
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,407
Whatever people may think,

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,944
he was able to bring Koharu
back from the brink.

43
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,183
If that doesn't make him a good doctor…

44
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,619
<i>Dr. Takashina.</i>

45
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,155
Yes?

46
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,463
Um…

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,401
Why didn't you put Dr. Saeki's name
at the end of the paper?

48
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,274
I'll be looking forward to the paper.

49
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,110
Dr. Seigo Saeki… Don't believe him.

50
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,547
To Dr. Saeki, the Snipe…

51
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,283
was nothing more than
a tool to win the election.

52
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,588
I only chose Dr. Nishizaki
so that I can continue to save lives

53
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,990
utilizing the Snipe.

54
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,492
Remember…

55
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,533
pretty words alone
can't save a single life.

56
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,442
<i>And so, the battle over the Snipe</i>
<i>was brought to an end.</i>

57
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,311
<i>But more foul play was at hand…</i>

58
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,018
This is why you should order
to have detailed blood tests done.

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,152
KOHARU SHIMANO

60
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,288
BODY TEMPERATURE

61
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,657
I see.

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,565
<i>Are you being serious?</i>

63
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,668
Yes. My name was included
in the <i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,670
as a contributing author.

65
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,607
I request the removal
of the Snipe paper from the <i>Journal</i>.

66
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,311
Dr. Saeki,

67
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,446
you realize the removal of the paper

68
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,117
will also cause significant damage
to your own career.

69
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,318
I'm well aware.

70
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,555
As a doctor, I cannot allow
for an unfinished paper to be made public.

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,093
But the final case with that
seven-year-old girl was very valuable

72
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,096
<i>as the surgery could</i>
<i>only succeed thanks to the Snipe.</i>

73
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,399
I believe the success of that operation

74
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,801
more than justifies
the publication of the paper.

75
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,738
Unfortunately, that patient
is still in the hospital,

76
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,341
and she is scheduled
for advanced blood testing.

77
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,909
-Blood tests?
-Yes.

78
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,011
Just in case.

79
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,383
In that case,

80
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,321
we can make a formal decision
after the blood tests come back, correct?

81
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,522
Very well.

82
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,697
Mr. Ikenaga.

83
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,634
You seem to be quite invested
in this paper.

84
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,405
I believe it is impressive research.

85
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,909
Or is it because
it's Dr. Nishizaki's paper?

86
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,513
Goodbye. We will talk soon.

87
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,786
<i>Withdraw the paper?</i>

88
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,256
Dr. Saeki came to us
to negotiate with the <i>Journal </i>directly.

89
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,561
He said that the last Snipe patient
needs more blood tests.

90
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,431
I can't believe it.
He's just being a sore loser.

91
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:09,402
We cannot simply ignore
what Dr. Saeki proposed.

92
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,672
Finish the tests
and get that patient out of there.

93
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,340
Got it?

94
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:15,808
Understood.

95
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,643
<i>Well, well…</i>

96
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,313
Dr. Saeki is full of surprises, isn't he?

97
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,485
You don't plan on giving up
your Impact Factor that easily,

98
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,919
do you?

99
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,188
You seem to be enjoying this.

100
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,659
A clash of the elite. What's not to enjoy?

101
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,601
STATUS: NORMAL

102
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,236
There's no problem here.

103
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,872
She'll be discharged.

104
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,510
<i>What?</i>

105
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>According to blood tests,</i>

106
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,348
there's an infection
in her heart's septum.

107
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417
She'll need treatment right away.

108
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,317
<i>Wait.</i>

109
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,286
<i>If it's an infection in the septum,</i>

110
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,156
it wouldn't be unheard of to miss it.

111
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,691
-What?
-Pretend you didn't catch it.

112
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,827
Have her discharged.

113
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,566
If the public finds out
that the Snipe has caused an infection,

114
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,602
it would be a good reason
to have the paper withdrawn.

115
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,206
<i>If she leaves the hospital,</i>
<i>the cause will remain unknown.</i>

116
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,941
-But…
-This is an order.

117
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,913
<i>If you wish to succeed as a researcher,</i>
<i>you need to think ahead.</i>

118
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,615
Dr. Takashina.

119
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,393
Hello, Dr. Takashina.

120
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,061
-Hello.
-Hi.

121
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,297
Koharu will be released soon.

122
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,065
She's almost ready to play soccer.

123
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,402
Yes. That's right.

124
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,777
What is it?

125
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,582
DISCHARGE PERMISSION FORM

126
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,716
Turn this in.

127
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,352
When the kid leaves, so do you.

128
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:13,593
And then, the Snipe
will be popularized nationwide.

129
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,531
Saving hundreds of lives. But…

130
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,282
Aren't you happy about your research?

131
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,594
Dr. Takashina, what was that about?

132
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,034
We'll be able to release Koharu, won't we?

133
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
Dr. Takashina…

134
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,942
<i>Dr. Takashina promised</i>
<i>to make me all better.</i>

135
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,343
<i>Don't worry, Koharu.</i>

136
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,312
<i>I'll help you get better.</i>

137
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,480
<i>I promise.</i>

138
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,748
<i>We'll play soccer soon.</i>

139
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,884
<i>Yay! I'll do my best to get better!</i>

140
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,919
<i>Promise.</i>

141
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,193
<i>Pretend you didn't catch it.</i>
<i>Have her discharged.</i>

142
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,436
I'm such a fool.

143
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,612
DISCHARGE PERMISSION FORM

144
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,084
I…

145
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,522
am a doctor.

146
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,729
<i>What do you want?</i>

147
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,763
It's Koharu Shimano--

148
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,868
This is about
the infection in her heart, I presume?

149
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,104
So you knew about it.

150
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,507
I need you to call
an emergency conference.

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,713
Aren't things working out well for you?

152
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,784
Didn't you say you were finished
with Tojo University?

153
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,122
How did the infection happen?

154
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,925
During the last operation,

155
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,194
<i>we closed a hole in the septum wall.</i>

156
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,295
SEPTUM
MITRAL VALVE

157
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,931
<i>However, the stopper came loose.</i>

158
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,600
<i>We can assume the infection started there.</i>

159
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,768
I see.

160
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,504
If such dangerous risks are involved,

161
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,841
we'll have to reduce the use
of the Snipe at our hospital.

162
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,378
Wait a moment.
The Snipe isn't the direct cause.

163
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,380
You will share the patient's details

164
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,849
at the conference.

165
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,387
So they've named
the Snipe operation as the cause.

166
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,223
No, the operation itself was a success.

167
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,025
<i>No matter the results of the operation,</i>

168
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,028
if we cannot earn
the Impact Factor, it's a failure!

169
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,264
You have nowhere to return to.

170
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,567
I don't want to see your face ever again!

171
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,843
Is it Dr. Takashina?

172
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,512
What?

173
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,815
Takashi…

174
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,118
Who the hell is that?

175
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,588
Mr. Matsuoka.

176
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,828
I have high expectations for you.

177
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,531
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,405
<i>And so the Snipe paper</i>

179
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,407
<i>returned to blank pages.</i>

180
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,944
<i>Dr. Nishizaki's Impact Factor was reduced,</i>

181
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,381
<i>putting Dr. Saeki back in the lead.</i>

182
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,469
An infection has been confirmed
in Koharu's septum wall.

183
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,773
If the bacteria spreads,
her heart could fail at any moment.

184
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,411
We must operate immediately
to remove the infection.

185
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,616
It has been decided that due to her blood
being unable to congeal,

186
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,686
a thoracotomy is extremely dangerous.

187
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,956
Dr. Tokai. What do you think?

188
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,092
We can't operate.

189
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,295
We should try medication.

190
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,565
Let's take a further look
at medicinal treatment.

191
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,200
This concludes the conference.

192
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:50,903
Wait.

193
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,275
There is one other way we can save her.

194
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,479
You're saying that now? What is it?

195
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,215
The Darwin.

196
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,655
Darwin?

197
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,926
<i>Darwin.</i>
<i>A surgical robot developed in America.</i>

198
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,429
<i>With a high-spec camera</i>
<i>and three operating arms,</i>

199
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,231
<i>it can perform</i>
<i>extremely precise operations.</i>

200
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:24,904
<i>Unlike standard thoracotomy,</i>
<i>it needs only small holes to operate,</i>

201
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,705
<i>greatly reducing any bleeding.</i>

202
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,142
<i>Darwin could work for Koharu's surgery.</i>

203
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,412
Yes, we might be able to use the Darwin.

204
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,286
We don't have a Darwin in Tojo.

205
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,989
Not at Tojo, but there is one at Teika.

206
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,862
We'll release the patient to Teika
and operate there.

207
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,898
Are you saying
we just give up our patient to Teika?

208
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,201
It would be shameful
to give her right back!

209
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,837
It's the only way to save her.

210
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,206
Even if that's so,

211
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,642
will Dr. Nishizaki even accept
your suggestion?

212
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,677
That's…

213
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,816
As of today, I'm removing you
as attending physician.

214
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,987
Koharu Shimano's new doctor will be…

215
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,891
Dr. Tokai.

216
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,727
Conference concluded.

217
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,666
<i>First at Teika University,</i>
<i>and now, at Tojo.</i>

218
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,668
<i>Dr. Takashina lost his standing.</i>

219
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,740
<i>Meanwhile, Dr. Tokai took over</i>
<i>as attending physician.</i>

220
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,609
<i>To care for Koharu,</i>

221
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,311
<i>he introduced a blood-producing medicine</i>
<i>called Nespa.</i>

222
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,548
-Her hemoglobin count is 12.
-Give her 20 ml of Nespa.

223
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,449
Right.

224
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,152
Where's Dr. Takashina?

225
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,589
Isn't he coming today?

226
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,324
Listen, Koharu.

227
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,962
Instead of Dr. Takashina,
Dr. Tokai will be taking care of you now.

228
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,298
Koharu.

229
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,136
Dr. Takashina is off the team.

230
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,073
Off the team?

231
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,376
-What is…
-Don't mind him.

232
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,378
Cut it out, will you?

233
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,981
All you need to do is relax, okay?

234
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,650
Okay…

235
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,551
Koharu is still a child.

236
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,520
You can't say things like "off the team"…

237
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,289
Choose your words better.

238
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,259
Dr. Tokai.

239
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,062
These are Koharu's documents.

240
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,569
How long do you plan
on continuing medicinal treatment?

241
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,470
Who knows?

242
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,808
Nespa does increase blood count,
but it will not cure her completely.

243
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,976
Wait a second.

244
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,613
-If her condition gets worse…
-If that girl loses her life,

245
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,848
it will be blamed on the Snipe.

246
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,586
Dr. Nishizaki will be responsible too
as the person who promoted it.

247
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,057
You got orders from Dr. Saeki, didn't you?

248
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,528
So what?

249
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,167
You do it then.

250
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,874
You do it.

251
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,218
How's the medicinal treatment going?

252
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,555
Who knows? We just started.

253
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,325
A doctor like you choosing
medicinal treatment is quite a surprise.

254
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,861
I use medicine like any other doctor.

255
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,399
As long as it helps my clinical trials,
I don't mind either way.

256
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,771
Koharu. It's almost time
for your medicine.

257
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,309
He said Dr. Takashina is off the team…

258
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,049
Don't worry.

259
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,321
He'll be back. I know it.

260
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,189
Really?

261
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,759
He promised, didn't he?

262
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,562
It'll be okay,
so keep doing your best, alright?

263
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,264
Okay.

264
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,235
Let's take your medicine now.

265
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,313
Dr. Takashina.
The results of Koharu's new tests.

266
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,183
-Here it is.
-Thanks.

267
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,388
She's stable, thanks to the medicine.

268
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,124
But it can't go on forever.

269
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,627
She won't live much longer.

270
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,030
Can't we do something?

271
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,671
Koharu has always believed in you,
Dr. Takashina.

272
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,408
You're the only one she can depend on.

273
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,777
But you…

274
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,515
Don't give up so easily.

275
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,494
You said we can change the rules.

276
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,831
You have to change the rules.

277
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,699
You must carry on with Koharu's operation.

278
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,080
Dr. Takashina!

279
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,551
It's Mr. Makino in 302.
He has taken a turn for the worse.

280
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,589
-Mr. Makino, can you hear me?
-Mr. Makino!

281
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,190
-Deep breaths.
-Mr. Makino!

282
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,059
-Thromboembolism of the lungs.
-Mr. Makino!

283
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,461
-Who's on duty?
-Dr. Sekikawa and Dr. Tokai.

284
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,298
I've brought Dr. Tokai.

285
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,101
Dr. Tokai. Take a look.

286
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,838
What a pain in the ass.

287
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,542
The right and left pulmonary arteries
are totally clogged. Furthermore…

288
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,378
<i>a heart operation in his youth</i>
<i>left severe adhesions</i>

289
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>so a thoracotomy is out of the question.</i>

290
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,816
We can't operate.

291
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,757
There is one way.

292
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,061
We open from the left
and remove the blood clots.

293
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,799
Both from the left? Is that even possible?

294
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,869
It has never been done,
at least not in Japan.

295
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,004
What do you mean?

296
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,642
I assisted at such a surgery
during my time in America.

297
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,945
There's no way you could do it.
You were just an assistant.

298
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,314
Move it.

299
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,717
No.

300
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,253
I'll do it.

301
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,328
Dr. Tokai, please assist me.

302
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,098
Sometimes you need to change the rules.

303
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,536
I'll take responsibility.

304
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,739
What?

305
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,258
Dr. Tokai, please assist me.

306
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,895
Sometimes you need to change the rules.

307
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,899
I'll take responsibility.

308
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,087
We'll now begin the removal of blood clots
within the pulmonary arteries.

309
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,121
Cooper.

310
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,200
Dr. Sekikawa. Start the heart-lung machine
and lower it to 18 degrees.

311
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,134
Okay.

312
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,540
-Scalpel.
-Here.

313
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,748
-Halt circulation.
-Right.

314
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,917
Let's remove the clots.
Magill forceps, please.

315
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,153
-Here.
-Miwa, bring the 4-0.

316
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,221
Right.

317
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,667
<i>Amazing. Such a delicate operation…</i>

318
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,803
<i>This is Dr. Takashina's real skill.</i>

319
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,550
-Metz.
-Right.

320
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,021
Operation complete.

321
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,557
Vitals all clear.

322
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,828
You look like you're about to die.

323
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,875
Dr. Takashina.

324
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,112
Forgive me for earlier.

325
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,518
I might be out of place asking this,

326
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:40,058
but how will I take
responsibility for this?

327
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,996
Thanks to you, I've finally realized…

328
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,437
I have nothing else to lose.

329
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,606
But…

330
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,944
That's why I have more work to do.

331
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,418
Tell Koharu that I'll be back soon.

332
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,555
Okay.

333
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,064
Hey. What are you doing here?

334
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:25,170
Dr. Nishizaki.
Dr. Saeki plans to let Koharu die.

335
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,239
If the patient dies,

336
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:31,676
you will take responsibility
for the Snipe's role in her death.

337
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,578
Is that a threat?

338
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,581
May I use the Darwin?

339
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,950
What?

340
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,653
That's not what I expected to hear.

341
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,157
Darwin is Teika's star surgeon.

342
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,059
I can't allow such a high-risk patient
to transfer

343
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,028
in case the surgery fails.

344
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,130
I won't be transferring her.

345
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,166
I wish to borrow Darwin.

346
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,069
-Borrow?
-That's right.

347
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,039
There will be no trouble for Teika.

348
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,141
If there are any problems,

349
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,680
I will take full responsibility
as part of Dr. Saeki's department.

350
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,018
I'm begging you.

351
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:15,987
Fine.

352
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:23,929
But I don't plan on letting you use it.

353
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,268
Dr. Matsuoka.
The Darwin is your specialty.

354
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,472
This is a chance for us
to gather new cases.

355
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,076
Show Tojo the real strength
of Teika University.

356
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,778
Leave it to me.

357
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,316
I will succeed, Dr. Nishizaki.
You have my word.

358
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,622
-Dr. Matsuoka as operating surgeon?
-Yes. That was the condition.

359
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,293
Acting quite recklessly, don't you think?

360
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,798
I no longer have anything to lose.

361
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,440
Very well.

362
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,642
Thank you.

363
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,345
I'll begin preparations right away.

364
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,751
<i>And so, the Darwin came</i>
<i>to Tojo University.</i>

365
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,095
It doesn't even compare to the Snipe.

366
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:34,499
Four arms. That's a robot all right.

367
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,385
Amazing. It can write on a grain of rice?

368
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,620
Rice is for eating.

369
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:57,923
What?

370
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,190
NAP ROOM

371
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,625
I had heard rumors,

372
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,961
but it can really write
on a grain of rice.

373
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,499
Like the common folk watching
the Black Ships' arrival in Edo, right?

374
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,267
You bunch of hillbillies.

375
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,270
<i>Hillbillies?</i>

376
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,243
That's what he called us?

377
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,612
He gives me a bad feeling.

378
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,785
How long do they plan
on using this medicine?

379
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,854
Dr. Tokai said they would use it
until the operating day.

380
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,524
Really? Until the very end?

381
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,392
It must be doing something.

382
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,264
Trial medicine… something to do
with receiving cooperation funding?

383
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,999
That's part of it, right?

384
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,302
<i>So it's all for money in the end?</i>

385
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,578
Mr. Tomizawa.

386
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,246
We've received warm praise

387
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,016
from the Ministry of Health
regarding the Darwin operation.

388
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,051
Thank you for your support.

389
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,822
The world of Japanese medicine
is outdated.

390
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,457
I want to change that.

391
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,194
This will require adopting
the latest medical technologies

392
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,031
and virtually eliminating
the skill gap among surgeons.

393
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,133
I agree completely.

394
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,803
Unfortunately, there are
a number of people that don't.

395
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,973
<i>People with great authority</i>

396
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,509
<i>who favor the skills of a surgeon.</i>

397
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,077
Putting it that way,

398
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,481
the Darwin operation taking place at Tojo

399
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:34,419
could serve to be quite valuable for us.

400
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,693
<i>Simulations of Koharu's</i>
<i>Darwin surgery began.</i>

401
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,543
-Scissors in the left hand.
-Right.

402
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,319
All right. All set.

403
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,056
I have no doubt we'll succeed.

404
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,624
Good job.

405
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,929
Dr. Matsuoka.

406
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,766
This is the first Darwin surgery
on a child, right?

407
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,202
Are you sure it will be okay?

408
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,204
Listen.

409
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,175
Do you know how many times I've done this?

410
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,312
The lot of you at Tojo
are a bunch of killjoys.

411
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,655
Dr. Tokai, here.

412
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,293
-The Darwin documents.
-I don't need them.

413
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,097
I have nothing to gain.

414
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,400
Nothing to benefit from this operation.

415
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,369
The only thing I hope for

416
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,840
is for Koharu's life to be saved.

417
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,911
I will do whatever it takes
to ensure her safety.

418
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,558
People change, huh?

419
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,397
Things change when you lose everything.

420
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,602
But you did help me realize something.

421
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:36,074
In university hospitals,
doctors with no interest in promotions

422
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,408
are the strongest.

423
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,614
Doctors like you, Dr. Tokai.

424
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,962
Excuse me, Dr. Tokai.

425
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,433
Dr. Tokai…

426
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,846
What's this…

427
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,817
<i>The fateful day finally arrived.</i>

428
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,420
He's here.

429
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,511
Greetings, Dr. Saeki.

430
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,947
It has been quite a while.

431
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,584
Likewise. It's good
to see you looking well.

432
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,554
Well, ever since the Snipe paper
was withdrawn,

433
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,989
I haven't slept much.

434
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,025
We should be grateful it was withdrawn
before something bad happened.

435
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,996
Your good name was in jeopardy.

436
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,866
I hear that today's surgery

437
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,301
will be crucial
to the success of the paper.

438
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,204
I hope to learn a lot.

439
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,539
I'm glad you're here.

440
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,709
Dr. Nishizaki. Please, this way.

441
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,915
Live feed, please.

442
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,053
Please begin.

443
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,622
<i>Okay.</i>

444
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:34,692
-Here we go.
-Tojo's first robotic operation.

445
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,697
Koharu…

446
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,568
More. More. Stop.

447
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,270
The cart is in place.

448
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:50,008
We will now begin septum infection
removal surgery with the Darwin.

449
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,943
-Docking.
-Right.

450
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,250
By the way, I heard from a little bird

451
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,621
that your team was planning
to let the patient die.

452
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,258
I'm happy to be able to help.

453
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,561
We're grateful to you
for lending us the Darwin.

454
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,431
And enlisting such a skilled doctor.

455
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,568
Failure seems unlikely,
even in a worst-case scenario.

456
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,304
Of course.

457
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,173
<i>Inserting forceps.</i>

458
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,443
The holes are so small. Will it work?

459
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,312
There's hardly any bleeding.

460
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,981
Maybe the day when we aren't needed
anymore will really come.

461
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,717
No way. I'm not losing to any robot.

462
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,853
But seeing something like this…

463
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,058
All right. It's showtime.

464
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,902
The tip of the forceps
have reached the pericardium.

465
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,805
-Set the electroscalpel to 25.
-Right.

466
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,942
Starting the pericardial incision.

467
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,546
Thanks to the Darwin,

468
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:05,850
even the most difficult of surgeries
can be made possible.

469
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,755
Right atrium open. Give me visuals.

470
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,656
Right.

471
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,896
RIGHT ATRIUM
BACTERIA

472
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,531
Soon reaching the site of infection.

473
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,501
Now, the hard part.

474
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:24,969
Hard part?

475
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,805
There's no such thing.

476
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,709
Let's proceed to remove the infection.

477
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,319
-Such precise work.
-That's the Darwin's power.

478
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,488
Now it just needs to be removed…

479
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,591
It appears to be a success.

480
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,799
Time to finish up.

481
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,269
That was a piece of cake.

482
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,672
Removing bacterial site.

483
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,573
Okay.

484
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,116
-What the…
-What is it?

485
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,485
What's happening? The forceps won't budge.

486
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,058
The forceps won't move?

487
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,926
What happened?

488
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,031
Blood loss increasing.

489
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,504
The arms are hitting each other!

490
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,473
This isn't good.

491
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,074
The arms' movement is limited

492
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,911
when working on the body of a small child.

493
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,345
Damn it.

494
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,347
That's what I was afraid of!

495
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,185
Any sudden movements will tear the heart!

496
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,420
What's happening?

497
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,155
<i>Can you move the arms?</i>

498
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,758
<i>-Wait.</i>
-What are you doing, Dr. Matsuoka?

499
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,626
Get ready for conversion.

500
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,128
Koharu…

501
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,230
This is not looking good.

502
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,032
Someone has to go help.

503
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,068
But no one at Tojo knows how to use it.

504
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,272
What's this…

505
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,115
Dr. Tokai…

506
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,784
Hey, Miwa!

507
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,822
We're losing more blood!

508
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,895
Dr. Matsuoka. We have to withdraw.

509
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,396
I'm the operating surgeon.

510
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,099
I'm going to remove the infection.

511
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,469
Know your place, Dr. Takashina!

512
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,974
I never had one to begin with!

513
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,380
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

514
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,452
-Dr. Takashina!
-Continue the operation!

515
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,887
Dr. Tokai!

516
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,829
-Move the arms.
-We can't. The blood won't stop.

517
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,398
-Then get transfusion!
-She's allergic to blood transfusion!

518
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,133
-We told you!
-I can't get a visual!

519
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,903
-Suction! Get the blood out!
-Right.

520
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,981
Dr. Tokai!

521
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,988
We need your help.

522
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,059
Let's go.

523
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,507
Suction on max!
She can't lose any more blood!

524
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,546
Damn it. We're toast.

525
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,250
Dr. Tokai!

526
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,052
Tokai?

527
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,824
<i>Dr. Takashina.</i>
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

528
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,894
You didn't take the patient's small body
into consideration

529
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,463
in adjusting the robotic arms.

530
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,631
This is your fault.

531
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,468
You call yourself a pro with the Darwin?

532
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,373
-Write your resignation letter.
-What?

533
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,178
I'll save you for your severance pay.
Ten million yen.

534
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,283
Don't be a fool! I don't have ten million…

535
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,551
Then what?

536
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,122
<i>Let the child die</i>
<i>in front of the great Dr. Nishizaki?</i>

537
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,661
Dr. Matsuoka. Out of the way.

538
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,229
What?

539
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,165
Get out!

540
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,508
<i>Move it.</i>

541
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,284
-Dr. Takashina. No. 3.
-Two cm to the right.

542
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,222
-No. 1.
-Three cm to the left.

543
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,426
The arms will move now.

544
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,363
-The forceps moved.
-We'll take them out.

545
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,831
I'll open up her chest.

546
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,200
You can't do that.
She's allergic to transfusion.

547
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,936
-So we'll use her own blood.
-Her own blood?

548
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,041
<i>So that's why you were using Nespa,</i>
<i>a blood producer.</i>

549
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,310
<i>You've been collecting her blood.</i>

550
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,115
-Nekota, how long will she last?
-I can give you 30 minutes.

551
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,285
Thirty minutes, starting now? Impossible!

552
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,222
Watch me do it.

553
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,960
Tojo University can do it.

554
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,199
-Move the cart.
-Right.

555
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,136
-Get ready!
-Okay.

556
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,442
<i>There's already a hole. Let's connect it.</i>

557
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,743
-Scalpel.
-Here.

558
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,512
-Wipe it.
-Okay.

559
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,480
-Electroscalpel.
-Okay.

560
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,581
-Open it.
-Right.

561
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,784
Think of the next step.
We'll open the chest.

562
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,519
-Open it up!
-Retractor.

563
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,723
-Opening chest.
-Remove blood from the heart and lungs.

564
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:19,957
Use suction, you!

565
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,392
-Nekota, muscle hook.
-Here.

566
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,062
-Bring it, hurry!
-I'll cut it off with the forceps.

567
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,033
Reclamped. Remove the blood.

568
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,868
<i>-Lend me a hand. Open.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

569
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,972
Amazing.
He's just as precise as the Darwin.

570
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,607
-No, he's better.
<i>-Suction!</i>

571
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,076
I knew he was incredible.

572
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,446
-Dr. Tokai…
<i>-Drain all the blood!</i>

573
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,782
It seems like
it was a difficult operation.

574
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,553
To operate on a child's small body,

575
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,425
more precise preparation was necessary.

576
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,262
It was Dr. Matsuoka, right?

577
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,665
He doesn't understand true surgery.

578
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,437
Taking it out.

579
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,374
-Got it. Suture, 4-0.
-Right.

580
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,410
-Suction!
-Right.

581
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,633
-Metz.
-Here.

582
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,039
-Suture complete.
-Vitals stabilized. No problem.

583
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,140
You finish up.

584
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,112
Dr. Tokai.

585
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,285
Thank you.

586
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,688
This is nothing.

587
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,761
I am a doctor, after all.

588
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,617
The operation was a success.

589
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,355
We learned a great deal, thanks to you.

590
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,924
Professor Nishizaki.

591
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,795
I'm glad to hear that.

592
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,833
I'll be leaving now.

593
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,905
Mr. Ikenaga. I will speak with you soon.

594
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,355
Dr. Nishizaki!

595
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,400
Dr. Takashina. Amazing follow-up.

596
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,803
-Thank you.
-I have something to talk with you about.

597
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,907
Please come see me later.

598
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,276
Yes, sir.

599
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,351
You have nowhere to return to.

600
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,657
Wait, please! Dr. Nishizaki, please!

601
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,626
<i>After the operation,</i>
<i>Koharu made a full recovery</i>

602
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,128
<i>and she was soon to be discharged.</i>

603
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,463
Wow! I bet you're ready to play soccer.

604
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:47,898
Yes!

605
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,370
What about Dr. Takashina?

606
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,206
He's getting some special training too.

607
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,915
Dr. Takashina, you're awful.

608
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,517
Want me to show you?

609
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,252
-Please.
-Okay.

610
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,357
It looks like
I'll get to stay at Tojo after all.

611
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,692
What?

612
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,596
<i>A nationally produced Darwin at Tojo…</i>

613
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,066
That's right. Teika is working alongside
Daiichi Industries

614
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,369
to produce a Darwin right here in Japan.

615
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,374
I would like to entrust you
with the first clinical trial.

616
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,177
But…

617
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:37,381
We'll gather the cases and you'll finish
the paper before the elections.

618
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,085
We'll be able to gather
more Impact Factor.

619
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,189
Understood.

620
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,024
I'm relying on you.

621
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,960
This project is also being backed

622
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:54,632
by an acquaintance
in the Ministry of Health.

623
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,133
The Ministry of Health?

624
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,568
That's why this project…

625
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,304
has to succeed.

626
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,210
It's our last chance.

627
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:12,316
There's no running away
from where I've found myself.

628
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:17,287
-Let's try again.
-Let's do it twice.

629
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,188
Let's go!

630
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,027
One… Two… Two times!

631
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,665
Excuse me.

632
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,868
I have a package for you.

633
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,869
Thank you.

634
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,637
I'll be taking my leave.

635
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,398
<i>If both universities join forces,</i>
<i>I believe the new Darwin can achieve this.</i>

636
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,834
-Ms. Harue?
<i>-This trial is of great significance.</i>

637

Can I ask for your cooperation?

638
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,570
What a foolish patient.

639

<i>The black forceps' secret</i>
<i>is still being protected.</i>

640
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,141
A medical error?

641

<i>What are you saying?</i>

642
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,945
<i>There is no room for error in surgery.</i>
