1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,909
The black forceps' secret
is still being protected.

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,845
Indeed.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,648
But I must ask you to be cautious.

4
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,420
Please dispose of this as usual.

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,888
I understand.

6
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,891
And the old administrative documents,

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,827
shall I move them
to the storage room here?

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,297
Yes.

9
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,932
That's fine.

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,403
Then I'll start on that soon.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,971
Excuse me.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,228
<i>Is this everything?</i>

13
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,698
Yes. Please bring it
to the hospital storage room.

14
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,966
Thanks again.

15
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,668
-Right.
-Okay.

16
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,808
We can't do this in a day.

17
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,342
You're right.

18
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,286
Excuse me.

19
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,689
If you're looking for the hospital,
it's that way.

20
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,925
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,726
But that's okay.

22
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,895
I know this hospital quite well.

23
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,598
They're taking care of my son.

24
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,733
So you're here to visit him?

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,035
No, not like that.

26
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,937
He's a doctor.

27
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,273
His name is Seishiro Tokai.

28
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,942
Dr. Tokai?

29
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,945
You're Dr. Tokai's mother?

30
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,414
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Likewise.

31
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,284
I thought I would pay a visit
to Dr. Saeki,

32
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,855
but my son never answers his phone.

33
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,822
Is that so?

34
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,890
That boy…

35
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,126
He couldn't give a damn
if I were alive or dead.

36
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,494
Completely apathetic.

37
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,296
-That can't be.
-I mean it.

38
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,433
How about we all get some lunch?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,235
Ms. Kinoshita.

40
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,605
Dr. Tokai is in an emergency operation.

41
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,642
-Dr. Sera. Artificial valve.
-Right.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,145
-4-0.
-Right.

43
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,281
-I'm supposed to be the operating surgeon.
-Here it is.

44
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,851
-Felt.
-Oh, please.

45
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,287
-Felt, hurry.
-Right, sorry.

46
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,655
-You should have it cut.
-Okay.

47
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,190
Here.

48
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,160
-Suction.
-Sorry.

49
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,832
The other day, Dr. Tokai made me
a delicious egg-on-rice bowl.

50
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,367
-He did?
-Wow.

51
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,669
I would love to try that.

52
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,106
Would either one of you be so kind

53
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,108
as to marry my son?

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,009
What?

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,778
You'll be able to eat delicious rice
for the rest of your life.

56
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,814
My husband was a lover of food,

57
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,716
but he loved rice the most.

58
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,586
He would always make rice balls
to bring to operations.

59
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,888
-Operations?
-That's right.

60
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,757
He was a surgeon at Tojo University.

61
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,160
He was a surgeon? Wow!

62
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,029
My husband would always say,

63
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,400
"The most ordinary people
make the best doctors."

64
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,336
-Ordinary people make good doctors.
-Right.

65
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,938
I have a photograph.

66
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,540
-Would you like to see it?
-Yes.

67
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,608
Certainly.

68
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,810
Dr. Saeki is in it too.

69
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,412
Really?

70
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,221
Ms. Harue?

71
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,924
Ms. Harue, are you okay?

72
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,192
Ms. Harue?

73
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,260
Ms. Harue!

74
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,229
Ms. Harue?

75
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,399
There's a large tumor inside her heart.

76
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,401
She likely fainted when it incarcerated.

77
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,403
We have to tell Dr. Tokai.

78
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,772
He's in another operation. Not now.

79
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,542
-We need to do an emergency surgery.
-Right.

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,947
-Spoon.
-Here.

81
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,388
-Left atrial myxoma excision complete.
-Okay.

82
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,425
We'll move on to suturing
the left atrium. 4-0.

83
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,865
MOM
4 MISSED CALLS

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,201
Pardon me.

85
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,203
Dr. Tokai.

86
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,007
It's your mother…

87
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,881
You're here. It was a sudden incident.

88
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,316
Dr. Kurosaki operated on her.

89
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,318
Her condition is stable.

90
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,688
Thank you.

91
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,492
Let's be thankful that she's all right.

92
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,166
Can I ask you to leave?

93
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,972
I see. Very well.

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,540
Take care.

95
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,659
-Doctor. I prepared the test.
-Thank you.

96
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,728
Tell Dr. Kurosaki that he'll be in charge.

97
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,629
Right.

98
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,634
What are the odds
of Dr. Tokai's family being admitted?

99
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,703
I'm sure he's worried as well.

100
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm not talking about that Dr. Tokai.

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,942
I'm talking about Dr. Ichiro Tokai.

102
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,879
<i>You are a disgrace!</i>

103
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,748
Do you understand what you've done?

104
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,717
What would we have done without Dr. Saeki?

105
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,652
How will you take responsibility for this?

106
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,993
Harue coming here at a time like this.

107
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,629
It's a thing of the past.

108
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,536
However, make sure it's not investigated.

109
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,905
-Be careful.
-Understood.

110
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,309
I can't believe
Dr. Tokai's mother is here.

111
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,911
We'll do the post-op exam tomorrow.

112
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,313
Tomorrow?

113
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,984
By the way, it sounds like
it will finally be here tomorrow.

114
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,819
Oh, that?

115
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,256
<i>The thing on everyone's mind.</i>

116
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,394
MEDICAL SUPPLIES ON BOARD

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,064
<i>Japan's first operating robot</i>
<i>developed by Daiichi Industries.</i>

118
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,868
<i>The domestically produced Darwin,</i>
<i>also known as Caesar.</i>

119
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,405
Its first clinical trial in Japan
will be done at Tojo,

120
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,008
and it will be handled
by the esteemed Dr. Saeki.

121
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,544
What an honor.

122
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,047
<i>Why did Tojo become the trial facility</i>
<i>for the new Darwin?</i>

123
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,150
<i>Thanks to Dr. Nishizaki,</i>

124
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,952
<i>and the involvement of</i>
<i>the Ministry of Health.</i>

125
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,788
Excuse me.

126
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,824
You're Dr. Saeki, right?

127
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,029
-Yes. And you must be from the ministry…
-I'm Tomizawa.

128
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,332
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Saeki.

129
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,904
-Hello Dr. Saeki.
-Ms. Kinoshita, you're here too?

130
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,007
We were invited by Dr. Nishizaki.

131
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,443
That's right, Dr. Saeki.

132
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,878
Mr. Tomizawa was kind enough

133
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,482
to read the recently published
Snipe article.

134
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,184
Oh, that one…

135
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:36,088
Your name was included
as a research partner, correct?

136
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,157
Yes, well…

137
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,429
The future of medicine relies
not only on individual skill

138
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,600
but also on the integration
of the latest medical technologies.

139
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,636
Wow. Did you hear that?

140
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,772
Truly a fantastic philosophy.

141
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,211
There is, in fact, a new device
that can make your philosophy a reality.

142
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,849
Dr. Nishizaki is leading
the development process

143
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,617
of a domestically produced Darwin.

144
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,587
Mr. Tomizawa has asked for your help.

145
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,890
He's suggesting that we ask
for your cooperation

146
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,525
in the development process.

147
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,094
Research from Teika University.

148
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,963
Practical skill from Tojo University.

149
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,066
If both universities join forces,

150
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,469
we can surpass the foreign-made products
that rule the industry.

151
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,139
I believe we can complete our own Darwin
with this method.

152
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,508
They got me.

153
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,512
All Dr. Nishizaki is looking for

154
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,714
is Impact Factor.

155
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,784
<i>Impact Factor is gained from being</i>
<i>published in academic journals.</i>

156
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,722
<i>Currently, Dr. Saeki is leading the race.</i>

157
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>But if the domestically produced</i>
<i>Darwin is completed,</i>

158
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>the Impact Factor will be given</i>

159
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,963
<i>to the project leader, Dr. Nishizaki.</i>

160
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,699
<i>There was no benefit for Dr. Saeki.</i>

161
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,602
It would appear the new Darwin

162
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,338
has only just passed animal trials.

163
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,175
With the Ministry of Health involved,
we can't simply ignore it.

164
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,012
And you plan to oversee it, don't you?

165
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,180
If a Japanese Darwin is developed,

166
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,917
it will be great progress
for Japanese medicine.

167
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,918
I hope that…

168
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,454
I can lend a hand in that.

169
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:21,127
<i>Thus, despite various unclear motives</i>
<i>the Japan-made Darwin, Caesar,</i>

170
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,463
<i>arrived at Tojo University</i>
<i>as an unwelcome guest.</i>

171
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,800
"Caesar" is the hero
who laid the foundations

172
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,735
of the ancient Roman Empire.

173
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,470
Caesar is a Latin name.

174
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:37,043
This Caesar will be the foundation
to change the future of the medical field.

175
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,046
That's how it got its name.

176
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,249
Wow. It's beautiful!

177
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,451
It's a bit smaller than the foreign model.

178
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,854
And only one arm instead of four.

179
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,058
With this one arm,

180
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,061
multiple tasks such as migrating
and suturing can be performed.

181
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,798
Incorporating the most advanced
technology in Japan,

182
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,901
it is the ultimate medical robot.

183
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,209
We'll leave the Caesar to Dr. Takashina.

184
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,911
Are you sure?

185
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,348
He seems to have cut ties with Teika,

186
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,383
and there was the Snipe incident.

187
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,253
We need someone to take responsibility
if something happens.

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,855
Right. I see.

189
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,292
How is Harue Tokai's condition?

190
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,161
She's currently being examined.

191
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,396
<i>I see.</i>

192
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,098
<i>However…</i>

193
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,699
Dr. Tokai.

194
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,768
Here.

195
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,604
<i>In Harue Tokai's exams,</i>

196
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,573
<i>something awful was discovered.</i>

197
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,579
An overlooked tumor in the pulmonary vein
of the left atrium?

198
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,713
That's right.

199
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,819
Overlooking the pulmonary vein
is not an entirely uncommon error.

200
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,189
For a novice surgeon.

201
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,794
Let's have a conference and form a plan.

202
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,396
Get it started at once.

203
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,197
Understood.

204
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,204
Of all people…

205
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,043
Why did it have to be Dr. Tokai's mother?

206
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,578
About Harue Tokai.

207
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,447
In her exams,

208
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:27,219
we discovered a tumor
in the pulmonary vein of the left atrium.

209
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,089
Dr. Kurosaki.

210
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,961
Why was the tumor overlooked?

211
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,966
Dr. Kurosaki.

212
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,237
Why was the tumor overlooked?

213
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,643
We removed the myxoma
in the surgery yesterday.

214
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,512
However, it was extremely difficult
to see the pulmonary vein

215
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,615
and part of the tumor was left unremoved.

216
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,050
So you mean it was human error?

217
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,088
So the one who put
the patient in danger was…

218
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,223
Dr. Kurosaki.

219
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,358
Who's responsible for this?

220
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,861
Drop it, Tokai.

221
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,097
I understand how you feel,

222
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,700
but a pulmonary vein oversight
is not unreasonable.

223
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,702
We cannot cast the blame on the surgeon.

224
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,840
I see. Understood.

225
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,143
Dr. Tokai is actually backing off.

226
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,879
Nothing would get done
if we did everything by his rules.

227
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,081
I'll place responsibility

228
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,851
on the hospital.

229
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,286
What? On the hospital!?

230
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,955
Director Moriya.

231
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,624
As a family member of the patient,

232
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,560
I demand a settlement of 20 million yen.

233
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,331
-Twenty million?
-It's only fair.

234
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,500
This is medical malpractice.

235
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,269
Just as Dr. Saeki said, this kind of thing

236
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,171
is not uncommon.

237
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,741
I haven't made a single error
in my entire career.

238
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,678
Then let me operate on her.

239
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,628
I decline.

240
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,136
-What?
-That's hospital logic, isn't it?

241
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,507
Completely incomprehensible
from the patient's perspective.

242
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,881
You're not planning on operating
on her yourself, are you?

243
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,118
Twice in Tojo's past,

244
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,453
doctors have failed
while operating on family members.

245
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,058
Since then, we have banned doctors
from operating on people close to them.

246
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,394
This is Tojo University's rule.

247
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,962
Of course I know that.

248
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,530
Then what do you plan on doing?

249
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,866
Until this is settled,

250
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,904
we put the operation on hold.

251
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,376
-Twenty million for a medical error?
-Yes.

252
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,912
However you put it, he's asking too much.

253
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,715
It is his mother, after all…

254
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,519
I think it's more about the money.

255
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,754
He even turned down
Dr. Saeki's offer to operate.

256
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,957
-He did?
-Yes.

257
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,497
I heard that Dr. Tokai's father used to be
an operating surgeon at Tojo too.

258
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,466
-Seriously?
-Yes.

259
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,801
His mother told me.

260
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,904
She even had a photograph of him
with Dr. Saeki.

261
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,809
I've had the feeling
that Dr. Tokai and Dr. Saeki

262
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
have some sort of special relationship.

263
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:39,778
Yeah.

264
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,981
I wonder what happened.

265
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,618
I didn't think Dr. Tokai
would react like that.

266
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,653
Forgive me. It's all my fault.

267
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,054
Don't sweat it.

268
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:53,058
When the patient wakes up,
we'll get consent for a second operation.

269
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,528
-I'll take care of the negotiations.
-Thank you.

270
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,797
But still…

271
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,535
I never thought I would hear Dr. Tokai
say the words "medical malpractice."

272
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,739
Absolutely. Is he trying to get back at us

273
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,408
for what his father did?

274
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,061
Dr. Tokai. Good afternoon.

275
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,034
I heard about your mother.

276
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,369
I don't know what to say…

277
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,239
It's none of your business.

278
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,074
I also heard that you

279
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,543
refused Dr. Saeki's operation.

280
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,350
It is true that medical malpractice
cannot be overlooked.

281
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,086
Asking for a settlement is only fair.

282
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:54,987
However…

283
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,592
Is that really
the only reason you refused?

284
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,364
It's none of your business.

285
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,114
It's you.

286
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:24,984
Where am I?

287
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,819
You're at Tojo University Hospital.

288
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,590
We were having lunch and I…

289
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,326
I'm glad you've woken up.

290
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,498
Dr. Saeki seemed quite worried.

291
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,800
Dr. Saeki? He did?

292
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,471
After what my husband did…

293
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,176
Now, I'm the one causing him trouble too.

294
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,022
Yes?

295
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,191
Have you decided on a test patient
for the Japanese Darwin?

296
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,795
We have a candidate,
but no negotiations have been made.

297
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,198
I see. Make sure you are well-prepared.

298
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,301
Understood. Everything is going well.

299
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,305
But because this will be
the first human trial,

300
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,108
<i>I think it's best to be extra cautious.</i>

301
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,445
Cautious? What are you talking about?

302
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,679
So what if it's a human trial?

303
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,550
It's just another test subject.
No different than an animal.

304
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,153
Got it, Dr. Takashina?

305
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,856
I asked you to infiltrate
Dr. Saeki's inner circle

306
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,560
in order to secure the Japan-made Darwin.

307
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,495
If you don't get me results,

308
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,297
I'll mean it next time.

309
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,433
<i>You'll have nowhere to return to.</i>

310
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,337
Begin the testing at once.

311
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,573
Understood.

312
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,778
I need nurses in the emergency room!

313
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,047
-Hurry!
-Okay!

314
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,250
Hurry up! Go!

315
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,687
There was an accident
at a nearby construction site!

316
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,224
-Twenty-seven victims are on their way.
-Twenty-seven?

317
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,992
Everyone on your feet! Let's go.

318
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:14,927
Okay!

319
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,933
Dr. Tokai. We need you.

320
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,411
<i>Got it, Dr. Takashina?</i>

321
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,347
<i>I've asked you to infiltrate</i>
<i>Dr. Saeki's inner circle</i>

322
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,584
in order to secure the Japan-made Darwin.

323
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,020
Begin the testing at once.

324
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,361
Dr. Takashina.

325
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,831
I'm glad to see you looking well.

326
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,767
I'm Dr. Takashina, a cardiac surgeon.

327
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,537
Nice to meet you.

328
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,772
I'm feeling much better.

329
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,477
I would actually like to have
a word with you about that.

330
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,348
-I'll be leaving then.
-No.

331
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,984
I would like you to stay here.

332
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,254
All right then.

333
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,759
I'm going to speak to you frankly.

334
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,596
While we performed
emergency surgery on your heart,

335
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,699
there appears to be a tumor
left in your pulmonary vein.

336
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,104
We'll have to perform a second operation
as soon as possible.

337
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,706
But you don't need to worry.

338
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,709
We have the perfect solution
for this case.

339
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,312
With the approval of Dr. Saeki,

340
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,017
we'll operate using brand-new technology
recently introduced to Tojo.

341
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,553
-Dr. Saeki approves?
-Yes.

342
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,590
Are you familiar with Darwin surgery?

343
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,459
You guys, over there!

344
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,864
We need antibacterial! Now!

345
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,201
Antibacterial! Bring antibacterial!

346
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,103
-This is not good. He needs surgery.
-Okay.

347
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,272
-We'll do it here.
-Here?

348
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,407
-Here?
-Nekota.

349
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,775
Bring me an incision set
and electroscalpel.

350
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,909
Okay.

351
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,613
Get me some scissors, hurry.

352
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,617
This trial in particular
is of great significance.

353
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,521
The affordable and compact
Japan-made Darwin, named Caesar.

354
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,390
If we can fully implement it,

355
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,694
small, local hospitals like this one
will be able to use it as well.

356
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,064
In some cases
where a skilled surgeon is present,

357
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,999
much like your talented son,

358
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,602
the machine won't need to be used.

359
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,872
But unfortunately,
I am just an ordinary doctor.

360
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,143
And unfortunately,
that's the case for most doctors.

361
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,446
<i>My husband would always say,</i>

362
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,650
"The most ordinary people
make the best doctors."

363
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,919
We need the Caesar.

364
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,090
There are countless patients
like yourself that we need to help.

365
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:00,959
For their future as well,

366
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,962
can I ask for your cooperation?

367
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,371
I understand.

368
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,544
I'm happy to help in any way I can.

369
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,381
Thank you.

370
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,082
In that case,

371
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,052
may I ask for your signature, please?

372
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,657
OPERATION CONSENT FORM

373
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,759
Over here, please.

374
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,662
Dr. Tokai, what about this one?

375
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,833
Don't you kill a single one of them.

376
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:44,903
Move!

377
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,353
-Almost done.
-Okay.

378
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,057
-Metz.
-Here.

379
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,628
Pulmonary vein suture complete.

380
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,030
-That was fast.
-Sew up the left atrium.

381
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,865
Okay.

382
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,703
Wait. You can't ask an intern to do that.

383
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,137
I see…

384
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,174
-Please.
-Here.

385
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,576
He'll do it.

386
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,052
He has the skill. Don't worry.

387
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,090
Hey, can you do sutures
on the left auricle?

388
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,460
Interns are not allowed to do that yet.

389
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,563
Sera is always having
a hard time with Dr. Tokai.

390
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:49,167
But it would seem our boy here
doesn't realize how much he's improved.

391
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,972
-No time to waste! Move it!
-Okay.

392
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,875
Finish the connection for me.

393
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,776
Right.

394
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,047
You finish up.

395
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,750
He's incredible.

396
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,586
Doing all this by himself.

397
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,602
Oh, Seishiro.

398
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,036
What's that?

399
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,274
Meeting again after all this time
and that's the first thing you say?

400
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,943
Caesar trial documents.

401
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,578
Trial?

402
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,682
The consent forms
have already been signed and submitted.

403
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,420
A nice doctor visited me just now

404
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,555
and explained it thoroughly.

405
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,891
I've decided to trust him.

406
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,461
Why are you writing that?

407
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:51,997
Listen.

408
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,800
The doctor told me.

409
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,302
If the device can be made popular,

410
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,139
they'll be able to save
countless more patients.

411
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,476
He is such a caring doctor.

412
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,814
Not like you,
always so narrow-minded and cold.

413
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,248
Always thinking about yourself.

414
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,351
Causing trouble around here, I'm sure.

415
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,657
What did you do?

416
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,428
The Caesar

417
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,866
was specifically designed
by the Japanese for the Japanese.

418
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,703
You could say it was made
specifically for your mother.

419
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,040
Don't get it twisted.

420
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,010
I explained everything
about the treatment in detail

421
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,212
and got her approval.

422
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,249
This is what she wants to do.

423
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,917
It's what you want.

424
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,155
I always put the patient's wishes
and needs first.

425
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,692
And tomorrow,

426
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,195
-we will hold the trial operation.
-Impossible.

427
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,998
Until I've got a settlement,

428
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,167
I said the operation is on hold.

429
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,606
It's always about the money, isn't it?

430
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,673
What?

431
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:15,347
Participating in this medical trial
is your mother's best option.

432
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,683
I may not be as skilled as you,

433
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,952
but I have the Caesar.

434
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,589
I will save lives with technology.

435
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,092
I don't trust that technology.

436
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,796
Putting her life in the hands
of some cheap machine.

437
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,699
What a foolish patient.

438
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:39,070
I promise to show you
that the Caesar can succeed.

439
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,007
For your mother, and myself.

440
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,475
And if it fails…

441
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,811
you can both die.

442
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,222
The patient agreed to Darwin surgery?

443
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,456
Forgive me.

444
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,560
While I was occupied, Dr. Takashina…

445
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,195
It doesn't matter.

446
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,567
If the patient has agreed,
all that's left is to hope for success.

447
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,069
Are you sure it's okay?

448
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,572
This will support
the Caesar's development--

449
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,474
And it will erase your error as well.

450
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,810
Isn't that just ideal?

451
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,514
That's true, but…

452
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,916
Listen.

453
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,286
In my hospital,

454
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,989
there is no room for error in surgery.

455
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,694
Even the slightest error.

456
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,430
Understood.

457
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,832
Dr. Tokai agreed to use the Caesar?

458
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,733
Yeah.

459
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,603
Using a robot for his mother's surgery…

460
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,438
I can't believe he agreed.

461
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,173
Yeah…

462
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,876
But because it's family,
he won't be allowed in the operating room.

463
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,546
That's right.

464
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,215
So even if something bad happens,

465
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,185
we can't count on Dr. Tokai
to save the day, can we?

466
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,989
Right. If he even touches a scalpel,
he'll be fired.

467
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,056
Fired?

468
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,016
It looks like you're prepared.

469
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,323
With the Caesar, we'll only need to make
incisions in two places.

470
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,558
There will be no burden on the patient.

471
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,596
With a precision camera
installed on the arm,

472
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,200
we'll be able to perform a high-level
operation with full internal visual.

473
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,140
-Dr. Takashina.
-Harue Tokai is asking for you.

474
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,816
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

475
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,985
No problem. Dr. Tokai is always…

476
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,287
helping me out.

477
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,756
-He is?
-Yes.

478
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,691
That boy?

479
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,427
You can't be serious…

480
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,729
-I mean it.
-Ouch.

481
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,564
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

482
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,534
So…

483
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,770
-What can I do for you?
-Right…

484
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,574
I would like to talk about
tomorrow's operation.

485
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,277
It's nothing much.

486
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,046
Just one thing.

487
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,194
<i>I'm always nagging you</i>
<i>to eat more and get enough sleep.</i>

488
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,564
Be a helpful person.
That's all you need to do.

489
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,899
People survive by helping each other.

490
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,969
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>you can do on your own.</i>

491
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:17,956
It hurts…

492
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,592
Mom?

493
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,063
The residual tumor is causing disturbances
in her blood flow.

494
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,999
Then we'll be able to operate
with the Caesar as planned.

495
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,735
But the patient's blood is Rh-minus.

496
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,638
Because of the accident earlier,
we don't have enough transfusion.

497
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,574
There's only 600cc remaining.

498
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,379
Only 600cc?

499
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,217
The Caesar doesn't need an incision.
It can be done.

500
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,288
If something goes wrong,
we won't have enough blood.

501
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,025
I will complete the operation
without trouble.

502
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:01,099
<i>The fateful day arrived</i>
<i>sooner than planned.</i>

503
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,237
Preparations complete.

504
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,476
We will now use
the Japan-made Darwin, Caesar,

505
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,945
to remove a residual tumor
in the pulmonary vein.

506
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,381
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

507
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,559
The arm is now entering the body.

508
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:34,499
Japan's own Darwin at its first operation.
Who knew it would happen so soon?

509
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,169
I'm thankful we got the patient's consent.

510
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,042
I've called him in
as a family member of the patient.

511
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,317
<i>-Remove the blood.</i>
<i>-Okay</i>

512
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,252
It's earlier than scheduled…

513
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,956
-The first robotic surgery.
-Let's hope it works out.

514
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,427
-Opening the left atrium.
-Right.

515
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,803
It can work so precisely. Amazing.

516
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,439
It works even faster
than the foreign model.

517
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,443
Amazing! It's beating all expectations.

518
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,113
The Caesar is able to operate
with only two small incisions.

519
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,117
The final challenge is the tumor
stuck to the pulmonary vein.

520
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,419
Will they be able to remove it?

521
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,822
They can't miss by 0.1 millimeter.

522
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,993
Don't worry, it's a robot.
They don't make mistakes.

523
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,363
We'll now remove the tumor.

524
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,813
It's all going according to plan.

525
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,218
Removal complete.

526
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,287
<i>Debakey.</i>

527
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,187
Okay.

528
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,358
Tumor removal complete.

529
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,960
-4-0.
-Right.

530
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,336
Left atrium closed.

531
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,006
We did it.

532
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,575
Flow down. Declamp.

533
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,111
Well done!

534
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,619
It's small, but we have bleeding.

535
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,121
-What?
-Please stay calm.

536
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,758
The Caesar is ready to perform recovery.

537
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,760
-Bring transfusion.
-Right.

538
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,362
They have to transfuse blood quickly.

539
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,399
But because of the accident
this afternoon,

540
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,401
there's hardly any transfusion left.

541
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,837
What's happening?

542
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,974
It would appear to be a hemorrhage
in the aorta.

543
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,477
The Caesar's camera gives a limited view.

544
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,414
They must have damaged the tissue
while finishing the operation.

545
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,352
This is the last of the transfusion.

546
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,922
-Blood pressure, 82!
-The bleeding won't stop!

547
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,058
-What should we do?
-We stop the bleeding with Caesar.

548
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,962
-Dr. Kurosaki. Your support, please.
-Got it.

549
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,464
Not enough blood?

550
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,333
The patient's blood type is not common.
She has Rh-minus.

551
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,937
Do what you can to collect more blood.

552
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,973
We need Rh-minus!

553
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,142
Contact all local hospitals
and facilities.

554
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,276
-Understood!
-Understood!

555
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,514
-How much do we have left?
-200cc.

556
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,116
That's all?

557
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,220
Toyoake Hospital has some!

558
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,523
It will be here in one hour.

559
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,862
One hour… that's too late.

560
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,601
-We're looking for Type A Rh-minus.
-Excuse me.

561
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,337
Does anyone here
have Type A Rh-minus blood type?

562
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:03,474
Type A Rh-minus.
Is there anyone who can cooperate?

563
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,644
Damn it! Finding Rh-minus is not easy.

564
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,679
It'll take more time.

565
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,317
-We don't have enough time.
-Blood pressure dropping more!

566
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:14,952
This is bullshit.

567
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,488
Isn't there anything you can do?

568
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,457
If this operation doesn't succeed,

569
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,326
development of the Caesar
will be halted completely.

570
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,695
That's none of my business.

571
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:29,967
I've also been prohibited
by the patient's family from operating.

572
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,069
But…

573
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,439
At this rate,
the patient will lose her life.

574
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,177
The only person besides me
who can save her, is Dr. Tokai himself.

575
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,451
You didn't want me to do it,
so you refused.

576
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:48,853
If that's the case…

577
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,022
You'll have to do it yourself.

578
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,033
However,

579
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,069
due to Tojo's rules,

580
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,572
you'll have to face punishment.

581
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,341
If that doesn't bother you,

582
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,712
then go.

583
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,117
-We got the transfusion.
-That's all?

584
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,352
Sorry, this is all we have so far.
Here you go.

585
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,155
-Where is the bleeding coming from?
-We don't know.

586
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,891
-Blood pressure, 72.
-She's running out of blood.

587
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,292
We can't retain blood volume!

588
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,243
-Dr. Tokai…
-What are you doing here?

589
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,845
You don't have permission to operate.

590
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,649
-Let it go. I'll take responsibility.
-Professor?

591
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,984
Dr. Tokai…

592
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,189
Move this.

593
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,461
You're in my way.

594
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,466
Get out of the way.

595
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,273
-I'll open up.
-Okay.

596
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,441
A median sternotomy now?

597
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,709
-Scalpel.
-Here.

598
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,946
Impossible. Even if you find the wound,
there is not enough blood.

599
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,728
If it's blood you need, I have it.

600
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,569
I'm Type A Rh-minus.

601
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,571
I have no infections. I can help.

602
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,141
Get me blood donation packs.

603
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,679
-Hurry!
-Right.

604
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,282
We cannot let this operation fail.

605
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,364
Use as much as you need.

606
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,411
Help me out.

607
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,779
Okay.

608
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:31,916
-Twister.
-Here.

609
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,785
<i>-4-0.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

610
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,120
-Two pieces of felt.
-Okay.

611
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,123
Found it. I'll suture now.

612
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,694
-Cover me.
-Right.

613
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,599
-More suction.
-Okay.

614
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,635
-Suction. Deeper.
-Right.

615
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,403
-Move the PA.
-On it.

616
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,106
-Don't pull too hard.
-Right.

617
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,575
-Deeper.
-Okay.

618
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,657
Dr. Takashina! That's enough…

619
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,792
Keep going.

620
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,430
It's no good.
Dr. Takashina's blood is not enough.

621
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,033
-Go deeper with the suction.
-Right.

622
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,035
-More to the side.
-Understood.

623
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,445
We have transfusion!
Bacteria-free and fully inspected.

624
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,981
-This is all of it!
-Bring it here!

625
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:37,815
Right.

626
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,052
-Here.
-Thanks.

627
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,221
They made it…

628
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,000
-Prepare the Metz.
-Okay.

629
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,768
-Metz
-Here.

630
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,905
Suture complete.

631
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:05,776
What's her condition?

632
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:07,745
Blood pressure…

633
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,015
stabilizing.

634
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,426
They saved her…

635
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,196
Recovering from a condition like that…

636
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,132
Dr. Tokai really is something.

637
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,009
Dr. Tokai knew about
Dr. Takashina's blood type all along?

638
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,519
-You finish up.
-Okay.

639
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,688
Dr. Tokai…

640
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,627
I'm very sorry.

641
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,499
You had planned from the beginning

642
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,337
to operate on your mother, right?

643
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,510
You're surprisingly hard to kill off.

644
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,723
<i>Dr. Tokai has broken</i>
<i>Tojo University's rules.</i>

645
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,825
We cannot simply ignore this.

646
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,530
-You're right.
-Please wait.

647
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,033
Before that…

648
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,770
Would you take a look at this, please?

649
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,148
Dr. Tokai, it's about
your mother's condition.

650
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,883
Post-op exams show no problems.

651
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,487
-I see.
-Yes.

652
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,924
Also…

653
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,426
Look at this.

654
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,932
It's your mother's consent form.

655
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,600
OPERATION CONSENT FORM

656
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,001
You can see here

657
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,471
that a request was added to the note.

658
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,209
"If my condition worsens
and my life is in danger,

659
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,444
I would like to request

660
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,314
that my son, Dr. Tokai,
finish the operation."

661
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,154
The patient's wishes
are the first priority.

662
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,290
This means that your actions

663
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,727
will have no consequences.

664
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,001
What an incredible woman,

665
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,137
your mother.

666
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,990
Good morning.

667
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,259
Could you help me up?

668
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,294
Sure.

669
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,735
Where is he?

670
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,138
Dr. Tokai is currently in another surgery.

671
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,240
I see.

672
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,342
So…

673
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,078
he wasn't fired after all.

674
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,415
How did you know…

675
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,050
I'm sorry.

676
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,019
I heard it.

677
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,222
So even if something bad happens,

678
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,225
we can't count on Dr. Tokai
to save the day, right?

679
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,828
Right. If he even touches a scalpel,
he'll be fired.

680
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,864
Fired?

681
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,900
I know the trouble
he has caused all of you.

682
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,604
But I couldn't allow him to get fired.

683
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,241
He still has work to do.

684
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,444
He still has patients to save here.

685
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,714
He has to make it up to you all.

686
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,485
I don't mind if I come in second place.

687
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,021
That boy, to me,

688
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,424
is everything.

689
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,996
You don't have to worry about me.

690
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,437
Dr. Sera?

691
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,441
-Are you crying?
-I…

692
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,043
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

693
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,279
When you see Dr. Saeki,

694
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,381
please give him my regards.

695
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,351
I will.

696
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:59,870
So you're saying the Caesar
still has issues?

697
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:00,838
That's right.

698
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,640
However,

699
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,575
analysis and countermeasures

700
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,177
have already been taken.

701
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,646
You don't need to worry.

702
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,915
You've finished the analysis?
Well done, Dr. Nishizaki.

703
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,851
Tojo University operates,

704
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,254
and Teika University analyzes.

705
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,389
HARUE TOKAI

706
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,558
As for the election,

707
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,962
I expect to present a good paper by then.

708
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,337
CARDIAC SURGERY PAPERS

709
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,019
"Seigo Saeki…"

710
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,523
"Ichiro… Tokai"?

711
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,803
Dr. Tokai.

712
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,541
Tell me just one thing.

713
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,245
Why were you against Dr. Saeki
operating on your mother?

714
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,619
Because I don't trust that man.

715
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,622
That man…

716
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,994
betrayed my father.

717
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,879
A person's greatest enemy is other people.

718
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,949
No matter where I go,
my job remains the same.

719
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:56,153
It seems this patient's case
is perfect for the clinical trial.

720
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,255
<i>How did they get</i>
<i>our patient's information?</i>

721
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,290
I even wished she would die.

722
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,992
<i>You've betrayed the patient!</i>

723
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,695
<i>What is Teika researching, a cover-up?</i>

724
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,996
Hurry up and save the patient.

725
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,599
<i>He's the devil of the operating room.</i>

726
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,969
<i>You're still running away</i>
<i>after all this?</i>

727
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,404
Tell me. Who was it?

728
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,906
