1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,640
Seigo Saeki…

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,845
Ichiro… Tokai?

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,248
Because I don't trust that man.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,550
<i>That man…</i>

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,288
betrayed my father.

6
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,635
What's the matter?

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,604
Nurse.

8
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,476
We're done here.
Please go check on the pharmaceuticals.

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,446
-But…
-I'll take care of the rest.

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,215
Okay, I understand.

11
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,121
<i>Soon after,</i>

12
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>an event took place</i>
<i>that shook Tojo to its core.</i>

13
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,101
Welcome to Teika University.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,538
Thank you.

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:16,342
<i>It happened after the surgery</i>
<i>of Dr. Tokai's mother was complete.</i>

16
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,777
<i>At Tojo University,</i>

17
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,914
doctors performing surgery
on family members

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,315
is strictly prohibited.

19
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,019
As punishment,
a third of your pay will be cut.

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,554
That is my final decision.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,123
One-third?

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,059
If you have something to say, speak up.

23
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,195
There is one thing I want to check.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,766
I've received an offer
from Teika University…

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,937
for the double of what you're paying me.

26
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,206
Teika University?

27
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,341
You're cutting my already low pay.

28
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,276
I have a life to live.

29
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,912
Professor?

30
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,716
It's up to Dr. Tokai.

31
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,919
Thank you for everything.

32
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,557
RESIGNATION LETTER

33
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
BY REQUEST, THE PERSON LISTED BELOW
WILL RESIGN

34
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,294
<i>Throwing it all away for money?</i>

35
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,563
And going to Teika University,
of all places?

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,433
Doesn't he have any morals as a doctor?

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,567
Seriously.

38
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,836
Dr. Tokai.

39
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,005
Take care of that for me.
I don't need this either.

40
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,309
<i>Dr. Tokai left Tojo University</i>

41
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,778
<i>as if he were never here</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

42
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,351
It would appear that the man is obsessed
with money, just like you said.

43
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,755
He didn't bat an eye ditching Tojo
to join me here.

44
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,192
What do you plan to do with him?

45
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,995
You focus on your own job.

46
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:43,963
Got it…

47
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,899
Dr. Takashina?

48
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,038
Taking a nap already? He just got here.

49
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,741
Why did Dr. Nishizaki bring him here?

50
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,708
Beats me.

51
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,878
Anyway, we've been ordered not to let him
do anything until after the election.

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,049
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>Mr. Tomizawa from the Ministry of Health</i>

53
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,985
<i>came to Tojo to promote</i>
<i>the Japan-made Darwin, Caesar.</i>

54
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,956
Rumor has it, Dr. Saeki,

55
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,194
that you deliberately choose
the most difficult cases.

56
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,799
That's not my intention.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,036
I would like you to focus
on lower-risk patients from now on.

58
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:27,140
I need you to perform
surgeries with a high success rate.

59
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,243
On that note,

60
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,913
I've heard that a patient
named Shoko Yamamoto

61
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,982
is currently being admitted.

62
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,755
AORTIC VALVE INSUFFICIENCY

63
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,092
Yes, we have indeed admitted
Shoko Yamamoto.

64
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,065
She may be the perfect case
for the Caesar.

65
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,601
This is Dr. Nishizaki's doing, I'm sure.

66
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,170
To speed up the clinical trials,

67
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
he has talked to Mr. Tomizawa
from the Ministry of Health.

68
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,809
But how did he get
our patient's information?

69
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,847
Someone told Dr. Nishizaki.

70
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,083
There is no other explanation.

71
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,285
I'm sure that Shoko Yamamoto

72
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,988
was Dr. Tokai's patient.

73
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,389
So Dr. Tokai did it?

74
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,192
When he was recruited by Teika University,

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,794
<i>perhaps he took our data</i>
<i>as a parting gift.</i>

76
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,565
Whatever the case, we must hurry.

77
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,003
Mr. Tomizawa's request is, in effect,
the request of the entire nation.

78
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,773
-That's right.
-If that's so,

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,044
I insist that you leave this one
to me, doctor.

80
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,383
This is a low-risk patient,
it doesn't matter who's in charge.

81
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,618
Make this a win for Tojo.

82
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,620
Thank you.

83
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,125
What is this about?
I'm supposed to be overseeing the Caesar.

84
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,763
You put the patient in danger
during the last clinical trial.

85
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,699
We didn't have enough blood transfusion.

86
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,669
This is the professor's order.

87
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,506
You'll assist me.

88
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,108
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,977
Dr. Saeki.

90
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,783
Oh. Sorry to call you so suddenly.
We would like to continue the trial.

91
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,619
I would be happy to cooperate.

92
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,754
-You take care of the rest.
-Yes.

93
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,457
<i>Shoko Yamamoto.</i>

94
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,695
<i>She worked as a nurse</i>
<i>at a nearby hospital.</i>

95
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,030
…that will make it easier
to locate the veins.

96
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,365
Wow, you're right.

97
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,901
-Drawing blood is about speed and courage.
-I see.

98
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,470
Pardon me.

99
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,240
I've called in the clinical trial
coordinator I told you about.

100
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,308
I'll introduce her now.

101
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,244
Pardon me. My name is Kinoshita…

102
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,617
What's the matter?

103
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,720
Pardon me.

104
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,491
Hey. What was that about?

105
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,492
Hey!

106
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,829
What about the explanation?

107
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,168
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Kinoshita?

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,276
<i>Kaori and I used to work</i>
<i>at the same hospital.</i>

109
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,444
-Here.
-Thank you.

110
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,812
<i>During an operation,</i>

111
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,981
<i>Kaori was a scrub nurse,</i>
<i>passing equipment.</i>

112
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,417
-Fix the circulation, hurry!
-Right.

113
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,886
-But…
-Get the heart-lung machine.

114
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,462
-The heart has stopped.
-Administer bosmin. We'll need more blood.

115
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,797
Why did you give the removal tool?

116
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,600
We needed to pump in blood!
This is your fault!

117
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,603
<i>She claimed her innocence,</i>

118
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,839
<i>but the surgeon refused</i>
<i>to admit his own mistake</i>

119
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,276
<i>and shifted the blame solely on Kaori.</i>

120
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,612
<i>As for me,</i>

121
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,215
<i>I was threatened to be fired</i>
<i>if I didn't tell my side of the story.</i>

122
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,584
Operating nurse Ms. Kinoshita

123
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,356
mistakenly handed
the doctor the wrong tool.

124
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,060
She was made fully responsible
for the mistake

125
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,063
and was let go by the hospital.

126
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>Even though she was a wonderful nurse.</i>

127
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,838
But there was no one
who would protect her.

128
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,478
A person's greatest enemy is other people.

129
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,718
I would greatly consider
the clinical trial,

130
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,022
<i>but could you put someone else in charge?</i>

131
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,624
I heard what happened.

132
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,061
So you were a nurse.

133
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,268
At that time,

134
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,072
I even wished she would die.

135
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,947
Do as she wishes.
Put someone else on the job.

136
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,519
<i>I didn't know she had a history like that.</i>

137
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,324
Ms. Kinoshita and Dr. Tokai
were pretty close.

138
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,126
Maybe we can ask him about it.

139
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,395
But he's not here anymore.

140
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,834
-This will be a pain to clean up.
-Jeez.

141
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,638
Dr. Nishizaki, new data
will be arriving shortly.

142
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,207
We'll be verifying it here, yes.

143
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,080
Dr. Tokai.

144
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,817
How are you finding Teika University?

145
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,219
Who are you?

146
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,655
My name is Takeda.

147
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,091
Don't you remember me?

148
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,363
Try not to get too lost here.

149
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,667
What do you mean by "I need rest"?

150
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,770
You can't just
take three weeks off like that.

151
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,874
-I need a break.
-What is it?

152
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,746
Without Dr. Tokai here,
Nekota doesn't want to work.

153
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,714
Do your job.

154
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,284
That is an order.

155
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,288
Truly appalling, nurses these days.

156
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,090
If you won't follow orders,

157
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:22,028
you can leave just like Dr. Tokai.

158
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,966
Director, I will take care of this.
I assure you.

159
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,802
Isn't that right, Nekota?

160
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,474
I can't believe it.
I'm counting on you, head nurse.

161
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,914
Don't you think director Moriya
has been really on edge lately.

162
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,217
Running around between Dr. Saeki
and the Ministry of Health…

163
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,452
Of course he's venting.

164
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,622
You can't blame him.

165
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,059
If you can't follow orders,
it's game over.

166
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,664
So you're telling me that Dr. Saeki

167
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,668
has been choosing high-risk patients
for clinical trials?

168
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,569
<i>That's right.</i>

169
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,272
After the newest medical tools were used,

170
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,443
he made sure to finish things
with his scalpel.

171
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,144
In other words,

172
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,016
trying to prove the ability
of a surgeon's skill over new technology.

173
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,754
The patient's safety must be made
a top priority in clinical trials.

174
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,656
<i>You don't need to worry.</i>

175
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:29,562
This time, we are backed by Mr. Tomizawa
from the Ministry of Health.

176
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,864
We've chosen a low-risk patient.

177
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,799
<i>There will be no failure.</i>

178
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,800
You've "chosen"?

179
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,605
Are you saying you have possession
of Tojo's patient data?

180
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,140
Well,

181
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,143
we have a few people on our side.

182
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,714
<i>We've picked a doctor that Dr. Saeki</i>
<i>has been training in the shadows.</i>

183
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,550
<i>Thanks to this new development,</i>

184
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,455
Tojo will no longer be able to handle
difficult operations successfully.

185
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,729
In two days, you'll undergo surgery
for mitral valve insufficiency.

186
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,765
All right. Excuse me, doctor?

187
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll see you tomorrow.

188
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,805
Yes? Dr. Nishizaki. Just a moment.

189
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,876
-My neck has been killing me lately.
-Really?

190
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,446
-I can't really move it.
-Is that so?

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,947
I must have slept the wrong way.

192
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,218
It seems like something happened
in the past

193
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,787
between Dr. Tokai's dad and Dr. Saeki.

194
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,921
What?

195
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,058
I overheard something recently.

196
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,994
Because I don't trust that man.

197
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,331
That man betrayed my father.

198
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,068
-Betrayed?
-Yes.

199
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,270
That reminds me.

200
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,573
When I was transporting those documents,
I came across an old paper.

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,808
A paper?

202
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,709
Yes.

203
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,913
The authors were Dr. Saeki
and Ichiro Tokai.

204
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,650
So the betrayal must have been…

205
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,461
There was one thing left over
from the documents we transported.

206
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,769
This brings me back.

207
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,507
I learned so much from Dr. Ichiro Tokai.

208
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:29,515
"A university hospital is established
on practical skills and research."

209
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,584
That's what he told me.

210
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,188
He sure put my arrogant self in my place.

211
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,398
But I threw all of that away.

212
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,272
PLEASE INSERT ID CARD

213
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,312
-What are you doing?
-This computer doesn't work.

214
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,549
-You need an ID card.
-Give me yours.

215
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,750
What?

216
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,754
I'm sorry, I can't.
There is important data on there.

217
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,156
I can't allow you to touch it.

218
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,225
Why, are you thinking of writing a paper?

219
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,226
A paper?

220
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,266
It looks like this super doctor
from Tojo University

221
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,669
has never written a paper before.

222
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,572
Online shopping.

223
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,973
What?

224
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,677
Your hospital doesn't have a rice cooker.

225
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,146
A rice cooker?

226
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,188
What are you doing?

227
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,890
Don't mess with that!

228
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,794
I'm making sure
the arm movement has improved.

229
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,695
I'll do it.

230
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,166
If you screw up this top-secret data too,
we'll be in trouble.

231
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,971
Are you suggesting
I would steal our patients' data?

232
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,906
I didn't say that.

233
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:07,479
How is it going
with the new clinical trial coordinator?

234
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,884
As a member of Tojo University Hospital,

235
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,954
I need you to stay on your toes.

236
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,925
One tiger prawn.

237
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,262
It seems like we've found
a replacement coordinator.

238
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,000
The patient wasn't pleased
with my presence.

239
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,503
Life is full of unexpected things.

240
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,641
Did you know about it?

241
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,244
About my malpractice.

242
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,516
If so, why did you continue
to trust me all this time?

243
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,154
I'm a trial coordinator
who caused a medical error.

244
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,125
If word were to get out,
Tojo risks losing its credibility.

245
00:14:55,194 --> 00:15:00,099
No matter what happened in the past,
I trust what I see in front of me.

246
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,903
You're an excellent person.

247
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,405
That's why I keep you around.

248
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,976
The past is what you make of it.

249
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,712
The truth.

250
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,515
True pain.

251
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,319
It's not for others to understand.

252
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,094
-How's the Caesar operating?
-We're preparing meticulously.

253
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,996
-I'm counting on you.
-Right.

254
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,967
Please pass the ethics committee documents
to Dr. Takashina.

255
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,436
-Understood.
-Also…

256
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,573
Make sure Ms. Yamamoto
is administered heparin and penicillin.

257
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,142
-Right.
-Okay.

258
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,049
But before, Dr. Tokai
didn't order a dose of penicillin.

259
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,984
It's Dr. Kurosaki's orders.

260
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,323
Let's get it over with.
I'll go see Ms. Yamamoto.

261
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,759
-You give the documents to Dr. Takashina.
-Okay.

262
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,399
Excuse me.

263
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,634
PENICILLIN

264
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,309
-It seems the next trial has been decided.
-Yes.

265
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,480
-I'll have you assist as well.
-Me?

266
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,249
That patient was being checked
by Dr. Tokai,

267
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,818
which means she's your patient too.

268
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,820
I've told Dr. Kurosaki.

269
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,656
But, I'm only a…

270
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,858
During that last surgery,

271
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,061
<i>you were able to follow</i>
<i>Dr. Tokai's orders instantly.</i>

272
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,699
After seeing your performance,

273
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,303
I've decided I need you for this.

274
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,072
Thank you.

275
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,976
Dr. Takashina.
The ethics committee documents.

276
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:51,944
Thanks.

277
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,314
Did Ms. Yamamoto get her medicine?

278
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,183
Miyamoto is giving her
heparin and penicillin now.

279
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,284
What?

280
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,521
-Penicillin?
-Yes. Dr. Kurosaki's orders.

281
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,791
That's not good.
Ms. Yamamoto is allergic to penicillin.

282
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,993
-Dr. Sera.
-Right!

283
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,972
What are you doing?

284
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,175
Ms. Yamamoto, are you okay?

285
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,312
PENICILLIN

286
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,547
Thank God.

287
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,484
Excuse me.

288
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,893
-Forgive us!
-We're truly sorry.

289
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,394
-The truth is…
-I can't believe it.

290
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,331
I never thought she would come to help me.

291
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,140
-She's allergic?
-You put the patient in danger.

292
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,577
What are you talking about?

293
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,313
Dr. Kurosaki would never do that!

294
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,783
He never gave you those orders.

295
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,987
You must have misheard what he said.

296
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,126
-But…
-I'm very sorry.

297
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,829
Unbelievable.

298
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,731
If you can't do your job right,

299
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,900
you might as well just quit.

300
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,938
There are countless others
who could replace you.

301
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,777
Dr. Kurosaki. There's an important
clinical trial coming up.

302
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,948
-Yes.
-Well then. Dismissed!

303
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,358
-Why?
-Why what?

304
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,527
Nothing happened. Let it go.

305
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,332
<i>After that,</i>

306
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,002
<i>a new clinical trial coordinator</i>
<i>was introduced.</i>

307
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,071
This is our new coordinator, Mr. Yamauchi.

308
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,307
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Dr. Yamauchi.

309
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,043
I'll be coordinating the medical trial.

310
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,147
Actually, can I have Kaori
do it after all?

311
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,553
I would like her to be in charge.

312
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
<i>She did?</i>

313
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,957
She said that if it's not you,

314
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,393
she doesn't intend
to participate in the trial.

315
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,632
You're the only one who can do it.
You wouldn't say no, would you?

316
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,605
Yes.

317
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,676
Yes, right. Okay.

318
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,659
How are you finding Teika University?

319
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,597
-What?
-I have a little something for you.

320
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:05,571
It's from Tokyo's oldest <i>onigiri </i>shop.

321
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:10,909
That's thoughtful of you.
I left all my rice back at Tojo too.

322
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,949
You're being treated
as a thief back at Tojo.

323
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,984
-What?
-The patients' data.

324
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,852
It seems you've given it to Dr. Nishizaki.

325
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,729
So, are you here to get
a checkup or something?

326
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,199
I'm here on business.

327
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,602
I do work for Teika too, you know.

328
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,371
You look like you should be a patient.

329
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,878
This can't be good.

330
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,213
It's Dr. Takeda's operation.

331
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,281
What happened?

332
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,116
-Blood pressure falling.
-Bring transfusion.

333
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,718
I guess food will have to wait.

334
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,987
Hurry up!

335
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,692
-VF persisting.
-Damn it.

336
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,128
VF won't stabilize.

337
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,229
What should we do?

338
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,398
The patient will die if we continue.

339
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,834
-We must stop operating.
-But…

340
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,371
We're finished! Turn off the camera now.

341
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,672
Right.

342
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,616
What are you doing here?
You've got no business here. Get out!

343
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,818
The patient had a heart attack.

344
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,620
How did you…

345
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,256
He said his neck hurt, didn't he?

346
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,926
If you had checked the coronary artery,
you would have known.

347
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,031
How do you plan on fixing it?

348
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,135
Isn't it written in your little paper?

349
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,138
What are you doing? Turn the camera off!

350
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,407
Don't. If you turn it off, you're dead.

351
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:55,113
You were about to end the operation
and be done with it, weren't you?

352
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,251
To make his death seem like
it happened after the surgery?

353
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,019
What's that?

354
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,723
What is Teika researching, a cover-up?

355
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,591
Someone get this man out of here!

356
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,827
If you have time to complain,
hurry and save the patient.

357
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,796
It's too late for that.

358
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,700
Ten million yen.

359
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,203
Write your resignation letter.

360
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:23,508
Pay me your severance money
and I'll cover it up.

361
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,610
What are you talking about?

362
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,680
-VF persisting.
-We don't have time!

363
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,117
Got it. I'll go tell your big boss then.

364
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,957
Okay, fine.

365
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,994
Help me.

366
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,431
Out of my way.

367
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,911
-We'll remove the inner artery.
-Thoracotomy tool.

368
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,814
-Thoracotomy tool!
-Right.

369
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,387
-Help me.
-Okay.

370
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,454
-Chair.
-Right.

371
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,692
Electroscalpel.

372
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,431
Prepare the following things for me.

373
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,568
Stabilizer, CO2 blower, holder,
beaver knife,

374
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,772
micro scissors,
microneedle holder, and 8-0.

375
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,607
-Move it!
-Yes.

376
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,842
-You remove the saphenous vein.
-Okay!

377
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,413
Internal mammary artery dissected.

378
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,214
He's fast.

379
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,150
All done.

380
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,384
Hurry up, will you?

381
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,020
-I'll take over. Move it.
-Right.

382
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,791
What an incredible skill.

383
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,361
So this is Tojo University's
devil of the operating room.

384
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,814
Get me the Metz.

385
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,916
Metz.

386
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,320
Okay. Suture complete.

387
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,589
-Finish up.
-Right!

388
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,195
Bad doctors are better off dead.

389
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,133
You can add that to your paper.

390
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,720
I thought the move
to Teika would help you mature a little.

391
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:53,358
-You're the same as always.
-If there's a patient, I help them.

392
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,160
That's all.

393
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,796
No matter where I go,

394
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,267
my job remains the same.

395
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,494
This is not enough.

396
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,531
This is all I was able to gather

397
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,899
in my current situation.

398
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,773
I'll leave it then.

399
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,043
But instead,

400
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,580
give me that.

401
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,116
<i>Excuse me.</i>

402
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,590
Once again,

403
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,626
I will be acting as coordinator
for the trial.

404
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,096
-My name is Kinoshita.
-I wanted to say…

405
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,300
thank you.

406
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,304
-I…
-First,

407
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,575
I would like to introduce
and explain the details of the trial.

408
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,177
<i>With Ms. Yamamoto's permission,</i>

409
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,314
<i>the second clinical trial of the Caesar</i>

410
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,282
<i>was finally decided.</i>

411
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,190
Ms. Kinoshita…

412
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,262
Thank you for fixing the IV mistake.

413
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,797
Thank you so much.

414
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,135
So…

415
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,573
Why did you decide to be
Ms. Yamamoto's trial coordinator?

416
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,942
If there's a patient…

417
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,612
If there's a patient, I help them.

418
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,113
I help that person.

419
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,348
That's all…

420
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,349
That is all.

421
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,189
Even if my job has changed
from nurse to coordinator,

422
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,258
my duties and obligations remain the same.

423
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,194
Dr. Tokai taught me that.

424
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,662
Dr. Tokai did?

425
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,899
I have to do my best work, no matter what.

426
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,168
But…

427
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,971
Even the thought of wanting to help

428
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,906
is not enough to solve one problem.

429
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,010
People.

430
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,145
People?

431
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,915
For a patient,
and even for the doctors helping them,

432
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,018
the biggest enemy
is not sickness or disease.

433
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,954
A person's worst enemy…

434
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,223
is other people.

435
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,460
A person's greatest enemy is other people.

436
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,064
Ms. Yamamoto said the same thing.

437
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,969
Being in my low-level position,

438
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,838
there was nothing I could do.

439
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,611
She also said that she wishes
to accept the trial

440
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,281
in hopes that future patients
can be helped as well.

441
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,618
She wants to help other people, too.

442
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,066
<i>Nekota.</i>

443
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,535
I have a job for you.

444
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,644
<i>The fateful day finally arrived.</i>

445
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,980
Kaori.

446
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,256
I would like to talk to you
about something.

447
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,325
The doctors are waiting for you.

448
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,527
Please hurry.

449
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,601
If you would like to talk…

450
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,373
I'll see you after your operation.

451
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,811
I hope the surgery goes well.

452
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:09,781
Thank you.

453
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,833
We'll now use
the Japan-made Darwin, Caesar,

454
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,902
to perform
aortic valve replacement surgery.

455
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,403
-Understood.
-Understood.

456
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,250
-You're saying this is a simple operation?
-That's right.

457
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,586
It will require delicate work, of course.

458
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,422
They'll have to suture the aorta.

459
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,058
It should be simple using the Caesar.

460
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,294
We can sit back and relax.

461
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,065
Blockage complete.

462
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,234
-I'll cut into the aorta.
-Okay.

463
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,948
The arms are moving
much smoother than before.

464
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,284
The improvements were a success.

465
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,486
This suturing was always troublesome,

466
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,421
but it's made to look so simple.

467
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,233
Complete.

468
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,801
Removing forceps.

469
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,873
What's her condition?

470
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,711
-Stable.
-Great.

471
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,182
Well done! A great success.

472
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,155
You all finish up.

473
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,490
-Good job.
-Great work.

474
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,326
Please wait!

475
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,330
Direct the ultrasound
to the left atrial appendage.

476
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,231
Okay.

477
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,908
-That's…
-A blood clot is loose!

478
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,809
BLOOD CLOT

479
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,578
A blood clot?

480
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,014
<i>We didn't see it in the tests.</i>

481
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,517
Dr. Takashina! We must remove it now!

482
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,224
Dr. Kurosaki!
Close up the patient for now.

483
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,861
Our planned operation was a success.

484
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,364
If you act brash and something happens…

485
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,765
<i>it will all be for nothing!</i>

486
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,469
<i>Do you understand me, Dr. Kurosaki?</i>

487
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,205
We'll close up.

488
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,076
If we ignore this,
her life will be on the line!

489
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,245
<i>If we act now, we can make it!</i>

490
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,615
It wasn't part of the plan.
We must close her up!

491
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,717
That is what hospital logic would say!

492
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,021
But to a patient, it's betrayal!

493
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,224
I will operate.

494
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,028
-Help me.
-Okay.

495
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,503
-Dr. Sera, support me.
-Right!

496
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,372
We'll now extract
the left atrial appendage thrombus.

497
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,640
-All right.
-All right.

498
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,309
-Forceps, please.
-Right.

499
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,913
Dr. Kurosaki!

500
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,982
<i>Dr. Kurosaki!</i>

501
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,054
I'm the head surgeon here.
Don't touch her!

502
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,556
The thrombus doesn't matter right now.

503
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,626
That's right, Dr. Kurosaki!

504
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:47,098
You won't mind if I share
this conversation with the patient?

505
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,903
What are you saying?

506
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,343
The rules are meant to be changed.

507
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,746
We can't put a life on the line
just because of some petty rules!

508
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,384
Do what you want.

509
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,227
-Opening the left atrium.
-Right!

510
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,795
-Remove blood with the pump.
-Right.

511
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,863
Get 4-0 ready.

512
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,264
-Right.
-Spoon too.

513
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,432
Okay.

514
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,505
Here.

515
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,709
-Get me the ultrasound.
-What?

516
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,312
I'll do it. Please.

517
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,988
Can he do it?

518
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,632
-Take out the thrombus.
-Right.

519
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,050
Extraction complete.

520
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,085
Are you sure that's it?

521
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,623
Yes. That's it.

522
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
Thank goodness.

523
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,039
They managed to succeed
without any incident.

524
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,875
It's all good since it worked out
in the end.

525
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,178
But how dare you use
the intercom like that?

526
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,448
Forgive me.

527
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,724
Miyamoto, I'll finish up.

528
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,264
Nekota.

529
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,601
I'm already finished cleaning.

530
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,371
There's one more thing
we need to clean up.

531
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,176
Well, we did stray from the original plan,

532
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,545
but the operation was a success.

533
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,282
Mr. Tomizawa from the Ministry of Health
will be pleased.

534
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,054
We'll move on to the next trial at once.

535
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,125
-I'll leave it to you.
-As for the next trial…

536
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,131
-Dr. Tokai?
-What are you doing here?

537
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,734
-Go back to Teika University.
-It was at Teika, actually…

538
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,972
that I found these.

539
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,612
This is a list of our patients.

540
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,548
So it was leaked to Teika?

541
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,186
It wasn't me!

542
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,555
-It couldn't be anyone else!
-Unfortunately,

543
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,659
it was not Dr. Takashina here.

544
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,796
The ID of the person who accessed
the documents from Tojo's computer

545
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,933
is written there on the document.

546
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,136
The person who copied and stole the data

547
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,005
is that person.

548
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:16,941
Whose ID is this?

549
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,117
Excuse us.

550
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,496
We looked up the owner of the ID number
on the documents.

551
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,936
0019292.

552
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,172
0019293.

553
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,976
0019294.

554
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,178
Ayumi Miyamoto.

555
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,146
AYUMI MIYAMOTO

556
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,182
It's her ID number.

557
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,492
What have you done?

558
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,095
You were connected to Teika?

559
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,064
What did they pay you?

560
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,166
Do you understand what you've done?

561
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,135
You've put us in quite a predicament!

562
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,947
Can you tell us… what really happened?

563
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,584
I've seen that terrified face.

564
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,387
I saw it once before.

565
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,959
<i>She mistakenly handed the doctor</i>
<i>the wrong tool.</i>

566
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,833
Can you tell me what happened?

567
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,871
It's okay.

568
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,575
I will protect you.

569
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,778
I promise I will.

570
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,417
Your dad has lung cancer, I hear.

571
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,056
He's currently admitted to Tojo, too.

572
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,692
In the executive suite.

573
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,432
You can't afford that
with your meager salary.

574
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,571
Who put you on this? Huh?

575
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,709
As an exchange,

576
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,882
you were forced to copy the data.

577
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,251
What did you say?

578
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,521
Who was it?

579
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,224
Tell me.

580
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,829
Who was it?

581
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,267
No crying.

582
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,836
Hey.

583
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,538
Say it.

584
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,678
Who was it?

585
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,195
I see you're teaching them well,

586
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,566
Director Moriya.

587
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,204
Director?

588
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,108
What? Nonsense.

589
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,377
I don't know about this.

590
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,946
She stole the data herself!

591
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,083
After all that, putting the blame on me?

592
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,987
You're still running away
after all this time?

593
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,557
You're like a surgeon
who has abandoned an operation.

594
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,261
What a pitiful hospital director you are.

595
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,398
Lower than me. The lowest of low.

596
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,734
Where's your proof
that I have a hand in this?

597
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,936
Get a grip, old man.

598
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,556
SENT BY NOBUAKI MORIYA

599
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,592
This is the email you sent to Teika.

600
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,760
DIRECTOR NOBUAKI MORIYA

601
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,898
The patient data was attached
to the message.

602
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,901
There is a nice guy at Teika.

603
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,971
He was kind enough to lend me his ID card.

604
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,643
<i>When I logged in…</i>

605
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,648
DR. NISHIZAKI, I'VE ATTACHED
A LIST OF ALL OUR PATIENTS.

606
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,417
TOJO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR NOBUAKI MORIYA

607
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,953
…I found your email.

608
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,570
Director Moriya.

609
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,174
There's a rumor going around

610
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:22,379
that Teika has a special position ready
for you after you retire.

611
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:27,685
Leaking patient data to a third party
for your own lousy gain.

612
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,186
This is a serious crime.

613
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,325
I doubt that offer will still stand
after this comes out.

614
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,228
Please wait, Dr. Saeki!

615
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,532
I'll do anything!
Please don't have me dismissed!

616
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,536
In that case,
I'll let it pass on one condition.

617
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,971
Anything at all!

618
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,710
You will accept the return of Dr. Tokai
from Teika University.

619
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,213
You're getting bored over there, I'm sure.

620
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:08,425
You'll double his pay.
Out of your own pocket.

621
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,362
Okay.

622
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,200
Dr. Tokai.

623
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,369
Um… Thank you so much.

624
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,906
So you'll be coming back to Tojo?

625
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,341
-There's something I need to do.
-What?

626
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,579
Huh? Dr. Tokai. You're back?

627
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,547
Yes.

628
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,815
You know what that means, Dr. Sera.

629
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,698
I'm…

630
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,801
so sorry.

631
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,740
A person's greatest enemy is other people.

632
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,176
But…

633
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,181
A person's best allies are people, too.

634
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,050
What?

635
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,524
When I was fired from being a nurse,
it really was painful.

636
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,793
But…

637
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,596
I was able to find a new job that I love.

638
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,434
I took a different path,
but my goals remain the same.

639
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:27,738
We're in this together.

640
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,447
Very well.

641
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,417
I was planning on cutting Moriya off
eventually anyway.

642
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,821
Why didn't you contact me?

643
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:48,559
With this, Tojo won't be suspicious
of you anymore, will they?

644
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,030
Accelerate the trials
and get me that paper.

645
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:54,898
Right.

646
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,870
There is a possibility that Dr. Saeki

647
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,474
will stop the publication
as he did with the Snipe paper.

648
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,578
Don't worry. Measures are in place.

649
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,319
There's nothing Dr. Saeki can do about it.

650
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,525
Come in.

651
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,027
Excuse me.

652
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,565
If what you said the other day is true,

653
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,468
Dr. Saeki has significant issues
as a researcher.

654
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,237
I would like to ask his true intent.

655
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,740
Yes. Go right ahead.

656
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,350
All done!

657
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,020
After we cleaned all this up,
we had to put it back…

658
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,822
What a struggle.

659
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,794
<i>He thinks about nothing but money.</i>

660
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,329
Do you think so?

661
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:01,865
Dr. Tokai said

662
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,902
he has something he needs to do at Tojo.

663
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,571
Something he needs to do?

664
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:12,910
Forceps.

665
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,546
I…

666
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,450
I found a strange photo here recently.

667
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,918
A photo?

668
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,320
An X-ray.

669
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,623
Inside the heart…

670
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,728
there was a pair of forceps.

671
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,196
What?

672
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,369
Why did Dr. Tokai have a photo like that?

673
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,880
<i>The final operation before the election.</i>

674
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,015
What's their name? Tell me!

675
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,651
<i>I have to take down Dr. Seigo Saeki.</i>

676
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:57,321
Dr. Nishizaki is operating at last.

677
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,890
<i>Perhaps Dr. Tokai</i>
<i>is hoping for my failure.</i>

678
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,059
<i>We can't find Dr. Saeki anywhere.</i>

679
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,361
<i>Find out where he's going. Follow him.</i>

680
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,898
<i>There's a patient that Tojo</i>
<i>doesn't want anyone to know about.</i>

681
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,333
In the end, it's people.

682
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,035
Man always prevails.

683
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,003
<i>Dr. Saeki!</i>

684
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,038
<i>It finally happened?</i>

685
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,039
