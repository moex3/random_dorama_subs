1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,572
Right this way.

2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,587
They're here.

3
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,759
Dr. Nishizaki.
Welcome to Tojo University Hospital.

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,561
Thank you for
your warm welcome, Dr. Saeki.

5
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,664
We look forward to working with you
in the coming weeks

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,567
and we appreciate your cooperation.

7
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,902
The pleasure is all mine.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,738
Let's work together
and ensure a smooth operation.

9
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,376
<i>Two universities</i>
<i>with zero interest in cooperating.</i>

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,912
<i>Why did this happen in the first place?</i>

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,515
<i>Just one week prior…</i>

12
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,416
ONE WEEK EARLIER

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,918
<i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>
editor-in-chief Mr. Ikenaga

14
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>paid us a visit along with Dr. Nishizaki.</i>

15
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,923
A reveal event for the Caesar?

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,258
As I'm sure you've heard,

17
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:03,430
the next Surgical Society summit
will be hosted by Teika University.

18
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,833
As the centerpiece
of our research announcement,

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,105
I would like to reveal the final operation
of the Caesar's clinical trial.

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,008
However, the Caesar
is currently at Tojo University.

21
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,710
Even if you wish to reveal it--

22
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,180
The operation will be performed at Tojo

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,584
and broadcast live to the event venue
at Teika University.

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,521
The Japan-made Darwin is receiving
attention from around the world.

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,557
We at the <i>Japan Surgical Journal</i>

26
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,526
would be thrilled
to report on this operation.

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,830
I see. That would be
quite a large-scale experiment.

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,301
Very well. You have my blessing.

29
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,802
I'm glad to hear it.

30
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,106
The operating surgeon will be
Dr. Takashina or Dr. Kurosaki.

31
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:51,511
I would personally like to entrust
the operation to Dr. Sakaguchi

32
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,815
who is leading the Caesar research
at Teika University.

33
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,654
I would like Teika University
to spearhead this operation.

34
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,326
What do you think, Dr. Saeki?

35
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,598
Very well.

36
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,170
-Well then.
-In that case,

37
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,074
I would like you to operate,
Dr. Nishizaki.

38
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,543
Me?

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,178
This is a monumental operation

40
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,847
that will mark the completion
of the Caesar.

41
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,917
The operation should be done
by the man leading that research.

42
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,120
That man is you, Dr. Nishizaki.

43
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,224
If that sounds too difficult for you,

44
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,395
then I would like to ask
one of my own men at Tojo, as usual.

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,232
Understood.

46
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:48,968
Let's do it.

47
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,905
Dr. Nishizaki is operating at last.

48
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,274
This is exciting.

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,742
Yes, it sure is.

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,814
Dr. Saeki waited until the last second
to deliver the blow.

51
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,683
It might be for the best.

52
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,685
If you complete the operation,

53
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,688
it could greatly benefit
you in the election.

54
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,723
It would virtually guarantee your victory.

55
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,626
That is true.

56
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,529
I look forward to the day of the surgery.

57
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,698
I'll see you off.

58
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,572
But if we fail,

59
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,375
it will all be for nothing.

60
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,413
We'll now perform on-pump,
on-beat mitral valve surgery.

61
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,948
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

62
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,519
For better or for worse,

63
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,055
this operation will decide everything.

64
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,658
That's why, for Teika's good name,

65
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,127
I will ensure a successful operation.

66
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,629
Right.

67
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:57,103
Thus ends the age of the scalpel.

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,338
<i>-Scalpel.</i>
<i>-Here.</i>

69
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,409
-Metz.
-Here.

70
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,451
-Dr. Saeki is really amazing.
-The professor is great,

71
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,187
but Nurse Fujiwara keeping up
is incredible too.

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,389
They've been working together
for over 20 years.

73
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,593
-That long?
-They're closer than a married couple.

74
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,199
We'll remove the valve tip. Scalpel.

75
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,533
Here.

76
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,641
What?

77
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,513
I'm sorry, it was my mistake.

78
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,117
I was late preparing the instruments.
Please forgive me.

79
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,185
-Continue the procedure.
-Okay.

80
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,654
Scalpel.

81
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,326
-Metz.
-Here.

82
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,967
So it was the nurse's fault? What a joke.

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,671
I would have preferred
to see Dr. Saeki mess up himself.

84
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,107
It was a close call,
but it seems like they're okay.

85
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,577
Did the head nurse really make a mistake?

86
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,881
-What?
-I guess not.

87
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,353
The problem is the patient.

88
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:26,059
Takashina, do you understand
why I sent you to infiltrate Tojo?

89
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,628
Well?

90
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,296
Yes.

91
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,801
I will find a patient with mild issues
to ensure there is a low risk of failure.

92
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,471
Someone perfect for our big reveal.

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,140
I'm counting on you.

94
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,675
<i>Soon after,</i>

95
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,845
<i>details of the Caesar reveal event</i>
<i>were shared with everyone.</i>

96
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,681
The operating team will include
members from Tojo.

97
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,783
Any volunteers?

98
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,586
-We'd be just assistants, right?
-Exactly.

99
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,722
This operation
is for Teika's sake, isn't it?

100
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,624
Why do we have to help our enemy?

101
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,825
It's a done deal.

102
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,263
I'll join the team.

103
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,235
I have the most experience
doing surgeries with the Caesar.

104
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,703
All right then. Thank you.

105
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,272
Anyone else?

106
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,109
-You have experience, don't you Dr. Sera?
-No, they don't need me.

107
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,778
Then I'll do it.

108
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,515
Dr. Tokai…

109
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,819
You too.

110
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,454
Huh?

111
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,523
What is this about?

112
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,095
I'll be joining the Caesar team.

113
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,366
<i>Five days before the Caesar reveal event,</i>

114
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,270
<i>the Teika team arrived at Tojo</i>
<i>for preparations.</i>

115
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,940
Let's get started with the preparations
at once.

116
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:21,841
Right.

117
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,445
Please use our facilities freely
until the day of the surgery.

118
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,681
-Show them around.
-Right. This way, please.

119
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,759
Please excuse me for a moment.

120
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,162
Wait, what about Teika?

121
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,765
Let them do whatever they want.

122
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,004
-Hey, that's my desk!
-What are you doing?

123
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,375
We were given permission
to use this room as we please.

124
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,478
Where are we supposed to work?

125
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,581
You're free to work over there.

126
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,287
It's so cramped!

127
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,295
Look at that. It's the simulation Caesar.

128
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,030
If they have all those things,

129
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,099
they should have lent it to us
in the first place!

130
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,667
Dr. Sakaguchi.

131
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,703
Yes.

132
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,540
We'll be holding a meeting.

133
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,776
I would like you all to leave.

134
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,545
What?

135
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,580
Thank you for your cooperation.

136
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,617
What the hell is going on?
This is our office.

137
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,485
The professor gave them permission.

138
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,554
Yeah, but this is taking it too far.

139
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,790
Regarding the crucial element,
our patient…

140
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,995
Tojo University has selected
three candidates for us to choose from.

141
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,564
All three of them are severe cases.

142
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,600
As expected, they've chosen
difficult candidates on purpose.

143
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,569
We will choose a candidate

144
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,273
after we have finished examining each one.

145
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,208
Dr. Nishizaki will be operating.

146
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,044
Dr. Takashina and I will be assisting.

147
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,347
-As far as the rest of the team…
-You take forever.

148
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,824
Dr. Nishizaki. You plan on making
this operation a success, right?

149
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,260
-Of course, I do.
-In that case, your assistant…

150
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,362
Dr. Tokai, please. Excuse me.

151
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,566
Me and this guy. We don't need
anyone else getting in our way.

152
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,275
Any patient is fine by me.

153
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,878
You'll be fine if I'm there.

154
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,014
It will succeed no matter who operates.

155
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,317
Lucky for you.

156
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,553
Dr. Nishizaki.

157
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,527
What's that?

158
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,163
There's one more person
I've asked to help.

159
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,973
I'm Nekota. An operating nurse.

160
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,510
Congratulations.

161
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,914
Chairman Nishizaki.

162
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,185
Nekota is on the team too?

163
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:23,823
Dr. Tokai seems to be
taking things seriously this time.

164
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,724
Still,

165
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,928
up until now, he never showed any interest
in the newest equipment.

166
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,096
You're right.

167
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:35,568
Why is Dr. Tokai acting
like he wants to help Teika?

168
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,537
Of course, the patient's life
is our top priority.

169
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,706
We're hoping for a successful operation.

170
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,441
But there's also the election.

171
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,177
Perhaps Dr. Tokai
is hoping for my failure.

172
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,482
That could be said as well.

173
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,288
Whatever it may be,
there's no one else we can rely on.

174
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,258
I'll be back.

175
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,627
What about the medical safety meeting?

176
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,996
Do it without me.

177
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>The doctor has been out a lot recently.</i>

178
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,505
<i>Without him here,</i>
<i>there's no stopping Teika.</i>

179
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,440
<i>They'll take over completely.</i>

180
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>After that,</i>

181
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,025
<i>simulations of the operation</i>

182
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,628
<i>were held leading up to the big day.</i>

183
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,597
-Okay, follow me.
-Right.

184
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,607
How many times has he used the Caesar?

185
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,877
It's his first time touching it.

186
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,015
Artificial valve ring placement complete.

187
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,450
-4-0, please.
-Right.

188
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,256
Okay, Great Doctor.

189
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,258
You're up.

190
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,094
Right.

191
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,139
Complete.

192
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
A job well done, as is to be expected.

193
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,646
Well. You too.

194
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,484
And you as well.
You have quite the skills.

195
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,486
You too, Great Doctor.

196
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,890
Let's repeat this success
during the real surgery as well.

197
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,766
This is Teika's big reveal event.

198
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,004
Will you just stand there
sucking your thumbs?

199
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,578
Get me the exam data
of the three candidate patients.

200
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,679
Yes!

201
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,988
You're being quite cooperative this time.

202
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,358
You had us good last time.

203
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,860
What were you unhappy about?

204
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,198
You didn't have a good rice cooker.

205
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,235
That reminds me.

206
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,071
When you left Teika,

207
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,177
a man from our hospital
named Dr. Takeda left as well.

208
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,745
I'll leave it then.

209
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,148
But instead, give me that.

210
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,218
<i>We found traces of someone</i>
<i>using his ID card</i>

211
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,421
to access Teika's main computer system.

212
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,325
What confuses me
is the nature of the access.

213
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:52,131
Out of the more than 100
nationwide hospitals connected to Teika,

214
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,836
they were searching
for one particular patient.

215
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,437
I-I-N

216
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,709
The name Tatsuji Iinuma was searched.

217
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,847
Tatsuji Iinuma?

218
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,317
However, the search returned zero results.

219
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,622
Unfortunately, that patient doesn't seem
to be in any of our hospitals.

220
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,292
Why were you searching for that patient?

221
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,062
It must have been that Dr. Takeda guy.

222
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,866
What is it you're planning this time?

223
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,636
If this operation succeeds,

224
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,240
I will without a doubt
win the chairman election.

225
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,745
That means that your mentor,

226
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,349
Dr. Saeki, will lose.

227
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,053
That's why I'm trying to help you, right?

228
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,928
Let's get this done together, okay?

229
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,331
Great Doctor Nishizaki.

230
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,209
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>a new patient named Ryuichi Kobayashi</i>

231
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,079
<i>was admitted suddenly,</i>
<i>jumping ahead of a long line of patients</i>

232
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,881
<i>waiting for an operation from Dr. Saeki.</i>

233
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,517
I'm honored to have Dr. Saeki
as my operating surgeon.

234
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,187
Dr. Tokai will be taking care of you
until next week's operation.

235
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,990
He's a man I trust.

236
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,092
That's very reassuring.

237
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,398
-I'm going out for a bit.
-I see.

238
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,033
Pardon me.

239
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,306
Dr. Saeki hasn't been
around here much lately.

240
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,410
Maybe he's just sick of work
and playing hooky.

241
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,012
What are you saying?
Of course, that's not it.

242
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,114
Don't you think it's odd he's not here?

243
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,155
Track him down.

244
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,323
What?

245
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,124
Find out where he's going.

246
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,493
Follow him.

247
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,531
Are you going today as well?

248
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,101
Please let me go with you.

249
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,703
I'll be fine by myself.

250
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,842
Or are you worried about something?

251
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,745
No.

252
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,593
Are you sure it's a good idea
to be tailing him?

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,595
No, but Dr. Tokai told me to do it.

254
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,865
He thinks Dr. Saeki
is skipping out on work.

255
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,867
I want to prove that's not true.

256
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,970
-Thanks for coming with me.
-Well…

257
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,339
I just finished my shift so it's fine.

258
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,609
But I don't think I'll be of much help.

259
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,578
That's not true.

260
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,513
I need another witness.

261
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,782
And it's shady if I do it alone.

262
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,118
With the two of us, we can say
we're on a date or something.

263
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,353
-A date?
-What?

264
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,757
No, not like that. It's just an excuse.

265
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,458
-An excuse?
-That's right.

266
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
I see.

267
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,361
I mean…

268
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,131
I… it doesn't have to be an excuse…

269
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,332
Dr. Sera!

270
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,535
Oh, no.

271
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,139
What? We lost sight of him.

272
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,243
-You wasted time saying weird stuff!
-Sorry.

273
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,815
I can't do it.
Dr. Tokai has got me in a funk.

274
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,986
Can't we take him off the team?

275
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,622
Take Dr. Tokai off the team?

276
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,690
I'm the surgeon in charge.

277
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:44,129
He is just an assistant,
but I can't let him take my glory.

278
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,499
There's one other problem.

279
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,103
Aren't there any other candidate patients?

280
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,874
I've been searching for a low-risk case,
but I haven't had much luck.

281
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,312
They're all too risky.

282
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,917
They were all scheduled
to be operated on by Dr. Saeki.

283
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,288
He's trying to make me fail
with a high-risk case.

284
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,723
His oldest trick in the book.

285
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,559
Dr. Tokai joining the team

286
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,528
is likely a ploy to prevent me
from succeeding as well.

287
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,465
-I don't think he would--
-You know what's at stake, Dr. Takashina.

288
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:24,436
If we fail,
you'll lose your place at Teika.

289
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,973
Find me a patient.

290
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,709
And while you're at it,
find a way to get rid of Dr. Tokai.

291
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,945
Show me your worth.

292
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:34,947
Get it done.

293
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,461
Where's Dr. Sera today?

294
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,697
On a date.

295
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,565
What?

296
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,367
What about you? Are you sure you're okay?

297
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,069
Neglecting the Caesar.

298
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,307
I would like to talk with you
since we're both on the team.

299
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,580
Is the great Dr. Nishizaki telling you
to kick me out?

300
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,019
You always obey your superiors.

301
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,923
It's to ensure the proliferation
of the Snipe and Caesar.

302
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,858
It is what I believe in.

303
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,828
Up until now,

304
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,498
you never showed any interest
in new technology, until now.

305
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,867
What has changed?

306
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,969
I don't like robots but this time,

307
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,872
there's someone I dislike even more.

308
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,608
Are you talking about Dr. Saeki?

309
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,477
I'll cooperate this time.

310
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,515
And yet up till now you've always
done as he said. Why?

311
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,220
I don't understand what you believe in.

312
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,189
I don't believe in anything.

313
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,692
The only thing I believe in is myself.

314
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,563
Dr. Tokai.

315
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,032
-Kobayashi's exam results are here.
-Thanks.

316
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:03,902
Move it.

317
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,220
This is…

318
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,955
Sakura Hospital.

319
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,023
SAKURA HOSPITAL

320
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,526
I see. About Kobayashi?

321
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:31,396
It wasn't mentioned in the handover,
but what kind of patient is he?

322
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,700
A special case brought in by Dr. Saeki.

323
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,536
It's top secret, so be careful.

324
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,809
Mitral valve insufficiency disorder?

325
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:49,514
It's a light case.
He could be perfect for the Caesar trial.

326
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,483
He's scheduled for surgery by Dr. Saeki.

327
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,152
We already have three candidates
for the trial.

328
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,795
Well, well. Dr. Saeki.

329
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,565
-Mind if I drop by?
-Not at all.

330
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,500
Let's go to the examination room.

331
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,375
Did he just say examination room?

332
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,244
Yes. Maybe he's not feeling well.

333
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,480
Scalpel.

334
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,490
It's almost operation day.
Still no other optional patients?

335
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,227
There is one patient named Kobayashi.

336
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,196
He has been scheduled
for surgery with Dr. Saeki.

337
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:44,102
-Then we'll take the patient from him.
-But--

338
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,539
If we can use that patient,
I can prove that the Caesar

339
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,676
is far more effective
than Dr. Saeki's black forceps.

340
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,812
If it's a low-risk patient,

341
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,815
we won't need that Dr. Tokai either.

342
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,451
Dr. Takashina.

343
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,055
Show your worth.

344
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,958
<i>Got it? Your worth.</i>

345
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,699
So where did he go?

346
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,300
To Sakura Hospital.

347
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,637
It seemed like he was there
for an examination.

348
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,640
-Sakura Hospital?
-Yes.

349
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,575
So…

350
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,644
About his last operation,

351
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:30,482
I thought I saw him tremble for a moment.

352
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,251
Do you think he might be ill?

353
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,620
It's his heart.

354
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,588
His heart?

355
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,027
-Dr. Takashina.
-Hello.

356
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,967
About Dr. Saeki…

357
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,437
Is that true?

358
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,875
Great Doctor Nishizaki would be happy
to hear about it.

359
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,646
Yes.

360
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,916
He will.

361
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,853
So go tell him.

362
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,524
-Dr. Saeki has heart problems?
-That's what Dr. Tokai said.

363
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:52,030
Didn't you say you saw an X-ray photo
with a pair of forceps inside a heart?

364
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,899
I did.

365
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,368
What if that X-ray…

366
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,670
was of Dr. Saeki?

367
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,873
I'll find an opportunity to look
for that X-ray.

368
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,643
Could you try finding the data for me?

369
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,778
Sure, I can try.

370
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,091
SAEKI

371
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,939
-Yes?
-Did you find it, Dr. Sera?

372
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,908
I can't find it anywhere. You?

373
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,878
I tried searching Dr. Saeki's name.

374
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,582
There's no X-ray and no trace
of any information at all.

375
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,749
Not even a check-up?

376
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,453
-I'll keep looking.
-Okay.

377
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:53,024
The name Tatsuji Iinuma was searched.

378
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,626
Wait a second.

379
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,127
Yes?

380
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,599
Would you mind looking up Tatsuji Iinuma?

381
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,034
Tatsuji Iinuma?

382
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,237
Yes, just in case.

383
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,206
Got it. I'll call you back later.

384
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,080
NO RESULTS FOR "SEIGO SAEKI"

385
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,717
TATSUJI IINUMA

386
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,559
Nekota.

387
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,195
What are you doing here?

388
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:41,540
Um, you're always sleeping
in Dr. Tokai's room, right?

389
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,712
Did you ever come across an X-ray photo?

390
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,116
In the photo, there is…

391
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,586
-a pair of forceps--
-What is this about?

392
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,255
Miwa.

393
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,859
I don't know what you're looking for.

394
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,462
But if you get in Dr. Tokai's way,

395
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,967
you'll be crushed.

396
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:28,386
Great. These all seem like
good candidates.

397
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,387
Yes.

398
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,556
Whoever is chosen,

399
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,792
you'll be able to operate
in ideal conditions.

400
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,926
Got it.

401
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,429
Anything else?

402
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,665
<i>Do you think he might be ill?</i>

403
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,634
It's his heart.

404
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,672
-No.
-Very well.

405
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,244
Let's figure out
which patient we'll choose.

406
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,046
Please stay on top of it.

407
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,481
Right.

408
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,102
A case of a doctor
neglecting his own health?

409
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,409
A cardiac surgeon with a bad heart.
How ironic.

410
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,844
What are you talking about?

411
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,148
By the way, I've been wondering
about this Kobayashi, a new patient.

412
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,020
While he does need surgery,
it doesn't seem very urgent.

413
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,154
A light case.

414
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,924
And yet he was suddenly admitted.

415
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,093
Playing favorites, are you?

416
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,295
It's a favor for a friend.

417
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,733
Another thing,
how is the Caesar operation going?

418
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,337
They've decided on a patient named Kudo.

419
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,040
I will be there as well,

420
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,709
so I'm sure it'll succeed.

421
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:02,814
That means that I'll lose
the election for chairman.

422
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,054
I don't care. Don't hold back.
Give it your best.

423
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,057
But remember this, Tokai…

424
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,660
No matter how great the Caesar may be,

425
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,630
in the end, it's people.

426
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,168
Man always prevails.

427
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,216
<i>The fateful day finally arrived.</i>

428
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:42,187
Why didn't you tell Dr. Nishizaki
about Dr. Saeki?

429
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,191
I'll tell him when the operation
is complete.

430
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,696
No matter where we all stand,

431
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,465
we must think of the patient.

432
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,770
Having Dr. Tokai on the team
is our best option.

433
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,609
It's a decision
based on what I believe in.

434
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,150
What you believe in?

435
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,752
TEIKA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

436
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,887
The wonder of the Japan-made Darwin

437
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,223
will finally be revealed to all of Japan.

438
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,157
Indeed.

439
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:24,028
I hear there will be a welcome message
from Dr. Saeki during the broadcast.

440
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,930
-That's right.
-I'm looking forward to it.

441
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,898
Certainly.

442
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,033
Please excuse me.

443
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,805
We're about to start. What is it?

444
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,206
<i>We have a problem.</i>

445
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,776
We can't find Dr. Saeki anywhere.

446
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,045
-What?
-No one has heard from him since morning.

447
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,148
He's supposed to give a greeting
before the operation.

448
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,082
If he doesn't show up,

449
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,317
it will leave a bad impression
on the board members.

450
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,485
There's another thing.

451
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,455
We kindly ask that you wait
in the family waiting room

452
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,223
until the operation is complete.

453
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,792
We'll keep you updated.

454
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,794
-Thank you.
-Please excuse me.

455
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,498
Well, well. Dr. Saeki.

456
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,835
Why is the director from Sakura here?

457
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,404
He's that Kobayashi's dad.

458
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,041
Well, well.
Thank you for caring for my son.

459
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,109
Our pleasure.

460
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,679
Today is the day.
I'm counting on you to help my son.

461
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,250
Today?

462
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,252
Didn't you hear?

463
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,022
For today's joint operation with Teika,

464
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,758
they've chosen Kobayashi.

465
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:37,769
What?

466
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,470
But why?

467
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,741
-Hey! What's going on?
-That's what we want to know.

468
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,577
Dr. Kurosaki told us.

469
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,479
He said that he showed you
the patient's chart before.

470
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,048
You were kicked out of Teika,

471
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,250
but you've been
working with Dr. Nishizaki all along?

472
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,518
That's dirty.

473
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,387
The patient was scheduled with Dr. Saeki.
To snatch that away is--

474
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,991
-You're wrong! I did no such thing!
-Then who did?

475
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,462
Me.

476
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,167
Dr. Tokai…

477
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,303
I received a request
from Dr. Tokai this morning.

478
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,374
I've explained the trial to Mr. Kobayashi
and received his approval.

479
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,243
Why did you do this?

480
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,814
We're starting the preparations!
Please hurry!

481
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,317
Hear that?

482
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,537
-Hey.
-Camera.

483
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,877
To our audience at Teika University.

484
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,782
<i>Today, I am honored to present to you</i>
<i>the surgery that will mark the completion</i>

485
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,486
<i>of the domestically produced Darwin</i>
<i>known as Caesar.</i>

486
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,662
<i>We had originally planned for Dr. Saeki</i>

487
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:16,668
to make an appearance this morning,
but his whereabouts are currently unknown.

488
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:22,507
It would seem the doctor has been dealing
with serious heart problems.

489
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,577
His heart?

490
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,581
The board members are watching.
He shouldn't say that!

491
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:35,653
Today's patient was originally scheduled
for surgery with Dr. Saeki.

492
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,191
But the doctor is in no shape to operate.

493
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,426
Instead,

494
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,394
for the patient's safety,

495
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,532
<i>it was decided to change</i>
<i>to surgery performed by the Caesar.</i>

496
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,768
That explains everything
about the current situation.

497
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,603
I'm worried about Dr. Saeki,

498
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,073
but for the patient's sake,
I'm glad we have the Caesar.

499
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,877
This patient's surgery
was carefully rehearsed and simulated

500
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,613
by Teika University's brilliant staff.

501
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,090
I would like to perform today's operation
with the same staff.

502
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,794
Which means
we'll be asking you all to leave.

503
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,399
Dr. Tokai. Thank you
for the helpful information.

504
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,635
But that is a different matter
from this surgery.

505
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,216
What are you doing?

506
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,686
-You too. Out.
-What?

507
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:46,190
This is Teika University's surgery.
Performed by doctors from Teika.

508
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,561
It's none of Tojo University's business.
That means you, too.

509
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,334
And so, once again,

510
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,103
we will now perform
mitral valve repair surgery

511
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,973
with the Japan-made Darwin, Caesar.

512
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,776
Now it's entirely
a Teika University surgery!

513
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,179
As if they are solely responsible
for the Caesar's success.

514
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,416
It's a fact that Teika completed it!

515
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,784
How dare you!

516
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,786
Stealing our patient and the credit too?

517
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,992
First, we'll make an incision
in the pericardium.

518
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:30,635
You told them everything about this
patient, and about Dr. Saeki's health…

519
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,072
Why?

520
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,375
I have to take down Dr. Seigo Saeki.

521
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,081
There was something
I wanted to confirm too.

522
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,983
-Confirm?
-That guy on the screen there.

523
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,588
His plan was to get rid of you all along.

524
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,758
-Anything else?
-No.

525
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,531
There was no need

526
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,268
for what you believe in.

527
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,340
But you were removed
from the team too, Dr. Tokai.

528
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,042
Yes, I was.

529
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,344
<i>In the end, it's people.</i>

530
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,348
Man always prevails.

531
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,551
Man always prevails in the end.

532
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,287
Anyway.

533
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,190
Wake me up when it's over.

534
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,064
Pericardial incision complete.

535
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,767
Next, we proceed
with myocardial protection.

536
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,304
Dr. Nishizaki is very skilled
even with a robot.

537
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,175
Aortic occlusion.

538
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,243
-Right.
-Right.

539
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,377
-Clamping forceps.
-Here.

540
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:47,812
Not these.

541
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,148
Bring the forceps
that Dr. Nishizaki always uses.

542
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,884
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up!

543
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,019
They seem to be in a rush.

544
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:59,023
A Darwin surgery is a team effort.
It's not just the operating surgeon.

545
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,226
The assistant following up
with the robot's arm is crucial.

546
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,362
But they don't have the experience.

547
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,698
-What are you doing? Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

548
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,669
Clamping complete.

549
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,237
Okay.

550
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,010
The left forceps
is not in their line of sight.

551
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,445
-What?
-This is not good.

552
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,652
The aorta has sustained damage!

553
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,262
-Compress the bleeding area!
-Suction! Now!

554
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,297
Right!

555
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,731
-Adding volume!
-Okay!

556
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,899
Take over!

557
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,467
This is really bad.

558
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,036
-Hurry!
-We need gauze, quick!

559
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,311
What are you doing? More suction!

560
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,079
It's no use! It won't stop!

561
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,247
Damn it.

562
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,295
Hey, get out of here!

563
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,632
Unskilled doctors are better off dead.

564
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,803
But I'll keep you alive for now.

565
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:21,505
What?

566
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,140
I told you, didn't I?

567
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,377
It will be fine as long as I'm here.

568
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,247
I'll stop the blood.

569
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,581
You carry on.

570
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,583
Finish the Caesar operation.

571
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,553
It will be your win in the end.

572
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,055
Congrats, Chairman.

573
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,160
This mistake of yours…

574
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,032
I'll make it all disappear.

575
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,772
-Nekota.
-Yes.

576
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,775
Move it.

577
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,313
Move it!

578
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,816
-4-0.
-Here.

579
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,300
Dr. Saeki…

580
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,572
-Professor!
-Dr. Saeki.

581
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,314
Let me take over, Dr. Tokai.
This is a joint operation.

582
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,950
If Dr. Nishizaki won't operate,
then I will.

583
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,986
Is that okay?

584
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,926
Tokai, I said I would take over.

585
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,330
Move it.

586
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,634
I'll take over now.

587
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,337
Okay.

588
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,952
-Get this out of the way.
-Right.

589
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,492
I'll do a minor thoracotomy and suture
the injured area to stop the bleeding.

590
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,160
Removing clamp. Flow down.

591
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,798
-Scalpel.
-Here.

592
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,970
Dr. Takashina, Dr. Sera, help me.

593
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,238
-Okay.
-Okay.

594
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,539
-Electroscalpel.
-Here.

595
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,274
-Thoracotomy device.
-Here.

596
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,911
-4-0.
-Okay.

597
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,764
-Metz.
-Here.

598
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,833
Blood pressure…

599
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,668
stabilized.

600
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,175
Next, we'll perform minimally invasive
beating heart mitral valve surgery.

601
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,610
-Scalpel.
-Here.

602
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,779
Professor…

603
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,817
Who said he was in no state to operate?

604
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,653
His skills are incredible.

605
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,792
-Metz.
-Right.

606
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,932
-Black forceps.
-Okay.

607
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,758
This is Tojo University!

608
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:06,597
This is the pride of Tojo University!
Operating Surgeon Dr. Saeki!

609
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,905
Operation complete.

610
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,707
You finish up.

611
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,675
Okay.

612
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,453
Did you think I would lose so easily?

613
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,923
This is me.

614
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,962
These are the black forceps.

615
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,611
I…

616
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,980
haven't lost yet.

617
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,484
My assistant just made a mistake
operating the arms.

618
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,990
You people…

619
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,727
You're all fired!

620
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,933
Throwing people away like that…

621
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,570
You have no right to be saving people.

622
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,988
-A job well done!
-Great work!

623
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,557
Incredible!

624
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,597
Doctor, thank you very much.

625
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,133
-I didn't do anything.
-That's not true.

626
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,069
I heard my son's operation was a success.

627
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,704
I can rest easy.

628
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,007
Mr. Kobayashi.

629
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,844
You're the head of Sakura Hospital, right?

630
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,650
Finally, it all makes sense now.

631
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,751
What do you mean?

632
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,689
The reason your son
was admitted suddenly to our hospital.

633
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,894
For you to be able
to ask that of Dr. Saeki,

634
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,597
you must share a special bond.

635
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,466
To pay us back,

636
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,472
I want you to inspect Dr. Saeki's heart.

637
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,008
Dr. Saeki's heart?

638
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,111
Oh, you haven't heard?

639
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,616
Then why was he visiting your hospital?

640
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,422
There's a patient that Tojo
doesn't want anyone to know about.

641
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,427
That's why he kept visiting your hospital.

642
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,997
He was barely able to see
the patient today.

643
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,635
Who is it?

644
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,172
<i>What are their symptoms?</i>

645
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,542
How old are they?

646
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,479
What's their name?

647
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,152
-You better spit it out.
-What are you doing?

648
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,569
Tell me.

649
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,439
-Tell me!
-Dr. Tokai, what are you doing?

650
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,774
Move it.

651
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,976
Tell me.

652
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,444
Say it!

653
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,279
Dr. Saeki!

654
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,380
Dr. Saeki!

655
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,516
Dr. Saeki!

656
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,784
<i>Say it!</i>

657
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,852
Tell me!

658
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,788
Iinuma…

659
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,692
Tatsuji Iinuma…

660
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,164
Are you okay?

661
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,565
Dr. Tokai!

662
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,033
It's Dr. Saeki!

663
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:05,936
It finally happened?

664
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,677
<i>What is this? Forceps left behind?</i>

665
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,946
Even so, he'll save them no matter what.

666
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,915
<i>Don't underestimate me, Tokai.</i>

667
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,784
<i>Sometimes there are things</i>
<i>more important than life itself.</i>

668
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,220
<i>What is research to you?</i>

669
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,123
Wasn't it made to save people's lives?

670
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,425
You are the shame of Tojo University!

671
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,427
<i>Dr. Saeki can't be saved.</i>

672
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,564
<i>Please save the professor!</i>

673
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,400
<i>He's always saying crazy things</i>
<i>and making me do as he pleases.</i>

674
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,534
Move it!

675
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,702
I'll kill him.

676
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,337
