1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,972
Tell me.

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,174
-Tell me!
-Dr. Tokai…

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,609
Tell me!

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,978
Iinuma…

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,614
Tatsuji Iinuma…

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,223
Dr. Saeki!

7
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,492
Dr. Saeki!

8
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,327
<i>Dr. Tokai!</i>

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,628
It's Dr. Saeki!

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,831
It finally happened?

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,334
The professor… collapsed?

12
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,172
What's his condition?
Understood, I'm on my way!

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,573
<i>One, two, three!</i>

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,909
Dr. Saeki!

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,820
-Take him to the operating room!
-Right!

16
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,323
Hold that.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,759
-Sorry. I'm late.
-Hold it back more.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,162
-Prepare for radiography!
-Bring his chart.

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,530
-Prepare a cardiac catheter!
-Right.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,067
-Let me help.
-We don't need your help.

21
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,035
Go back to Teika where you belong!

22
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,271
-Get the aortic balloon pump!
-Okay!

23
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,840
-Move now.
-Go!

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,075
Right!

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,019
Dr. Tokai?

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>Emergency procedures on Dr. Saeki</i>
<i>have been completed</i>

27
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,664
<i>and he's currently stable.</i>

28
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,332
As for his exam results,

29
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,802
a narrowing was found
in the left coronary artery.

30
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,671
We believe the cause is

31
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,507
anomalous left coronary artery
from the pulmonary artery.

32
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,010
<i>Normally, the left coronary artery</i>
<i>should emerge from the aorta,</i>

33
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,481
<i>but in rare cases,</i>
<i>it originates from the pulmonary artery.</i>

34
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,484
<i>As a result, the heart</i>
<i>doesn't receive sufficient oxygen.</i>

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,019
<i>A serious condition</i>
<i>leading to impaired heart function.</i>

36
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,189
<i>Additionally, he's suffering</i>
<i>from mitral valve regurgitation.</i>

37
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,394
He could suffer a fatal heart attack
at any time.

38
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,598
-We must operate at once.
-I can't believe this.

39
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,700
Dr. Saeki's own mitral valve…

40
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,870
The only one at Tojo who can operate is…

41
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,811
-Where's Dr. Tokai?
-He's nowhere to be found.

42
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,946
Oh! I saw him earlier!

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,649
During Dr. Saeki's procedure,
he took off somewhere.

44
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,418
-What?
-Dr. Sera, go track him down.

45
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,353
Right.

46
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,327
I saw him, but I have no idea
where he was heading.

47
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,030
-Where could he have gone?
-I'm sorry.

48
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,299
Say it!

49
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,435
Tell me!

50
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,272
Tatsuji Iinuma…

51
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,775
-Tatsuji Iinuma.
-What?

52
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,580
The name Tatsuji Iinuma was searched.

53
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,316
Could that be…

54
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,389
Yes, it does appear that Tatsuji Iinuma
is admitted here.

55
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,356
Which room?

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,560
-I would like to hear your reason--
-Which room?

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,063
-He's on a restricted floor.
-Which room?

58
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,069
Room 421.

59
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:30,977
Ms. Kinoshita.

60
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,547
Dr. Tokai was here, wasn't he?

61
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,952
He's searching for Tatsuji Iinuma.

62
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,157
What is he planning to do?
Which way did he go?

63
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,596
Thank you.

64
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,899
Someone, call the guards!

65
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,502
-Please stop.
-You don't have permission to be here.

66
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,305
Dr. Tokai, what are you doing
at a time like this?

67
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,242
-Dr. Saeki is seriously ill!
-You save him then.

68
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,777
-Someone stop him!
-Someone, please!

69
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,913
-Just wait a second.
-Move it!

70
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,192
No one is here.

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,832
Dr. Saeki?

72
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,901
Yes?

73
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,407
-What about Mr. Iinuma?
-I released him as you ordered.

74
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,975
Dr. Saeki!

75
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,610
Dr. Saeki!

76
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,946
Release…

77
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,081
Mr. Iinuma…

78
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,584
I see.

79
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,855
I can't believe it.

80
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,292
Collapsing in my own hospital.

81
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,161
Please.

82
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,431
You have to focus on your own health now.

83
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,636
The election is around the corner…

84
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,739
They've done it now.

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,175
Wait, Dr. Tokai…

86
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,347
-Mr. Kobayashi.
-So it was you?

87
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,949
Could you please leave?

88
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,485
-Where did you send him?
-Who knows.

89
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,290
I simply released him,
on Dr. Saeki's orders.

90
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,361
Where he was transferred, I do not know.

91
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:35,568
You'll have to ask Dr. Saeki yourself.

92
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,808
Pardon me. Sorry.

93
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,447
-What is this about?
-How's the professor?

94
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,416
The emergency procedures were finished,
but he's still in danger.

95
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,652
He's fine. I'll save him.

96
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,123
And then I'll kill him myself.

97
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,528
I never thought I would have
a mitral valve problem myself.

98
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,766
I would prefer to operate on myself,
but I suppose that's not possible.

99
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,869
How would you like us to proceed?

100
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,477
-Dr. Tokai…
-Where were you?

101
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,979
I'll operate.

102
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,683
What are you talking about?

103
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,617
So…

104
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,086
Who else do you think could do it?

105
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay, I'll be leaving then.

106
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,959
I refuse.

107
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,230
But… who else can do it?

108
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,134
I hate to say it, but Dr. Tokai
is the only one with the right skills.

109
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,636
The Caesar.

110
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,172
Use the Caesar for your operation?

111
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,809
This will be a difficult procedure
requiring precise work.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,612
I believe Caesar is the best option.

113
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,647
These are…

114
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,450
my orders.

115
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,051
Yes, sir!

116
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,689
We will definitely
make the surgery a success!

117
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,998
The master of the scalpel's own surgery

118
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,567
and he chooses to have it done
with the Caesar?

119
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,105
<i>The board has caught wind</i>
<i>of Dr. Saeki's condition.</i>

120
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,641
<i>I wasn't sure what would happen,</i>

121
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,678
but this surely confirms my victory
in the board chairman election.

122
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,582
Dr. Saeki fell after covering up
your mistake, Dr. Nishizaki.

123
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,051
He was under too much pressure.

124
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,022
I've made no mistakes.

125
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:40,660
<i>Dr. Saeki just happened to barge in</i>
<i>during my procedure.</i>

126
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,628
You reap what you sow.

127
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,966
-Dr. Nishizaki!
-The age of the scalpel comes to an end.

128
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,303
Take care of yourself.

129
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,010
So the professor has put his fate
in the hands of technology.

130
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,079
A declaration of defeat, you could say.

131
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,083
Losing to a robot like this?

132
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,322
NO DATA

133
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,960
All the data is gone!

134
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,028
You're still here, Dr. Takashina?

135
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,630
There's nothing for you here.

136
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,233
Are you still trying to stand in our way?

137
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,835
Is everyone here?

138
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,373
About Dr. Saeki's Caesar operation,

139
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,343
I will lead the surgery.

140
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,446
Dr. Sekikawa and Dr. Kakitani will assist.

141
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,347
Okay.

142
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,049
I would also like to call on anyone
able to lend a hand.

143
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,051
Understood?

144
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:44,090
Dr. Saeki's life represents
the life of all patients in this hospital.

145
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,296
We must work together
and save Dr. Saeki's life!

146
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,731
-Right.
-Yes.

147
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,501
Dr. Sera. A word, please.

148
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,303
Yes?

149
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,106
We've received a complaint
from Sakura Hospital about Dr. Tokai.

150
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,575
At a time like this…

151
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,710
Keep an eye on him, will you?

152
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,947
-What?
-There's no telling what he might do.

153
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:13,553
I have no intention
of dealing with him during this operation.

154
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,554
Got it?

155
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:16,856
Yes.

156
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,726
<i>Leading up to Dr. Saeki's operation,</i>

157
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,129
<i>preparations began</i>
<i>to improve the skills of the entire team.</i>

158
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,697
The operation at hand

159
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,200
will be full of difficulty.

160
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,337
<i>Dr. Saeki requires a bypass operation</i>
<i>using the mammary artery</i>

161
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,373
<i>for the left coronary artery,</i>
<i>and mitral valve repair.</i>

162
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,609
<i>Two entirely different operations,</i>

163
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,911
<i>requiring an approach</i>
<i>from two separate locations.</i>

164
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,348
<i>But the doctor's cardiopulmonary function</i>
<i>was weak</i>

165
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,850
<i>and the time available after anesthesia</i>
<i>is just two hours.</i>

166
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,187
<i>Completing two operations in two hours</i>
<i>was thought to be impossible.</i>

167
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,157
A Caesar operation like this
has never been done.

168
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,826
And in only two hours…

169
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,763
-Shouldn't we ask Dr. Takashina?
-This is Tojo's operation.

170
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,131
We don't have room for traitors.

171
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:05,104
The only thing to do is rehearse
the operation and analyze the results.

172
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,005
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,546
You should be on that team, Dr. Takashina.

174
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,785
I've already betrayed Tojo twice.

175
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,855
That may be true,

176
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,192
but you've never betrayed a patient.

177
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,462
And on top of that,

178
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,965
you know more about the Caesar
than anyone at Tojo.

179
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,168
This simulator can be used, right?

180
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,775
The Teika team took all the data from it,
leaving nothing behind.

181
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,845
Like a game console without a game.

182
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,382
So, it can't help us after all.

183
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,820
Dr. Sera, aren't you supposed to be
watching Dr. Tokai?

184
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,689
-Yes, that's right.
-He just left.

185
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,590
What?

186
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,825
-Where?
-There.

187
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,229
Crap, that's not good. Now what do I do?

188
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,640
The Caesar.

189
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,245
You know it won't work.

190
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,718
It won't be just the election you lose,

191
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,155
but your life as well.

192
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,992
Dr. Tokai.

193
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,563
I want you to operate after all.

194
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,003
Did you think I'd come begging to you?

195
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,508
But the fact is
that you know it's the only way.

196
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,512
You don't care about saving my life.

197
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,352
You just want to know
about the patient I'm protecting.

198
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,390
Don't underestimate me, Dr. Tokai.

199
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,696
Sometimes, there are things
more important than life itself.

200
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,632
Even if I die,

201
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,437
I would never bow to a man like you.

202
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,343
My surgery will be done by the Caesar.

203
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,346
For my survival,

204
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,451
that is the only way.

205
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,154
Well then, if that's so
you can rest at ease

206
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,058
and die.

207
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,620
-Dr. Takashina…
-I have something to ask of you.

208
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,672
<i>Data?</i>

209
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,640
Yes.

210
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,812
The data saved inside the Caesar
Simulator from the trials at Tojo.

211
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,079
Would you lend it to me?

212
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,015
I won't.

213
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,920
That data is three long years
of hard labor.

214
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,123
I value it like my own life.

215
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,158
You can't just come asking for that.

216
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,229
Isn't it part
of our collaborative research?

217
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,364
Our research was concluded
with the last trial.

218
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,265
You're wrong.

219
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,471
I haven't completed my paper just yet.

220
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,680
If this is about the paper,
I already have one.

221
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,062
I had Dr. Sakaguchi write it.

222
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,531
In fact,

223
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,067
I was just on my way to submit it

224
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,302
to Mr. Ikenaga
from the <i>Japan Surgical Journal.</i>

225
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,939
In that case…

226
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,144
What was I working for all this time?

227
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,646
What was it for?

228
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,453
It was for me.

229
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:54,894
Well…

230
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,330
you'll just have to

231
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,833
work a little harder.

232
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,704
Takashina.

233
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,278
Dr. Nishizaki.

234
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,951
What does the Caesar mean to you?

235
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,592
What is research to you?

236
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,098
Wasn't it made to save people's lives?

237
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,472
Thanks for all your work.

238
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,444
-Dr. Nishizaki!
-Hey! Stop!

239
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
You!

240
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,585
You call yourself a doctor?

241
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,499
Yes.

242
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,135
I am a doctor.

243
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,340
Tojo's doctor will be leaving now.

244
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,676
Make sure he's sent off properly.

245
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,198
Excuse me.

246
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,601
I wasn't trying to butt in.

247
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,008
Dr. Takashina.

248
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,812
I…

249
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,284
I would like to ask you to operate.

250
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,055
To save Dr. Saeki's life,

251
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,824
we need your help.

252
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,897
The data from this operation
will be crucial for our case study.

253
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,768
It will also be a fine souvenir
for Teika University.

254
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,638
The chairman election win
will go to your team at Teika.

255
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,810
It pains me, but it's what we must do.

256
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,082
To save Dr. Saeki's life,

257
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,352
if we can keep him alive,

258
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,688
then so be it.

259
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,660
We must save his life. Nothing more.

260
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,832
Wasn't it made to save people's lives?

261
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,270
Please.

262
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,940
Please help us.

263
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,913
Thanks for all your work.

264
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,454
Dr. Nishizaki has thrown me under the bus.

265
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,593
I've dedicated everything
to writing my paper.

266
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,465
But now, Dr. Nishizaki
doesn't need me anymore.

267
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,301
He had someone else write it.

268
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,839
For years now,

269
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,777
I poured my heart and soul
into working for that man.

270
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,780
And as a result…

271
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,983
this is what I get.

272
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,388
I have dedicated
years of work to Dr. Saeki,

273
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,290
supporting him.

274
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,695
So I understand your feelings

275
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,832
and your deep regret.

276
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,469
Let us support him together.

277
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,371
Please!

278
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,383
Dr. Kurosaki.

279
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,256
I would be…

280
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,659
honored to help you.

281
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>With Dr. Takashina back on the team,</i>

282
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,203
<i>preparations for Dr. Saeki's</i>
<i>Caesar surgery continued onward.</i>

283
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,839
We only have one week until the operation.

284
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,207
I would like you to dig up

285
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,309
any previous files
of similar Darwin operations.

286
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,810
We'll need to think globally.

287
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,582
I'll ask acquaintances from my time
studying in New York and Paris.

288
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,586
I can speak Italian and German.
I'll see what I can find there.

289
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,620
These guys…

290
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,357
Right then. Everyone,
let's find simulation cases.

291
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,258
-Right!
-Right!

292
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,395
Listen up! Let's show the world
what Tojo University is made of!

293
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,896
-Yes!
-All right!

294
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,607
So Dr. Takashina is on the team now?

295
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,508
Yes.

296
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,212
They're ready to
"show the world what Tojo is made of."

297
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,414
Is that so?

298
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,055
-Just one thing.
-Yes?

299
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,158
I want to see them in action.

300
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,493
Could someone film it for me?

301
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,263
Certainly.

302
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,568
All right.

303
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,606
We don't need that. Get it out of here.

304
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,441
Please let us borrow your wisdom.

305
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,317
Make sure this constricted part
doesn't come off…

306
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,186
Right there.

307
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,888
Where do we approach the coronary artery?

308
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,956
That's the question…

309
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,394
We still haven't found a similar case.

310
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,965
We'll have to conduct simulations
and create a plan that way.

311
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,638
Like walking through an uncharted desert.

312
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,973
We must keep walking forward

313
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,276
believing we'll make it through.

314
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,345
<i>Without a prior example,</i>

315
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,549
<i>simulations had to be done</i>
<i>for each variation of the arm insertion.</i>

316
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,056
We're out of time.

317
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,859
This approach will make
the bypass take too long.

318
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,295
-Let's try again.
-Right.

319
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,231
<i>Only a week remained until operation day.</i>

320
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,601
<i>Still without results to show</i>
<i>after hours of trial and error,</i>

321
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,570
<i>Dr. Takashina and the others</i>
<i>were becoming anxious.</i>

322
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,111
Dr. Tokai.

323
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,383
We need your help to save Dr. Saeki.

324
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,652
Might as well just let me do it myself.

325
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,954
The doctor asked specifically
for the Caesar…

326
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,495
Dr. Tokai is the only person
we can rely on.

327
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,800
But he and Dr. Saeki
continue to grow further apart.

328
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,502
If we can find the root cause of that,

329
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,205
Dr. Tokai may agree
to help with the operation.

330
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,341
The root cause?

331
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,111
I think it has something to do
with that person named Tatsuji Iinuma.

332
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,647
The person Dr. Tokai is searching for.

333
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,883
That picture you found with the forceps

334
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,785
might have something
to do with it as well.

335
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,556
But if you get in Dr. Tokai's way,

336
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,725
you'll be crushed.

337
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,731
I don't think
we should meddle in this too much.

338
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,132
It's to save the doctor.

339
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm going to search
Dr. Tokai's room again.

340
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:01,847
<i>Dr. Tokai?</i>

341
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,917
Yes. I'm hoping to ask him
to operate the Caesar.

342
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,520
What will the professor say?

343
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,889
It's to save his life.

344
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,492
You're right.

345
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,595
I'll talk to Dr. Tokai myself.

346
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,533
I knew his father a bit, in fact.

347
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,472
I've wanted to talk to him
about this for a while.

348
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,777
Nothing. It's not here.

349
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,480
Maybe we should forget about it.

350
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,216
Dr. Tokai will be back soon anyway.

351
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,519
He just sits around here eating rice.

352
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,189
Rice?

353
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,764
Could it be…

354
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,673
I found it.

355
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,313
This is the photo I saw.

356
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,749
There really is a pair of forceps.

357
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,424
The patient's name is Tatsuji Iinuma.

358
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,296
Physician's name, Ichiro Tokai.

359
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:27,866
Hey, Dr. Tokai.

360
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,235
I would like to speak to you.

361
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,573
It's about Dr. Saeki's Caesar operation.

362
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,309
Convince the doctor to use a scalpel.

363
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,211
If we don't, he'll die.

364
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,281
Dr. Tokai…

365
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,718
Wait, Dr. Tokai.

366
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,653
Get a grip!

367
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,807
Dr. Tokai…

368
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,643
Wait, Dr. Tokai.

369
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,645
Get a grip!

370
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,749
That photograph…

371
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,754
Why do you have this?

372
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,357
Where did you get this?

373
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,758
Um…

374
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,993
Give it back.

375
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,230
It's mine.

376
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,833
What are you doing, Dr. Tokai?

377
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,501
Why do you have that?

378
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,807
A grudge, is it?

379
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,145
You're the son
of Tojo's biggest embarrassment.

380
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,816
Get out, Dr. Tokai.

381
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,720
I thought I would ask for your help,
but I was wrong. We don't need you.

382
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,356
You'll never set foot
in the operating room again.

383
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,661
You'll wait at home until the operation
is complete, understood?

384
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,562
What?

385
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,731
This is my home.

386
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,503
Get out!

387
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,666
<i>Dr. Kurosaki.</i>

388
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,805
Did you know about that photograph?

389
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,007
It's none of your business.

390
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:53,345
Dr. Tokai is searching for Tatsuji Iinuma.

391
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,048
That's why he went to Teika University

392
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,218
and why he went to Sakura Hospital
when Dr. Saeki fell ill.

393
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,520
He's looking for Iinuma?
What is this about?

394
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,256
That's supposed to be left in the past.

395
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,426
What happened?

396
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,103
When I first joined this hospital,
that man was my mentor.

397
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,940
Dr. Tokai's father.

398
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,909
The doctor is mistaken.

399
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,079
<i>Ichiro Tokai was an outstanding doctor.</i>

400
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,116
<i>But he was ambitious,</i>
<i>always aiming for the top.</i>

401
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,485
<i>He had difficulty getting along</i>
<i>with the other doctors.</i>

402
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:37,856
<i>He was put in charge of operating</i>
<i>on a patient named Tatsuji Iinuma.</i>

403
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,159
<i>A simple cardiovascular surgery.</i>

404
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,663
Dr. Tokai, about Mr. Iinuma's
post-operation care…

405
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:49,567
<i>I happened to catch a glimpse</i>
<i>of the X-ray that he was holding.</i>

406
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,070
-That's…
-None of your business.

407
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,872
<i>In the patient's chest</i>

408
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,541
<i>was a pair of forceps.</i>

409
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,978
<i>He left them inside the patient.</i>

410
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,413
<i>Clearly medical malpractice.</i>

411
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,181
How will you take responsibility for this?

412
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,517
<i>After his incriminating mistake,</i>

413
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,920
<i>Dr. Tokai was expelled from Tojo.</i>

414
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,225
<i>I've heard that the forceps</i>
<i>were removed in a secret procedure</i>

415
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,695
<i>and the story never gained traction.</i>

416
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,932
Only a handful of our staff know

417
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,902
about Tojo's tainted past.

418
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,740
After that,
Dr. Saeki felt pity for Ichiro Tokai's son

419
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,576
and invited him into his practice.

420
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,612
That's Dr. Tokai.

421
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,983
That explains why he feels the need
to follow Dr. Saeki's orders.

422
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,487
I'm sure he resents it on the inside.

423
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,689
After his revered father was expelled,

424
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,325
someone had to take his place.

425
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,427
That was Dr. Saeki.

426
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,698
Dr. Tokai can't be trusted.

427
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,768
We'll operate on Dr. Saeki without him.

428
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:58,870
Dr. Sera.

429
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,372
You'll be joining the operating team.

430
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,277
<i>We don't need Dr. Tokai's scalpel.</i>

431
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,093
You'll be crushed.

432
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,537
Nekota…

433
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,773
What were you talking
to Dr. Kurosaki about?

434
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,843
Does it have something to do

435
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,346
with Dr. Tokai being kicked out?

436
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,382
-Well…
-Was it about Ichiro Tokai?

437
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,019
Do you know about him?

438
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,195
You.

439
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,098
What did you hear?

440
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,105
Nekota.

441
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,241
What are you doing here?

442
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,111
Get back to work.

443
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,683
Understood.

444
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,992
She's being obedient today.

445
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,129
So?

446
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,799
What did you hear from Dr. Kurosaki?

447
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,442
TOJO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
INTERN DORMITORY

448
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,380
-I missed dinner.
-You scared me.

449
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,650
-Got a rice cooker?
-Dr. Tokai. Yes, I do, but…

450
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,718
<i>I see…</i>

451
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,186
You heard the whole story.

452
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,057
But going forward,

453
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,427
you must focus on your duties as a nurse.

454
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,164
You need to keep it a secret.

455
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:11,536
That goes for Nekota
and your close friend Dr. Sera too.

456
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,174
If I were to tell Dr. Saeki,

457
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,577
I could have anyone fired in an instant.

458
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,947
Do you understand?

459
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:25,617
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:39,197
Um, everyone here is asleep
so try to keep it down.

461
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,666
-I know that.
-Okay. Thanks.

462
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,836
-Hold it.
-What is it?

463
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,838
These are in my way.

464
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:48,740
Sorry.

465
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,676
I was practicing and…

466
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,048
Average guys like me
need to practice at home to keep up.

467
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,416
I bet you do.

468
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,058
I have to keep up with my studies.

469
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,296
I've been put on the Caesar team
and asked to conduct simulations.

470
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,206
I don't know if I'll be able to help.

471
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,742
There has never been a case like this.

472
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,646
<i>I still can't grasp exactly</i>
<i>what the Caesar can do and how.</i>

473
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,716
<i>The doctors</i>
<i>are having a hard time as well.</i>

474
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,084
Out of time again.

475
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,821
I hope we can find a way.

476
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,793
Go find it yourself. Go ask.

477
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,262
Ask? But where?

478
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,931
If you're looking for cases or papers,

479
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,534
go to the best source we've got.

480
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,838
About the Caesar paper submitted recently,

481
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,307
we've gotten confirmation
on its publication

482
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,509
in the next issue of the <i>Journal</i>.

483
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,045
Thank you.

484
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,414
It will be out just before the election.

485
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,416
Just in time.

486
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,720
this is all thanks to you, Mr. Ikenaga.

487
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,523
This time, I'll finally exceed
Dr. Saeki's Impact Factor.

488
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,361
I will win the chairman election.

489
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,498
Well. As for Dr. Saeki himself,

490
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,334
he's not exactly in a position
to compete anyway.

491
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,573
I hear his operation
will be quite difficult.

492
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,607
That's right.

493
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,076
We were once great rivals,

494
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,513
but I do pray for his swift recovery.

495
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,351
<i>I'll pay you back after the election.</i>

496
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,420
Until then.

497
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,100
Victory

498
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,170
is mine.

499
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,052
You call yourself a doctor?

500
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,522
Yes. I am a doctor.

501
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,261
Come in.

502
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,299
-Excuse me.
-Pardon me.

503
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,135
Sorry for the short notice.

504
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:45,149
Dr. Sera would like to speak to you
about the Caesar operation.

505
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:46,918
Yes.

506
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:48,920
I see.

507
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:53,925
You don't plan on asking me to show you
Dr. Nishizaki's Caesar research, do you?

508
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,728
The paper would indeed

509
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:01,099
give you a good hint
about Dr. Saeki's operation,

510
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,634
but I cannot provide that information.

511
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,404
A paper is a doctor's life.

512
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:08,639
I know.

513
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,710
There's no way he'll show you the paper
before it's published.

514
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,180
-So what should we do?
-Are you stupid?

515
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,748
Maybe.

516
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,317
Well, in that case,

517
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,652
maybe you should just ask him anyway.

518
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,657
"So what should we do?"

519
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,193
So what should we do?

520
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,628
What?

521
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,596
Um,

522
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,599
these are Dr. Saeki's clinical records.

523
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,936
Would you be willing to share any advice?

524
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,808
There's no way he'll give us any advice.

525
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,176
You're right.

526
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:47,912
Well then,

527
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,215
just go tell him what you want to say.

528
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,017
It's simple.

529
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,187
Make him get angry at your stupidity
and come home.

530
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,922
Advice?

531
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,625
Are you stupid or what?

532
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,528
Yes.

533
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,998
You're asking the wrong person.

534
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,401
Sorry, but I'm a very busy man.

535
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,203
Forgive us.

536
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,040
Make him get angry at your stupidity
and come home.

537
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,845
That job you're so busy with…

538
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,781
What is it exactly?

539
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,318
From my point of view,

540
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,822
all you do is give out Impact Factor
and get people promotions.

541
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,459
-That's what it looks like to me.
-Dr. Sera.

542
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,862
These papers,
they're like students' essays.

543
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,064
You give them a big thumbs up

544
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,834
and throw a big party
to pat yourselves on the back.

545
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,538
I don't see the fun in that at all.

546
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,211
I'll be leaving now.

547
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,012
Please… wait.

548
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,913
Please--

549
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,415
What is it you want?

550
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,549
Showing up like this.

551
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,352
A doctor asking for help like this,
it's absurd!

552
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,054
I'm not a doctor.

553
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,526
Even in the face of a life
that needs to be saved,

554
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,729
I'm useless.

555
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,666
I'm not a doctor at all.

556
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,871
I'll tell you about the doctors I know.

557
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,642
<i>One never shies away</i>
<i>from life-threatening decisions,</i>

558
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,878
<i>leading the way</i>
<i>and fighting to save lives every day.</i>

559
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,116
<i>Another believes in technology,</i>
<i>hoping to create</i>

560
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,185
<i>a future where more lives will be saved.</i>

561
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,088
<i>And one more.</i>

562
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,391
This man is like the devil himself,

563
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,162
<i>always saying the craziest things,</i>
<i>getting me into trouble too.</i>

564
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,532
<i>But he always saves lives, without fail.</i>

565
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,002
<i>With his own hands,</i>

566
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,805
<i>he saves the lives in front of him.</i>

567
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,610
I respect them all.

568
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,546
They are all great doctors.

569
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,251
At Tojo University,

570
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,655
<i>they're working away</i>
<i>on operation simulations.</i>

571
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,891
<i>But they are not making any progress.</i>

572
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,795
<i>Searching the globe for medical cases</i>
<i>that could give a hint</i>

573
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,697
<i>on making the operation a success.</i>

574
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,201
<i>They've all thrown away their pride</i>
<i>of using a scalpel</i>

575
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,570
<i>in order to save one man's life.</i>

576
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,141
<i>That's because Dr. Saeki's life…</i>

577
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,013
represents the lives of the thousands
of patients awaiting his care.

578
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,518
Of course I know…

579
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,387
there's nothing I can do.

580
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,589
But I won't give up.

581
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,296
I cannot give up on a life
that is right in front of me.

582
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,433
That's why I'm here.

583
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,268
I'm trying to do everything I can.

584
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,937
I want to be a doctor too.

585
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,475
So I ask you, please.

586
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,478
Won't you help us?

587
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,114
I beg of you.

588
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,784
I beg of you!

589
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,153
Please!

590
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,397
I indeed recall seeing

591
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,067
a case similar to Dr. Saeki's
where the Darwin was used.

592
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,504
A report of a similar successful surgery.

593
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,075
Still unknown to the world,

594
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,847
it's from a small research magazine
in America.

595
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,953
I have connections,
so I'll ask about it myself.

596
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,791
You will?

597
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,761
Thank you.

598
00:39:59,029 --> 00:39:59,864
No.

599
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,800
After all,

600
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,202
that's what these papers are for.

601
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,076
When I was young,
I was diagnosed with a rare sickness.

602
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,278
They said I wouldn't live long.

603
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,782
But despite the odds,
my physician at the time

604
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,586
scoured the globe for papers
and found a way to treat me.

605
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,557
Research by someone,
somewhere in the world…

606
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,926
will save people in other countries.

607
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,463
That's what papers are for.

608
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,533
As you said,

609
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,202
it's not for someone's promotion.

610
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,870
It's to save lives.

611
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,909
Making sure they're read is my job.

612
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,811
Thank you for reminding me.

613
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,083
I pray for your success.

614
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,253
Thank you.

615
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,995
This is the report
I received from Mr. Ikenaga.

616
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,199
This is indeed similar
to Dr. Saeki's case.

617
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,434
We hadn't thought of this approach.

618
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,103
Finally, the light
at the end of the tunnel.

619
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,807
All right. We'll use this
to form a new plan.

620
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,476
-Right.
-Understood.

621
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,645
<i>The new plan was different</i>
<i>from previous simulations.</i>

622
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,982
<i>Instead of two operations</i>
<i>using separate entrance routes,</i>

623
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,653
<i>they would enter through one hole</i>
<i>and do both a bypass and the mitral valve.</i>

624
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,155
<i>A completely new approach.</i>

625
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,259
<i>By operating with only one opening,</i>
<i>surgery time would shortened,</i>

626
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,261
<i>making the impossible possible.</i>

627
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,629
<i>The only way.</i>

628
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,833
Thanks to you, Dr. Tokai,
we've finally found a way to operate.

629
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,737
I didn't think
you would actually find something.

630
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,638
I did.

631
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:54,845
But we don't have time and we don't know
if this method will actually--

632
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,014
Don't think about it, just do it.

633
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,883
If you kill the doctor,

634
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,018
I'll kill you all.

635
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,224
I have to keep him alive for now.

636
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,831
So you can find out more
about that patient?

637
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,003
-Why were you trying to--
-So I can kill Dr. Saeki myself.

638
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,206
This is our plan.

639
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,275
It is theoretically possible.

640
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,412
We'll continue simulations
for further analysis.

641
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,783
If you succeed,
it will be a world-first for the Caesar.

642
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,886
That's right. I would consider
writing a paper about it.

643
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,889
Dr. Takashina,

644
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,594
what happened to the Caesar paper
you were working on?

645
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,230
Actually, Dr. Nishizaki

646
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,166
had someone else write it for him.

647
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,637
My paper no longer holds any value.

648
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,307
It's tucked away inside my computer.

649
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,645
I'm glad to hear that.

650
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,647
What?

651
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,086
<i>-Raise it, 60 degrees.</i>
<i>-Deeper…</i>

652
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,187
<i>Time out.</i>

653
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,025
-Dr. Saeki?
-Professor!

654
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,328
-Get the electrocardiogram.
-Okay!

655
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,462
Professor!

656
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,231
A heart attack?
Take him to the operating room!

657
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,399
-Hey!
-Wait!

658
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,404
Understood. I'm on my way.

659
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,240
Dr. Tokai. The professor's condition
has taken a turn for the worse.

660
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,976
They're doing an emergency surgery.

661
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,355
We will now perform
a coronary artery bypass

662
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,757
and mitral valve repair surgery
with the Caesar.

663
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,096
No matter what,
we must save Dr. Saeki's life.

664
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,263
-Right.
-Okay.

665
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,035
-All right, insert the arm.
-Right.

666
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,907
<i>Even with simulations not yet complete,</i>

667
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,378
<i>because of the heart attack,</i>
<i>operating time was shortened even further.</i>

668
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,781
<i>We only had one hour to operate.</i>

669
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,082
TIME LIMIT
59 MINUTES REMAINING

670
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,354
We've reached the internal mammary artery.

671
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,590
Proceeding with the dissection.

672
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,195
So, they're dissecting

673
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,898
the internal mammary artery
to use for the coronary bypass?

674
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,335
This is the best option for the patient.

675
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:34,605
Dissection complete.

676
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,042
That was the first hurdle.

677
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,078
Next is the hard part.

678
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,115
Let's begin the bypass.

679
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,757
Dr. Tokai, are you sure
you can go in there?

680
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,959
Dr. Tokai.

681
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,262
Confirming position
of the left coronary artery.

682
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,329
<i>Damn…</i>

683
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,665
<i>I can't see the coronary artery at all.</i>

684
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,603
We'll have to insert the Caesar.

685
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,277
Bleeding from the right ventricle.

686
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,178
-Gauze.
-Right.

687
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,814
-Dr. Sekikawa, wipe the camera lens.
-Right.

688
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,884
There isn't enough time.
They won't finish at this rate.

689
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,820
Dr. Tokai!

690
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,488
Dr. Tokai is here!

691
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,390
Is he trying to operate instead?

692
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,293
If he's trying to make an incision now,
it will take even longer.

693
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,296
-Stop him!
-Now, please!

694
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,231
Dr. Tokai.

695
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,868
They're not going to let you in there.

696
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,070
-I know that.
-What?

697
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,012
We have to stop him.
We've been ordered to keep him out.

698
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,017
Where's Dr. Tokai?

699
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,886
He's not coming.

700
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,088
So he gave up after all?

701
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,361
-Sorry, I'm late.
-Where were you?

702
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,295
Sorry.

703
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,066
Dr. Takashina, is there anything I can do?

704
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,602
-Get me one pack of transfusion.
-Right!

705
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,104
It has been 40 minutes.
Saturation is dropping.

706
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,272
Damn…

707
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,473
If we go over the hour limit,

708
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,108
his heart could stop at any time.

709
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,778
-We have to save him no matter what!
-Right.

710
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,579
-Right.
-Let's work together.

711
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,951
I can finally see
the left coronary artery.

712
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,853
Hold the heart back with gauze.

713
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,255
-Got it.
-Here.

714
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,274
We have ventricular tachycardia.

715
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,943
The heart couldn't handle the pressure.

716
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,678
Doctor, let's remove it.

717
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,246
Right.

718
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,185
I've lost sight of it again. Damn it.

719
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,321
It has been 45 minutes.
We only have 15 minutes left.

720
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,990
TIME LIMIT
14 MINUTES REMAINING

721
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,395
I can't reach it…

722
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,932
It's right there.

723
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,871
Fifteen minutes is not enough.

724
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,410
-What is it?
-Dr. Takashina.

725
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,413
If the Caesar goes in any further

726
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,749
it will only damage the heart.

727
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,958
We can't go any further than this…

728
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,528
Oh, no…

729
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,831
So the professor…

730
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,602
Dr. Saeki…

731
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,172
can't be saved.

732
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,673
What are you saying?

733
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,442
That cannot be.

734
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,545
I won't accept the professor's life
being taken away!

735
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,015
Dr. Saeki,

736
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,717
for years and years,

737
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,721
has saved hundreds and thousands of lives!

738
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,225
God!

739
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:16,894
The devil!

740
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,996
I don't care who!

741
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,465
Please!

742
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,268
Please!

743
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,071
Please save the professor!

744
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,446
-Dr. Takashina?
-We need 4-0.

745
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:10,914
Right.

746
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,750
-It moved.
-The arm moved.

747
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,721
What is going on?

748
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,290
Excuse me.

749
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,227
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

750
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,042
All right.

751
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,578
First, we stop the bleeding
in the right ventricle.

752
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,252
Remote operation.

753
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,888
Dr. Tokai gave me the orders.

754
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,725
Dr. Tokai.

755
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,328
They're not going to let you in there.

756
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,664
-I know that.
-What?

757
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,500
I'll use the other Caesar in the office.

758
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,338
Remote operation.

759
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,509
Go get permission to use the Caesar
in the operating room.

760
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:15,912
Go.

761
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,257
REMOTE OPERATION CONNECTING

762
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,160
-Sorry, I'm late.
-Where were you?

763
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,094
Sorry.

764
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,097
Dr. Takashina, is there anything I can do?

765
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:34,998
REMOTE OPERATION REQUESTED

766
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,167
-Get me one back of transfusion.
-Right!

767
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,037
It has been 40 minutes.
Saturation is dropping.

768
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,173
REMOTE OPERATION ACCESS GRANTED

769
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,581
I'm sorry I didn't have time to explain.

770
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:56,119
We thought the simulator was of no use.

771
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,122
Using it like this is…

772
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,329
Your plan wasn't bad.

773
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,398
It was actually quite good.

774
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,637
This approach could indeed work.

775
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:14,538
<i>But…</i>

776
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,075
You aren't able to see
the coronary artery.

777
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:21,278
The Caesar cannot be inserted any further
in this condition.

778
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:25,415
If you can't get in deeper,
we'll have to pull the heart out.

779
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,418
Pull it out? How?

780
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,388
-With a suction cup.
-A suction cup?

781
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,092
We'll use a suction cup
and pull the heart out.

782
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,961
You can't just…

783
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:42,232
Right ventricle suture complete.
You're up.

784
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:46,002
-Right ventricle suture complete.
-Fifty minutes elapsed. We have no time!

785
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,604
TIME LIMIT
9 MINUTES REMAINING

786
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,638
Dr. Takashina.

787
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,176
-What is it, Dr. Takashina?
-Dr. Takashina.

788
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,512
-Dr. Takashina, the next steps, hurry!
-I know.

789
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,354
We'll now proceed with
the left coronary artery bypass surgery.

790
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:10,193
-Bring a suction cup.
-Suction cup? That wasn't in the plan.

791
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,728
I've got one ready.

792
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,571
All right. Here we go.

793
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,207
-We'll do anything we can!
-Right!

794
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:29,412
Here.

795
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,591
The heart is coming toward the Caesar.

796
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,960
The heart won't stabilize like that.

797
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,763
There's no arm to hold it like the Darwin.

798
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,801
-I'll suture with one hand.
-With one hand?

799
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,741
The left arm will hold the heart
and the right will suture.

800
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,276
Got it.

801
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,112
Almost at one hour.

802
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,014
Come on… let's make it work!

803
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,415
TIME LIMIT
4 MINUTES REMAINING

804
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,722
He's using his right hand only.

805
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,825
Amazing. I've never seen it done.

806
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,400
Hurry up with the thread. Stay focused!

807
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,872
Hurry up with the thread. Stay focused.

808
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,740
Got it.

809
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,242
-Suction!
-Suction!

810
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,176
Sorry.

811
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,578
-Blower next.
-Blower next.

812
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,446
-Hurry up.
-Let's pick up the pace.

813
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,681
-Right!
-Okay!

814
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:39,983
-Arai.
-Yes?

815
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,651
Get the blood flow pumps.

816
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,919
What?

817
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,654
Okay.

818
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,626
-Amazing.
-The arm is moving so much faster.

819
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,027
We might actually make it.

820
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,868
Bypass complete.

821
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,870
Bypass complete.

822
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,341
We did it in an hour.

823
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,642
<i>We made it.</i>

824
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,448
But the mitral valve surgery
still needs to be done.

825
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,953
-We've made it this far.
-Damn.

826
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,823
<i>Use the heart-lung machine.</i>

827
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,024
What?

828
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,561
We'll do it on-pump beating heart style.

829
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,298
The Saeki Method with the Caesar?

830
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,667
Is that possible?

831
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,935
Who knows?

832
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,272
But we have to try.

833
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,543
Dr. Takashina!

834
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,350
Understood.

835
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,556
We'll now use the Caesar

836
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,393
to perform on-pump beating heart
mitral valve repair surgery.

837
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,729
-What?
-The Saeki Method with the Caesar?

838
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,867
Those were the orders.
Turn on the heart-lung machine.

839
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,136
-Right.
-Blood flow pumps!

840
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:07,971
Here they are.

841
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,473
Here.

842
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,108
-Hurry.
-Right.

843
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,645
All right. Next…

844
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,647
We will begin mitral valve repair.

845
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,782
-Right.
-Okay.

846
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,196
<i>His skills are godlike.</i>

847
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,864
It's like watching Dr. Saeki operate.

848
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,341
Doctor.

849
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,142
It's all right.

850
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,814
You're doing great, Dr. Takashina.

851
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,285
Thank you.

852
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,307
Dr. Takashina.

853
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,045
Using my real hands
is a hundred times easier.

854
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:30,887
Complete.

855
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,459
What's his condition?

856
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,395
Blood pressure…

857
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,532
Stabilized.

858
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,367
All right!

859
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,640
All right!

860
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,644
-We did it!
-We did it!

861
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,908
It was written here the whole time.

862
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:31,347
Dr. Tokai is really an incredible person.

863
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,615
He is.

864
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,855
Professor.

865
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,797
So I'm still alive.

866
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,501
-We're glad you're here.
-If I'm still alive,

867
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,170
then there's more work

868
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,174
to be done.

869
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,386
NEW MESSAGE

870
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,264
<i>After that, the new issue of the </i>Japan
Surgical Journal<i> was published.</i>

871
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,780
Congratulations, Dr. Nishizaki.

872
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,150
Thank you. You've done well too.

873
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:23,760
What the hell is this?

874
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,143
Saeki…

875
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,548
It's a Caesar paper
written independently by Tojo University.

876
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,318
Apart from the paper itself,

877
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,120
the video attached was great.

878
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,592
<i>The Saeki Method executed</i>
<i>through remote operation of the Caesar.</i>

879
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,626
MEDICAL ROBOT CAESAR PAPER

880
00:59:56,693 --> 01:00:00,863
<i>A top-notch surgery made possible</i>
<i>by a top-notch surgeon</i>

881
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,232
<i>using top-notch technology.</i>

882
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,002
I won't stand for this!

883
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,670
It's against the rules
of collaborative research!

884
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:12,375
I've decided that the paper from Tojo
will better benefit future patients.

885
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,811
Thank you for your time.

886
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,447
What… Hello?

887
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,493
Takashina…

888
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,566
<i>JAPAN SURGICAL JOURNAL</i>

889
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,435
This is pretty good work.

890
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,641
You put your life on the line
for this paper.

891
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,011
It's all thanks to your cooperation.

892
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,913
Was Dr. Tokai's use of the Caesar

893
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:52,882
part of your plan as well?

894
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:59,656
Dr. Tokai won't let me die just yet.

895
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:03,660
Forgive me,

896
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,496
but if you'll excuse us…

897
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,717
Thanks to you, I live to see another day.

898
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:33,890
I take it you've come here to kill me now.

899
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,326
Where is Tatsuji Iinuma?

900
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,831
I cannot tell you that.

901
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,334
There's something…

902
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,137
I still have to do.

903
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,375
You must be careful not to leak
information about the patient.

904
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,010
Okay.

905
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:54,977
All right.

906
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,313
Please take care of him.

907
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,753
This sure brings me back.

908
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:09,225
You know, a long time ago…

909
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,762
I was once admitted here at Tojo.

910
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,531
Is that so?

911
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,308
TATSUJI IINUMA

912
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,682
I told you, didn't I?

913
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,819
There's only one man in this world

914
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,157
who can use the black forceps.

915
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:48,698
I'm not ready to hand them over
to you just yet.

916
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,500
Then I'll just have to take them myself.

917
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,572
By the way…

918
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,027
FINAL EPISODE

919
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,929
<i>My father lost everything</i>
<i>to these forceps,</i>

920
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,931
<i>and now, it's your turn!</i>

921
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,566
<i>So we finally meet.</i>

922
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,902
-The patient comes first.
-You're a patient too!

923
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,069
<i>The forceps…</i>

924
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,772
<i>It's almost time.</i>
<i>This is where it will all end.</i>

925
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:30,873
<i>Stop, Dr. Tokai!</i>

926
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,876
<i>You've opened up the gates of hell.</i>
