1
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,773
Where is Tatsuji Iinuma?

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,909
I cannot tell you that.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>You must be careful not to leak</i>
<i>information about the patient.</i>

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,383
By the way…

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,986
Your heart…

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,457
still hasn't been entirely cured.

7
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,832
The Caesar operation
was a temporary emergency treatment.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,535
If you have a heart attack,

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,471
you'll only have a couple of hours left.

10
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,742
I recommend a second surgery
as soon as possible.

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,511
But of course,

12
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,248
I'm the only one who can do it.

13
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,053
So I will ask you once again.

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,792
Where is Tatsuji Iinuma now?

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,228
Threatening your patients now, are you?

16
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,465
That's unbecoming of a doctor.

17
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,734
I saved your life.

18
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,204
I'm free to use it as I please.

19
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,676
I cannot tell you.

20
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,682
I have no intention
of undergoing surgery right now.

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,418
The election is in three days.

22
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,590
Will you last that long?

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,258
Well,

24
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,161
since you are my attending physician

25
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,530
maybe I'll have you come with me.

26
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,433
The election will be held in Tokyo.

27
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,002
If something were to happen to me there,

28
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,473
no one will ever know where Mr. Iinuma is.

29
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,479
It would be wise for you
to keep an eye on me.

30
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,983
Are you giving up on your search?

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,820
For Tatsuji Iinuma?

32
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,791
I have a fairly good idea
of where to find him.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,696
In that case, I'll be leaving it to you.

34
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:10,597
Goodbye.

35
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,702
Even if that patient
was a victim of medical malpractice?

36
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,506
Medical malpractice…

37
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,176
is unforgivable.

38
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,210
I agree.

39
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,513
Well,

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
shall I fill you in then?

41
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,653
An aortic dissection?

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,323
Dr. Tokai really did it this time.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,261
Will Mr. Iinuma be okay like this?

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,666
The only person
who can operate on that patient…

45
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,635
is me.

46
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,239
Take care of things
while I'm away, will you?

47
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,474
Understood.

48
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,047
I'm currently laying the groundwork
with the board members,

49
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,984
but as of now,
the votes appear to be evenly matched.

50
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,819
It can't be!

51
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,887
Normally,

52
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,790
I was supposed to win by a landslide!

53
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,825
<i>I've decided that the paper from Tojo</i>

54
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,029
will better benefit future patients.

55
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,935
Both Ikenaga and Takashina…

56
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,170
stabbing me in the back…

57
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,639
at the final moment!

58
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,845
As planned,
this weekend Dr. Saeki will be attending

59
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,348
the Surgical Society
board meeting in Tokyo.

60
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,785
Is that a good idea?
We hear his condition is still critical.

61
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,154
Dr. Tokai has decided to go with him.

62
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,392
While Dr. Saeki is gone,
the one taking responsibility is…

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,094
Dr. Takashina.

64
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,863
He's asking you to do it.

65
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,499
Me?

66
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,335
Dr. Saeki's orders.

67
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,339
So Dr. Takashina
has finally earned the professor's trust?

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,408
Frustrating as it is,
he deserves the credit.

69
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,877
Let's all give our support
to the professor.

70
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,680
We're counting on you.

71
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,317
Understood.

72
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,596
Dr. Tokai.

73
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,935
Just as you thought you were abandoned
by Dr. Nishizaki,

74
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,038
you find yourself
as Seigo Saeki's right-hand man.

75
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,308
One man's trash

76
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,145
is another man's treasure.

77
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,283
What you told me before…

78
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,319
would you please explain what you meant?

79
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,221
Seigo Saeki.

80
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,856
Don't believe him.

81
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,758
That man…

82
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,794
betrayed my father.

83
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,362
That guy…

84
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,831
is a god of death.

85
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,806
Pardon me.

86
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,908
I've brought your meal…

87
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,015
Excuse me.

88
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,655
Dr. Tokai, it's about
your business trip schedule…

89
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,238
I found it.
There really is a pair of forceps.

90
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,474
The patient's name is Tatsuji Iinuma.

91
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,178
Physician's name, Ichiro Tokai.

92
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,313
What happened?

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,048
<i>He left them inside the patient.</i>

94
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,717
<i>Clearly medical malpractice.</i>

95
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,786
<i>After his incriminating mistake,</i>

96
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,156
<i>Dr. Tokai was expelled from Tojo.</i>

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,395
TO: SEISHIRO TOKAI
CONTENTS: RICE

98
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,437
Hanabusa.

99
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:13,940
Dr. Sera.

100
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,479
It's about the forceps. I think
it was more than just malpractice--

101
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,180
Shouldn't we leave this alone?

102
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,225
SENDER: HARUE TOKAI

103
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,280
Mr. Iinuma! Where were you?

104
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,216
Just to the shop downstairs.

105
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,285
If you need something,
you can just tell me.

106
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,421
That's why I'm here.

107
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,157
Having things
taken care of for me is nice,

108
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,559
but it feels like I'm being held captive.

109
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,894
That's not true.

110
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,897
You need to take it easy.

111
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,700
Take it easy? So when is my surgery?

112
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,337
At Sakura Hospital,
they told me it was urgent.

113
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,206
Surgery?

114
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,212
Mr. Iinuma!

115
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,146
Mr. Iinuma!

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,385
<i>You must be careful not to leak</i>
<i>information about the patient.</i>

117
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,592
-Mr. Iinuma's condition has worsened.
-He needs hemostatic agent.

118
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,628
-Get the hemostatic agent. I'm on my way.
-Right!

119
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
-Hey!
-Oh, pardon me.

120
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,205
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

121
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,246
The executive suite there?

122
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,482
There's no patient in there.

123
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,417
I'll operate.

124
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

125
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,388
-The patient comes first.
-You're a patient too!

126
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,924
You won't be able to attend the election.

127
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,099
I'm looking for hemostatic agent.

128
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,602
It's not here. You'll need to get it
from the storage room.

129
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,503
Thanks.

130
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,405
Was there someone using hemostatic agent?

131
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,741
I haven't received any reports.

132
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,846
-Nurse!
-Have you told anyone?

133
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,914
I haven't said a word.

134
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,192
I administered first aid.

135
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,994
His condition has stabilized,

136
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,129
but there may be intrathoracic bleeding.

137
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,632
He'll need surgery right away.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,968
Show me the patient's data.

139
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,336
I cannot do that.

140
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,942
This is a special patient.
His information must remain private.

141
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,477
Private?

142
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,812
That is the professor's order.

143
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,251
Sorry to show up out of the blue.

144
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,054
-You're still young, so eat up.
-Thank you.

145
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,758
Japanese bodies
are made from rice, you know.

146
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,393
That's right.

147
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,395
Yes.

148
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,200
So, Dr. Tokai's father…

149
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,371
-What kind of doctor was he?
-What kind?

150
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,206
Just a normal doctor.

151
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,010
Putting his heart and soul
into the care of each patient,

152
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,546
spending days upon days away from home.

153
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,682
-I see…
-Oh.

154
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,550
Want to see his photo album?

155
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,219
-It's in my son's room.
-Sure.

156
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,324
-Go ahead.
-Thank you, pardon me.

157
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,898
<i>All these surgical ties…</i>

158
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,533
Amazing.

159
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,802
Wow.

160
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,004
This is simply amazing.

161
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,742
My son…

162
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,046
He used to work at a city hospital.

163
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:14,947
He did?

164
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,918
After his father died, all of a sudden

165
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,587
he said he wanted to transfer to Tojo.

166
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,522
He started working hard.

167
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:28,494
He's lucky that Dr. Saeki
took a liking to him.

168
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,165
He did all this
to become a doctor at Tojo?

169
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,009
SCHEDULED FOR RECONSTRUCTION

170
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,477
<i>Seishiro.</i>

171
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,912
<i>What kind of doctor do you want to be?</i>

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,382
A regular doctor is fine.

173
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,020
No matter the age, people stay the same.

174
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,688
A doctor is a doctor.

175
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,027
Just be yourself. Become a regular doctor.

176
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,163
Cut it out.

177
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,012
I'll send him to hell.

178
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,315
About the executive suite,

179
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,653
Nurse Fujiwara appears to be watching
the patient around the clock.

180
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,625
Even if you know Mr. Iinuma's whereabouts,
it's hard to tell what will happen.

181
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,294
I'm not worried about that.

182
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,663
I've already decided.

183
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,471
I have one chance.

184
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,940
It all ends there.

185
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,579
<i>Tomorrow is finally election day.</i>

186
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,083
Here's to Dr. Saeki's victory.

187
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,784
Cheers!

188
00:11:58,851 --> 00:11:59,852
Cheers!

189
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,297
-Dr. Sera.
-Yes?

190
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,035
Excuse me.

191
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,209
-Pardon me.
-Keep an eye on Dr. Tokai.

192
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,280
Don't leave his side
until we return to Tojo.

193
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,416
Don't let him leave your sight.

194
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,754
These are my orders.

195
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,123
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,228
-Thanks.
-Pardon me.

197
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,901
It's a waste of time.

198
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,406
The editor-in-chief of the <i>Japan</i>
<i>Surgical Journal</i>, Mr. Ikenaga,

199
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,609
will soon be here to greet you.

200
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,411
-I'll wait in my room.
-Okay.

201
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,561
-Professor!
-Doctor!

202
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,829
Professor!

203
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,831
Pericardial fluid is
leaking into his chest.

204
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,133
We can't perform a thoracentesis
in a place like this.

205
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,501
-What should we do?
-We'll do it here.

206
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,103
What? Here?

207
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,913
-Roll his shirt up.
-Right.

208
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,285
Towel.

209
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,521
Bring more towels.

210
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,662
-Get ready to carry him out.
-Right.

211
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,630
-Get a stretcher.
-Okay.

212
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,468
I'll let you live a bit longer.

213
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,008
Your own hell is still waiting.

214
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,086
Professor Saeki.

215
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,761
Mr. Ikenaga is worried about you.

216
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,797
We asked him to leave, but…

217
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,101
-It's fine. Let him come in.
-Right.

218
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,904
-Let him in.
-Okay.

219
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,975
Where's Tokai?

220
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,345
Resting in his room with Sera.

221
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,480
I see.

222
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,583
Dr. Saeki…

223
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,019
How are you feeling?

224
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm fine.

225
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,901
I guess I'll stay here.

226
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,120
ELECTION DAY

227
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,490
It's time for the handover.
I'll step out for a bit.

228
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,159
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

229
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,369
-What's wrong?
-I'm going for a walk.

230
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,306
I want something to drink.

231
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,042
You need to rest.

232
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,710
Can't I just go out?

233
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,078
If you need something, I'll get it.

234
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,214
Fine.

235
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,885
A drink, right? I'll be right back.

236
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,096
You're fast.

237
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,400
Who are you?

238
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,309
Oh, no.

239
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,845
Dr. Tokai, it's almost time to…

240
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,117
So we finally meet.

241
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,326
What do you mean by "forceps"?

242
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,161
A surgical tool.

243
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,798
Please wait.

244
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,169
That tool is inside your body.

245
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,172
What? There's no way.

246
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,908
If we take an X-ray, you'll see.

247
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,243
Let's go.

248
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,411
That's enough.

249
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,547
Get out. My physician is Dr. Saeki.

250
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,751
I won't trust anyone else
besides Dr. Saeki.

251
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,720
He's the reason I've stayed healthy
all these years.

252
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,857
All these years?

253
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,129
You had a heart operation here at Tojo
some years ago, right?

254
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,433
The operating surgeon was Dr. Saeki.

255
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,168
Am I wrong?

256
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,437
Why do you care?

257
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,075
So you admit it.

258
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,180
-I'll be using that as your testimony.
-My testimony?

259
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,983
To expose the crimes of Dr. Seigo Saeki.

260
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,851
And what crime would that…

261
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,723
PULSE

262
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,894
-Mr. Iinuma!
-Give him oxygen.

263
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,395
-Okay.
-You, bring the X-ray machine.

264
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,430
Okay.

265
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,298
Mr. Iinuma, can you hear me?

266
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,102
Hello, this is Fujiwara.

267
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,672
I can't find Dr. Tokai.
He must be on his way there.

268
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,773
I'll look now.

269
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,410
Did Dr. Tokai go back to Tojo?

270
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,549
Call Dr. Kurosaki.
I need to ask him for a favor.

271
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,450
Okay.

272
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,740
Dr. Tokai.

273
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,310
What are you doing?

274
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,413
Inside this patient's chest
is a pair of forceps.

275
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,148
Forceps?

276
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,417
What are you talking about?

277
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,019
The doctor has entrusted me
with the hospital while he's out.

278
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,554
Don't do as you please.

279
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,597
It's Nurse Fujiwara.
I'll have to report this.

280
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,138
-Yes?
-Where are you, Dr. Takashina?

281
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,941
I would like you
to check on the executive suite.

282
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,878
That's where I am right now.

283
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,713
<i>Did something happen?</i>

284
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,984
Trust me.

285
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,956
Believe me.

286
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,194
What is it? Did something happen?

287
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:37,910
It's…

288
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,782
The patient wanted something to drink.

289
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,351
May I give him some vegetable juice?

290
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,588
Yes, of course.

291
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,756
Go ahead.

292
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,502
You need to tell me exactly what happened.

293
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,904
I'll show you.

294
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,024
There's no way…

295
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,829
There's really a pair of forceps…

296
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,200
My father was wrongfully accused
of medical malpractice.

297
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,638
This was all the work of Dr. Saeki.

298
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,648
You'll need to receive a testimony
from the patient himself.

299
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,118
The reason you've stayed at Tojo

300
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,787
and continued to follow Dr. Saeki's orders

301
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,724
was because of this?

302
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,294
That's why I have to keep
this patient alive.

303
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,631
I need to get my hands
on the root of all this.

304
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:07,966
The forceps.

305
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,534
However…

306
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,037
without Dr. Saeki's permission--

307
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,205
When it's necessary…

308
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,544
…the rules can be changed.

309
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,446
Today,

310
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,284
I will end it all.

311
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,410
Professor Nishizaki and Professor Saeki.

312
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,845
Which of these men
will take the position of chairman?

313
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,282
It will be decided by the board members
after the presentation

314
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,319
of their respective research topics.

315
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,389
I'm greatly looking forward
to the results.

316
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,999
Professor. About your orders.

317
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,801
It has been taken care of.

318
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,840
-Miwa, bring the thoracotomy device.
-Right.

319
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,543
Prepare for intubation
after finishing the A-line.

320
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,249
What going on?

321
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,422
What are you doing here? Get out.

322
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,860
-I'll call the others.
-Go ahead.

323
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,662
But if you do,

324
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,898
everyone will find out about the forceps
Dr. Saeki left in the patient.

325
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,369
I won't let you get in the way.

326
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,778
Preparations complete.

327
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,981
Okay, Miwa. Time for you to leave.

328
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,117
What? Why?

329
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,318
We don't need you.

330
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,354
You're in the way.

331
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,858
You must understand.

332
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,794
We're operating on Dr. Saeki's patient.

333
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,097
You're an intelligent and skilled nurse.

334
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,633
Think about your future.

335
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,076
Get out, now!

336
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,994
-We'll take out the forceps.
-Right.

337
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,328
-Scalpel.
-Here.

338
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,667
We'll now move on
to the research presentations.

339
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,771
First, we'll hear from Teika University's
surgeon, Dr. Keisuke Nishizaki.

340
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,106
Thank you.

341
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,324
We'll start with the dissection
around the adhesion area.

342
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,392
-Electroscalpel.
-Here.

343
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,436
After receiving high praise
for my research on the Caesar,

344
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,507
I'm nearing my goal
of making it widely available in Japan.

345
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,610
Without having to call upon
the aid of foreign countries,

346
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,013
I believe it is time for Japan
to act independently

347
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,950
and pour our strength and resources
into advanced medical research.

348
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:51,389
For the experts who pride themselves
on their personal skill,

349
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:55,293
this may be a slightly unpleasant reality.

350
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,829
Here. Dissection complete.

351
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,197
-Metz, please.
-Here.

352
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,833
This is taking a lot of time.

353
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,972
I see it.

354
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,174
I can see it.

355
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,879
As for especially skilled surgeons,

356
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,849
just how many are there in Japan?

357
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,419
And in that one doctor's lifetime,

358
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,390
just how many patients can they save?

359
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,264
We finally meet.

360
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,802
I can't believe it.
There are forceps in his heart.

361
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,640
Taking them out.

362
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,885
-He's bleeding. Blood pressure dropping.
-I can't locate the source.

363
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,887
-Get the Satinsky clamp.
-We have no free hands.

364
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,355
-I'll go.
-I'll stop the bleeding.

365
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,657
-Hurry.
-Understood.

366
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,598
Sorry, I'm late.
I have the Satinsky clamp.

367
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,769
Here you are.

368
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,142
This is my patient.
He was entrusted to my care.

369
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,179
Nekota, support Dr. Tokai.

370
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,148
I'll get whatever you need.

371
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,987
He's losing more blood.

372
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,789
-Stitching, 3-0 please.
-Right.

373
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,690
-Two felt pieces.
-Right.

374
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,658
To save even more lives,

375
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,361
we need to popularize
the latest medical technology

376
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,897
and no longer rely on the skills
of a medical surgeon alone.

377
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,067
Realizing accessible medical care for all

378
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,171
is a necessity above all else.

379
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,053
We will now take
a short 15-minute intermission.

380
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,625
Dr. Saeki's presentation is next.

381
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,027
What should we do?

382
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,098
-Using the Metz next.
-Okay.

383
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,300
-Metz.
-Here.

384
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,904
The bleeding has stopped for now.

385
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,873
I have to get them out.

386
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,542
I'll get the forceps out.

387
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,911
The adhesion is terrible.

388
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,413
That's because it's vintage.

389
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,282
I hope the patient can hold out.

390
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,653
If we can get the forceps out,
he'll be saved.

391
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:39,090
After that, I'll have him
confess everything he knows.

392
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,960
It's almost time.

393
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,362
This is where it will all end.

394
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,365
No. We have to stop them.

395
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,969
-I won't let you go.
-Get out of my way.

396
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,443
Stop!

397
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,755
Don't take them out.

398
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,957
Dr. Saeki? Dr. Sera.

399
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,394
Dr. Saeki…

400
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,563
How did he get here…

401
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,568
I took a medical helicopter.

402
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,071
Dr. Kurosaki prepared it for me.

403
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,441
Well…

404
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,677
in place of Dr. Saeki…

405
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,713
I, Kurosaki,

406
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,550
will be presenting his research.

407
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,453
-What happened to Dr. Saeki?
-What could it be?

408
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,922
At the renowned Tojo University…

409
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,858
So he bailed at the last second, did he?

410
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,928
You threw away the election to come here?

411
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,098
Are you that afraid of your past?

412
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,266
I'm here to save the patient.

413
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,269
Dr. Tokai. Don't touch those forceps.

414
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,805
All you want to save is your prestige.

415
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,607
-I'm telling you not to…
-Shut up!

416
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,210
I'm almost finished.

417
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,947
We're almost done, Dad.

418
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,048
Watch me, Saeki!

419
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,586
With this pair of forceps,
I finally have undeniable proof

420
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,921
of your crimes.

421
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,423
Stop, Dr. Tokai!

422
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,125
This is the end for you.

423
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,693
Apologize.

424
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,262
Apologize to me first.

425
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,165
And then apologize to my father.

426
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,401
My father lost everything
to these forceps,

427
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,737
and now, it's your turn!

428
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,982
Don't!

429
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,303
Goodbye,

430
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,107
Dr. Seigo Saeki.

431
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,220
Dr. Tokai.

432
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,556
-Blood pressure, 50!
-3-0. 3-0.

433
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,524
-Stop the blood!
-Apply pressure. 3-0!

434
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,126
-We need gauze.
-Right.

435
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,360
-As much as you can.
-Okay.

436
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,762
-Saturation dropping.
-Miwa, gauze!

437
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,164
-Dr. Tokai…
-We have VF!

438
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,165
Damn.

439
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,000
No matter how much we suture,
it won't stop.

440
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,969
Not even Dr. Tokai can stop it?

441
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,537
-3-0!
-Here.

442
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,074
You've opened up the gates of hell.

443
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,578
Dr. Saeki.

444
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,248
Move it.

445
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,116
Tokai.

446
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,021
I will deal with it.

447
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,874
By forcing the forceps out,
you've injured the aortic arch.

448
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,943
-I'll take over.
-First, we stitch the aortic arch.

449
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,511
-Run the heart-lung machine.
-Right.

450
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,146
-Cool down to 25 degrees Celsius.
-Right.

451
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,381
-Cooper.
-Okay.

452
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,956
What do you plan on doing?

453
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,926
Dr. Tokai, listen.

454
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,728
If I couldn't fix it,

455
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,030
there's no way you'll be able to.

456
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,164
Just listen to me.

457
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,769
This wasn't forgotten
because of negligence.

458
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,439
<i>On that day,</i>
<i>there was a large-scale bus accident.</i>

459
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,575
<i>A number of patients were brought in.</i>

460
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,846
<i>At that time, I realized</i>
<i>that one of our patients, Mr. Iinuma,</i>

461
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,482
<i>had taken a turn for the worse,</i>
<i>so I went to care for him.</i>

462
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:03,121
<i>But the operation rooms were full,</i>
<i>leaving no extra staff to help.</i>

463
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,858
<i>Not knowing how to possibly</i>
<i>stop the bleeding,</i>

464
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,826
<i>I was left with no option</i>

465
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,829
<i>and left the forceps inside his body.</i>

466
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,866
<i>That was the only way.</i>

467
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,135
<i>Soon after,</i>

468
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,738
I was sent on a long-term
medical assistance job in Africa.

469
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,809
But the unexpected happened.

470
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,845
<i>Mr. Iinuma, who was supposed</i>
<i>to have been discharged,</i>

471
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,281
<i>was brought in again in an emergency</i>
<i>while I was away.</i>

472
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,886
<i>The doctor put in charge was Dr. Ichiro.</i>

473
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,490
<i>When he looked inside Mr. Iinuma's chest,</i>

474
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,225
<i>how surprised he must have been.</i>

475
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,830
-Prepare for puncture immediately.
-Right.

476
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:46,998
There's a call for you--

477
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:51,302
<i>I heard the news,</i>
<i>but I had no phone line or time to spare.</i>

478
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,138
<i>I sent a telegram to Dr. Ichiro.</i>

479
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,440
<i>DO NOT TAKE MR. IINUMA'S FORCEPS</i>

480
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,377
<i>Dr. Ichiro realized that those forceps</i>
<i>were necessary for the procedure.</i>

481
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,045
Administer Revolade and close him up.

482
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,880
<i>Leaving the forceps inside the patient,</i>

483
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,484
<i>Mr. Iinuma's procedure</i>
<i>and operation were completed.</i>

484
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,222
<i>But after surgery, when your father</i>
<i>was checking the X-rays,</i>

485
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,858
<i>Dr. Kurosaki walked in on him and saw it.</i>

486
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,828
<i>It was declared medical malpractice,</i>

487
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,397
<i>and Dr. Ichiro received harsh criticism.</i>

488
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,299
<i>You're a disgrace to Tojo University!</i>

489
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,002
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>Dr. Ichiro made no further objections,</i>

490
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,471
<i>accepted that it was his own mistake,</i>

491
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,272
<i>and left Tojo University.</i>

492
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,110
<i>The professor told me</i>
<i>only after I returned to Japan.</i>

493
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:33,978
<i>But it was too late.</i>

494
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,215
<i>Dr. Ichiro was stricken with illness</i>
<i>and he passed away.</i>

495
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,116
HE PASSED THE OTHER DAY

496
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,151
<i>After that,</i>

497
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,888
<i>I received a letter from Dr. Ichiro.</i>

498
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,862
<i>To my sworn friend, Seigo Saeki.</i>

499
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,464
<i>You don't need to say anything.</i>

500
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,801
<i>A doctor needs only</i>
<i>to think of their patients.</i>

501
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,503
<i>Save lives.</i>

502
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,638
<i>Save Mr. Iinuma.</i>

503
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,075
<i>I entrust everything to you.</i>

504
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,746
<i>Knowing he didn't have much time left,</i>

505
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,748
<i>Dr. Ichiro protected me.</i>

506
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,019
<i>And bearing the disgrace</i>
<i>of medical malpractice as his own,</i>

507
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,955
<i>he left this world.</i>

508
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,229
This is the truth.

509
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,599
For me,

510
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,002
it was your father.

511
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,640
Dr. Ichiro Tokai is the one
who spared my life.

512
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,344
"It was all my responsibility."

513
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,383
If only you had said that,

514
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,422
my father wouldn't have died like that.

515
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,694
Why did you stay quiet?

516
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,163
If saying something would have saved
Mr. Iinuma, I would have.

517
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,901
I would have happily been fired.

518
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,840
But without me,
who could treat this patient?

519
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,977
If the forceps were to be removed,
the patient would die.

520
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,448
Dr. Tokai, not even you could save him.

521
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,620
A doctor who overestimates his own skill

522
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,457
could never save this patient.

523
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,528
That's why I couldn't tell anyone.

524
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,764
Hate me if you must.

525
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,334
Kill me if you want to.

526
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,437
But I will save this patient

527
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,206
even if I die.

528
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,680
These black forceps.

529
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,482
That is what they're for.

530
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,919
They serve as a reminder to me as well.

531
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,156
No doctor, even myself,

532
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,024
is perfect.

533
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,094
This cannot be forgotten.

534
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,230
Without arrogance,

535
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,934
continuously hone your skills,

536
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,638
keep questioning what medical care
is really all about.

537
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,007
A testament to one's resolve.

538
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,845
These black forceps…

539
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,950
only need to be used by me.

540
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,020
When the time comes to use them,

541
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,255
that will be the time…

542
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,327
that I resign from being a surgeon.

543
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,534
This…

544
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,071
is what I've lived for.

545
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,141
And now,

546
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:51,776
my work…

547
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,545
is done.

548
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,452
Hand me the black forceps.

549
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,887
Right.

550
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:26,544
Goodbye,

551
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,014
Dr. Ichiro Tokai.

552
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,554
Suction.

553
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,257
Right.

554
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,594
Blood pressure, 80. Stabilized.

555
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,664
It stopped…

556
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,337
We'll close him up.

557
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:01,846
Tokai.

558
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,360
Doctors are not perfect.

559
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:19,997
There is still much more

560
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,100
for all of us to learn.

561
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,484
-Hurry, close him up.
-But…

562
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,354
The black forceps
are made of a special carbon.

563
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,556
They won't appear in X-rays.

564
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,591
They will turn to ash when he's cremated.

565
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,594
Close him up now.

566
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,233
Those are my orders.

567
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,536
Right.

568
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,539
-5-0, please.
-Okay.

569
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,740
Nurse, support me, please.

570
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:03,974
Okay, understood.

571
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,213
The black forceps' duties
have been fulfilled.

572
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,084
And so have mine.

573
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,020
From now on…

574
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,996
-Dr. Saeki!
-Professor Saeki!

575
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,599
-Take him to Operating Room 2!
-Dr. Saeki!

576
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,500
Professor!

577
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,970
One, two, three.

578
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,107
He's experiencing aortic dissection.
Prepare to open him up.

579
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,608
-Right.
-Where's Dr. Tokai?

580
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,111
Dr. Tokai.

581
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,113
Dr. Tokai.

582
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,021
Dr. Tokai.

583
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,559
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

584
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,996
Dr. Tokai, where are you?
The professor collapsed.

585
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,030
We need you, now!

586
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,934
Also, when Dr. Saeki fell…

587
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,204
Well…

588
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,809
At Tojo's very own
Saeki Surgery Department,

589
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,644
we perform an on-pump, on-beat…

590
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,279
You already said that.

591
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,648
Where is Professor Saeki?

592
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,987
The truth is he had to return
to the hospital for an emergency.

593
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,090
Please forgive us

594
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,858
for letting you all down.

595
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,965
Is Dr. Saeki the only doctor
at Tojo University?

596
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,236
This is exactly the situation
I feared most,

597
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,673
having to rely solely
on the skills of special individuals.

598
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,577
A man in such high demand as Dr. Saeki

599
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,247
surely can't be entrusted
with the position of board chairman.

600
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,888
The bleeding won't stop. Gauze!

601
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,957
-Right.
-Blood pressure, 80.

602
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,425
His heart rate is falling.

603
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,061
-Dr. Sera, where's Dr. Tokai?
-I don't know.

604
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,364
-Heart-lung machine, now!
-Right.

605
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,300
SCHEDULED FOR RECONSTRUCTION

606
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,436
TOJO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FORMER WING

607
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,909
It seems like Dr. Saeki
will not be returning.

608
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,612
Why don't we move on to the voting?

609
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,248
Right. Okay, then.

610
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,349
Excuse me.

611
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,720
In place of Dr. Saeki,

612
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,989
I would like to use this time to speak.

613
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,029
Last night,

614
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,899
I spoke with Dr. Saeki.

615
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,303
Are you sure you are fit for this?

616
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,475
Please keep this a secret
to the board members.

617
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,447
Do you want this that badly?

618
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,516
The seat of chairman.

619
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,620
My life

620
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,323
is no longer only my own.

621
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,761
I'm here today

622
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,031
because many people protected me.

623
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,600
Above all,

624
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,870
I have to show something for it.

625
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,307
What I was entrusted with

626
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,111
and what I learned through experience.

627
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,249
Doctor…

628
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,220
I believe…

629
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:43,160
all doctors must always remain humble.

630
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,864
Be it surgical skill,

631
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,067
or advanced technology,
there is always a limit.

632
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,504
When faced with a human life,

633
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,874
there is only so much we can do.

634
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,144
That's why…

635
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,015
we must use both.

636
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,351
We must work together.

637
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,254
We must strengthen them both.

638
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,893
<i>To save patients' lives in the future,</i>

639
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,929
<i>we need the latest research.</i>

640
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,534
<i>To save the patients</i>
<i>who are suffering in front of us</i>

641
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,769
<i>we need the best skills.</i>

642
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,673
<i>We cannot afford to lose either of them.</i>

643
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,544
These two opposing ideals

644
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,147
must be allowed to coexist

645
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,352
for the future of medicine.

646
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,488
That is Dr. Saeki's goal.

647
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,292
Blood pressure dropping!

648
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,596
Damn it. The tear is too large,
we can't stop the bleeding.

649
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,567
Isn't there anything else we can do?

650
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,583
His heart has stopped!

651
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,186
Dr. Saeki!

652
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,593
-Give him a shot of adrenaline!
-Right!

653
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,495
Start heart massage.

654
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,108
<i>For me, it was your father.</i>

655
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,813
<i>Dr. Ichiro Tokai is the one</i>
<i>who spared my life.</i>

656
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,896
MISSED CALL FROM SERA

657
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,268
<i>Dr. Tokai, where are you?</i>

658
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,537
<i>The professor collapsed. We need you, now!</i>

659
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,242
<i>Also, when Dr. Saeki fell…</i>

660
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,113
-Professor Saeki!
-Dr. Saeki!

661
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,014
Professor!

662
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:23,487
Tokai…

663
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,426
Just be yourself.

664
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,498
Just be normal.

665
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:37,968
Doctors…

666
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,006
Need only to think of their patients.

667
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,743
<i>Save lives.</i>

668
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,145
<i>Tokai…</i>

669
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,951
<i>Just save people's lives.</i>

670
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,453
To you…

671
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,758
I entrust everything to you.

672
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,494
<i>"I entrust everything to you."</i>

673
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,530
<i>That's what he said.</i>

674
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,301
<i>Whether accumulating research</i>

675
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,103
or honing one's skills,

676
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,006
in the end, it's people.

677
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,144
Striving for the incomplete
to be made perfect,

678
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,579
medicine continues to advance.

679
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,984
That is Dr. Saeki's hope

680
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,453
and his wish.

681
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,802
We still haven't got a heartbeat!

682
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,069
Don't give up.

683
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,606
If we give up, it's over.

684
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,976
Don't give up.

685
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,612
If we give up…

686
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,158
We won't be able to…

687
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,135
It's not over yet.

688
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,475
It's not over yet!

689
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,332
It's not over yet.

690
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,202
It's…

691
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,838
It's not over, is it?

692
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,113
Dr. Tokai.

693
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,126
Move it.

694
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,330
Okay!

695
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,201
Okay.

696
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,302
Gown.

697
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,137
-Right.
-Five minutes since the heart stopped.

698
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,973
-Okay, we still have time. Continue.
-Right.

699
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,909
-Is the heart-lung machine ready?
-Almost.

700
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,411
-Turn it on when it's ready.
-Turning it on now.

701
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,480
-Set it to cooling down.
-Right.

702
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,882
Get all the gauze
and artificial blood vessels you can.

703
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,584
-Change places.
-Thank you.

704
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,519
-Magnifying glass.
-Here.

705
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,720
-Metz.
-Here.

706
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,356
-Cut circulation.
-Right.

707
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,991
-3-0.
-Here.

708
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,660
-Suturing.
-Right.

709
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,128
Keep bringing more gauze.

710
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,596
-Dr. Sera, follow the thread.
-Okay.

711
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,431
-Follow me.
-Right.

712
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,233
-Takashina, suction deeper.
-Right.

713
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,636
And now, the election results.

714
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,839
Professor Nishizaki, Teika University.

715
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,441
JAPAN SURGICAL SOCIETY
BOARD CHAIRMAN ELECTION

716
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,476
Professor Saeki, Tojo University.

717
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,844
All right!

718
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,847
Professor Nishizaki, Teika University.

719
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,418
-More suction.
-Right.

720
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,319
Artificial vessels.

721
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,487
-Open wider, I can't see.
-Right.

722
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,222
-Sera, suction deeper.
-Right.

723
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,924
-Gauze.
-We need gauze.

724
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,093
Professor Nishizaki, Teika Univerisity.

725
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,698
Professor Saeki, Tojo University.

726
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,569
Artificial vessel sutured. Removing clamp.

727
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,437
Okay.

728
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,772
-Get the DC just in case.
-Okay.

729
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,574
There we go.

730
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,655
-VF!
-Dr. Tokai.

731
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,457
If his heart doesn't work,
he won't make it.

732
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,725
-Defibrillator.
-Here.

733
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,427
Let him hear your voice.

734
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,763
-Talk to him.
-Dr. Saeki.

735
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,765
Dr. Saeki!

736
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,867
-Come back!
-Here we go.

737
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,836
-Professor Saeki!
-Doctor Saeki!

738
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,271
-Doctor!
-Nothing!

739
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,774
-Come back to us.
-Professor!

740
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,743
-Come back.
-Professor Saeki.

741
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,512
-Dr. Saeki!
-Here we go.

742
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,182
-Nothing yet.
-Please!

743
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,884
-Stay alive!
-Come back.

744
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,085
Come back to us.

745
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,421
-Come back.
-Come back!

746
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,451
He has a pulse.
Blood pressure stabilizing!

747
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,586
Dr. Tokai.

748
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,726
Professor Saeki…

749
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,738
<i>Professor Saeki, Tojo University.</i>

750
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,277
And now, the final vote.

751
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,757
Professor Saeki, Tojo University.

752
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,241
Let's go.

753
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,877
Professor Nishizaki.

754
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,846
Where are you going?

755
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,449
To do some research.

756
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,420
That's what makes a doctor.

757
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,106
Why did you save me?

758
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,283
Accepting you into Tojo University

759
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,421
was my attempt at atoning for my sins.

760
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,626
But you…

761
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:48,198
possessed an immeasurable talent
for surgery.

762
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,469
With your grudge towards me,

763
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,640
you continued to hone your skills.

764
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,542
I wanted to see…

765
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,812
your growth…

766
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,550
I wanted to observe more of it.

767
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,619
That's what I thought.

768
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,256
I…

769
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,126
wouldn't have cared if I died.

770
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,763
As you wished.

771
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,039
Tokai.

772
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,312
"Just be yourself."

773
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,417
"Just be normal."

774
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,025
"A doctor needs only
to think of their patients."

775
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,264
"Save lives."

776
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,936
"Just save people's lives."

777
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,011
Those words

778
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,552
are from a doctor I respect.

779
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,227
Will you be leaving?

780
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,263
At a university hospital like this,

781
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,167
someone has to take responsibility.

782
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,004
What about me?

783
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,974
What will happen to me?

784
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,377
I still have so much to learn.

785
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,147
I've worked so hard to keep up with you.

786
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,649
I put myself through hell
just to be useful to you!

787
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,285
How can you suddenly walk away like this?

788
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,491
What about the hundred million yen?

789
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,797
I still owe you the money.

790
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:37,801
But…

791
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,205
I haven't paid anything back.

792
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,779
So you can use me all you want.

793
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,814
Order me around.

794
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,517
Just please don't leave.

795
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,428
Fine.

796
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:09,999
I'm starving.

797
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,569
-What?
-Make me some rice.

798
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,004
-What? Rice?
-Now.

799
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,507
Right.

800
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,520
Bye.

801
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,630
I hope you'll become a good doctor.

802
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:59,215
<i>And so, Dr. Saeki was appointed chairman</i>

810
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,440
Impact Factor!

<i>he showed a somewhat lonely expression.</i>

817
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,565
<i>Dr. Tokai did that?</i>

818
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,669
<i>He sent all the money he made</i>
<i>to organizations that help patients</i>

819
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,704
<i>who have suffered</i>
<i>from medical malpractice.</i>

820
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,274
Come to think of it,
I never did see him spend any money.

821
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,209
Yes.

822
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,778
Do you want some, Dr. Sera?

823
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,646
I said wouldn't.

824
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,282
I'm waiting to eat with Dr. Tokai.

825
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,751
And when will that be?

826
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,554
-I have a bone to pick with him.
-By the way,

827
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,591
it seems there was an unidentified deposit
the other day.

828
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,026
The amount was ten million yen.

829
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,429
-Ten million?
-That means…

830
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,598
No way.

831
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,267
<i>Move it.</i>

832
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,036
<i>For ten million,</i>

833
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,873
I'll make the whole thing disappear.
