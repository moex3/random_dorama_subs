1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,166
 I'm Hachi.

2
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,875
 This is about a love story
 between my girlfriend and I.

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,750
 She is a bit different, but super cool.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,875
 She wields a sword.

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,666
 She's unbelievably strong.

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,416
 When I met her, I learned the joy
 and sadness of being in love,

7
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,000
 and what it means to truly love someone.

8
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,041
 In any case, I learned what "love" is.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,750
 She really is my special person.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,750
 It might be misleading to say "person,"

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:50,083
 Since my girlfriend

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,875
 is a Yokai who was bound a long time ago.

13
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,541
 My Yokai girlfriend
 crossed a tremendous amount of time

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,291
 to arrive in the present day,

15
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,750
 with a huge secret.

16
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,250
 I had no idea about her secret back then.

17
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,375
 This is a love story between me
 and my dear, and slightly scary,

18
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,666
 Yokai girlfriend.

19
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,166
 It all started with a strange incident.

20
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,375
ONE WEEK AGO

21
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,333
 Love?

22
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,875
POST IN STORY

23
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:45,875
UPLOAD COMPLETE

24
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,958
I just want to free her!

25
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,750
You fool!

26
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,333
That isn't love.

27
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:22,250
That's a story of betrayal.

28
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,416
It's coming! I'll go forward.

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,916
We can do it. Yes! They're coming.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,208
You can do it. Yes!

31
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,500
Hikari, help me out.

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,333
-Okay.
-Give me one.

33
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,583
-Okay, nice!
-Oh...

34
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,833
MAI
SENT A STAMP

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,125
Morning Mai!
I'm off now!

36
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,041
PEEK

37
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,166
Hachi, the flank.

38
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,416
 I can't give you death.

39
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,583
-Hachi.
-Hachi, the flank!

40
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,375
What's up? Hachi, the flank!

41
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,333
How are you, Mai?

42
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,750
-Hachi, the flank!
-Where did you go?

43
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,833
The flank!

44
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,000
 Battle test complete.

45
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,250
 The Opposing team completed the mission.

46
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,791
 You lost.

47
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,458
 I repeat. You lost.

48
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,875
What were you doing?
We were about to level up.

49
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm sorry. I got a message.

50
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,708
Turn your phone off!
That's the most basic rule.

51
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
It was from my girlfriend.

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,250
Nothing is more important than
gaining levels.

53
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,833
-There is.
-Totally.

54
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait. What girlfriend?

55
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,583
Your response is slow.

56
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,041
What girlfriend?

57
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,333
I met her on a fanzine site.

58
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,708
We get along well,
and everything about her is very cute.

59
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,875
I mean, I haven't met her in person yet.

60
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:27,208
A gamer is having an online romance?
How typical.

61
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,750
Because of people like you,

62
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,750
people think gamers are lame and asocial.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,291
Get it together.

64
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,916
You always do that when you get nervous.
Stop, Wetty.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,916
Don't call me that.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,333
He's right. Abuse of power.

67
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm just passionate about games.
Right, Hikari?

68
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,666
Thanks to all you HikaristsI
I'm so happy. I love you all!

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,500
Don't forget to follow me. Hikari out.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,125
Well, if you ask me,

71
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,875
gamers equal nerds with money,

72
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,000
and the rest are harmless losers.

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,916
I'm not a loser.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,541
You're more like a loyal dog,
Hachi, rather than a loser.

75
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,333
-All right, let's do it again.
-Yes.

76
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,083
Benitaro is a musclehead,
so don't let it get to you.

77
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,833
By the way, are online girlfriends lame?

78
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,583
Your soft, tofu-like mentality
worrying about that is lame.

79
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,208
Then there's nothing I can do!

80
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,458
I have no confidence in myself.

81
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,041
I'll never be the main character
no matter what I do.

82
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,416
I'm just a nobody
with no level-unlocking capabilities.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,250
I sound like a total loser
talking about this, too.

84
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,666
Why is everything so difficult?

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,791
It's simple.

86
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,541
Games and love are the same.
You just take on the next level.

87
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,916
All you do is summon your girlfriend
into the real world.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,125
Ask her out on a real date.

89
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,208
What?

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,791
That's... What?

91
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:05,916
Here we go!

92
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,208
-Hi.
-Hi, Tadashi.

93
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,000
Mom, focus! This is my profile picture.
Take it seriously.

94
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,583
Okay, step back one step.

95
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,500
Hachi!

96
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,041
I'll kill you if you drink my smoothie.

97
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,416
Understood.

98
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,875
Here we go!

99
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,208
-What?
-I posted it.

100
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,583
MAI
I'm sorry about earlier

101
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,750
MAI
SENT A STAMP

102
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,625
No problem!
I had a lot bothering me today

103
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,708
How about you, Mai?

104
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,583
Me too!

105
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,083
Misaki kept on making
mean comments again today

106
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,958
Mai, you're the only one
I can talk to about everything

107
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,291
I feel the same way.
I really like you, Hachi

108
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,083
BLUSH

109
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

110
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,708
How about we go out to eat this weekend?

111
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,333
I won't say anything mean to you.

112
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,708
I'm sorry...
I have plans already

113
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,000
Why? I'm serious about you, Mai.

114
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:29,041
I bought everything
on your Amazon Wish List too

115
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,458
I sent it.

116
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,208
VIDEO CALL

117
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,833
CALLING

118
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,416
Who was that?

119
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,083
Mai?

120
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:16,333
Mythology wasn't just handed down
for entertainment purposes.

121
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:22,333
There are unimaginable stories
hidden behind it.

122
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,500
That's all for today.
We'll pick this up next week.

123
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,000
I bet that was Mai's father.

124
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,375
Hachi, just forget it.

125
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,750
See her profile picture? It's authentic.

126
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,250
Editing apps these days are impressive.

127
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,541
Hey, Wetty!

128
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,791
I heard you got scammed on a dating app.

129
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,333
How did you find that out?

130
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's see...

131
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,208
"We may be physically apart,

132
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:59,000
"but I've never been so close
to anyone in my whole entire life."

133
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
Man, that's sick to say to a dude!

134
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,791
Give it back.

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,416
Inukai.

136
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,333
Do you have a moment?

137
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,875
What?

138
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,041
Thank you, Arisa.

139
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,708
-That'll be enough for today.
-Yes.

140
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,000
Excuse me.

141
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,666
Inukai, are you okay?

142
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,375
Yes, Masato has been that way
since high school.

143
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,791
There's something I'm worried about...

144
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm worried, too!

145
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,333
Everyone thinks I'm a loser.
They call me "Wetty."

146
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,791
-This isn't an American teen drama.
-"Wetty?"

147
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,041
When I was talking to a girl
in elementary school,

148
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,625
I started to sweat a lot.

149
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,500
When I told that story
to the e-sports team,

150
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,791
the entire campus knew it the next day.

151
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,833
Sweating is part of social awkwardness,
which means I get nervous.

152
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,041
I know I have to do something about it...

153
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,208
That must be hard,

154
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,750
but I'm worried about something else.

155
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,166
What?

156
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,625
It's about a student
named Kouki Shikazono.

157
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,291
I haven't been able to get ahold of him
for a week.

158
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,750
Do you know anything about it, Inukai?

159
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,625
Um... I don't know.

160
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,500
Just like you,
he was a different kind of a nerd,

161
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,458
so I thought you might know something.

162
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,958
MUKURO POLICE DEPARTMENT

163
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,000
Captain!

164
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,291
That blood found at
the Keiho University library

165
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:55,083
matched the DNA
of that missing Kouki Shikazono.

166
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,416
Now it gets super interesting.

167
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,291
No one hardly ever
steps in to that old library's basement.

168
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,625
You need to request entry, however!

169
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,958
There's no record
of Kouki Shikazono's entry.

170
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,833
It looks like he snuck in there.

171
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,666
It's like he's to blame...

172
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,833
It gets more interesting.

173
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,583
This book was found there.

174
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,291
Isn't this cut amazing?

175
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,083
It's impossible to do this with
a CNC laser cutter.

176
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:29,666
Did the culprit use an iron-cutting sword?
Or the user of Destructo Disc?

177
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,500
Does that mean Krillin is the suspect?

178
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,500
By the way, who are you?

179
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,291
Sir! I'm Nico Suzuki, and I've been
assigned to First Investigation Division.

180
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,416
It's seriously awesome
that the best captain here is my mentor!

181
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,583
I'm thrilled!

182
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,250
-Suzuki.
-Sir!

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,708
Get the report together.

184
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,125
Sir!

185
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,208
 Kouki Shikazono?

186
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,625
The one who went missing?

187
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,625
Right! He was an occult fanatic.

188
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,833
He was a little different.

189
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,625
Take a look at this.

190
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,750
It's a screenshot of a Story

191
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,833
Kouki Shikazono posted
before he went missing.

192
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,291
What do you think this is?

193
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,625
Ancient characters?

194
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,000
You sure are good, Hachi!
I only understand bits and pieces of it,

195
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,125
but I'm thinking it's a spell
for some ritual.

196
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,250
 "Amanoenoma?"

197
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,166
"For those who seek love."

198
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,708
It looks like a spell to grant love.

199
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,458
Look at this.

200
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,583
Isn't she cute? She looks like Mai!

201
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,041
I went too far.

202
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,916
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,750
A love spell...

204
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,500
Oh, man! If only I had a real girlfriend!

205
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,208
Then no one would harass me.

206
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,333
Why don't you try the spell?
You might get your wish.

207
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,666
No way!

208
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,125
Airdrop it to me anyway.

209
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,458
"To unleash the beast of desire,

210
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,541
"collect the sacred devices."

211
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,625
 An object to reflect your vanity.

212
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,875
 An object that broadcasts
 humanity's deceitful laws.

213
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,875
 The blood of a young virgin maiden.

214
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,083
Pervert!

215
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,791
I think a virgin boy's blood will do.

216
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,166
This is stupid.

217
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,125
Hey!

218
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,291
 Did that spell work?

219
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,625
Jeez! I've been looking
for you all morning.

220
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,125
I might have been looking for you, too.

221
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,583
What? Who are you? Creep!

222
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,625
 Of course not.

223
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,166
I found you.

224
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,708
What?

225
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm Princess Izuna-imiki.

226
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,500
You must be Tadashi Inukai.

227
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,916
I've been looking for you.

228
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:36,958
Me?

229
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:41,250
Now, let's have intercourse.

230
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,041
Intercourse?

231
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,500
Where's the camera?
Isn't this one of Masato's pranks?

232
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,333
I'll go now.

233
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
Where are you going?

234
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,208
Tadashi Inukai.

235
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,458
I'm going to have intercourse with you
right now.

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,291
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

237
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,833
What was that?

238
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,708
Was I hallucinating? Have I gone mad?

239
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,291
Is this your residence?

240
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,875
What? When? Did you follow me? Why?

241
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,125
We are going to have intercourse.

242
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,583
That hurt!

243
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,625
And her breath is cold.

244
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,208
What?

245
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,000
Wait one second!

246
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,583
Are you halting the ritual?

247
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,291
This is new to me, too.

248
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,250
Don't worry. It's just formality.

249
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,333
But this is very special.

250
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,500
Special?

251
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,208
Right. I think it should be special.

252
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,291
It shouldn't be done on a whim like this.

253
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,041
I mean I want to do it.

254
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,375
I want it to be special.

255
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,791
Enough with your nonsense.

256
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,375
-Hey!
-Tadashi?

257
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,958
Are you home?

258
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,791
This is horrible. Move!

259
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,208
Put your clothes on! Hurry! Your clothes!

260
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,541
-Tadashi?
-Wait!

261
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,791
Hi.

262
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,833
This isn't...

263
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you doing?

264
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,916
Here's your laundry.
Make sure to put it away. There!

265
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,333
How else do I explain it?

266
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,250
A connection between the fact
that you almost did it

267
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,833
and the fact you used that love spell?

268
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,458
Whatever it is, I envy you.

269
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,666
Can you be serious here?

270
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
Maybe I'll give it a try, too.

271
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:30,458
-I swear I'll do this.
-No! You'll ignore me for a whole week?

272
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,583
Suddenly, a girl who wants to have
intercourse with me shows up.

273
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,166
You know it's some kind of a scam.

274
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,416
I thought so, too!

275
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
But she looked like she was
really summoned by the spell.

276
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,458
Everything is different about her.

277
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:45,416
It's as if she came from
a different time period.

278
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,208
By the way, what does she look like?

279
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,458
She's slender.

280
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,833
She's fair and has black hair.

281
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:58,916
Is she dressed like a female ninja
with black armor and lots of weapons?

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,583
Yes! How did you know that?

283
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,583
Here you go.

284
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,125
So you followed me after all?

285
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,708
What is this mud water?

286
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,833
It's cola.

287
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,708
Why is this mud water mad?

288
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,375
You never had it before? It's good.

289
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,291
I feel a burst of energy now.

290
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,500
Okay! Let's have intercourse.

291
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,708
Keep it down.

292
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,458
But why me?

293
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,666
Were you summoned by that spell?

294
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,166
You broke the seal
and brought me back to this world.

295
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,333
If I don't have intercourse with a human
by the hour of the ox,

296
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,750
I'll disappear from this world.

297
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,958
-The hour of the ox?
-No time can be wasted.

298
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,041
Hold on a second! Izunaimi...
What was it again?

299
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,750
That's long. Can I call you "Izzy?"

300
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,125
Go ahead.

301
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks. People call me "Hachi."

302
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,833
It's actually Tadashi,
but I got it after Hachi, the loyal dog.

303
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:23,250
Izzy, you're very attractive.

304
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,041
I'm interested in lots of things.

305
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,791
But to have intercourse, you know...

306
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,000
I think things should be done in steps.

307
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,750
So first, why don't we go on a date?

308
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,458
A date?

309
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,916
We go out together
and talk about ourselves...

310
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,083
I mean, I don't know...

311
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,083
I've never been on a date.

312
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,166
If we go on this "date" thing,
then can we have intercourse?

313
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,625
Well...

314
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,875
If things go well.

315
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,208
Hachi, let's go.

316
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,083
What? Wait!

317
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,583
What?

318
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,083
Seriously?

319
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,500
Would you like one?

320
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,125
 Izzy, do you have any siblings?

321
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,708
 I have two older sisters.

322
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,875
 Where are you from?

323
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,583
 Our family line goes back to Buzen
 during the Yayoi period.

324
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,208
 I grew up on Kutsujima Island.

325
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,500
 Why do you ask?

326
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,083
 That's the whole point of a date.

327
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,833
 We get to know one another.

328
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,166
 Is knowing one another necessary to
 do an intercourse ritual?

329
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,500
I think it is.

330
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,875
Do this.

331
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,916
Here. Look here, okay?

332
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,333
It's to remember our first date.

333
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,208
Look who's here! It's Wetty!

334
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,250
Is she your girlfriend?

335
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,250
Well, she's not quite my girlfriend yet.

336
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,875
Right! You can't be this lowly
nobody's girlfriend!

337
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,916
Lowly nobody?

338
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,708
-Someone that's insignificant.
-Let's go.

339
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,666
You look wild and gorgeous.

340
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,708
Why don't you dump him
and come to a party?

341
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,250
It's happening at my cousin
Hayato's penthouse tonight.

342
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,916
We won't go to Ippongi's party.

343
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,666
I'm not inviting you.

344
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,208
Here.

345
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,250
I'll see you there.

346
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,083
See you!

347
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,666
I bet Ippongi's party is full of
rich arrogant people with no taste.

348
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,500
They're all investors and frauds.
They're all scum!

349
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,541
Ippongi...

350
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,625
Hachi, let's have intercourse right now!

351
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,583
We just met, we have things to prepare,
and my mother is home.

352
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,208
We should get to know each other.

353
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:05,500
Enough. If you won't do it,
than I'll just look for a temporary mate.

354
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,541
I got my eyes on one.

355
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,750
I'm going to Ippongi's residence.

356
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,583
I will have intercourse there.

357
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,666
What? Wait!

358
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,708
Where is everyone?

359
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,625
They all went to Ippongi's party.
Where is she?

360
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,791
Izzy went to that party, too.
Masato invited her.

361
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,750
Parties are stupid.

362
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,875
They'll have hangovers and puke.

363
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,916
It just ruins their record.

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,166
I don't envy them at all.
Let's go to an all-you-can-eat barbecue!

365
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,291
Let's have salty ox tongue,
then short ribs!

366
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,166
I'm going to Ippongi's party.

367
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,791
But you aren't invited.

368
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,041
I followed Hayato's account.
I know where it is.

369
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,375
Don't.

370
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,500
Offal, then short ribs again!

371
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,875
Just forget her.

372
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,375
You know you'll be in trouble
if you don't quit now.

373
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,291
That missing Kouki Shikazono

374
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,166
disappeared after he posted that spell.

375
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,250
Take a look at this.

376
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,875
Doesn't she look like her?

377
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,625
She's definitely dangerous.

378
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,083
-She doesn't look like her.
-Hachi.

379
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,958
She likes me!

380
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,333
Someone actually likes me.

381
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,583
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime for me!

382
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,500
Give it up for Hayato!

383
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,000
There are two kinds of people.

384
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,041
A small fraction of successful winners

385
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,208
or the rest, the losers!

386
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,000
Which makes me...

387
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,916
A winner!

388
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,291
That's right!
A rich and distinguished family.

389
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:34,791
Ippongi's only son. Special by birth.

390
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:38,625
Furthermore, I was gifted with two things.

391
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't know who you are,

392
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,625
but thank you, Satoshi Nakamoto,

393
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,416
the developer of Bitcoin!

394
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,791
"Since the ancient times,
the demon fox haunted a human male

395
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,750
"and used that man as a host,

396
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,500
"and by having intercourse with that host,

397
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,291
"it is able to regain
its original powers."

398
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,416
"Having intercourse with its host
is considered as a forbidden ritual,

399
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,541
"and the demon fox depends on the host..."

400
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,083
This is bad. This is seriously bad!

401
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:39,916
If you win against me,
then I'll introduce you to Hayato.

402
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,541
There.

403
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,375
You got this.

404
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,416
Izzy!

405
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,708
Wetty. What are you doing here?

406
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,958
You weren't invited.

407
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:10,833
What did you do that for?

408
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,666
Scram, you lowly nobody.

409
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,833
Izzy, let's go.

410
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,041
That...

411
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,625
Fucking bitch.

412
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,125
Yeah!

413
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,500
We are currently
at Hayato Ippongi's party!

414
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,916
There you are!

415
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,625
-Hikari! Where's Hachi?
-What?

416
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,041
Have you seen Hachi?

417
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,541
What? I can't hear you.

418
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,958
-Hachi!
-What?

419
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,583
Forget it!

420
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,208
There's something I want to say to you.

421
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,958
You're right. I'm taking it slowly.

422
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,250
I'm not confident like Masato.

423
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,875
You do everything so abruptly, and
that's completely different from me.

424
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,083
So I don't know what to do.

425
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,166
But...

426
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,750
I like you, too.

427
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,541
I think...

428
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:39,250
I mean, I want to
have intercourse with you,

429
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,666
but what about afterwards?

430
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,250
We support one another, right?

431
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,041
That's having a cooperative relationship.
That's partnership, right?

432
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,041
A cooperative relationship...

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,625
Right, you and I will have
a cooperative relationship,

434
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,541
and we will have intercourse, right now.

435
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,583
Yes.

436
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,166
We just made it in time.

437
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,416
What is this? This is no joke.

438
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,125
You and I are now connected forever.

439
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:29,833
Hayato!

440
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,708
That's Ippongi's descendant.

441
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,083
Let's get this party started!

442
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,166
Izzy?

443
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,000
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

444
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,916
Izzy.

445
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:12,458
-There you are, Hachi!
-What's up, buddy?

446
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:17,166
I know why she was so eager
to have intercourse with you.

447
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,750
For love, right?

448
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:22,041
No! That girl is a demon fox,

449
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,250
and she has to have sex

450
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,875
with the man who summoned her
or she'll disappear.

451
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,708
It's a forbidden ritual
involving spiritual powers

452
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:32,416
to have sex with that Yokai.

453
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,958
When you have sex with her,
you'll be connected to her

454
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,750
and she'll suck out your spiritual power.

455
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,333
You'll be dependent on her powers,

456
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:44,125
and you won't be
able to get away from her!

457
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:50,166
You haven't done it with her yet, right?

458
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,583
I just want to clarify this.
How old are you?

459
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,083
You aren't underage, are you?

460
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,708
I'm 521 years old.

461
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,833
I don't get it,

462
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,333
but I'll take that
as enthusiastic consent.

463
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,833
What's this?

464
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,750
That's a charm for my family's prosperity.

465
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:35,416
Basically, it shows
that I'm a super special person.

466
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,250
Your ancestor was born in Yamato

467
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,333
and thrived as a carpenter.

468
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,666
Isn't that right?

469
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,791
How do you know that?

470
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,208
I've been looking for you.

471
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,500
Hold on. Who are you?

472
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,541
Well...

473
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,875
I'm the woman you longed for.

474
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,750
You are a Guardian, and my target.

475
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:12,791
Izzy?

476
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,458
Izzy!

477
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,750
Have you seen Izzy?
That girl who was with me?

478
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,833
She left with Hayato.

479
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:33,500
I bet they're having a good time
in a private room right now!

480
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,125
INVESTIGATION DIVISION ONE

481
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,500
Yes. Thank you very much.

482
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,000
Is that Kouki Shikazono's laptop?

483
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,291
Yes, I got it from his mother.

484
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,750
Dance at home.

485
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,791
You got it.

486
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:05,916
 Hi, everyone.

487
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:10,041
 I found something incredible.

488
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,333
 A forbidden book

489
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:15,125
 with information about Yokai
 that was never revealed!

490
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:20,750
 What is to be revealed will affect
 the future of this world.

491
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,583
 This forbidden book...

492
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,458
Hello?

493
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,375
Yes, I'll be home late tonight.
Can you put my dinner in the fridge?

494
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:35,083
 Calm down me. I shouldn't rush this.

495
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,875
 Now, everyone, listen carefully.

496
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,458
 This is a story from ancient times.

497
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,000
 Long time ago,

498
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:51,666
 humans and Yokai lived in perfect harmony.

499
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,000
 Humans and Yokai supported one another,
 and had a reciprocal relationship.

500
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,625
He had intercourse with that...

501
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,791
What a foolish human.

502
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:30,875
Izzy!

503
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,750
Izzy?

504
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,958
Perfect timing.

505
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,666
Is there a good place to store this?
