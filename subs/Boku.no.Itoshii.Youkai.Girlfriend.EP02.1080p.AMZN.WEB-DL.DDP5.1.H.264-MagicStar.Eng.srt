1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,916
Hey, Hayato.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,250
Some bitch threw up in the pool,
it's crazy.

3
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,541
Tanuki!

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,541
You should go, Tanuki!

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,666
I'm coming in.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,083
I'm dizzy.

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,333
Is this Hachi's room?

8
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,916
But we were in Ippongi's room.
What happened?

9
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,958
I brought you guys here.

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,041
Through the world of shadows.

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,750
What?

12
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,208
Is this real? It's not a metaverse?

13
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,041
It's real! We can't log out!

14
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,083
I have to create an altar
to adorn this head.

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,625
Where can I put this until then?

16
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,958
Of course not.

17
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,041
Let's escape.

18
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,416
She's a demon. No, a murderer.

19
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,208
I have extremely good hearing.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,291
Maybe I shall cut your throat

21
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,833
so you can never speak ill again.

22
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,083
What's your name?

23
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,625
-Sorry.
-A question for you, Sorry.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,500
He's Tanuki, not Sorry.

25
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,333
Tanuki. Is there
an underground ice cave nearby?

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,541
I don't know.

27
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:37,791
Hey, can't you put back that head
in the shadows?

28
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:38,875
No?

29
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,791
I need this for an important ritual.

30
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,125
And you'll cooperate.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,541
Of course. Totally. Right?

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,333
Hachi, sorry. I can't stand this.

33
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,416
I'm logging out.

34
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,291
Hey! Wait!

35
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,750
HAVE YOUR DAD ARREST HER!

36
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,041
You must never speak of this.

37
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,916
Anyone who obstructs my mission,
I will freeze the blood in their veins,

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,833
extract their spine and intestines

39
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,541
and devour their heart!

40
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,208
Understand?

41
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,750
Yes.

42
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,083
It's as if he was instantly frozen.

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,708
The wound is clean.

44
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
And no sign of the head anywhere.

45
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,583
A headless corpse on a newly assigned site

46
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,708
is quite punk! Is this common?

47
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:43,958
No.

48
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,666
Sleep.

49
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,541
A lot of young people are into mysticism
and the occult these days.

50
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,375
I've seen this symbol on social media.

51
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,375
It's a trend.

52
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,000
The cause seems to run deeper than that.

53
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,625
The victim from the Ippongi Clan
holds significant power.

54
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,083
Many enemies, too.

55
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,833
But first, gather evidence.

56
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,041
Sir, may I have a moment?

57
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,458
Nothing.

58
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,916
We couldn't find the victim's head
in the other room, either.

59
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,875
We'll ask the people in the vicinity.

60
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,208
 The Yokai have come to our world.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,791
 In just one night,
 one of the Five Spears died.

62
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,708
Hey.

63
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,833
This isn't a sumo ring salt toss.

64
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,166
Gather fingerprints less dramatically.

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,875
Ten thousand apologies, Master.

66
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,416
Of course, as you desire.

67
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,000
What is his problem?

68
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,833
Forensics seem to have
some peculiar characters.

69
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,875
You know, Izzy...

70
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,750
I find you to be a very intriguing person.

71
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,000
And very cute, too.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,125
Hold on.

73
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,416
An icehouse?

74
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
We call it a refrigerator.

75
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,750
So, Izzy.

76
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,500
We've become partners,

77
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,458
but it seems quite challenging.

78
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,500
I mean... I'm sorry for
performing the summoning ritual.

79
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,958
But that was an accident.

80
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,666
So, I think it's better for us
to part ways.

81
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,041
You're a great person.

82
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,583
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

83
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,666
I've told you.

84
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,791
We are connected through a bond that has
been passed down since ancient times.

85
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,750
There's no escaping it.

86
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,666
What do you mean?

87
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,125
Using your terms,

88
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,375
we are in
a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.

89
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,000
But there are times

90
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,333
when boyfriends and girlfriends part ways.

91
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,500
There is no parting for us.
It's an eternal and sacred bond.

92
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,708
You're sweating.

93
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,875
Sorry, I'm nervous.

94
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,583
I need to bond more with you.

95
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,791
You mean, again?

96
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,541
But we just talked about
what to do with our relationship,

97
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,000
and I don't know what to do
in these situations.

98
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,833
-What do couples usually do?
-Shut up.

99
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,375
Let's at least be quiet.
My family might wake up.

100
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,791
You slept well.

101
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,666
So...

102
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,458
Last night was real, right?

103
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,541
Indeed.

104
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,250
We were able to share
our power sufficiently.

105
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,833
It feels like a dream.

106
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,541
It's not a dream.

107
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,583
Everything is fine.

108
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,833
Please let it be a dream.

109
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,250
I'm hungry.

110
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,083
Let's eat.

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,041
Hey, wait!

112
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,666
You can't! My family's downstairs.

113
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,875
What should I do?

114
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,875
All right.

115
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,166
Let's go.

116
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,166
No!

117
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,916
Tadashi, what's with all the fuss?

118
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,083
What?

119
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you always fly around
with this roller-coaster-like vibe?

120
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,291
It's just an ordinary shadow walking.

121
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,500
It's time. I've got to go.

122
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,166
I have school and stuff.

123
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,958
And my stomach hurts.

124
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,958
It was nice meeting you.

125
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,458
It seems you don't
quite understand our bond.

126
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,708
I do.

127
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,083
But you see, I have a life

128
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,208
that involves ordinary things, not murder.

129
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,208
So, bye.

130
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,750
If I die, you'll die, too.

131
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,875
Come again?

132
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,541
-What is this sweet scent?
-It's a crepe.

133
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey! Hey, wait.

134
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,541
Could you elaborate on this dying thing?

135
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,833
You summoned me, so it's
your responsibility to provide for me.

136
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,833
I recommend our most popular crepe,

137
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,833
the chocolate strawberry
with super violent whipped creme.

138
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,791
I request that.

139
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
-One, please.
-Thank you.

140
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,666
So, what do you mean I die?

141
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,500
Our souls are bound by a connection.

142
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,541
We share our power.

143
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,208
If I die, you would soon follow.

144
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,958
Or, if you die, I would die.

145
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,958
That's more likely.

146
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,416
Thanks for waiting.

147
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,000
Here you go.

148
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,166
Have a good day.

149
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,583
Delicious!

150
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,000
Now, let's get back to our mission.

151
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,916
We must gather more heads of the accursed.

152
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,875
Heads...

153
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,750
I see it now.

154
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,791
I finally know what's wrong.

155
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,166
-Gathering heads!
-No.

156
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,666
You're hesitant about our bond.

157
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,041
You said it yourself. We help each other.

158
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,625
I never said I'd help with murder!

159
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,166
Fine.

160
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,250
It's a detour, but it can't be helped.

161
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,916
We'll perform the traditional
engagement ceremony tonight.

162
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,416
Then, we'll be connected
both physically and spiritually,

163
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,125
and you'll gain self-awareness.

164
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,625
Engagement? Marriage?

165
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,625
Tonight, at your residence.

166
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,750
-You can't!
-Why not?

167
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,625
I mean, It's too sudden.

168
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,916
I remembered, I'll be out tonight.

169
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,458
Fine.

170
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,083
Wherever you go,

171
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,708
I'll simply follow your trail
through the shadows.

172
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,166
I will now acquire

173
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,000
a dance and outfit suitable
for the engagement ceremony.

174
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,791
Okay, I get it!

175
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,291
Just hold on.

176
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,625
It'd be a problem
if we can't get int touch, so...

177
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,750
Here.

178
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,625
What's this?

179
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,583
TADASHI INUKAI

180
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,291
That's your name.

181
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,333
Press this and you'll be connected to me.

182
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,333
Put it on your ear.

183
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,625
Do you hear my voice?

184
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,541
I can hear your voice from this board!

185
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,916
With this, we can communicate
no matter where we are.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
Is this modern sorcery?

187
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:37,875
Amazing.

188
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,083
Well, I have to go to class now.

189
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,458
I'm so busy!

190
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,958
I have to practice.

191
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,958
The tournament is coming up.

192
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,041
So busy.

193
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,625
I need to get more kills.

194
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,416
So busy.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,916
Busy.

196
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,875
Hey! I'm giving the sign for help!

197
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,750
Did we have such a sign?

198
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,250
Do you intend to abandon me?

199
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,083
We swore a blood oath of brotherhood
when we were eight.

200
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,541
Have you forgotten?
You were the one who found that spell!

201
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,791
I just showed you Stories.

202
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,708
I summoned a Yokai!

203
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,666
Your best friend ended up bonding with
a killer Yokai that gains power from sex!

204
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,958
Don't you care?

205
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,666
-Your words are interesting.
-Stop being silly!

206
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,166
She said she wants to gather more heads.

207
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,083
Seriously?

208
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,208
Dead serious.
We need to drive her away somehow.

209
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,750
Have you told your dad?

210
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,041
That there's a severed head in my fridge?

211
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,291
How could I?

212
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,208
Hurry up and tell him! Right now!

213
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,958
I can't. We never talk about anything.

214
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,875
Wait, you put that thing in your fridge?

215
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,458
-Anyway!
-Seriously?

216
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,375
We need to find a solution now,

217
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,458
while she's off preparing
for some absurd engagement ceremony!

218
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,375
Engagement?

219
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,333
I told you it's an emergency.

220
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,333
But I bought her a smartphone
with location tracking.

221
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,958
It's on a 60-month installment plan!

222
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,958
You're her stalker now?

223
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,791
I'm kidding.
Quite a thoughtful move for you.

224
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,916
I've been thinking about something, too.

225
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,041
Your relationship with her is a curse.

226
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,958
And if it's a curse,
you might be able to break it.

227
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,625
This is quite a day's work.

228
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,250
Could take longer.

229
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,125
The curse that summoned Izzy
was written in ancient divine characters,

230
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,875
but I have no idea what language this is.

231
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,000
Boys.

232
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,250
That's a precious book,
so handle it with care.

233
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,375
Sorry, we're in a bit of rush.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,541
You're...

235
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,083
 Professor Sawada's...

236
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,541
Ms. Arisa.

237
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm Tanuki, from the workshop.

238
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,166
Hello.

239
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
Sanskrit sacred magic?

240
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,833
The existence of ancient guardian spirits?

241
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
What are you looking for?

242
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,291
-You can read them?
-Of course.

243
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,625
We're looking for a ritual to banish
Yokai from the human world.

244
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,708
-Yokai?
-For school.

245
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,625
Did the professor give such an assignment?

246
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,625
I'm looking for a way
to sever the spiritual connection

247
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,875
between a Yokai and its human host...

248
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,000
Tanuki's into occult stuff,
and sometimes says weird things.

249
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,583
So, you're looking for
a banishment ritual?

250
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,083
Here.

251
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,708
BANISHMENT RITUAL

252
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,750
This is an ancient exorcism ritual
from ancient times.

253
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
It can deal with various entities.

254
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,708
You know a lot.

255
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,708
My family is into mythology,

256
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,000
so I like sorcery and ghost stories.

257
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,250
I hope it works out.

258
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,958
And make sure to put it back
after you're done.

259
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,083
Yes.

260
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,625
She's a mysterious person.

261
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm surrounded by mysterious things.

262
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,208
Speaking of, where's Izzy?

263
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,416
KAMAKURA CITY
SEARCH: IZZY

264
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,000
-Kamakura?
-Kamakura?

265
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,875
So the dance has survived in this era.

266
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,125
I like how you look, too.

267
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,291
If she's in Kamakura, we have time.

268
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,208
Have you forgotten?

269
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,583
Izzy can teleport through shadows.

270
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,541
Let's take a note of this spell.

271
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,333
-I hope it works.
-Yeah.

272
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,333
-You look good!
-Great!

273
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,333
Nice.

274
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,250
Smile.

275
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,166
Great move!

276
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,208
You're doing great!

277
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,958
That's awesome!

278
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,875
Hey.

279
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,125
What's that strange dance?

280
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,625
This dance is buzzing right now.

281
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,958
Buzzing?

282
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,541
It means it's trending.

283
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:38,958
Like an epidemic?

284
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,041
That's hilarious.

285
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,250
She said epidemic.

286
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,083
Do you want to dance, too?

287
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,291
-Yeah.
-She should.

288
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,666
-We'll take you.
-Go on.

289
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,833
She's still in Kamakura, near the sea.

290
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,833
-Let's get ready now.
-Yeah.

291
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,000
The ritual requires
a magically protected location.

292
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,791
A quiet place
where no one will disturb us at night...

293
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,958
What about
the abandoned school in Kitayama?

294
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,125
Yeah!

295
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,833
I'll drop by for practice
and join you later.

296
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,458
Benitaro would be mad if we skip it.

297
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,750
Got it. See you tonight.

298
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,291
 Have you heard anything from Hayato?

299
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,708
Nothing.

300
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,000
Any financial troubles?

301
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,208
It seems he was quite well off.

302
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,125
No clue.

303
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,125
Your cousin was murdered.
Can't you cooperate?

304
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,833
He seemed to be interested in mysticism.

305
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,916
Do you know anything?

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,625
Like occultism or magic?

307
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,875
I said I don't know.

308
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,375
That was the first time I'd seen Hayato
since he left his family.

309
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,333
He left his family?

310
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,791
He didn't want to inherit
his dad's position.

311
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,750
So, he had a bad relationship
with his father?

312
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,250
Did they have conflicts?

313
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,291
I'm not saying Uncle killed him.

314
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,000
To begin with, they hardly even talked.

315
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:27,541
Uncle always exaggerated things, talking
about how they were protecting the world.

316
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,541
He was hard on others and overconfident.

317
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,250
It's no wonder his son didn't like him.

318
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,041
Enough?

319
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,666
Thank you for your cooperation.

320
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,208
Let's also talk to the victim's father,
Takeru Ippongi.

321
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,166
You seem to be fixated on mysticism.

322
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,833
Well, it's not normal.

323
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,083
 The corpse, the cut on the neck,

324
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,750
and that room.
We should follow every lead.

325
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,833
Don't casually mention things
like the world of mysticism

326
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,875
or magic.

327
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,916
Why?

328
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,708
It doesn't exist, that's why.

329
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,666
Nice.

330
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,500
-Good job.
-All right!

331
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,791
All right! Nice game.

332
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,375
Not bad, Terauchi.

333
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Thank you.

334
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,208
We'll kill those who bail.

335
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,583
Why is Hachi skipping practice?

336
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,833
He's probably struggling
from that incident.

337
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,833
Why is Hachi struggling?

338
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,916
He wasn't even friends with Hayato.

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
He has to pull himself together.

340
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,875
We're aiming to win the next tournament.

341
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,583
Okay, I'll tell him.

342
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,333
Jeez, I'm starving.

343
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,041
Do you have any snacks?

344
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,500
What's this?

345
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,916
Hey!

346
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,375
That's nothing.

347
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,291
I'll head home first, then.

348
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,291
Bye-bye! Adieu!

349
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,833
Something seems suspicious.

350
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,041
I'm home.

351
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,833
Welcome home.

352
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,166
Mom's at a class reunion.
Your dinner is in the fridge.

353
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,458
Where are you going?

354
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,750
Just to the gym.

355
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,125
The gym? At this hour?

356
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,250
Tanuki and I decided to work out together.

357
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,875
I see.

358
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:46,291
Do you know a kid named Hayato Ippongi?

359
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,541
What?

360
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,541
I think he's from your university.

361
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,041
Sorry, I don't really know.

362
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,958
Okay.

363
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,375
I gotta go.

364
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:07,958
Tadashi.

365
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,041
Never mind.

366
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,625
I got them!

367
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,333
Finally. Hurry up!

368
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,750
I used my points
so I got the offerings cheaper.

369
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,708
I got a roasted chicken
since I couldn't find

370
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,166
a freshly slaughtered one.

371
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,958
I told Izzy about this place.
She'll be here soon.

372
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,916
We're a good team, as expected.

373
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,625
Look at this.

374
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,916
Place them where the gravitational force
intensifies, like in the diagram.

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,083
Got it.

376
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,958
FOLLOWERS

377
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,375
TADASHI INUKAI

378
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,875
 Do you know a kid named Hayato Ippongi?

379
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,375
 Sorry, I don't really know.

380
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,791
Is this party
also part of the exorcism ritual?

381
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,875
It's for distracting her.

382
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,625
"I'm jere"?

383
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,041
She's here.

384
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,458
It's freezing.

385
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,291
All right. I'll attract her
to the center of this magic circle.

386
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,333
When I give the sign, read this spell.

387
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,250
Okay.

388
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,083
-Quick, hide!
-All right.

389
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,083
Hurry!

390
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,375
Let's begin the engagement ceremony.

391
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,208
Through this,
we will have a spiritual connection.

392
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:01,583
This? I also prepared
a party for the engagement.

393
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,875
A party is basically a way to celebrate.

394
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,500
Thank you.

395
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:11,333
I offer this dance to you.

396
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,958
To show my gratitude, I incorporated

397
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,208
the modern style
into the traditional dance.

398
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:57,500
With this, our bond is formally connected,

399
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,291
mind and body.

400
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,458
Yeah.

401
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,083
You don't like it?

402
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,125
No, not at all.

403
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,708
It was really great.

404
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,458
It's my turn next.

405
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,125
Have a seat.

406
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,458
Why do I smell incense?

407
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,875
It's to cover up the musty odor.

408
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,125
This place isn't cleaned regularly.

409
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,125
How about some wine?

410
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,375
I don't drink.

411
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,333
You're sweating.

412
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,166
What are you nervous about, Hachi?

413
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:10,958
Izzy.

414
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,041
Sorry.

415
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,625
Tanuki!

416
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,500
Return to the ancient world!

417
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,291
Return to the ancient world!

418
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,250
Is it because I didn't use
a freshly slaughtered chicken?

419
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,125
Tanuki!

420
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,166
It hurts.

421
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,000
You watch out! I have a weapon!

422
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,916
I have shadows.

423
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,583
I didn't mean to do that.

424
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,083
What's this?

425
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,750
Let me out!

426
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,250
Please! Let him out!

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,208
He ends here. I'll crush him to pieces.

428
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,208
Wait, Izzy!

429
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,208
We never intended to harm you.

430
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:16,000
We were going to use the exorcism spell
to send you to where you came from.

431
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,958
To the World of Nothing?

432
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,333
We are bound by an eternal bond.

433
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,875
Why can't you understand?

434
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,375
It seems sacrificing your friend
is the best way

435
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,750
to make you understand
the importance of our vow.

436
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,833
Okay!

437
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:40,708
I accept everything about us, the bond,
and all the magic!

438
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,666
I'll stop all of this.
No more exorcism spells.

439
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,708
So, please.

440
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:49,125
I promise you. Please spare Tanuki.

441
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,958
Don't kill my friend! Please.

442
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,583
You betraying me is unforgivable.

443
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,291
And you didn't even like my dance.

444
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,333
I liked it.

445
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,833
Your dance was... You know, it was cute.

446
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,041
You're lying!

447
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,791
You're just trying to appease me!

448
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,541
Until you realize your mistake,
I won't speak to you.

449
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,583
She's crazy.

450
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,041
I...

451
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,250
I think my girlfriend's mad at me.

452
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,125
There you are.

453
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,750
-That was delicious!
-Yeah.

454
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,291
I want to drink a bit more.

455
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,583
Sounds good!
