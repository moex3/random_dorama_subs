1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,291
Tenkai... I killed you back then.

2
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,625
You were banished from this world.

3
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,416
I will finish you once again.

4
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,666
Then I'll banish you for eternity.

5
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,166
What's going on?

6
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,416
My flowers!

7
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,458
This accursed place...

8
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,708
It's surprising it still exists.

9
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,916
This place is a testament to our resolve.

10
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,791
It's a perfect place to banish you.

11
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,833
It's clear that
you bonded with a foolish human.

12
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,750
How, in the shadows?

13
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,708
Tomori. It was a thoughtful gesture
from the Five Spears.

14
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,375
It has the Yokai power
seized from your brethren.

15
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,958
Can you hear it?

16
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:15,708
The pitiful cries of the decaying Yokai
as their power is drained away.

17
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,333
Good grief.

18
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Izzy. Welcome back.

19
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,708
Are you still mad?

20
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:04,458
About the whole "banishing you" thing.

21
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,791
Something stinks!

22
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,208
Sorry!

23
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,291
We are a couple, right?

24
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,750
How about we establish
some rules for our future

25
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,625
so that we can maintain
a good relationship?

26
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,208
Says the one who tried
to banish me with a spell.

27
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,000
Sorry.

28
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,791
You must be tired today.

29
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,166
I have to study for tomorrow's test,

30
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,958
so you can use the bed to rest.

31
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,875
Good night.

32
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,041
Come on, hitchhiking at this hour?

33
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,041
I need this vehicle.

34
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,208
What?

35
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,791
Oh, well.

36
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,250
I was just thinking
I could use someone to talk to.

37
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,125
Lucky for both of us.

38
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,500
Hop in.

39
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,208
Cool car, right?

40
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,833
-It's strange.
-So are you.

41
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,791
I've been traveling around in this car
for various adventures.

42
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,458
Are you a monk?

43
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:22,833
The last time I was called
to this world was in 1979.

44
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:30,166
Being a monk really means
being isolated from the world.

45
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
So, what were you doing
in a place like this?

46
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,458
My only goal

47
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,333
is to eliminate

48
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that wretched fool from this world.

49
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,166
Sounds tough.

50
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,583
Are you single?

51
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,666
Got any friends you can talk to?

52
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,041
All my friends are dead.

53
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:03,875
Well, cheer up.
Life has its ups and downs.

54
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,125
If you need a friend, I'm here.

55
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,250
Friend...

56
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:15,416
If you ever run into trouble,
I'll have your back, pal!

57
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,625
Not a bad idea.

58
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,041
Izzy.

59
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,791
Here.

60
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
-What's this?
-You have a test today.

61
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,333
Eat this and ace it.

62
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,166
Bed hair.

63
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
Stop.

64
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,958
You look sleepy. Are you all right?

65
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,708
Seems like he had a busy night.

66
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,708
What?

67
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,541
Check the sound when watching porn.

68
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,750
Language.

69
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,041
But...

70
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,583
 Do you know a kid named Hayato Ippongi?

71
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,875
Sorry, I don't really know.

72
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,500
TADASHI INUKAI

73
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,583
Shoot, I gotta get going.

74
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,041
I'll eat later. Thanks for the meal.

75
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,083
I hope she's not here.

76
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,166
Calm down and act normal.

77
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,375
What's the status?

78
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,541
I'm thinking of
finding a way to coexist with her.

79
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,625
A Yokai that decapitates people?

80
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,375
It might work if we find
some ground rules for us.

81
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,666
Are you serious?

82
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,291
I want to resolve this situation
without hurting anyone.

83
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
And that takes time, you know?

84
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,958
Hachi. By any chance, have you

85
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
seriously fallen in love with her?

86
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,750
-In love?
-Have you?

87
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,708
Have I...

88
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

89
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,125
Oh, my God.

90
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,875
You're completely into her.

91
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,291
Can you handle her?

92
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,208
It's okay. I'll make sure
she follows the rules.

93
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,583
Let's just focus on taking the exam
fair and square.

94
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,416
-All right!
-All right!

95
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,291
I have awakened.

96
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:11,916
Escaping from the deadly god Izanami,
I have returned to this world...

97
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,833
Wait.

98
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,708
You killed me.

99
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,625
And brought you back to life.

100
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,875
No. You stabbed me, and...

101
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,458
Then...

102
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,291
What is this?

103
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,375
You have become the living dead.
Just like me.

104
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,500
I don't want this!

105
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,166
Stop messing with me.

106
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,041
Bring me back to where I belong.

107
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,833
Your fate is now in my hands.

108
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,208
What do you want from me?

109
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
TO IZZY - HELP YOURSELF.

110
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,625
AND DON'T GET FOUND BY MY FAMILY!
HACHI

111
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,958
Completely flunked the course.

112
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,166
Same here.

113
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,166
Our grades keep dropping endlessly.

114
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,625
At this rate, we can't get a job anywhere.

115
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,833
Or worse, we might get killed by a Yokai.

116
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,541
Look.

117
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,083
Hey, Big Sweat... Like father, like son.

118
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,541
What do you mean?

119
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
Are you kidding me?

120
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,416
Because of your old man's
incompetence in the police,

121
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
Hayato's killer is still at large.

122
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,750
Well... I'm really sorry about
what happened to your cousin.

123
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,916
My condolences...

124
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
-Izzy.
-Let me go.

125
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,625
It hurts!

126
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,666
Izzy. It's okay now.

127
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Masato... I'm sorry for everything.

128
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:37,958
Shut up.

129
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,916
Someday I'll definitely settle the score.

130
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,708
So don't you run away!

131
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,958
It looks like that idiot
is the one running away.

132
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,916
Well, why are you here?

133
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,458
I came to thank you for the food.

134
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,291
The omelet?

135
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,041
I loved that.

136
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,916
Please, just disappear from our lives.

137
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:14,875
Do you want me to skewer your skull
and turn your skin inside out?

138
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,541
It's okay.

139
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,875
Izzy?

140
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,791
Are you all right?

141
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,000
Anyway, let's go.

142
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,583
Goodbye.

143
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,458
Forever.

144
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,291
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,208
Damn her sharp hearing.

146
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,125
Hey, it's Koki!

147
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,875
What are you doing?

148
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,416
You went missing,
and there's a big fuss about it.

149
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,541
Rumors say that you're involved

150
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,708
in some shady business online
and you're on the run.

151
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,333
Hey, that's creepy!

152
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,291
ROKUBANCHO UNIVERSITY STUDENT
MURDER CASE

153
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,875
VICTIM: HAYATO IPPONGI
CASE OVERVIEW

154
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,958
IPPONGI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

155
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,083
I called Ippongi Construction,
Hayato's father's company

156
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,875
five times to make an appointment,
but no response.

157
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,916
While waiting for a call back,

158
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,166
I've mastered the dance that's gone viral

159
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
on Instagram Stories lately.

160
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,000
If you're going to dance, do it at home.

161
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Isn't it odd, though?

162
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,333
His son's head was cut off,
which has gone missing,

163
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,666
yet he ignores calls from the police.

164
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,916
Ippongi Construction evolved

165
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,375
from a family of carpenters in Nara
about 500 years ago.

166
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,750
It's the largest in the industry,

167
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,083
with a total of 250,000 employees
including related companies.

168
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:36,500
Hayato's father, Takeru Ippongi,
is the president of this massive company.

169
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,125
Let's go to Ippongi.

170
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,541
Are we raiding them?

171
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,208
Don't you dare dance
in the president's office.

172
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,250
I'm back. Here.

173
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,583
Try this.

174
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,916
Did you get a headache?

175
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,583
It's cold, so eat slowly.

176
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,666
So, Izzy...

177
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,041
I've made notes in my Notes app
about our rules and agreements.

178
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,333
Rule one, about the house.

179
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,958
We need a place for you to live.

180
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,875
I live with you,
and all my belongings are there.

181
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,416
That's the problem.

182
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,125
Having weapons and a severed head
in my room is not good.

183
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,416
Don't worry.

184
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
I stored the weapons under the bed.

185
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,500
That's the worst!

186
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,208
Mothers always want to search
under their son's bed.

187
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,416
Besides, you want a space
for yourself, right?

188
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,333
Rule two, fit into this world.

189
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,916
You need to be less conspicuous.

190
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,458
Like your clothes.

191
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,250
Is my appearance a problem?

192
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,041
It's not a complaint,
but the whole vibe...

193
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,583
This is valuable armor made from
the skin of Uwabami serpent.

194
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,750
Is that popular in your world?

195
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,833
It fits in this world, too.

196
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,333
You're looking great. One more, please.

197
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,083
Okay, let's discuss the clothing later.

198
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,500
Next is the last rule.

199
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,458
The third rule is the most important.

200
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,541
Rule three, do not kill anyone.

201
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,083
No, that's necessary.

202
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,583
To kill people?

203
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,583
No matter the reason,
it's wrong to kill anyone.

204
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,666
Izzy?

205
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,541
Are you all right?

206
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,750
Are you in pain?

207
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,750
Is there any pure spring water somewhere?

208
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,291
Spring water?

209
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,291
Izzy? Izzy!

210
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,208
Good, you're awake.

211
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,583
Izzy, it's spring water.

212
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,708
Amazing.

213
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:57,500
This sacred spring holds mysterious power.

214
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,208
This place?

215
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,500
Where are we?

216
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,625
Behind the temple nearby.

217
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,375
Why did you bring me here?

218
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:10,708
When I was a kid,
my grandma brought me here.

219
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,416
It's the only place that comes to mind
for clean water.

220
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,666
It's strange.

221
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,916
You really understand me well.

222
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,208
Wow.

223
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,833
Beautiful.

224
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,208
Yeah.

225
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,666
Hey.

226
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,958
Why didn't you tell me about your injury?

227
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,375
Showing weakness would be the end.

228
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,833
We're lovers, aren't we?

229
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,416
I can't trust the human world.

230
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,541
Even if you can't trust the human world,

231
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,375
trust me.

232
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,541
IPPONGI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

233
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,875
Quit looking around.

234
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,750
It's my first time visiting
a billionaire or a conglomerate.

235
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,250
It's a self-indulgent show
of an inherited conglomerate.

236
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,208
You follow the trend, too?

237
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,916
We'd like to see Mr. Takeru Ippongi.

238
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,166
Sorry for the sudden visit.

239
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,333
I'm Detective Inukai
from the Investigation Division...

240
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,250
What do you see?

241
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,541
I would like to inquire
about your son, if I may.

242
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,583
A dolphin? Or maybe a raccoon?

243
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,083
Mr. Ippongi?

244
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,500
Sometimes you need
to change your perspective

245
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,458
to see things correctly.

246
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,375
What do you see?

247
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,583
-A dinosaur.
-Interesting.

248
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,708
So...

249
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,333
How can I help you?

250
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,750
I have some questions about your son,
Hayato Ippongi.

251
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,208
Do you know anybody
who might hold a grudge against him?

252
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:28,833
Everyone despises my son.

253
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,375
Do you understand the weight

254
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,333
of being chosen?

255
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,875
Everyone is

256
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,958
chosen for a role.

257
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,708
Fulfilling that role

258
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,125
can be very dangerous.

259
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,416
That's why

260
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,625
I didn't want to burden my son
with such a heavy responsibility.

261
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:08,958
What do you mean by "dangerous"?

262
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,208
Are you okay, sir?

263
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,083
I'm Sakon Renjo, the legal advisor.

264
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,208
Inukai.

265
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,291
The president has been sick
for several years.

266
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,291
On top of that,

267
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,791
he's suffering from mental illness
due to his son's situation.

268
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,458
Could you leave for today, please?

269
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,750
We'd like to ask him a bit more...

270
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,458
If you could send us a questionnaire,
we'll answer it.

271
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,416
By the way, is the chief doing well?

272
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,750
We were classmates in college.

273
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,208
Sorry for taking up your time.

274
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:04,791
Goodbye.

275
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,583
One more question.

276
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,125
Do you know a college student
named Kouki Shikazono?

277
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,875
I don't know.

278
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,958
He was interning here.

279
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,833
Do you know if there was any interaction
between him and Hayato?

280
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,958
Who knows? He was just an intern.

281
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,708
If we find out something,
we'll let you know.

282
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,375
Please do.

283
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,416
Wait.

284
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,666
What does this look like to you?

285
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,208
It depicts an animal
that will eventually disappear.

286
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,458
Human beings.

287
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,791
That was crazy.

288
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,208
You got a leaf.

289
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,791
You got one, too, Hachi.

290
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,791
Thanks.

291
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You scared me!

292
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,291
Sorry to disturb you.

293
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, no, we were just taking a walk.

294
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,833
Haven't you forgotten something?

295
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I was young once, too.

296
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,583
I'm sorry. Please excuse us.

297
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:15,791
Our waterfall is said to bring good luck.

298
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,916
You seem to have found out
about this special power.

299
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,625
This place is special.
The spring, fireflies,

300
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,500
and the intimacy with Hachi.

301
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,583
I'm sorry. We're really going home now.

302
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,166
We are surrounded by a mysterious power.

303
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,833
You could say
this whole town is built on magic.

304
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,750
Come back anytime.

305
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,416
I'm always here.

306
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,916
Strange guy.

307
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,500
Super awkward.

308
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:12,541
Hachi, do you remember rule one?

309
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,375
What?

310
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,958
Well, it seems like
you won't be found here, at least.

311
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,250
If you need anything else, let me know.

312
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,541
I sent you my Amazon wish list.

313
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,208
A massage chair?

314
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,666
It's apparently a magical chair
that can relieve fatigue.

315
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,916
I desire it.

316
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,125
You've really mastered this thing.

317
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:12,000
Izzy, about rule three...

318
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,333
It's not easy.

319
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,291
Why?

320
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,125
It's not that difficult
to not kill people.

321
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,083
I don't kill people every day.

322
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,708
If there's a reason, tell me.

323
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:00,666
 Long ago, humans and Yokai
 respected and supported each other,

324
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,833
 leading peaceful lives,

325
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,791
 until humans betrayed us.

326
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,416
 The war began,

327
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,250
 and humans tried to eliminate us.

328
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,666
 Our brethren were killed one by one.

329
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,000
 My mother as well.

330
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:23,000
 Eventually, five powerful clans united,

331
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,916
 burying Yokai in the world
 between the afterlife

332
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,041
 and this world, the World of Nothing.

333
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,916
 We were exiled to the timeless darkness.

334
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:38,125
 I spent 500 years there.

335
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,958
 Each of the five powerful clans

336
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,333
 has a guardian who sets up a barrier.

337
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:48,791
 I must find and bury the guardians

338
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,750
 and unravel the curses.

339
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:17,250
You're the one who rescued me
from the inferno, Hachi.

340
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,583
I must lift the seal
for the sake of my comrades.

341
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,833
In other words, rule three is the reason
you exist in this world, right?

342
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,750
Can't we resolve this by talking?

343
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,291
To release my comrades,

344
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,666
I need the heads of
the remaining four Guardians.

345
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,083
Looking at it positively,

346
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,875
two out of the three rules
are agreed upon.

347
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,833
That's progress, isn't it?

348
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,041
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

349
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,791
SAKON RENJO
ATTORNEY

350
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:01,916
Something stinks.

351
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,333
Man, the police have no manners.

352
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:35,083
Now, what should I do?
