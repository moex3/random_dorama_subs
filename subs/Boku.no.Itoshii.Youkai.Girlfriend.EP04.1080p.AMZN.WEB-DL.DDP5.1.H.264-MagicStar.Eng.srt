1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:16,250
Disgusting. This place still smells
like piss and crap.

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,375
Shall I take your jacket?

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,250
What have you done?

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,833
Because you stole the forbidden book...

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,750
-That's because you...
-Shut up.

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,791
Hey, why is he here?

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,583
He's one of us now.

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,500
Store it here for now.

9
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,291
Don't you have to return it
to the Five Spears?

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,125
This is the most secure place.

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,000
Because you...

12
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,750
By the way, have you taken care
of that Yokai? What's taking so long?

13
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,125
Leave it to me.

14
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:10,416
The police are snooping around now.
They're looking for him, too.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,958
Failures are unacceptable.

16
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,708
It's all part of the plan.

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,166
The plan?

18
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,625
This is the plan!

19
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,416
I don't have time for this.

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,583
Anyway, just get rid of that Yokai.

21
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,250
Can I eat his brain?

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,708
Our plan takes priority.

23
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,250
Izzy?

24
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,083
Good morning.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,041
It's a success.

26
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,875
Izzy, what's this?

27
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,416
It's more secure now.

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
Can you let me down?

29
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,333
Blood is rushing to my head.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,583
This is something else.

31
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,333
To find the remaining four heads,

32
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,166
I need this Dragon's Magatama.

33
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,708
What is that?

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,916
This magatama has the power to identify

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,833
the Guardians of the seal
that trap us Yokai.

36
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,750
I checked for the magatama's location.
It's here.

37
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,166
Wait. That's the exhibition room
at my university.

38
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:43,958
Is that true?

39
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,958
What is it doing there?

40
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,375
Take me there.

41
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,625
Hey, what do you plan to do
once you find that magatama?

42
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll find the Guardians
and collect the remaining heads.

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,666
That's not good. Can't you talk it over?

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,958
There you go again.

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,708
Times are different now.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,208
I get that these Guardians'
ancestors are your enemies,

47
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,416
and you detest them,

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,625
but if my great-great grandfather
did something bad, would you kill me?

49
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,125
With no hesitation.

50
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,250
-I can't help you.
-Why not?

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,250
You'd help your friends, but not me?

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,875
I don't want you to kill anybody.

53
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,166
This is pointless.

54
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,041
Wait, Izzy!

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,375
You won't help me.

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,708
No. There must be another way.

57
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,541
-Like another spell.
-It doesn't exist.

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,875
I've had enough of this. I'll go alone.

59
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,708
Wait!

60
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,750
Rule number three. Don't kill anyone.

61
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,666
OFFERING TO THE GODS

62
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,125
IPPONGI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

63
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,208
 Sakon Renjo. He's a legal advisor
 for Ippongi Construction,

64
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,333
 and has other extensive clientele.

65
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,291
WITNESS, SAKON RENJO

66
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,916
He also handles Mikurube Shipping
and Yomoda Brewery.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,333
These are huge corporations.
It's kind of annoying.

68
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,541
Would you like one?

69
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,458
Do you prefer Chocorooms?

70
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,583
By the way,
what's with that baseball mitt?

71
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought I might play catch with my son.
It's been awhile.

72
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,583
Your son is a university student, right?

73
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,333
It's not weird at all.

74
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,416
You two are close.

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,625
It's the opposite.

76
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,208
I grew up without a father.

77
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,833
It's hard for me to get close to my son.

78
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,250
He'll see that you want to do
something together.

79
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,041
I mean,
my family wasn't that close, either,

80
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,458
but we all followed
Madam Yoshiko's oracle.

81
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,666
Madam Yoshiko?

82
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,125
Don't you know
the charismatic fortune-teller?

83
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,208
Our subject.

84
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,500
Are you sure that using
this personal computer thing

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:02,166
is more reliable than using a spell?

86
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,458
It's faster online.

87
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:11,291
And it's more wicked!

88
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,083
I thought you'd be back.

89
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,916
I just wanted a quiet place to think.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,833
This is a special place.

91
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:47,583
Actually, what you said has been
on my mind this whole time.

92
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,375
It's about the special powers.

93
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,041
Yes, powers are constantly around us,

94
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,458
just like love and sex.

95
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,750
I believe in special powers.

96
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,625
But it's so absurd...

97
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,625
I don't entirely understand.
Google and books were no help.

98
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,708
I don't know what to do.

99
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,791
There's a limit to what we can learn
from books and the Internet.

100
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,833
There's only one thing I want to say.

101
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,500
Power is something
that's constantly changing.

102
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,833
On the contrary, the world

103
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,625
is able to change the power.

104
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:33,291
Let's say you're caught in a cursed bond.

105
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,416
Is it possible to change that?

106
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,875
Yes.

107
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:46,666
However, empathy with one another
is necessary to change that bond.

108
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,333
You look at things from
the other person's perspective.

109
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,333
How can you change the way things are?

110
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,291
Think about that.

111
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,041
HEADQUARTERS FOR THE ERADICATION
OF ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS

112
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,708
This is a report on Sakon's actions.

113
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,541
 He had breakfast with the CEO
 of Mikurube Shipping.

114
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,875
 Then he went to work at
 Ippongi Construction.

115
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,250
 Midday, he visited Yomoda Sake Brewery,
 then to Ippongi Construction.

116
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,416
 At night, he stopped by Nijoji Temple
 and went home.

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,750
It's the same every day.
It's Sakon's routine.

118
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,750
He seems like a hard-working attorney.

119
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,791
Oh, but last night,
the investigator reported

120
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,916
that he couldn't confirm Sakon
leaving the temple.

121
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,708
What does that mean?

122
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,541
Who knows? Maybe a waterfall training.

123
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,625
Waterfall training?

124
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,916
What are you saying?

125
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,583
YOMODA SAKE BREWERY

126
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,166
MIKURUBE SHIPPING COMPANY

127
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,875
NIJOJI TEMPLE

128
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,166
Mitsuki? Mitsuki.

129
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,833
Are you here? Mitsuki...

130
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,708
Where did she go?

131
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
Mitsuki!

132
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,791
Mitsuki?

133
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,500
Mitsuki.

134
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
Ms. Sawada.

135
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,166
-Mitsuki?
-Yes, it's me.

136
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,166
You're talking!

137
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
I am your cat.

138
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,125
Your ancient folklore knowledge
is excellent.

139
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,416
That's why I decided to reveal
my true self to you.

140
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,166
Are you really Mitsuki?

141
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,083
I am, meow.

142
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,166
I need your help, meow.

143
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,416
Where is the Dragon's Magatama, meow?

144
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,916
I wanted to ask you something, too.

145
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,333
Do you like the food I always give you?

146
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you like? Canned food or dry food?

147
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,833
Stupid.

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,583
I'll ask again.
Where's the Dragon's Magatama?

149
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,958
Are you really Mitsuki?

150
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,708
Where is the Dragon's Magatama?

151
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,333
Who are you?

152
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,958
Answer me!

153
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:25,583
That magatama was loaned to us
for an exhibit from an anonymous owner.

154
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,416
It's been returned already!

155
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,208
I don't know where it is now.

156
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,250
Could it be... A Yokai?

157
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,500
Does they really exist?

158
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,291
You good-for-nothing!

159
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,083
I'll show you a real Yokai.

160
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,083
You scared me. Don't do that.

161
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,458
-Hachi, help me.
-What?

162
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,875
The magatama was moved.
I need to locate it.

163
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,625
ANCIENT MAGIC EXHIBITION

164
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,666
"Anonymous." If the owner is anonymous,

165
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,458
it might be hard to track it unless
we hack into the school's server.

166
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,666
Do that "hack" thing, then.

167
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,041
You can't hack that easily!

168
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,875
I kept your promise
and didn't kill anyone.

169
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,750
It would have been so much easier to kill.

170
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,458
You followed the rule.

171
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,666
What's so funny?

172
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,791
Nothing.

173
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,791
Oh! I know someone who's good at hacking!

174
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,041
Listen up!

175
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:41,041
The greatest competition in e-sports,
E LEGENDS,

176
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,458
is being held at our home.

177
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,916
It's a great opportunity.

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,333
Let's utilize this to get our first win.

179
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,625
That's when... You're late!

180
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,291
Who is she?

181
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,625
This is Izzy. She's my girlfriend.

182
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,250
She's no balding old man.

183
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,833
Blink twice
if you didn't come of your own free will.

184
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,333
Is it okay to kill him?

185
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,875
Yes.

186
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
No! Don't!

187
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey, Hachi!

188
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,875
You are breaking the rules of
Team Under Dogs.

189
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,625
You have rules here, too?

190
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,375
People like rules.

191
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,291
Don't forget the team rule.
The team takes priority at all times!

192
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,958
Sex is prohibited.
Maintain your energy as a man.

193
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,416
We are boxers in a gaming world.

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,250
Terauchi, we don't need that explanation.

195
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,500
You know they aren't in a relationship...

196
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:48,750
Hachi, why did you bring a girlfriend
to this sacred place?

197
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,875
We came to see Ms. Hikari.

198
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,333
Who, me?

199
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,208
We need your help with something.

200
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,541
-Izzy, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

201
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,791
I'm not here. I don't know anything.

202
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,333
Whatever. Focus.

203
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll allow you to watch today.

204
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,875
But do not interfere from now on.

205
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,458
No distracting cosplay costumes, either.

206
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,666
-This is anaconda...
-No talking!

207
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,500
Awesome!

208
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,250
Hey, where did you buy it?

209
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,875
Focus! We'll start the match.

210
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,458
Hachi!

211
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,541
Wait here.

212
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,375
Let's go forward.

213
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,375
Oh, they're coming from the back.

214
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,166
Go! Let's go!

215
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,166
-Hachi, handle it.
-Okay, count on it.

216
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,666
-Okay, nice.
-I'll aim for the foot.

217
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,583
-Hikari, heal us!
-You got it.

218
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,666
Show boobs, or get lost

219
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,791
Hikari? Healing! Healing!

220
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,250
-I'm sorry. Hold on.
-Healing!

221
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,833
Women can't play games

222
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,083
-Die!
-Hey!

223
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,750
I'm not talking to you!
There's a troll on the field.

224
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,208
Cut the crap! You shit.

225
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,041
What the hell?

226
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,416
What is this?

227
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,833
I don't know, but I suddenly got a chat
degrading woman. What is this?

228
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,083
-Didn't you turn it off?
-I did!

229
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
You probably offended someone.

230
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,458
You used femininity to earn.

231
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,541
Hey, you went too far!
Apologize to Hikari.

232
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,041
My bad. I went too far.

233
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,166
Our API is hacked.

234
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,958
All the servers are locked.

235
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,125
-What?
-Let me see.

236
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,875
What the hell is this?

237
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,000
Those are weird.

238
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,791
Sanskrit characters. What does it say?

239
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,708
It's a trap.

240
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,416
Do you get it?

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,541
"Seek me out if you want it back."

242
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,291
I see.

243
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,250
They got some guts challenging me
to a hacking contest.

244
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,458
I'll locate and kill them!

245
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,791
I'll help you.

246
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,708
Shall I flay them and remove their guts?

247
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
That's super hardcore!

248
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,833
I like you!

249
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:10,750
Starting today,

250
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,250
you are our team cheerleader!

251
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,458
I located it!

252
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,333
They're at this university's library.

253
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,666
Yeah!

254
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,791
Now you know! Go get them, everyone!

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,166
The coordinates are in here.

256
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,166
Now, who did it?

257
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,125
We'll just go threatening everyone
one by one.

258
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
What's going on here?

259
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,958
We planned to return her
to her original world,

260
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,041
but you're helping her out now.

261
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,250
You're seriously in deep shit.

262
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,708
How far is this story going to go?

263
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,958
I seriously can't handle it anymore.

264
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,916
Are you interfering again?

265
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,375
Tanuki is just nervous.

266
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,000
Nervous?

267
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,666
Why? Are you scheming something again?

268
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
No! He's not used to girls.

269
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,083
Calm down.

270
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,208
Stop that.

271
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,708
You may have a girl, but don't think
your social status is higher.

272
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,833
I might have it!

273
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,458
I followed the IP address.
It's coming from the basement.

274
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,583
This way.

275
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,500
Inukai.

276
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,666
Hello.

277
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,166
-More research?
-Oh, well...

278
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,708
We're eagerly continuing our research
about that ritual.

279
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,833
A ritual?

280
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,791
Could you tell us
about that ritual again sometime?

281
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,291
What is it about?

282
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,875
It's nothing.

283
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,750
Izzy, let me introduce you to her.
This is Arisa. She's my girlfriend.

284
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,750
Hello.

285
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,041
That's a wonderful retro outfit.

286
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,166
She's a cosplayer.

287
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:01,875
I'm very curious
about Inukai's girlfriend.

288
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,041
I'm sorry. You have such beautiful hair.

289
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,833
Your hair looks like
it would make a great brush.

290
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,041
What?

291
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,416
Arisa, we're in a rush.
We'll see you later!

292
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,916
Is anybody here?

293
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,666
This way.

294
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,791
What? It's a dead end.

295
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,708
But it looks like it's ahead of here.

296
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,666
Look at that symbol!

297
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,541
-What? Cut the crap!
-Hold it.

298
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,208
-Wow.
-This is no joke.

299
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,125
What is this place?

300
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,125
Is it okay to come in here?

301
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,333
This is truly horrific.

302
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,375
You go first. Are you scared?

303
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,458
No, it's always ladies first
as per my grandpa's will.

304
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,625
Whatever.

305
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,833
Stop that!

306
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,750
What is this?

307
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,750
Hey, how far does it go?

308
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,833
Wait, what is that sound?

309
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,708
You stay here.

310
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,583
Did you do that, Izzy?

311
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,083
I sense strong demon powers ahead.

312
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,416
There is no need to endanger your friends.

313
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,875
Thank you. Actually, I want to leave, too.

314
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,750
You're so naive, Hachi. I told you.

315
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,041
What happens to me will affect you, too.
Did you forget that?

316
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,791
To be honest, I still don't get it.

317
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,916
Who's there?

318
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,416
Hello.

319
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,875
Kouki Shikazono?

320
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,875
Princess Izuna-imiki!

321
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,541
The one who destroys the world.

322
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,541
You came to this world.

323
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
Who is he?

324
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,958
He's a student here. He's been missing.

325
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,166
Hey, everyone is worried about you.

326
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:06,291
For the longest time,

327
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:10,791
I've been trying to summon Ms. Izuna.

328
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:17,375
But why you?

329
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,375
Are you a zombie now?

330
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,166
I'm not a zombie!

331
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm just a corpse!

332
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,958
He's been brought back from death.

333
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,541
You can't reason with him.

334
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,958
We'll look for the one controlling him.

335
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,333
Cursed stones are in place now.

336
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You can't go through the shadows anymore.

337
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,791
You and I

338
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,875
were supposed to be together...

339
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,208
-Let's hurry on.
-Yes.

340
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,000
So it's you.

341
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,833
I'll beat you out of this place!

342
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,541
You're the one that's going to die!

343
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:42,208
So you're the fool that had sex with her.

344
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,083
-That's not helping!
-I'm sorry!

345
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,416
I hold no personal grudge.

346
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,791
Why, you...

347
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,625
This place has a barrier
and we can't escape into the shadow.

348
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,750
-We'll retreat.
-Yes.

349
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,916
Why, you...

350
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:17,958
This way!

351
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,583
Where is this? A cemetery?

352
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:47,916
Izzy!

353
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,750
Here you go.

354
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,791
Who was that?

355
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,166
Tenkai.

356
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,458
He broke the rules of life
and became a living corpse.

357
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,958
He used to be a samurai
who served the Five Spears.

358
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:29,083
I assume he's serving them again.

359
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,708
Do you mean he died
and came back to life again?

360
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,583
Seriously? Our situation got worse!

361
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,125
The Five Spears will pursue me until
they kill me.

362
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:46,333
So it's either you kill them
or they kill you?

363
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,250
That's not all.

364
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:53,708
They know about our bond now.

365
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:59,958
When one of the pair dies,
the other one dies as well.

366
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,458
Is that why he attacked me?

367
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,041
I should have predicted this.

368
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,916
Your friends were almost killed, too.

369
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,583
But you let Tanuki and Hikari escape
before that happened.

370
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,666
Izzy, I just learned this recently,

371
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,875
but the world is a lot more
complicated than I thought.

372
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,916
Everything can be changed.

373
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,500
I'll help you look for
the Dragon's Magatama.

374
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,083
You are just too soft.

375
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,125
But I'll think of a way

376
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,291
so you don't have to kill anybody anymore.

377
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,833
I'll come up with something.

378
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,666
What's at this temple?

379
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,041
Just to make sure.

380
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,958
Cemeteries are exciting at night.
Something might appear.

381
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,041
Something appeared!

382
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,833
Captain! Wait for me!

383
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,291
What is it?

384
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,666
I'm late.

385
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:14,250
Sakon, you must have a good reason
to be late.

386
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,750
The police are investigating
that incident.

387
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,791
They're on to me.
It took me awhile to lose their trail.

388
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:24,041
Enough with your excuses. Get started.

389
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,625
That Yokai is still acting as she pleases.

390
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,916
But there's no need to worry.

391
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,458
Our emissary, Tenkai, is on the move.

392
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,208
"Our"?

393
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:43,375
Sakon, you're our emissary, too.

394
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,000
My apologies.

395
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,375
She can come to my house if she wants.

396
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,791
I'll teach that Yokai woman a lesson!

397
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:57,000
Sakon, what if Tenkai fails?

398
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,375
First of all, who summoned a Yokai?

399
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,166
The stolen forbidden book
hasn't been found yet.

400
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,333
We are diligently searching for it.

401
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,583
That's why Hayato died.

402
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,083
That's why I opposed it.

403
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,041
But you can't serve as a Guardian
with your body.

404
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:25,583
Hayato was my only son.

405
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,625
Everyone, now is the time to unite.

406
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:51,000
For several thousand years,
our five families

407
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,000
transformed barbaric Yokai magic

408
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,041
into useful forms to make a fortune.

409
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,875
We won't lose it.

410
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,375
Isn't that right, Ninomiya?

411
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:18,250
Yes, you're exactly right, chairperson.
