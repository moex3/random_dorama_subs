1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,625
Your back is safe.

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,875
What is this place?

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,583
It's not a subway,

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,083
not a sewer...

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,666
It kind of has the vibe
of Torneko's dungeon.

6
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,250
Who's there?

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,458
Freeze!

8
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,708
What was that?

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,833
Sir!

10
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,291
It's Koki Shikazono, who went missing.

11
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:14,958
Mother.

12
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,708
I am still unable

13
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,791
to free my brethren
trapped in the World of Nothing.

14
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,500
 I'll think of something,

15
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,708
A way for you
to not have to kill anyone anymore.

16
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,833
I promise you.

17
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,333
It's all because of
this human named Hachi.

18
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,583
Perhaps his kindness

19
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,375
has disturbed my heart.

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:01,541
Mother, please lend me your strength.

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,000
Please give me a sign.

22
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,291
Welcome back. Hope you don't mind me here.

23
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,458
Guess what I'm doing?

24
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:45,208
I might be able to find the magatama
you're looking for.

25
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,666
I'm trying the method
I learned from Hikari.

26
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,791
I'm breaking into
my university's email server

27
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,041
and trying to find out about
the magatama's owner through their IP.

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,666
I see.

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,291
What's wrong?

30
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
I feel stuck.

31
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,708
Enemy encounters keep increasing.

32
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,083
But if you find the magatama,
you can release your brethren, right?

33
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,750
Why are you doing so much for me?

34
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,000
I told you, we'll find a way not to kill.

35
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,458
And I don't want to be
killed by that zombie.

36
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,291
More than anything,
I don't want to see your sad face.

37
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,958
Why do you have
such a scary look on your face?

38
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,500
It's Hachi.

39
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,708
He hasn't contacted me
since we parted ways in that underpass.

40
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,708
This has never happened before.

41
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,750
I talked to him recently.

42
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,666
He wanted to know how to hack.

43
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,583
-You did?
-Yeah.

44
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,750
What the heck?

45
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,708
Damn him.

46
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,291
It's Benitaro.

47
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,416
I have to go.

48
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,375
I've got to open Hachi's eyes.

49
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,250
-Hey! Why did you ignore my call?
-You ignored it!

50
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,833
I'm busy now!

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,291
Why did I get yelled at?

52
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,958
PROFESSOR NATSUKO SAWADA

53
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:48,958
Excuse me.

54
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,166
There's something I wanted to ask you.

55
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,000
What's this?

56
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,083
What are you doing?

57
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,875
No, it wasn't me.

58
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,833
So, to summarize,

59
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:22,875
one, you found a mysterious post
by Koki Shikazono.

60
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,875
Two, Koki Shikazono is still missing.

61
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,708
Three, you accidentally summoned
a Yokai named Izzy.

62
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,708
Why do I have to tidy up?

63
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,541
Because you created this situation
by summoning the Yokai.

64
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,000
No, Hachi summoned Izzy.

65
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,750
Wait, so you believe what I said?

66
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,041
So, is this also Izzy's doing?

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,583
There's still Yokai energy
remaining in this room.

68
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,125
How do you know that?

69
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,416
Professor Sawada is no longer
coming to the university.

70
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Was she taken out by Izzy?

71
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,416
I received an email from her this morning.

72
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,916
"I seem to have unintentionally entered
a world I shouldn't have.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,333
"I will spend my remaining days
quietly with Mitsuki.

74
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,000
"Please don't look for me."

75
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,333
I'm glad she's safe.

76
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,875
It's not good!

77
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,541
The Yokai shattered her mind.

78
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,708
But at least she's alive.

79
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
Hayato was...

80
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,458
What?

81
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,166
Was Izzy the one who killed Hayato?

82
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,833
It's over! I have to go to the police!

83
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,625
You can't. This is a problem that goes
beyond human understanding.

84
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,500
We need someone
with special powers to deal with it.

85
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,416
What do you mean by special powers?

86
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:01,916
Aero.

87
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,833
Not good at all.

88
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,291
-Yokai!
-I'm not.

89
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,250
Then, what?

90
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,458
You're so loud.

91
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,291
If Yokai can use sorcery,

92
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,375
it's not strange that there are humans
with special powers.

93
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,083
I come from such a family.

94
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,833
I'm still in training, though.

95
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,125
Here. It's a cola float.

96
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,750
Because you seem down.

97
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Even while I'm spacing out like this,

98
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,083
my brethren are suffering
in the World of Nothing.

99
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,333
It's okay to have moments
where you forget your mission.

100
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,583
Fine.

101
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,041
I think I'll be able to find
the owner of the magatama.

102
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,541
I'm also analyzing it. This...

103
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,041
No way!

104
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,875
-Misa!
-Tadashi.

105
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,416
Mom.

106
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,125
Who is she?

107
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,958
She's Izzy.

108
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,333
Izzy.

109
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,541
My girlfriend!

110
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,208
Wow.

111
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,416
Madam, Ms. Misa.
It's an honor to meet you.

112
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,791
Hello.

113
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,958
He didn't tell us anything.

114
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,166
Ms. Izzy, was it?

115
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,208
I see. Nice to meet you.

116
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,208
I'm Tadashi's mother.
Thank you for looking after him.

117
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,208
Are you serious?
What's good about this dork?

118
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,375
Dork?

119
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,000
Actually, she also seems
eccentric and crazy.

120
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,333
-Hey.
-What's this?

121
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,791
-What's this?
-Okay.

122
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,583
Careful!

123
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,000
Anyways, why are you here?

124
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,166
We're preparing for
today's party, of course.

125
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,916
Don't tell me you forgot.

126
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,666
Of course not.

127
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,125
Hey, let's invite Ms. Izzy
to the party, too!

128
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,166
-Hey!
-Yes!

129
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,333
"Party"?

130
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,875
Today is Dad's birthday,
and we're going to celebrate.

131
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,291
I shall join you.

132
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,791
Please do.

133
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,708
You know, a lot of his friends
are gathering for a surprise party.

134
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,750
I sent an email to Tanuki as well.

135
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,375
It's going to be lively.

136
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,208
That's not possible.
Izzy has things to do. Right?

137
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,250
Let's go.

138
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,750
See you later.

139
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,958
You're going?

140
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,875
Don't forget to meet us
at 6:00 at Minatoya.

141
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,666
Her outfit is so unique.

142
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:06,333
I feel like I've seen her
somewhere, though.

143
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,500
There's no way Hachi can change Izzy.

144
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,791
You can't change
the personality of a killer.

145
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,041
I told Hachi that it's absolutely
impossible. What do you think?

146
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,458
Let's calm down a bit.

147
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,916
So, we must find a way
to send Izzy back to her world, right?

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,875
Exactly. That's what I thought of
asking Professor Sawada.

149
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,875
There might be some useful books
in the library's archives.

150
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,791
What happened?

151
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,291
Hey.

152
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,583
Sir.

153
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,041
We've expanded the search area,
but no sign of the suspicious man.

154
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,500
The suspect is armed.
Find them at all costs.

155
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,500
Yes, sir. Let's go.

156
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,708
I still can't get a hold of Sakon Renjo.

157
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,208
We followed Sakon
and discovered the underpass.

158
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,833
We found the body of Koki Shikazono,

159
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,208
and we were attacked by a suspicious man.

160
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,041
And now, we can't reach Sakon.

161
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,583
We won't let him get away this time.

162
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,666
I'll keep calling until he picks up.

163
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,208
I'll send him texts, too.

164
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,208
Where are you? Plz call.
Plz pick up.

165
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,125
Plz reply! Quick chat!
2 mins, or even 1.

166
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,666
Plz reply or call back!
30 seconds?

167
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:30,083
The temple and the university
are connected by such underpass...

168
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,500
What's that?

169
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,666
I don't know.

170
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,458
But keep it.

171
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,291
Sir, your phone has been
ringing like crazy.

172
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,250
Yeah. I have something scheduled.

173
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,416
What is it? Spit it out.

174
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,291
It's actually my birthday today.

175
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,791
It's your birthday?

176
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,041
Why didn't you say so earlier!

177
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,666
If you don't go, it'll be a family crisis!

178
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,375
Can I take a short break?

179
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,583
Leave things to me and enjoy your time.

180
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,250
Stop it.

181
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:42,958
MINATOYA

182
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,125
 You've reached a Yokai
 from an otherworldly place.

183
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,583
 Leave a message.

184
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,708
I'm sorry for not inviting you
to the party.

185
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,875
My dad is a cop, so it'll be awkward.

186
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,416
I promise I'll make it up to you.

187
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,666
-No need for that.
-What?

188
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,208
Izzy!

189
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,416
I came to see your father.

190
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,625
But I told you.
My dad takes everything seriously,

191
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,750
and he'll be shocked
if he saw your outfit.

192
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,375
How about this?

193
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,333
-Is it strange?
-Not at all.

194
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,791
Let's go, then.

195
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,541
Wait! Just promise me one thing.

196
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,208
Keep the conversation light.
No murder or severed heads.

197
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,125
And don't give unnecessary details.

198
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,833
If you don't understand,
just say, "Wow, that's amazing!"

199
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,083
And if you're in trouble, signal me.

200
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,375
You might've seen before.
It's the "help" sign I use with Tanuki.

201
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,875
Try it.

202
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,166
Let's keep a low profile, then.

203
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
-What?
-Oh.

204
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,791
Sorry, Mom. It's us.

205
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,666
Sorry, everyone. It was my son.

206
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,583
Please go back to your positions.

207
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,666
What were you doing? He'll be here soon.

208
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,583
Ms. Izzy. Nice dress.

209
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,833
You look nice too, ma'am.

210
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,416
Thank you. It's been a while
since I wore these things.

211
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,333
No one complimented me, so thank you.

212
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
Izzy, you're super cute!

213
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,750
Hachi's father's birthday party is here,

214
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,041
so if Izzy is with Hachi,
she should be here.

215
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,958
-Be cautious with Izzy.
-Right.

216
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,958
Act as naturally as possible.

217
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,250
This is a mission to investigate
Izzy's behavior.

218
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,041
I'm in charge of Hachi
and I'll leave Izzy to you.

219
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't want to pee in this outfit.

220
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,208
Sorry, everyone. Another false alarm.

221
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,250
Could you go back to your places?

222
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,625
-Thanks for coming, Tanuki.
-Yes.

223
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,875
And this is?

224
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,458
This is Arisa, she's a senior
from my university.

225
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,166
Sorry for coming uninvited.

226
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,166
Not at all. The more the merrier.

227
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,083
Please come in.

228
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,708
Why are you two here?

229
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,375
Well, you know.

230
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,708
We can't just let your dad's birthday
go unnoticed, right?

231
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,583
You sound like you're hiding something.

232
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,333
Are you two...

233
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,250
-Well, yeah.
-No.

234
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,250
No, we aren't.

235
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
No way! Awesome!

236
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,166
What skincare products do you use?

237
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750
Skincare. Hello?

238
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,750
Excuse me.

239
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,083
-Wow, amazing.
-Your lips are so plump.

240
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
-What's this about?
-Nothing.

241
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,166
Are you all right?

242
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,708
You saved me.

243
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,458
Misa is hard to understand.

244
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,958
High school girls are all like that.

245
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,666
What's with that outfit?

246
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,625
What do you mean?

247
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,416
Oh, no, nothing. You just look beautiful.

248
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,708
Hachi, come with me.

249
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,250
Hey! Stop it.

250
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,916
You came to save me?

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,583
Izzy is a monster.

252
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,083
A body was found in that underpass.

253
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,625
That body is Koki Shikazono.

254
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,708
So, he was already a zombie
and Izzy just re-killed him.

255
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,500
"Just re-killed him"?
Do you know what you're saying?

256
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,791
I can't take it anymore.

257
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm so scared I might pee myself.

258
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,333
She saved me.

259
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,958
Besides, killing a zombie is completely
different from killing a person.

260
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,583
That wasn't murder.

261
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,875
What's with that
philosophical anime excuse?

262
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,083
You're going insane.

263
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,291
This is bona fide murder!

264
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
Hush!

265
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,583
Sorry, wrong person! Please go back!

266
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,291
Don't do it again, Tadashi.

267
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,125
-Come on.
-Hurry!

268
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,375
-Quick!
-Jeez.

269
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,500
-Hurry!
-What?

270
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,541
Everyone.

271
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,541
No way.

272
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,500
He's here.

273
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:58,458
Do you know how long
it took me to prepare all this?

274
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm sorry I ruined the surprise.

275
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,291
Cheers!

276
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,916
But I'm glad
everyone is here to celebrate.

277
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,083
-Excuse me.
-What?

278
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,375
Izzy, I found out who owns the magatama.

279
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,875
Hikari helped me hack the mail server.

280
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,750
I'll send you the owner's address.

281
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,958
Tadashi?

282
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,083
It might be a good opportunity
to introduce her to your father.

283
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,833
This is Izzy, Tadashi's girlfriend.

284
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,541
Girlfriend?

285
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,625
Today is a most auspicious occasion
for celebration, sir.

286
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,250
She's quite traditional.

287
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,166
Would you mind helping
with cutting the cake, Izzy?

288
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,583
Cutting is my specialty.

289
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,916
-You're 50...
-Your girlfriend...

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
-Fifty is...
-She's nervous...

291
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,208
Dad...

292
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,500
Happy birthday.

293
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,541
Thanks.

294
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,541
So, that's your girlfriend.

295
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,708
Show me my friend.

296
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,666
Hey.

297
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,291
I'm busy. Come back later.

298
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,000
Your search should lead you
to the police station.

299
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,708
Why'd you leave that corpse alone?
And the underpass?

300
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,833
Keep it down.
The way to here has been sealed.

301
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,000
Humans cannot see it.

302
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,041
The police are after me. Listen.

303
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,125
Don't get involved
with that corpse anymore.

304
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,166
I don't want any more trouble. Got it?

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,500
Now, everyone,
it's time for the biggest show of the day.

306
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,791
Lights!

307
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,583
Today's star, Tadayoshi Inukai,

308
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,625
was a backpacker traveling in America,

309
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,916
when he had a fateful encounter
in a café in Boston!

310
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:38,166
There, he picked up Shizuka Inukai,
who was studying at a university there.

311
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,625
On their first date,
they danced to this memorable song.

312
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,791
Everyone, please join in
the dance tonight!

313
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,375
Music, start!

314
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,833
It turned into something strange.

315
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,708
I'll make it stop right away.

316
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,250
Since we're here...

317
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,041
Happy birthday.

318
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,375
I wish your parents were here to see this.

319
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,416
Thanks.

320
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,291
You know,

321
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,750
I left home at a young age

322
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,458
so I wasn't confident
of having my own family,

323
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,416
but thanks to you, I've made it this far.

324
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:48,416
I'm sorry for
always leaving the house matters to you.

325
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:54,833
I don't say this often enough,
but I appreciate it.

326
00:23:58,791 --> 00:23:59,958
Thanks.

327
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,291
That means a lot.

328
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,875
Izzy.

329
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:26,625
I think it's okay to have moments
where you can put your mission aside,

330
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,041
especially at a party.

331
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,291
So maybe we can...

332
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:39,541
Forgetting one's mission is never allowed.

333
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,333
I see.

334
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,916
Of course. Sorry.

335
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,708
Can I have a moment?

336
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,750
Girl talk.

337
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,708
Take it. It's work, right?

338
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,000
Sorry.

339
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,291
Hello?

340
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:38,541
 I'm sorry to interrupt you,
 but I have something urgent to report.

341
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,041
It turns out that Koki Shikazono,
whose body was found,

342
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,125
was in a seminar led by Professor Sawada,

343
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,291
who recently took
a sudden leave of absence.

344
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,750
-Leave of absence?
 -Yes.

345
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,041
 Her name is Natsuko Sawada.

346
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:56,166
There was a kind of diary,

347
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,375
or record of guidance, left at her lab,

348
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,875
and according to that,
right after Shikazono went missing,

349
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:06,166
she interviewed some student
to inquire about Shikazono.

350
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,500
Who is it?

351
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,833
Well, it's your son, Tadashi.

352
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,333
I wanted to be friends with you.

353
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,750
Please, use this.

354
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,625
I'll accept this powder
as a token of friendship.

355
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,875
Where did you learn
to handle a knife like that?

356
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:01,750
My family is skilled in the use
of various types of weapons.

357
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,625
Are they hunters?

358
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,750
If necessary, we hunt.

359
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,250
Who are you?

360
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,500
This is a problem.

361
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:34,958
Damn.

362
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,333
In that case...

363
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,166
Shit.

364
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,000
-Where's Tadashi?
-I don't know.

365
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,666
But his girlfriend is super cool.

366
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,125
I knew I'd seen her somewhere.

367
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,750
Her dance videos have gone super viral.
She's famous.

368
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,916
I need to take a photo with her.

369
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,666
This is...

370
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,250
Answer me. Who are you?

371
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,416
I know your true identity is a Yokai.

372
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,750
Tell me everything you know.

373
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
This is your first and last warning.

374
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,166
You're still alive because of Hachi.

375
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,791
Don't you come any closer. Got it?

376
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,541
Do you really think
he wishes to be with you?

377
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,083
Your relationship is just a curse!

378
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,375
He fears being with you.

379
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,541
Deep down, he knows you're a monster!

380
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,416
Your relationship with him
will never be more than that!

381
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,916
I appreciate it.

382
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,541
You reminded me of something important.

383
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,583
Humans are foolish creatures
who willingly hurt others.

384
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,666
You humans are the true monsters.

385
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,416
Until my brethren are free,

386
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,541
I'll slaughter
as many humans as necessary.

387
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,666
Where the hell is this?

388
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,416
Izzy. Where have you gone?

389
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,583
Hachi.

390
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,791
Arisa was left stranded
on a distant bridge.

391
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,750
Izzy threatened and abandoned her.

392
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,583
She wouldn't do that for no reason.

393
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,500
Are you still defending her
in this situation?

394
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,750
Hey, did you tell Arisa about Izzy?

395
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,708
I told her. I had no other choice.

396
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,750
Didn't we promise
not to tell anyone about Izzy?

397
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,125
I was trying my best
to keep everyone safe.

398
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,250
It's your fault.

399
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,250
Why'd you fall for someone
who kills people?

400
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,041
Then, you stopped caring
about the people around you.

401
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,750
Am I right?

402
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,541
That's not true, Tanuki.

403
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,125
Don't run away.
I'm talking about something important.

404
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,666
Tell me. If I get attacked by Izzy again,

405
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,791
who would you pick?

406
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,375
No way.

407
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,166
What happened to you?

408
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,208
Where's Izzy?

409
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,541
She disappeared into the shadows.

410
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,375
Apparently, she's willing to kill
as many people as it takes

411
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,833
to free her brethren.

412
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,208
I have to go.

413
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,166
Hachi, she's a killer.

414
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:41,416
If you allow this, you're just as guilty.

415
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,208
I think you should follow your own path.

416
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,708
A path that has nothing to do with me.

417
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,291
I completely agree.

418
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,791
Where are you? Hey!

419
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,416
What's wrong? Call me!

420
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,458
Hachi.

421
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:54,916
I realized who I am

422
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,375
and what I must do.

423
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,083
No more hesitation.

424
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,208
The owner of the magatama is here.

425
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,666
NIJOJI

426
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,958
This is...

427
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,000
I didn't mean to surprise you.

428
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:40,708
Reverend. I'm looking for
a certain artifact.

429
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,208
Could you help me?

430
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,458
I believe we can help each other.

431
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,708
Come, please follow me.
