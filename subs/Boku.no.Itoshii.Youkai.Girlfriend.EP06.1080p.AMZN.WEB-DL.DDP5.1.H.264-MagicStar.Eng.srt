1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,000
Wake up, my friend.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,750
I have awakened.

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:25,625
Escaping the deathly grasp
of Izanami's godly hand,

4
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,666
I return to this world...

5
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,291
Wait.

6
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,166
You killed me.

7
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,500
That was the last, last time, if I recall.

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,208
That's right.

9
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:52,625
I was killed by Princess Izuna!

10
00:00:55,041 --> 00:01:00,208
That means she now knows about me!

11
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,583
Amazing!

12
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,500
She probably just sees you
as a mere corpse.

13
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,375
Your plan failed.

14
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:12,958
If only there was more time,
it would have worked!

15
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:17,375
Never mind. Your detection ability
is still valuable.

16
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,583
Let's go before this one awakens.

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,666
My third wife

18
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,458
planted these daffodils.

19
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,791
The delicate blossoms
somehow resembled her.

20
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,291
She was a great kisser,
especially her tongue...

21
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,375
No time for unnecessary chatter.

22
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,750
So, what are you looking for?

23
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,458
-The magatama.
-Magatama?

24
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,875
It's not strange for an ordinary woman
to be searching for it.

25
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,750
It's just an ordinary item, after all.

26
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,833
Yes, a very ordinary possession

27
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,666
for an ordinary monk.

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,375
Well, it should be in the tearoom.

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,916
Let me guide you there.

30
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,416
 You've reached a Yokai

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,791
 that comes from a place
 beyond human knowledge.

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
 Leave a message.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,958
Izzy! I'm coming!

34
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,208
Don't do anything foolish!
No more killing!

35
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,708
Have a seat.

36
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,375
Where's the magatama?

37
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,666
No need to rush.

38
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,000
How about taking a break?

39
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,125
This is a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,458
Princess Izuna-imiki.

41
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,416
This tea is the Tea of Submission.

42
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,708
It has a rich aroma
and is good for the skin.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,583
You're one of the Five Spears?

44
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:38,208
Exactly. Saigen Ninomiya at your service.

45
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,791
First, put away that dangerous thing.

46
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,583
Let me go.

47
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,500
The magatama you were looking for...

48
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,500
Is it this?

49
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,791
I wanted more people

50
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,666
to see the beauty of this,

51
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,625
but now that a Yokai has returned
to this world, I had to take it back.

52
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,458
Give that to me!

53
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,875
This magatama

54
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,666
indicates the location of what you seek.

55
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,916
I tried to find the Yokai
released from the World of Nothing.

56
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,125
Then, that happened.

57
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,583
 This thing emitted light.

58
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,083
What were you going to look for
with this magatama?

59
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,416
Find the Guardian of the Five Spears?

60
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,500
Look.

61
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:10,333
One is right in front of you,
and you didn't even have to use it.

62
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,666
I'll kill you!

63
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,833
To prevent being killed,

64
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:24,083
let me take away
your Yokai power with this.

65
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,791
Is it from your boyfriend?

66
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,708
How pitiful of him,
being pursued by a Yokai like you.

67
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,000
He came to me alone before.

68
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,708
He was looking for a way
to sever the bond with you.

69
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,000
Didn't you know?

70
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:13,375
Yokai are truly not needed by anyone.

71
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,750
I can sense it.

72
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,125
Even in the darkness,

73
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,750
the aura of a Yokai!

74
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,375
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

75
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,666
You can't go through!

76
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,625
Stop!

77
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,791
Izzy.

78
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,791
Izzy!

79
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,833
Hachi.

80
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,791
Izzy.

81
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,250
You...

82
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,166
Izzy.

83
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,333
Izzy!

84
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,166
Help me!

85
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:03,500
This woman is saying nonsense
and trying to kill me!

86
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,750
He's one of the Guardians
of the Five Spears.

87
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,583
I need his head to release my brethren.

88
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,208
No!

89
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,958
-Why?
-You can't kill him!

90
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,666
There must be another way
to fulfill your mission!

91
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
Let's find it together!

92
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,500
It's over.

93
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,791
Go. Before I change my mind.

94
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,916
Thank goodness.

95
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank goodness!

96
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
I'm so glad.

97
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,791
You're awake.

98
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,041
Izzy.

99
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,708
What's with that outfit?

100
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,750
Your breakfast is ready. Hurry up.

101
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,125
It's delicious! You're the best, Izzy.

102
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,791
Izzy is such a great cook.

103
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,666
Hurry up and eat.
You'll be late for school.

104
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,083
Right, yeah.

105
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,291
Can't fight on an empty stomach. Eat up.

106
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Fight?

107
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,083
Nice, Hachi.

108
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,333
That's good.

109
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,041
Go! Nice!

110
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,583
Hachi, cover me.

111
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,833
Okay. Got it.

112
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,708
They got me!

113
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,958
Damn, me, too.

114
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,458
Hachi, the rest is up to you!

115
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,750
Great job!

116
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,916
-That's our man!
-Hachi!

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,166
Hachi!

118
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
Nice, Hachi.

119
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,291
Yeah.

120
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,625
Can we make up?

121
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,875
What are you talking about?
Were we fighting?

122
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,208
What?

123
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,666
Hachi, congratulations. Let's go.

124
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,000
Hachi!

125
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,083
Just the two of us is better.

126
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah.

127
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,000
What's wrong? Want some ice cream?

128
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,458
The stars are beautiful.

129
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,333
Hachi, let's dance.

130
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,083
Sure.

131
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,833
Hachi, do you remember?

132
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:26,458
You once said it's okay to have moments
where I forget my mission.

133
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,958
Forgetting one's mission is never allowed.

134
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,708
Yet, when I'm with you,
I really feel like forgetting.

135
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,750
Is this okay, Hachi?

136
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,666
But this isn't real, is it?

137
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,125
What are you saying?

138
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,208
Where is this?

139
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:16,791
Hachi, we're together now.
That's what's important.

140
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,750
I want this, too. But, sorry.

141
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,500
I know this isn't real.

142
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,833
Because we can't have any of this.

143
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,333
Don't think too much.

144
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:42,416
Besides, there's no way
you could forget your mission.

145
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,500
Hachi, I...

146
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,708
Please! Take me back to my world.

147
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,375
Izzy!

148
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,041
Why?

149
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,458
I had to fight.

150
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,875
You were confused.

151
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:45,166
You killed him and showed me an illusion?

152
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,500
The moments with family,
the games, the dances... All lies!

153
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,333
I only fulfilled my mission.

154
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,500
You killed an innocent man for a magatama?

155
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,125
This man was evil.

156
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,625
He was kind to us.
He could have helped us.

157
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,750
Don't be deceived!

158
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,208
He approached us
with sweet words to trick us!

159
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,250
That's not true.

160
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,750
He was one of the Five Spears.

161
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,500
I need his head to release my brethren.

162
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,583
You said you'd help me.

163
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,333
I just said
I'd help you find the magatama.

164
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,500
I wanted to stop you from killing.

165
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,250
Stop pretending to be naive!

166
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,666
You should know my mission!

167
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,750
"Pretending"?

168
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,625
Doing the right thing isn't an act!

169
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,416
This is absurd.

170
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,500
Am I the foolish one here?

171
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,125
Indeed, thinking I could help you
was foolish!

172
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,458
I'm calling the police.

173
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,875
No matter what, you can't escape our bond.

174
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,125
I don't care about that.

175
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:02,916
Hachi.

176
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,958
Why did you summon me?

177
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,083
-It was just an accident.
-No, it was fate.

178
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,125
I honestly don't understand fate,

179
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:30,291
and even when I summoned you,
I didn't know what would happen.

180
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:39,750
I was just lonely and foolish.

181
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,416
At rock bottom, without hope,
I tried that spell.

182
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,083
Then, meeting you

183
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,666
made me happy.

184
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,750
But...

185
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,416
I never wished for something like this.

186
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,666
I'm foolish, so I still hold on to hope.

187
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,166
That things might work out between us.

188
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,416
But deep down,
we know it's impossible. Right?

189
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,208
Izzy.

190
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,541
Hiding...

191
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,916
Killing...

192
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,875
I can't do it anymore.

193
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,958
Is that what you desire?

194
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,125
You must feel the same way.

195
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,833
I...

196
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,416
I can't stand this anymore.

197
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,791
Sorry.

198
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,166
Hachi.

199
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,541
This is over.

200
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,583
MUKURO POLICE STATION

201
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,333
FIRST INVESTIGATION DIVISION

202
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,541
He's not back yet?

203
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,750
 He's probably with his girlfriend.

204
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,291
 Don't worry. He's a big boy.

205
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,583
 It's only his first time
 staying out all night. Let it pass.

206
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,250
All right.

207
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,583
Let me know when he comes back.

208
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,458
Sir! He's gone!

209
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,625
I know. My son's gone with his girlfriend.

210
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,791
No, Kouki Shikazono is missing.

211
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,166
What are you talking about?
We found his body.

212
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,791
I know,

213
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:58,791
but the body disappeared
from the autopsy room, apparently?

214
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,375
This was found stuck
to the medical examiner's neck.

215
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,916
Some kind of neurotoxin, maybe?

216
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,833
This guy is from that underpass.

217
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,250
They're gone.

218
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,916
My dear Hikarists. Hi! Can you see me?

219
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,958
Can you guess where I am now?

220
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,000
Turn it off.

221
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,625
-Why?
-Why is she here?

222
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,666
Because I needed help.

223
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,041
You were stuck by some river.

224
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,750
And Hachi, he's the worst.

225
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:09,166
Also, I'm a Scorpio, and I like magic.

226
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,916
You told her about the sorcery?

227
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,500
Because everyone besides me
seemed to know about it.

228
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,541
Just so you know, this is not a game.

229
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,041
Hachi's life is on the line,
and so are ours.

230
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,875
By the way, where are we heading?

231
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,416
My hometown.

232
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,208
My uncle has
a collection of sorcery there,

233
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,541
and there might be a way to counter Izzy.

234
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,125
Keep this in mind. We're going
to send Izzy back to her world,

235
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,500
but before that,

236
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,416
it's crucial to sever the bond
between Hachi and Izzy.

237
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,000
If we don't unravel that connection,

238
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,375
Hachi will be dragged into
the World of Nothing.

239
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,500
What?

240
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,416
You're still worried about Hachi
after ending the friendship?

241
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
It's not like that.

242
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,166
SAKON RENJO
LAWYER

243
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,166
-Have they found Shikazono's body?
-No.

244
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,250
It's peculiar how Sakon Renjo...

245
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,250
Sir, Sakon Renjo

246
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:15,000
hasn't been seen at his office
for the past few days.

247
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,875
But take a look at this.

248
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,250
We found a shell company
that belongs to Sakon Renjo.

249
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,791
A shell company?

250
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:28,166
The address registered under Sakon's name
is a vacant space in a mixed-use building.

251
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,791
Where is it?

252
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,458
Around this area, I believe.

253
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,500
The heir of Ippongi Construction,

254
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,041
 for which Sakon is the advisor,
 was killed.

255
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,333
 Following Sakon's trail,

256
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:51,041
 we were attacked by a mysterious man
 in the underpass we found

257
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,625
 and discovered
 the body of Kouki Shikazono.

258
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,333
Let's retrace Sakon's movements.

259
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,833
-Yes.
-Yes, sir!

260
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:29,291
KYOTO CITY, KYOTO PREFECTURE

261
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,166
I see.

262
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,250
Ninomiya has...

263
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,125
Call Sakon.

264
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,333
I told you, Tenkai. I'm done with him.

265
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,916
Ninomiya's head has fallen.

266
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,458
What?

267
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,958
Only three heads remain.

268
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,791
They have also obtained the magatama.

269
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,375
Magatama?

270
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,333
It's only a matter of time
before all five heads fall.

271
00:26:55,541 --> 00:27:01,250
You really don't know
who the fifth Guardian is?

272
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:09,750
Fifteen years ago, Goromaru transferred
the power of the Guardian secretly.

273
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,708
Aside from the lady herself,
even the Guardians aren't aware of it.

274
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,000
If the fifth head falls,

275
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:26,208
neither you nor I
will get away with it so easily.

276
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:33,291
If the fifth head falls...

277
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,958
That's fine. I have a plan, too.

278
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,833
-A plan?
-Follow me.

279
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,541
Sir.

280
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,000
What is this place?

281
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,666
What's that smell?

282
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,250
Preservation water.

283
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,541
Awaken, my warriors.

284
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,000
Freeze! Police!

285
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,125
Tadashi.

286
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,625
Dad.
