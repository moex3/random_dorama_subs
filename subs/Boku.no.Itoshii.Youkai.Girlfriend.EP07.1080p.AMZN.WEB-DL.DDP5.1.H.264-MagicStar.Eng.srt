1
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:14,458
Tell me.
What's with the body at the temple?

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,083
This is Saigen Ninomiya,
the monk of Nijoji Temple.

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,375
The way he was beheaded

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,083
is the same as the first incident
involving Hayato Ippongi.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:35,250
And Kouki Shikazono, who knew
Hayato Ippongi, was also found dead.

6
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,916
Tadashi, you lied and said
you didn't know Kouki Shikazono.

7
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,833
This is your girlfriend, right?

8
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,833
This was at the scene
where Kouki Shikazono's body was found.

9
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,500
Everything is connected,
just like in a Miyuki Miyabe novel.

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,500
Can you explain what's going on?

11
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,083
What were you doing with your girlfriend?

12
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,666
Tadashi.

13
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,666
Do you know this man?

14
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,625
Spit it out!

15
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,166
Hey.

16
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,208
Yes?

17
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,875
What was that just now?

18
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,333
I will play the bad cop,

19
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,916
so you can offer him a drink
to open his heart...

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,250
He may be a suspect, but he's also my son!

21
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,750
Sorry.

22
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:12,166
The way you treated him
made me think he's a suspect.

23
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,958
How can she fall asleep in this situation?

24
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,333
I shouldn't have brought her.

25
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,791
Worried about Hachi?

26
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,500
Hachi cares more about Izzy than me.

27
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,500
Izzy's Yokai aura
is clouding Hachi's mind.

28
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,541
You know,
I was bullied in elementary school.

29
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,625
Probably because I'm big
and have a different skin color.

30
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,250
But Hachi stood up for me.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,791
He's smaller and weaker than me,

32
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,958
but got in between the bullies and me,

33
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,500
drenched in sweat and trembling.

34
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,375
Hachi always sees the good in people,

35
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,916
even if he ends up suffering himself.

36
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,750
I think he's trying to
see the good in Izzy, too.

37
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,416
And you're seeing the good in Hachi, too.

38
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,166
You're trying to help him.

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did you fight with him, then?

40
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,750
You're awake?

41
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,500
It's not a fight. We ended our friendship.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,291
Did these guys

43
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:46,250
try to summon Yokai like I did?

44
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:50,750
Yes. And they were killed by my hand.

45
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,625
They're losers who can't do anything
without my orders.

46
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,125
A little noisy.

47
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:01,791
I'm not a loser like them!

48
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,375
Exactly. There's something
only you can do.

49
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,875
Use this to find the whereabouts
of their friends.

50
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,416
I see.

51
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,791
So we're freeing Princess Izuna-imiki

52
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,291
with the help of her friends.

53
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,625
And then I'll marry her!

54
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,916
You fool!

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,291
We're going to end her life.

56
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,791
Do it.

57
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,416
No.

58
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,791
This is ridiculous.

59
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,750
I shouldn't have unilaterally doubted you.

60
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,791
Let's have a talk.

61
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,583
I'm on your side, no matter what.

62
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,708
Of course.

63
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,125
I've never really

64
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:45,000
listened to you properly until now.

65
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,583
Tadashi.

66
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,708
Please.

67
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,416
Tell me the truth.

68
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,333
I summoned an ancient Yokai
that travels through shadows.

69
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,583
And I ended up forming a bond with
and dating this Yokai.

70
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,375
But her mission is to free her brethren
trapped in the World of Nothing,

71
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,208
while a zombie samurai
is trying to stop her.

72
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,916
I wanted to help her somehow,

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,333
but we had a fight
and we broke up, so I can't reach her.

74
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,375
So, she's no longer my girlfriend.

75
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,125
This is a big problem.

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,041
Thanks for sharing.

77
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,083
Let me bring you something to drink.

78
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,250
He's totally lost his mind.

79
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,708
I'm going out to get some fresh air.

80
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,708
Okay.

81
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,291
We're here.

82
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
This place is so old.

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,708
Don't touch anything.

84
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,291
-Bad signal!
-You, too. No streaming.

85
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,958
Okay.

86
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,500
Jeez.

87
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,916
Amazing.

88
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,750
So many surveillance cameras.

89
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:28,000
My family
has been fighting Yokai for generations.

90
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,708
But there doesn't seem to be anyone here.

91
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,458
Where's your family, Arisa?

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
Someone's on the ground.

93
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,083
What happened?

94
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,833
-Are you all right?
-Your umbrella, dear.

95
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,375
 My parents were killed by Yokai.

96
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,333
So, my uncle manages this house now.

97
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,500
I see.

98
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,166
Anyway, I want you to find
a certain scroll here.

99
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,916
That's what we're here for.

100
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,625
A scroll?

101
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:52,166
The scroll to send Izzy back to her world.

102
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,000
I think

103
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,083
it has a pattern like this.

104
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,791
You're a terrible artist.

105
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,125
From here?

106
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,375
 Hachi.

107
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
 Can you hear me?

108
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,125
Izzy? Is that you?

109
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,583
What is this?
I can hear her voice in my head.

110
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,333
HE NEEDS A DRUG TEST!

111
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,041
 I heard your inner scream.

112
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:59,125
 It seems our bond has evolved
 through our hearts' connection.

113
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,750
But we've broken up already.

114
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,458
 Yokai don't easily
 discard bonds once formed.

115
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,583
Where are you now?

116
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,208
What? How?

117
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,708
This ain't good!

118
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,416
 This is the last time I'm helping you.

119
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,541
Izzy?

120
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,541
 The suspect has fled the police.
 Officers need to...

121
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,125
Sir!

122
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,166
Tadashi is...

123
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,666
Where did you get this car?

124
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,125
I borrowed it from
my new friend in this era.

125
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,250
A true friend is a great blessing.

126
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,166
How's your work?

127
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,375
The other day,

128
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,833
when I infiltrated Princess Izuna-imiki's
friend's game account,

129
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,791
I planted a virus.

130
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,208
We can track their location with GPS.

131
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,333
Good job.

132
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,416
If I don't do well,
I'll be under some painful spell again!

133
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,083
Listen, everyone!

134
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,500
Here's the plan.

135
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,541
We're going to capture a human
who bonded with a Yokai.

136
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,708
He's a weak man.

137
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:35,500
If we kill him,
the Yokai bonded to him will die, too.

138
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,333
It's a pre-celebration.

139
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,500
Sing, my undead!

140
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,958
Can't find it at all.

141
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,666
Where did Arisa go?

142
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,041
You know,

143
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,583
you seem to be the type

144
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:13,291
who likes intellectual women like Arisa.

145
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,666
What?

146
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, since we're talking

147
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,083
about this topic now,

148
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:26,250
what kind of girl do you like?

149
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,000
What?

150
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,250
I...

151
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,916
Well...

152
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,000
It's Hachi.

153
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,791
Not answering?

154
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,333
Our friendship is over.

155
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
Pick it up!

156
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,708
All right.

157
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,333
You've got some nerve calling me.

158
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,500
Tanuki, we have to stop Izzy!

159
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,750
Well, that sounds tough.

160
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,041
I know! I was wrong.

161
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,416
Remember? We're no longer friends.

162
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,333
I'll apologize in person. Where are you?

163
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,083
We're at the Renjo residence
where Arisa was born.

164
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey!

165
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,291
 Was that Hikari?

166
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,291
I'll send you the address.

167
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,791
Buy me ramen next time.

168
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,458
Thanks, Hikari!

169
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,791
Tanuki, I'm coming soon.

170
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,041
I haven't forgiven you yet!

171
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,291
Damn.

172
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,291
Coming through. Excuse me.

173
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,625
 Foolish Yokai.

174
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,833
 Disappear!

175
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,166
 Disgusting.

176
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,125
Hey, Yokai.

177
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:31,416
I'm better at transformations
than you Yokai, don't you think?

178
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,958
Troublesome.

179
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:03,333
Anyone can undergo a transformation.

180
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:21,791
Jeez. Transforming into a Yokai is creepy.

181
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,833
I wonder if you could find me?

182
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:48,000
I expected you to come, rogue Yokai.

183
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,916
Battle music, start!

184
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,708
The time has finally come!

185
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,333
That's right.
The time to end Yokai has come.

186
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,666
Let me explain.

187
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,333
This whip of light
will cut you into pieces,

188
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,708
leaving no trace...

189
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,333
What's that sound?

190
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,625
-What?
-Who is that?

191
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,416
What's going on?

192
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,833
This is bad.

193
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,458
So many of them.

194
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,708
Don't worry.

195
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,333
This mansion has a hybrid defense
of magic circles and cutting-edge tech.

196
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,750
They can't...

197
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,666
We're okay... Right?

198
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,541
Shit.

199
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,458
We've got to find it!

200
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,625
Now is not the time for that!
We've got to run!

201
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,583
Wait.

202
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,125
What?

203
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,541
Close it! Quick!

204
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,583
I can't! He's strong!

205
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,791
Aero.

206
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,583
You.

207
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,208
Give up.

208
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,458
Where's the kid?

209
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,375
I'm right here!

210
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,458
Hachi!

211
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,916
You idiot! Run!

212
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,541
Like a bug flying into the fire.

213
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,416
-Time-out!
-It's time-out!

214
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,666
No such thing!

215
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,541
Listen to me.

216
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,666
If you die, she will also die.

217
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,375
That solves everything.

218
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:08,708
If you kill me,
Izzy's anger will spin out of control!

219
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,750
That's a lie!

220
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,208
It's true.

221
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,708
Otherwise, I wouldn't show up myself.
So just listen.

222
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,083
We're looking for a scroll of spells

223
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,625
to sever the bond between Hachi and Izzy

224
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,416
and send the Yokai
back to the World of Nothing.

225
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,250
Enough with the killings.

226
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,000
You're sending her back
to the World of Nothing?

227
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,541
It's not an easy spell
for someone inexperienced like you.

228
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:30,833
Besides, you might be her target
because...

229
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,416
You are one of the chosen ones
by the Five Spears.

230
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,666
The Five Spears?

231
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,666
The Five Spears are the clans

232
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,083
 that saved this world from Yokai
 500 years ago.

233
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,916
Ippongi, Ninomiya,

234
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,208
Mikurube, Yomoda and Goromaru

235
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,500
are the five clans
that make up the Five Spears.

236
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:01,291
 Having won the battle against Yokai,

237
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:06,166
 the Five Spears became known as Guardians,

238
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,791
 who quietly sealed away Yokai.

239
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:15,375
And the Five Spears have continued
to inherit that power to this day.

240
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,666
However, there were problems, too.

241
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,208
Their power has been

242
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,833
targeted by Yokai many times.

243
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,375
Worried about the future, the Five Spears

244
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:35,125
decided to share their powers
to protect it.

245
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:41,541
That's why the Renjo family

246
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,833
was chosen.

247
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:51,083
The head of the Five Spears,
Saori Goromaru,

248
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,875
 gave an amulet to a young child

249
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,958
to secretly perform a ritual
and bestow them with power.

250
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,666
This ritual

251
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:06,000
must have been your fate
for being born into the Renjo family.

252
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:11,000
The bracelet, harboring a special power,
is the greatest proof of this.

253
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,916
It's a gift from my deceased father.

254
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,708
I, too, serve the Five Spears.

255
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:27,541
That's why, as someone with power,
I am targeted by Izzy.

256
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,666
Exactly.

257
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,000
-Uncle?
 -Arisa.

258
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,875
 Are you at the mansion?

259
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,083
You see...

260
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:59,375
I'm a chosen one of the Five Spears.

261
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,875
 Has Tenkai come to you?

262
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:07,083
Were Father and Mother
also chosen by the Five Spears?

263
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:15,875
 Your father served the Five Spears.

264
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,541
That's why he was killed by Yokai.

265
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,125
You tried to keep me away from this world

266
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,125
by not telling me about the Yokai power.

267
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:32,875
 The Renjo family's destiny
 is much grander than you can imagine.

268
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,916
I don't care about fate.

269
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,875
I just hate that Yokai killed my parents.

270
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,708
 Hey, Arisa. Arisa!

271
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,625
You were right.

272
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,333
If that's the case,

273
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,333
I know a way to send Izzy
back to the World of Nothing.

274
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:04,666
You can use me as bait to lure Izzy.

275
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,708
That's the only way.

276
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,708
And I want this more than anyone else.

277
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:18,208
But we still haven't found the scroll
to send Izzy back to her world.

278
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,750
To the right.

279
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,833
To the left.

280
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,416
Can we really find it?

281
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,166
Tanuki.

282
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm really sorry.

283
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,000
It feels so good to be right.

284
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,958
You were right, Tanuki.

285
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,625
Izzy can't stay in this world.

286
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,791
You really fell for her.

287
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:12,708
Back in elementary school,
you treated me just like everyone else,

288
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,958
despite me being mixed race.

289
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,500
It made me happy.

290
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,375
It's lame to push away my best friend

291
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,833
just because you have
a Yokai ex-girlfriend.

292
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:43,416
I have one question.
When Tenkai attacked you earlier,

293
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,333
you said Izzy's anger
would spin out of control.

294
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:48,666
Did you make that up?

295
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,833
You knew it?

296
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,208
You...

297
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,875
Shit!

298
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:01,083
BENITARO

299
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,916
 Tomorrow is the ELEGENDS tournament!

300
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,291
I'll forgive your past mistakes.

301
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:10,833
So, listen up. Don't be late tomorrow.

302
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:17,041
This is a fierce battle
where we give everything!

303
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,791
Do you understand? Answer me!

304
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,583
 Hello?

305
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,541
Found it!

306
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,166
We can send Izzy back
to her world with this.

307
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,583
So, where do we lure Izzy?

308
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,250
Here, right?

309
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,541
It's our home.

310
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,750
The Yokai power
in this mansion is incomplete.

311
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,000
Even I could easily break it.

312
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,375
Right.

313
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:05,750
First, we need a place where we can set up

314
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,541
a powerful magic circle
to capture that Yokai.

315
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,541
It can't just be anywhere.

316
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,291
We need to cast the spell

317
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,166
where conflict and hatred are swirling.

318
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,333
Is there such a place?

319
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:26,375
We need a battlefield akin to dedicating
everything to a fierce struggle.

320
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:32,375
"A battlefield akin to dedicating
everything to a fierce struggle"?

321
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,375
It's a battlefield of fierce struggle!

322
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,583
That's right!

323
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,250
So, it's decided, then.

324
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,250
That's where

325
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:49,708
we'll end her.

326
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:53,708
Banishing her from this world, right?

327
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm very sorry.

328
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,458
It seems I made a mistake

329
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,083
leaving it to you.

330
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,333
Oh, my.

331
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:33,000
What a spirited young fox.

332
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,583
MUKURO POLICE STATION

333
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,416
Sir!

334
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,833
The chief is calling.

335
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:56,166
Are you going to look for Tadashi?

336
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,958
You'll be punished.

337
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,208
Get out.

338
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:01,958
My son is more important.

339
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:06,208
Cool! I'll accompany you, sir.

340
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,500
Here, Arisa.

341
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:14,791
Thanks.

342
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,458
Okay. Are you all ready?

343
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,833
The time has come. All right!

344
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,500
Charge forth!
