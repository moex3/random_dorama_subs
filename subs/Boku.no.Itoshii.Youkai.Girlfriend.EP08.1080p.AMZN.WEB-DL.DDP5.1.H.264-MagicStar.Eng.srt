1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,791
Stay back!

2
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,958
The Five Spears have decided
to take away your Yokai power.

3
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,291
You have no other option but to surrender.

4
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,250
I won't give my kids away.

5
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,375
Please understand, Hisana.

6
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,625
Humans and Yokai cannot coexist.

7
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,458
Izuna!

8
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,625
Mother!

9
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,500
Izuna.

10
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,500
No!

11
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,000
Thanks for your patience, everyone.

12
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:02,916
Without further ado, the long-awaited
pinnacle battle of eSports players,

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,291
E LEGENDS will now begin!

14
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,833
E LEGENDS!

15
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,083
What the hell are they doing? Damn it!

16
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,583
This event today
is the culmination of my life!

17
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,041
Your life was ruined
by becoming a jobless graduate.

18
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,416
It's not over yet!
I mean, it hasn't even begun!

19
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,041
Well, I'm here. I'll be with you next year
and the year after.

20
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,750
Hey.

21
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,791
Is Princess Izuna-imiki a wonderful Yokai?

22
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,791
Yes.

23
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,833
Noble, dignified
and an unparalleled beauty!

24
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,541
That can't be denied.
She's incredibly cool.

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
Hey, guys.

26
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,500
Consider Arisa's feelings.
She's being targeted by Izzy.

27
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,750
So, focus!

28
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,666
Even the living deads are Hikarists?

29
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,458
Listen up, everyone.

30
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:31,875
That Yokai will come after
her final target, Arisa.

31
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
Don't let her escape, no matter what.

32
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,875
Did you get in touch with Tadashi?

33
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,250
No.

34
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,458
Is he really involved in this incident?

35
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,500
Don't worry.
Our son would never harm anyone.

36
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,625
But given the circumstances,
it's hard to deny his involvement.

37
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,875
 He must have a reason.

38
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,041
Is he safe?

39
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:08,125
I'll bring him back for sure. Don't worry.

40
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,083
 I'll call you back.

41
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,666
RENJO LAW OFFICE

42
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,541
Show me Arisa's whereabouts.

43
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,583
What's going on?

44
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,041
Where's my son?

45
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,958
What is this about?

46
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,291
Answer my question!

47
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,166
The monk at Nijoji Temple,
where you frequently visit,

48
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,791
was found dead, just like
the son of the Ippongi Construction.

49
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,291
And the missing interns, too.

50
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,625
They're all connected to you.

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,625
Stop making false accusations.

52
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,875
No, Captain!
This goes beyond rule violations!

53
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,333
Captain!

54
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,291
Don't you think you can escape.

55
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,041
Did you do it?

56
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,458
Of course!

57
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,833
With this, we can track down Sakon.

58
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,166
Hopefully, we'll find Tadashi, too.

59
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,708
I hope so.

60
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,625
Cool!

61
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,458
What a perfect setup!

62
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,750
Awesome!

63
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,458
Now, onto the next stage.

64
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:06,833
All of you, get out of here
if you don't want to die.

65
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,291
Otherwise...

66
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,583
I'll kill you all!

67
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:27,875
Hachi!

68
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,458
What are they doing?

69
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,375
Beni!

70
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,541
Terauchi!

71
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,250
It stinks!

72
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,666
Distribute these to everyone.

73
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,208
I'll be the bait to lure out Izzy.

74
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,583
First, we'll sever
Hachi and Izzy's bond with a spell.

75
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,750
Then, the binding spell
to expel her from this world.

76
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,500
Here she comes.

77
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,000
Izzy.

78
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,291
Princess Izuna!

79
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,666
So, it was you.

80
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,083
Move, Hachi. Her head can end all of this.

81
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,416
I'll put an end to everything.

82
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,000
You're the one who will be banished.

83
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,708
Izzy.

84
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,541
Izuna!

85
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,208
You are calamity itself.

86
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,375
Now!

87
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,000
Circle of Five.

88
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,875
A magic circle...

89
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:39,083
Within the magic circle,
your power is null.

90
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
Arisa, the binding spell!

91
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,541
Stop!

92
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,833
We have to chant the spell!

93
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,458
Arisa!

94
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,916
Are you all right?

95
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,541
The time has come to bury you completely.

96
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,666
Stop!

97
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,458
Hachi!

98
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
Princess Izuna!

99
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,916
All of you are miserable.

100
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,416
Losers who can't even protect
their own lives.

101
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,333
Get them.

102
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,166
Kill them all, except for
the Guardians of the Five Spears.

103
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,041
Seriously?

104
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait, aren't we allies?

105
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,708
Allies?

106
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,708
Don't make me laugh.

107
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,625
You're finished.

108
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,375
Princess Izuna!

109
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,250
What a fool.

110
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
This ends with you.

111
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,666
Izzy!

112
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,833
Why...

113
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,041
The magatama is reacting to you.

114
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,625
Hachi...

115
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,708
You...

116
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,541
I've been curious since I heard about

117
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,250
the Five Spears' ritual.

118
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,625
Fifteen years ago, Saori Goromaru,
the head of the Five Spears,

119
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,500
secretly performed a ritual,

120
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,666
 giving an amulet to a young child
 to bestow them with its power.

121
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,833
Do you remember?

122
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,958
The spring I took you to?

123
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,000
Why was it that place?

124
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,416
Seeing this, I remembered everything.

125
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,166
Now, if you drink this,

126
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,625
you'll be set to embrace your destiny.

127
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,666
Tadashi.

128
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,791
My precious grandson.

129
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,708
You're...

130
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,500
I'm...

131
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,541
...the Guardian.

132
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,125
I am your final

133
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,541
target.

134
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
Stay away!

135
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,125
Izzy.

136
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,458
If you choose to liberate
your family and friends,

137
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,708
I would gladly offer my life.

138
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,791
In return,

139
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,500
could you make just one promise?

140
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,916
Let me be the last one

141
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,583
you hurt.

142
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,916
I...

143
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,958
...don't want to see anyone else get hurt.

144
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,875
Izzy!

145
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,291
Return to your world!

146
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,541
Izzy!

147
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,291
Hachi.

148
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,041
I'm sorry.

149
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,583
-Uncle?
-I see.

150
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,916
I get it now.

151
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,208
What a masterpiece.

152
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,375
I never expected a Guardian
to be summoning Yokai.

153
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,375
Arisa.

154
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,000
Forgive me.

155
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,208
Once you're gone,

156
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,875
all the power of
the Five Spears will be mine!

157
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Advance!

158
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,083
Suspect arrested!

159
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,250
Dad...

160
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,208
Tadashi.

161
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,791
Are you okay?

162
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:46,833
Yeah.

163
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,208
You're all right now, son.

164
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,500
ONE MONTH LATER

165
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,625
 The case of the mysterious serial murders
 that shocked the nation.

166
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,625
 Captain Inukai, who handled the case,
 is here to give us details.

167
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,083
 There was an accomplice to Sakon Renjo.

168
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,208
 We're still investigating
 their relationship and the motive

169
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,625
 behind these events.

170
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,083
 An unidentified group

171
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,208
 suspected to be accomplices
 was spotted at the crime scene,

172
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,375
 and we are currently locating them.

173
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,791
Dad, you're famous!

174
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,250
Turn that off.

175
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,041
Fine.

176
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,166
My friend wanted your autograph, Dad.

177
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,375
I'm leaving.

178
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,875
Tadashi, have a seat. Let's eat together.

179
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,291
But there's no time...

180
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,291
Here.

181
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,083
An omelet.

182
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,666
-Okay.
-Good.

183
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,833
-Thanks for the meal.
-Go ahead.

184
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,375
Tadashi.

185
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,541
Don't forget your
therapy appointment today.

186
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,833
I know.

187
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,708
It's good.

188
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,958
I've got to go to class now.

189
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,833
I'm going, too.

190
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,833
Have a nice day.

191
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,375
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

192
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,875
-See you.
-See you.

193
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,375
They're good kids.

194
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,083
Yeah.

195
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:02,708
No matter what happens,
I don't want to lose them.

196
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,458
Yeah, it's okay now.

197
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,208
The case is solved.

198
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,583
No.

199
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,958
There's something I haven't told you yet.

200
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,416
Get in.

201
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,208
I'm sorry.

202
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,541
Sakon.

203
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,708
How did that Yokai

204
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,583
come into this world in the first place?

205
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,958
The forbidden book.

206
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,208
It seems a foolish intern stole it.

207
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,250
The chaos began with that.

208
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,666
Do you think I didn't notice

209
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,041
you were trying to steal

210
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:30,166
the forbidden spells from us?

211
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,583
The release of the forbidden spells

212
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,208
was definitely not my intention.

213
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:42,458
If that idiot
hadn't posted on the Internet...

214
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,208
I'm grateful to you.

215
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,291
Thanks to your failure,

216
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,916
things have progressed quite smoothly.

217
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,750
We were able to eliminate the weak
from the Five Spears

218
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,666
and evolve.

219
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,833
Once I leave this place,

220
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,708
you won't remember anything.

221
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,208
I heard they no longer offer
ancient folklore studies.

222
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,666
Officially, because there's no replacement
for Professor Sawada.

223
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,625
I would've gotten
good grades in that class.

224
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:59,666
But we know magic now.
Why attend the lectures?

225
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,916
I have to go. I have a counseling session.

226
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,791
I need to discuss as they expect.

227
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,250
Hey.

228
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:18,250
Have you talked to your dad about
the possibility

229
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,916
of your grandmother being involved?

230
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,125
Not yet.

231
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,875
There must be a reason,
so we need to find that first.

232
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I see.

233
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,666
So, no updates from her?

234
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,208
I guess the final ritual went well, then.

235
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,166
It still feels weird, you know.

236
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,416
Like...

237
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,416
I don't sense Izzy,

238
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,125
so our bond must have been
severed for sure,

239
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,750
but there's this lingering discomfort.

240
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,541
She was quite interesting.

241
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:11,416
I can't quite put it into words,
but we have to move forward.

242
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,458
Right.

243
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,375
-Well, I'm off!
-Yup.

244
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,041
 Arisa.

245
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,791
 If you're watching this,

246
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,875
 I might not be in this world anymore.

247
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,625
 There's something about

248
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,833
 the Renjo family's destiny
 that I need to tell you.

249
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,041
 It's about your parents.

250
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,250
 Your parents weren't killed by Yokai.

251
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,333
 Your parents were killed by...

252
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:32,750
I still sense the aura of Yokai
in this world.

253
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:38,041
A bond that can't be completely severed
even with spells.

254
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,000
It's intriguing

255
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,500
and troublesome.

256
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,791
We must definitely expel that Yokai.

257
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:00,458
She's not suitable for my grandson.

258
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:06,166
Tadashi is no ordinary Guardian.

259
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,541
That child possesses special powers.

260
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,958
 You've reached a Yokai from a place
 beyond human knowledge.

261
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,125
 Leave a message.

262
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,750
Izzy, it's me.

263
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,666
I don't know if you can hear this message

264
00:30:56,458 --> 00:31:01,375
or if you're still in our world.

265
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,625
 There's something I want to say.

266
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:12,083
 I think I've made a lot of mistakes.

267
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,625
 I did many things
 without thinking of the consequences.

268
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,916
 I was always nervous,
 lacked confidence in everything,

269
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,083
 and would easily run away.

270
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,250
 But now,

271
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,375
 I don't want to give up.

272
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,291
 Meeting you

273
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,583
 made me feel like
 I want to choose my own path

274
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,000
and make my way through.

275
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,291
 Fate isn't something
 imposed on you by someone else.

276
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,708
 You choose your own path.

277
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,833
 Hey, Izzy. No matter where you are,

278
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,958
 I'm going to find you.
