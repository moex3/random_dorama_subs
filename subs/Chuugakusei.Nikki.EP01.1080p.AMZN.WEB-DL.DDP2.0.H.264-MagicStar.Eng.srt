AUGUST 2015

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>"Ms. Suenaga.</i>

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:07,775
<i>Back then</i>

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,511
<i>I was a little crazy.</i>

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,981
<i>I'd get irritated for no reason,</i>

6
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,150
<i>and lose control.</i>

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:21,555
<i>To a point where I couldn't see</i>
<i>myself or my surroundings.</i>

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,659
<i>That's how much…</i>

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,063
<i>I loved you."</i>

10
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,967
<i>I'll ask again.</i>

11
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,001
Are you sure?

12
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,003
At this rate…

13
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,073
He's in middle school.

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,174
Ms. Suenaga!

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,947
Ms. Suenaga!

16
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,750
Ms. Suenaga!

17
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,094
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>I fell in love with a student.</i>

19
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,033
APRIL 2015

20
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,470
OPENING CEREMONY

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,573
One minute of silence.

22
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,884
HIJIRI SUENAGA

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,522
I had no idea.

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,658
One year ago today,

25
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:35,563
a worker died when a meteor
struck them from the sky.

26
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,499
I had heard that the stars
are pretty in Koboshidaira.

27
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,135
Did you all pray--

28
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,403
Ms. Suenaga!

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,737
Yes, um…

30
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,872
CLASS ONE SEATING CHART

31
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,307
-Ms. Iwasaki.
-We lied.

32
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:47,575
What?

33
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,411
While a worker did collapse
on school grounds,

34
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,180
you can see he's fine.

35
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,081
Huh?

36
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,352
Then what about a NASA researcher
coming every year?

37
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,420
Not true.

38
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,354
Not true?

39
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,527
Huh? Then what about the huge meteor
shower that happens every 100 years?

40
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,562
-And it's this year--
-Not true either.

41
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,266
Just so you know,
I came up with all those stories!

42
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,703
-Yay!
-Sit down.

43
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,972
-All lies.
-Sit down.

44
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,909
Junichiro Kokonoe.

45
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:22,977
Yes?

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,452
Those lies are inappropriate.

47
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,188
-You'll need to be reprimanded.
-Huh?

48
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,857
I'm sending you to social skill training.

49
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,026
See me after school.

50
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,095
-Huh? For real?
-No, I'm kidding.

51
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,501
-What?
-Kuroiwa!

52
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,103
What're you doing?

53
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,209
You okay?

54
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,421
Huh?

55
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,557
Did you hit your head?

56
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,091
-Ms. Suenaga.
-Hmm?

57
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,294
He's always like this.

58
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,672
-How did you greet them?
-Reminds me of my practical training days.

59
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:28,576
Out of all the trainees I looked after
your efforts lacked the most motion.

60
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,877
What?

61
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,278
Go on, show me.

62
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,285
-Nice to meet you, I'm Hijiri Suenaga.
-A bit stiff.

63
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,354
After graduating university in Tokyo,

64
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,191
I worked for two years as a part-time
teacher at grade and middle schools.

65
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,492
Yeah.

66
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,228
Ms. Chizuru, are you listening?

67
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,862
Yes, I'm listening.

68
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,564
You're doing a good job.

69
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,435
Abandoning your love life to focus
on teaching was worth it.

70
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,736
I haven't.

71
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,072
I'm long-distance with Shotaro.

72
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,508
He's in Osaka, and you're
in the Kanagawa sticks.

73
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,143
You should've followed him.

74
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,414
It's not like he asked me to.

75
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:12,253
I mean, you've been dating
for three years, and no ring yet?

76
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,688
Maybe he's not ready to settle down.

77
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:19,994
But it was my dream.

78
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:25,232
To have my own homeroom class
despite all the drawbacks

79
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,869
of being a young, unmarried woman.

80
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,107
It may not seem like it,
but I'm super motivated.

81
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:33,974
Yup!

82
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,209
Cheers.

83
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,484
You're inappropriate.

84
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,451
What?

85
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,754
That's what they're saying.

86
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,856
-Already.
-That's Old Lady Shioya.

87
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,190
Suenaga's in trouble.

88
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,226
-How stupid!
-There's the Internet now.

89
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,496
Cute, not cute, lame.

90
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,400
They may say that,
but always be dignified,

91
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,568
and do not show any weakness.

92
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,736
Yes, ma'am.

93
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,106
Right now, population decline is an issue.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,641
Did you know that?

95
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:13,947
Every year, 500 schools close
due to the declining population.

96
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,653
Teachers must protect
the school's reputation at all cost.

97
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,422
Understood.

98
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,924
How are the third years, Ms. Suenaga?

99
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,893
They're all hardworking.

100
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,728
They only look hardworking.

101
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,631
That's your school account.

102
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:35,669
You can log in here to place
lunch orders and contact parents.

103
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,870
Thank you!

104
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:41,208
Normally, a new teacher like you wouldn't

105
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:45,045
be left to handle third years like this.

106
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,514
Since your predecessor
is on maternity leave…

107
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,684
-I have high hopes though.
-Oh my!

108
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:55,789
Ms. Suenaga's essay was full of passion
and came from the heart.

109
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,757
Impressive!

110
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,159
And you seem tough.

111
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,060
Huh?

112
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,695
Good luck.

113
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,197
Okay.

114
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,598
A minute of silence!

115
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,400
So lame.

116
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,770
-Suenaga is so wily.
-For sure.

117
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,172
She acts like she doesn't wear makeup.

118
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,208
The guys like her. Right?

119
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,342
What?

120
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,010
Don't you think Hijiri's cute?

121
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,546
Not really.

122
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,882
Wow! A total shutdown!

123
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,317
That's Kuroiwa for you.

124
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,387
Ever the insensitive,
non-conformist too cool for everyone.

125
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:29,990
Come on, let's go.

126
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,659
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

127
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,429
-I'm off then.
-Have a good one.

128
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,500
<i>Can you talk tonight?</i>

129
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,367
OSAKA

130
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,002
HIJIRI

131
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,539
You're getting sent out.

132
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,774
What?

133
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,208
That's our new leader.

134
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,210
Haraguchi from the New York office.

135
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,014
She's a real career woman
with a short fuse.

136
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,550
She should lighten up.

137
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,189
-Ms. Kasuya!
-Coming.

138
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,495
Gonna grab some food.

139
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,664
I'm stepping out.

140
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,801
HIJIRI SUENAGA

141
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,457
Kuroiwa.

142
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:27,808
Huh?

143
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,713
So annoying.

144
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,714
Hey Akira!

145
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,886
Hold on, my precious son.

146
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,289
I take it back, my not so precious son.

147
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,025
-Stop.
-You didn't eat my curry?

148
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,595
If you're going to do this, I'm--

149
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,331
I keep telling you I don't need food.

150
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,066
Quite the opposite.

151
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,836
I'm going to make even more
elaborate dishes.

152
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,873
Something that requires
a lot of chopping or even shelling.

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,610
Time consuming food filled with my love
that I'll make every day

154
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,846
that you'll throw out heartlessly.

155
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:11,818
-Your ungratefulness will kill me.
-Shut up!

156
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,188
Oh, woe is me!

157
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,224
I'll eat it.

158
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,261
I'm jealous of Akira getting
to be a teenager.

159
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,263
Listen, Joffe.

160
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,366
Being a teenager is no excuse.

161
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,835
He's just being rebellious.

162
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:35,776
That cute round-eyed boy
is now a rebellious young man.

163
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,112
I'm impressed you raised him
so well on your own.

164
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,247
Boss!

165
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,316
Hat's off!

166
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,717
And thank you for the food.

167
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,987
I'm worried about school.

168
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:52,859
I want to talk with them, but his new
homeroom teacher is a young woman.

169
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:59,499
According to the other moms,
she's rather cute, like a Russian doll.

170
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,667
Good morning.

171
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,915
We met yesterday.

172
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,619
I saw you buying a boxed lunch.

173
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,220
Is your mom busy working?

174
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,026
Do you eat alone a lot?

175
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,831
If you need to,
you can talk to me anytime.

176
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,699
I want to be of help to you.

177
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,379
I thought this yesterday,

178
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,048
but you have a pretty face.

179
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,254
Please! You need to stop annoying me.

180
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,337
<i>Why did he hit me?</i>

181
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:13,241
<i>Did I say something?</i>

182
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,244
<i>Why?</i>

183
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,486
OSAKA

184
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,087
<i>Be vocal.</i>

185
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:43,224
<i>And stand up for myself if a student</i>
<i>makes a comment.</i>

186
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,294
<i>I follow these rules for myself.</i>

187
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:52,266
<i>I even became the swim coach</i>
<i>when I said I swam as a kid.</i>

188
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,569
<i>Really?</i>

189
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:58,773
Every day is hectic,
but all of my students seem nice.

190
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,846
<i>-What's wrong?</i>
-Hmm?

191
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,448
Nothing.

192
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,884
I'll do my best.

193
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,721
By the way,

194
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,324
are you going this weekend?

195
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:18,960
Yamamoto's transferring to London.

196
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,695
<i>The farewell party?</i>

197
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:22,697
<i>What about you?</i>

198
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:25,199
I'll be in Tokyo for work, so I think so.

199
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,267
Kawai.

200
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,535
Yes?

201
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:30,938
Go home if you're not going to work.

202
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,575
And the meeting was moved up an hour.

203
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:35,977
<i>-Sorry, got to go.</i>
-Okay.

204
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,724
I'm sorry, I thought I had time.

205
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,392
I said you could leave.

206
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:58,132
You can cry about missing
your girlfriend at home.

207
00:12:58,199 --> 00:12:59,433
Is that from a song?

208
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,069
You want me off the team?

209
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,904
Today's web meeting is important.

210
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,773
Yes, it's big.

211
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,823
What's going on?

212
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:25,426
Why's her voice shaking so much?

213
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,796
-She's always like this.
-Really?

214
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:31,065
They call her Shaky Voice Haraguchi.

215
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:35,002
But she never fails and even gets laughs.

216
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:45,379
-Rumors say she's the boss's mistress.
-What?

217
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,415
You go against her, you get exiled.

218
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:54,989
Yamamoto.

219
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:55,856
KENTA YAMAMOTO

220
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,460
Mahiro?

221
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:05,499
Kuroiwa.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,335
AKIRA KUROIWA

223
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:12,807
Parent teacher conference?
And it's this week?

224
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:17,178
Why didn't you show this to me earlier?

225
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,047
Hey.

226
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:24,719
-Did the school call you or anything?
-Huh?

227
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,954
Why?

228
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:30,491
Hey.

229
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,059
Hey, Akira!

230
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:38,833
I'm going to talk to your teacher about
your teenage rebellion!

231
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,712
KOSUKE SHIMAZAKI

232
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,082
AS HIS FATHER…

233
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,751
I WANT TO MEET AKIRA

234
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,094
HIJIRI SUENAGA

235
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,333
DEAR GUARDIAN, I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

236
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,570
HIJIRI SUENAGA

237
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:18,906
Maruoka.

238
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:26,781
It looks like a strange code, doesn't it?

239
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,750
<i>Hijiri hasn't told anyone</i>

240
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,487
<i>that I slapped her yet.</i>

241
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:34,922
<i>Why?</i>

242
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:38,459
This is a poem by Chinese poet Du Fu.

243
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:40,261
Page 23 in your text books.

244
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:44,031
It was written about 1,250 years ago.

245
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:45,499
But when you read it,

246
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:49,970
the imagery of the scene expands
around you like a picture.

247
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:52,506
Let's experience it together.

248
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,013
"What color is Hijiri's bra?"

249
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,448
Idiot!

250
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,284
<i>Welcome Rain on a Spring Night.</i>

251
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:10,191
Rejoicing a gentle spring shower
that begins during the night.

252
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:14,028
"The good rain knows its season."

253
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,964
Good rain knows of that time.

254
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,400
-Time to find out!
-Spring has come.

255
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:20,835
In other words, it begins.

256
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:24,138
"When spring arrives, it brings life.

257
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:28,542
It follows the wind
secretly into the night--"

258
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:32,046
Are you alright?

259
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,949
You've got to be joking!

260
00:16:38,586 --> 00:16:40,621
Seriously, Kokonoe!

261
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,990
Take out your phones right now!

262
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,193
The whole class.

263
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,662
Hurry up!

264
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,999
This is what they were up to.

265
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:55,870
I didn't notice.

266
00:16:55,936 --> 00:17:00,207
I don't see why they're
so interested anyway.

267
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,943
They're just a boring beige.

268
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,345
Nobody asked!

269
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,214
First of all,

270
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,818
instruct them to keep
phones off during class.

271
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:12,553
Also,

272
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,922
that blouse.

273
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,490
It's too feminine.

274
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:20,361
And refrain from using shampoo
and soaps with strong smells.

275
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,029
Your skirts should be long.

276
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,032
And your shoes should be flats, not heels.

277
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,268
I warned you.

278
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:31,972
Make sure that you dress appropriately
for school in the future.

279
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,808
I'm very sorry.

280
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,645
Why did Suenaga get in trouble?

281
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,947
That bitch snitched on me.

282
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:44,585
Somehow she found out I went karaokeing
the other day and emailed my parents.

283
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:47,221
Something about "having me home early."

284
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,722
Kokonoe got one too.

285
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,293
I got one saying that I hang around
the second year classes.

286
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,861
But you do to get near Juri.

287
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,196
Well, I love her.
I just wanna see her face.

288
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:58,365
Such a purely innocent reason.

289
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,702
Why does she care how I use my free time?

290
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,537
Like get a life.

291
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:04,872
Suenaga pisses me off.

292
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,074
-She's cute, so it's fine.
-No it's not.

293
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,376
Why is she snitching on us?

294
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:13,414
There are people who think she's
too young to handle our class.

295
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,183
-She's trying to prove herself.
-What?

296
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,818
It sucks.

297
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,788
-Who cares, she's cute.
-No she's not.

298
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,026
PARENT TEACHER CONFERENCE

299
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:33,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

300
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:37,438
Your mom contacted me to say
she's running a little late.

301
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:41,041
We can get started without her.

302
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:55,289
Oh, so earlier, you tried to stop
him from getting water on me, right?

303
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,524
Thank you.

304
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:09,069
Anyway, I saw that you left
your future career aspirations blank.

305
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,271
Do you have any dreams?

306
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,245
My dream was always to become a teacher.

307
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,147
So I'm living my dream.

308
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,252
Dreams are important.

309
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,556
If there's anything you're interested in
now or want to talk about, you can--

310
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:30,457
But…

311
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,928
You're not cut out to be a teacher at all.

312
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:37,698
What?

313
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,702
Why didn't you tell anyone that I hit you?

314
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,974
I should be suspended.

315
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:51,011
Do you have some weird punishment planned?

316
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,312
It's nothing like that.

317
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,049
I just don't know you well enough yet.

318
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:57,484
Is it fun playing teacher?

319
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,601
It is fun.

320
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,474
Saying good morning to everyone in class
gives me so much positive energy.

321
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,444
The school meals are delicious,

322
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:28,215
and all my students are so cute,
I love them.

323
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:32,553
Then what do you like about me?

324
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:55,864
Ms. Suenaga.

325
00:20:55,931 --> 00:21:00,068
Kuroiwa's mother called,
she can't make it today.

326
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,104
I see, I understand.

327
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,638
Thank you.

328
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:11,914
Thank you for coming all this way.
Just look at this.

329
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:15,785
We got a huge order from
a friend's restaurant, but look.

330
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:18,854
I had to check the items.

331
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,457
-Put these away, Joffe.
-Okay.

332
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,025
-Joffe?
-Hi, I'm Jofu.

333
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:26,929
People mistake my name a lot,
so I go by the foreign sounding Joffe.

334
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:29,932
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,300
It's about Akira, right?

336
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,971
He hasn't submitted anything
for his future aspirations.

337
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:36,806
I'll try talking to him,

338
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,277
but he's been a real brat lately.

339
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:44,280
-I'll pour you some tea.
-Thank you.

340
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:47,416
Oh, that's right.

341
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:50,720
-You've been sending parents emails.
-What?

342
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,722
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

343
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,156
I heard from the other moms.

344
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:58,461
That you've been informing them
about their children.

345
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,162
Feel free to send any to me too.

346
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:06,969
That's why my students
have been shutting me out.

347
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,571
-Huh?
-Actually…

348
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:13,843
I lost my login password,
and I'm getting it reissued.

349
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:15,044
Then who sent the emails?

350
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,146
I'll check when I get back.

351
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,181
I'm so sorry.

352
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:24,387
Ms. Suenaga, please take care
of my stupid boy.

353
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:27,656
He's in his rebellious phase,

354
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,493
and hard to deal with,

355
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,728
but deep down he's a good person.

356
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:33,662
Yes.

357
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:36,065
I will do my best.

358
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:50,413
Kuroiwa.

359
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:09,565
So someone was sending out emails
pretending to be you?

360
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,500
Your account's been unlocked.

361
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:15,104
You should send out an email
explaining what happened to the parents.

362
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,605
Yes, I will do that.

363
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,474
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,943
Have a good day!

365
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:24,080
<i>Hijiri.</i>

366
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,214
Listen--

367
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,450
Can you make it to the party tomorrow?

368
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,188
I want to, but I have work.

369
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,956
I'd like you to come.

370
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:36,759
<i>We need to talk.</i>

371
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:43,966
"We need to talk?"

372
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,267
What was his tone?

373
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,636
Was it like "we need to talk."

374
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:49,738
Or "we need to talk."

375
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,507
Or "we need to talk."

376
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:52,675
You know?

377
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:56,011
"We need to talk."

378
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:58,814
-That sounds bad.
-You think so?

379
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,882
How long's it been?

380
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:01,617
Three weeks.

381
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:04,153
And we've talked twice since.

382
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:06,522
Sounds like the end.

383
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,824
I thought so.

384
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:14,230
But it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all.

385
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:15,698
You'll be okay.

386
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:16,699
You're great.

387
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,336
Thank you, I guess.

388
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,117
It's the one I wanted.

389
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,923
I'm going camping with a coworker,

390
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,192
and I got put in charge.

391
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,395
You're a good cook after all.

392
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:51,667
When I was looking for tools I needed,
I remembered when we went camping.

393
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:53,469
You know,

394
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:56,005
it was fun, wasn't it?

395
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:03,379
You destroyed our tent,
and dropped chopsticks in the river.

396
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,881
Oh, yeah, I remember!

397
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,350
So when I look at these,

398
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:11,020
I want to buy one for you too.

399
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:15,758
I'd wonder what color you'd like.

400
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:20,396
Or think about buying a third
or fourth if we start a family.

401
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,033
So…

402
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:26,835
Um…

403
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:30,973
What?

404
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:34,610
What?

405
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,213
So I couldn't wait!

406
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,751
Sorry, a lot's been going on,

407
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:47,690
so I didn't have time to choose,
this is a placeholder!

408
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:54,830
-I thought we'd never go again.
-What?

409
00:25:54,897 --> 00:26:00,736
That all our camping trips were behind us.

410
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:03,806
It made me sad.

411
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,507
Huh? Why?

412
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:07,509
I don't know.

413
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:09,345
I don't know.

414
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,147
The long distance?

415
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:14,483
Maybe.

416
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,418
Yikes. That's scary.

417
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:21,257
Will you

418
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,293
marry me?

419
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,532
You ready?

420
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,467
What the hell?

421
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:34,703
Tonight, we drink beer for the first time.

422
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,604
Come with me.

423
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,172
Hurry up!

424
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,474
What the hell?

425
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,643
-Come on already!
-Drink and do what?

426
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:44,146
Drink like this… Just come with me!

427
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:47,916
-Hurry up!
-Hold on!

428
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,287
You're heavy! Watch out!

429
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:52,888
You actually came.

430
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:54,857
What are they doing?

431
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:58,327
-Hey!
-Why'd you ask us to bring snacks?

432
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,896
Stop crying just because you got rejected.

433
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:02,931
How about you comfort me?

434
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm sensitive.

435
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:06,702
Wait, we're climbing?

436
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:07,770
For real?

437
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,141
Buzz Cut!

438
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:13,409
Buzz Cut!

439
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,312
I'm coming. Wait.

440
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:26,388
<i>Married?</i>

441
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:31,126
Congrats!

442
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,294
This way, please.

443
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,229
We need to celebrate!

444
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:36,598
Seriously, that's great!

445
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:39,268
To think such a day would come…

446
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:40,703
I'll drive.

447
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:42,338
Thanks.

448
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,147
Kawai.

449
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:56,985
So the girl you were gabbing away with
before our important meeting

450
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,422
making me worry about how your
brain works, was your fiancé?

451
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:02,024
Huh…

452
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,892
I'm Hijiri Suenaga.

453
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:05,794
Hijiri?

454
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,695
Yes.

455
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:08,430
Long distance?

456
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:13,068
Yes, but she should be moving
to Osaka before too long.

457
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:17,773
I'm sure she can find a teaching position
in Osaka, we need to talk more about it.

458
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,212
This is close to our main office.

459
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:24,346
Really?

460
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,715
Are you alone today?

461
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:28,550
I'm on a date.

462
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:30,786
-What?
-Ah!

463
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:31,987
There they are.

464
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:33,288
The president?

465
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:34,523
President?

466
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,295
Tequila.

467
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:42,197
Coming right up.

468
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:53,876
-One second.
-Shotaro.

469
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:54,810
They need you.

470
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,982
Hijiri.

471
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:02,885
Here you go.

472
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:05,821
For the engagement.

473
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:08,357
Thank you.

474
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:15,497
Are you sure you want to marry Kawai?

475
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:18,867
Quit your job like he wants you to?

476
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:23,172
You want the average family life
back in Osaka?

477
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,707
I need to think about it.

478
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:29,178
Although, long distance is tough.

479
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:33,348
You might fall for someone closer.

480
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,851
Not me.

481
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:38,153
You can't say that for sure.

482
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:44,693
Sometimes you fall for the last
person you imagine.

483
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:49,998
Something not accepted by society,
opposed by many.

484
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,733
Yet, you're still drawn to them.

485
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:53,435
Deeper.

486
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,477
There's no better experience.

487
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,013
Hijiri.

488
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:11,086
Do you love Kawai?

489
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:12,821
Yes.

490
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:14,456
-Of course.
-Are you happy?

491
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,525
-Yes.
-Liar.

492
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:18,460
It's one or the other.

493
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,462
-Come on, drink.
-I'm driving.

494
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,299
Someone once said,

495
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,904
"Love kills happiness
and happiness kills love."

496
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:31,373
What's that mean?

497
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,344
That you can't have both love
and happiness.

498
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,957
Did a meteor really crash here?

499
00:30:49,658 --> 00:30:51,260
It would've been huge then.

500
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,529
Runachi!

501
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,898
Six in a row!

502
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,266
-Let's play later!
-Yeah!

503
00:30:57,332 --> 00:31:00,002
Fireworks!

504
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,436
Goodbye, Juri.

505
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,841
Yes, here we go!

506
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:09,711
Pavlov's dog.

507
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,149
He drools every time he sees Juri.

508
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:16,184
There's another one.

509
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:17,319
Kuroiwa, too.

510
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,755
Always staring at Suenaga.

511
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:22,124
Really?

512
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,425
Don't be ridiculous.

513
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:24,459
I know you do.

514
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,463
I know because I'm always looking at you.

515
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,299
Was that a…?

516
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:31,967
Runachi?

517
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:34,436
Fire!

518
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:36,004
Crap!

519
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,539
Shit!

520
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:41,910
What are you doing?

521
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:44,212
What do we do?

522
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,648
Let's get out of here!

523
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:50,052
What are you doing?

524
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:52,821
Kuroiwa?

525
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:54,690
Just leave it!

526
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,594
You're right!

527
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,495
That's enough!

528
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,931
You're gonna catch on fire!

529
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,877
MS. SHIOYA

530
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:24,451
I have to go.

531
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:25,218
Now?

532
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:28,288
One of my students started a fire
and is in the hospital.

533
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:29,289
I have to go!

534
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,092
I'll drive you.

535
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,460
Ms. Shioya!

536
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,328
How is Kuroiwa?

537
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:37,230
No answer.

538
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,198
Any texts?

539
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:39,799
Not yet.

540
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:43,703
There she is.

541
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,605
I'm so sorry.

542
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,474
Everything's okay.

543
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,576
This way.

544
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,088
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:03,657
I couldn't come right away.

546
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,192
-I was out.
-It's okay.

547
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,430
We don't know how to apologize for this.

548
00:33:10,497 --> 00:33:11,331
It's nothing.

549
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:14,300
APRIL 18TH, SATURDAY

550
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,771
-I'm so glad.
-Ms. Shioya.

551
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,742
Ms. Shioya.

552
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:28,481
We were lucky.

553
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,152
Kuroiwa put the fire out
and only suffered minor burns.

554
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,989
The police won't be bringing any charges
as it didn't become a big incident.

555
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,024
Just a stern warning.

556
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,060
Thank you!

557
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:42,295
-We're so sorry.
-I'm sorry.

558
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,799
-You idiot!
-Sorry.

559
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,133
Dragging everyone into it!

560
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,334
Ma'am, that's enough.

561
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:50,236
Ms. Kokonoe.

562
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:53,039
-I'm sure everyone's exhausted.
-No!

563
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,742
Let's pick this back up at school.

564
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:00,447
-I'm glad they're okay.
-Thank you.

565
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,733
I'm very sorry.

566
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:24,037
-I was in Tokyo for--
-The matter's settled.

567
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,472
I will see you tomorrow.

568
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:39,018
So bright.

569
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:42,822
Shotaro.

570
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,125
Hey.

571
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,826
Hey.

572
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,469
Ms. Suenaga.

573
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,304
Is this…?

574
00:34:59,073 --> 00:35:00,074
Your…?

575
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:02,676
Yes.

576
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:04,211
Are you getting married?

577
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:05,713
Yes.

578
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,615
Is that so?

579
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,851
I'm so sorry for dragging
you out for this.

580
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,587
And your fiancé as well.

581
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:16,290
Akira.

582
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,058
Say you're sorry.

583
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:19,860
Akira.

584
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,095
It's--

585
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,664
That's why you don't care at all.

586
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,001
What?

587
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:31,138
Instead of checking on us,
you went straight to our parents.

588
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,406
Worried about your job.

589
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:34,475
-I didn't mean--
-Akira.

590
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:37,211
You're just here until you
get married anyway.

591
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:40,381
You might as well quit now.

592
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,353
What is with your attitude!

593
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:47,855
Listen up!

594
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:52,359
I will not tolerate you disrespecting
your teacher this way!

595
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,360
Got it?

596
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:54,428
I'm okay.

597
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:55,629
I'm serious.

598
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,431
I'm okay.

599
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:03,704
Get in.

600
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:24,959
Kuroiwa.

601
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,160
I'll see you in school.

602
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,113
What's up?

603
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,381
It's my essay.

604
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,617
I submitted it when I applied.

605
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:54,021
"I want to be depended on.

606
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:57,892
To notice my student's struggles,

607
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,161
and approach them."

608
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:05,232
But in reality, I'm useless.

609
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:06,433
Why?

610
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:12,773
He's right.

611
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:15,542
I'm just playing teacher.

612
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:21,148
Come to Osaka.

613
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:26,353
Then I'd always be around to listen.

614
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,156
And help anyway I can.

615
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:34,828
Let's live together.

616
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,678
After your father left,

617
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,748
it was just you and me.

618
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:58,652
But it was okay,

619
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,522
I was confident we could make it.

620
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,626
You're me.

621
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,595
You're a part of me.

622
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:12,900
So I knew what you're thinking,
what you're feeling

623
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,869
because we're connected.

624
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:19,940
But now,

625
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,079
I have no idea anymore.

626
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:30,217
I don't understand you.

627
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:38,092
How could you?

628
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:41,228
Lately,

629
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:43,964
it's been weird.

630
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:51,138
I don't even understand myself.

631
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:06,353
Thanks for cooking.

632
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:53,734
Even teachers need a break.

633
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:58,072
You couldn't come right away
during an emergency,

634
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,007
it happens.

635
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:05,779
Mr. Irie and I covered for you,
and everything worked out!

636
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,347
However,

637
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:09,817
if it were me,

638
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:14,421
I wouldn't lose my login information
on my first day of school,

639
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:18,759
I wouldn't stray that far from school even
on the weekends or drink alcohol,

640
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:23,263
let alone show up
with my lover driving me.

641
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,467
Absolutely unthinkable.

642
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:31,839
That's because the students
are watching us.

643
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:36,677
You've lost their trust.

644
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,147
Yes.

645
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:41,982
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:45,752
I suppose, they may call me a relic,

647
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,322
someone stuck in the past.

648
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:49,256
Not at all.

649
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,495
But I have my conviction.

650
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:56,897
Teaching is a sacred job.

651
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:59,466
We must always lead by example.

652
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:01,001
That is a teacher.

653
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,205
No amount of attention is ever enough.

654
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:07,674
Middle schoolers are precarious creatures.

655
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,761
I've had it.

656
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:38,272
You should be able to go back
to school tomorrow.

657
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:41,909
Make sure to apologize to your teachers.

658
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,111
Are you listening?

659
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:53,187
Hey!

660
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,055
-Don't touch--
-It's from Dad.

661
00:41:55,122 --> 00:41:56,823
Stop! Give that here!

662
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,326
You don't need to read it!

663
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:02,462
It's complicated.

664
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:03,997
You're still a child.

665
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:06,333
You can't understand.

666
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,169
I'm not a kid!

667
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:22,783
Hello.

668
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:24,618
Ms. Suenaga.

669
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:27,354
I came to check on your son
since he wasn't at school.

670
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,156
<i>Well…</i>

671
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,034
Sorry.

672
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,237
-Have you seen Kuroiwa?
-Kuroiwa.

673
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:45,939
<i>No amount of attention is ever enough.</i>

674
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:48,775
<i>Middle schoolers are precarious creatures.</i>

675
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:09,963
Kuroiwa!

676
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:17,570
Kawai.

677
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:20,973
Ms. Haraguchi!

678
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,208
Why are…?

679
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:23,976
I was going to cook dinner.

680
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:25,311
What?

681
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:26,746
Sometimes I want to eat in.

682
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,848
A home cooked meal?

683
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:30,983
My place is way too tidy to relax.

684
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:32,718
You already unpacked?

685
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:35,154
My place is full of boxes.

686
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:36,889
Push it.

687
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,161
Do we live in the same building?

688
00:43:42,762 --> 00:43:45,598
Our company has a contract
with this building.

689
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:47,700
So we're neighbors.

690
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:51,537
What?

691
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:55,908
You really are so mysterious.

692
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:58,811
-Am I?
-I thought you were a capable boss.

693
00:43:58,878 --> 00:44:01,480
-Then a mistress?
-With a girlfriend.

694
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:03,182
I'm bi.

695
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:04,784
Just so you know.

696
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:11,824
You're like an onion with so many layers.

697
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,829
How's your girlfriend?

698
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,497
She's good.

699
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:22,068
Kuroiwa!

700
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:29,108
What are you doing?

701
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:30,676
Why are you here?

702
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:47,727
Mayugahama.

703
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,061
What?

704
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,030
I'm going to Mayugahama beach.

705
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:55,968
It's over 20 kilometers.

706
00:44:57,503 --> 00:44:59,071
I thought I could make it.

707
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,941
It's only half a marathon.

708
00:45:04,276 --> 00:45:05,911
Your mom's worried.

709
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:11,884
I'll give you a ride.

710
00:45:13,052 --> 00:45:13,886
So get in.

711
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,589
Yes, I just ran into him.

712
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:18,124
See you soon.

713
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:31,670
Hold on, I'll find a towel or something.

714
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:51,490
Anyway,

715
00:45:51,557 --> 00:45:55,060
you're such a guy for trying to
go to the beach.

716
00:45:57,563 --> 00:45:58,964
Always surprising me,

717
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:01,767
being so unpredictable,

718
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,369
I just don't get it.

719
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:17,917
<i>Welcome Rain on a Spring Night.</i>

720
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:22,455
"The good rain knows its season,

721
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,827
When spring arrives, it brings life."

722
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,062
Good rain

723
00:46:32,264 --> 00:46:34,600
chooses when to rain.

724
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:39,038
It always rains when spring comes.

725
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,947
"It follows the wind

726
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:53,819
secretly into the night."

727
00:46:54,653 --> 00:46:58,424
It continues to rain through
the night as the wind blows.

728
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:04,029
"And moistens all things softly,
without sound."

729
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,267
Quietly, while barely making a sound,

730
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:11,704
it moistens everything.

731
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:14,707
It's true.

732
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:16,976
It's just as you said.

733
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,678
I can see the scenery.

734
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,227
I…

735
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,899
I love this poem.

736
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:45,437
The wind and rain I feel,

737
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,174
the scenery I see,

738
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:58,617
I always wanted to share it with someone.

739
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:03,589
Thank you.

740
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:09,762
Ms. Suenaga.

741
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:12,965
You won't quit?

742
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:19,705
Maybe I got my own class too soon.

743
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:24,977
I mean, it's too late now.

744
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:43,829
Seatbelt please.

745
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:23,469
-Yes?
<i>-Hijiri?</i>

746
00:49:24,136 --> 00:49:29,174
Sorry, I had a student runaway,
and I'm taking them home now.

747
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:33,979
See. Look at you being a good teacher.

748
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,318
I'll call you back.

749
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:44,089
Let's get you home.

750
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,598
Kuroiwa!

751
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:02,041
Child.

752
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,942
Student.

753
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:09,682
I see.

754
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,050
He's home.

755
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,484
Yes.

756
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:14,620
I'm glad he's okay.

757
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:16,588
Yes.

758
00:50:17,523 --> 00:50:20,125
Yes, goodbye.

759
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:25,297
KOSUKE SHIMAZAKI

760
00:50:32,104 --> 00:50:34,239
You're not going to tell Akira about it?

761
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:35,307
I can't.

762
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:38,811
How could I?

763
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,685
LESSON PLAN

764

HER FIANCE WORKS AT A MAJOR COMPANY.

GOLD DIGGER

ANNOYING

771
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:24,490
QUIT SCHOOL LOL

772
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:29,027
Don't go, Hijiri!

773
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:31,964
Snitching is the worst!

774
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,232
So annoying.

775
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:35,834
Good morning.

776
00:51:37,102 --> 00:51:39,571
-Shut up!
-She's coming!

777
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,839
She's coming!

778
00:51:40,906 --> 00:51:42,374
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

779
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:46,545
She's here! Come on, she's here!

780
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:49,114
-She's here.
-Good morning.

781
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:54,553
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING

782
00:51:57,523 --> 00:51:58,791
I didn't do anything.

783
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:01,894
She should just quit.

784
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,599
-I was just warning them.
-She's not built for teaching.

785
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,001
I warned them.

786
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:11,236
Bye, Ms. Suenaga.

787
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:30,889
I'm not quitting.

788
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,865
I will not quit.

789
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:44,903
I understand getting disrespected.

790
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:49,007
My appearance, my lack
of experience and abilities,

791
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,076
I get it more than anyone.

792
00:52:53,078 --> 00:52:55,047
Yes, I have a fiancé.

793
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:58,250
To be honest, he's wonderful.

794
00:52:58,317 --> 00:52:59,751
I don't deserve him.

795
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,624
My friends ask me if I hypnotized him.

796
00:53:08,493 --> 00:53:09,394
But

797
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:13,832
I left him behind to be here.

798
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,868
I came because I wanted to see you.

799
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,437
So

800
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:22,341
I will stay by your side.

801
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,010
One day I'll become a teacher

802
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:27,613
you can depend on.

803
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:49,401
I'm starting class.

804
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:51,703
Open your books to…

805
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,138
<i>So your girlfriend?</i>

806
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:55,474
She wants to stay at her school for now.

807
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,110
She'll be teaching a while longer.

808
00:53:58,176 --> 00:53:59,177
Good night.

809
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:01,113
I'm impressed.

810
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:04,383
She seems normal, but she's not.

811
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:09,187
She looks like she wouldn't be interested
in something open, but maybe not.

812
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:10,289
Want to come by?

813
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,156
What?

814
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,691
Want to eat at my place?

815
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:15,227
I have some pickled onions.

816
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:16,828
Um,

817
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,431
is this an invitation?

818
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:21,600
I'm just hungry.

819
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:26,772
So?

820
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:27,673
You coming?

821
00:54:50,262 --> 00:54:51,463
Good morning.

822
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,397
Here.

823
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:55,100
You forgot this.

824
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,476
Your future goals.

825
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:07,612
Submit them soon.

826
00:55:46,118 --> 00:55:47,152

Ms. Suenaga.

828
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,403
I…

829
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,639
I've fallen in love with you.

830
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,444
I've fallen for you!

831
00:56:16,214 --> 00:56:17,049
I don't

832
00:56:18,683 --> 00:56:19,584
have a single clue

833
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,688
about what to do.

834
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:32,931
I want you to fall in love with me too.

835
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:35,667
<i>-She has a fiancé.</i>
<i>-Go out with me, Kawai.</i>

Don't treat me like a kid!
