Your future goals.

Ms. Suenaga.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,974
I…

13
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,210
I've fallen in love with you.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,015
I've fallen for you!

I don't

16
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,522
have a single clue

17
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,592
about what to do.

18
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:15,443
I thought you hated me.

19
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,148
Thank you.

20
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,832
<i>A student told you he loved you?</i>

21
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,668
It's that Kuroiwa boy I mentioned before.

22
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,237
The problematic one?

23
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:48,275
So he was acting out because he had
feelings for you or something?

24
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,746
Go.

25
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,616
He wasn't that serious.

26
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:59,753
He was like
"I've fallen in love with you."

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,654
I think.

28
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,224
"I've fallen in love with you."

29
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:07,027
What is that,
a punishment for losing a bet?

30
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,496
Maybe.

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,464
Most likely.

32
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,033
It's like we're not here.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,639
You got a crush, don't you?

34
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,040
It's all over your face.

35
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,910
I'm so right.

36
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,778
Did you tell her?

37
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,315
Go out on a date yet?

38
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,483
It's not like that.

39
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,521
I heard you and your mom
got in a fight again.

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,027
I'm a pacifist who hates conflict.

41
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,398
I'm happy to mediate whenever you need.

42
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,338
If she doesn't want to tell me,
then I don't care anymore.

43
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,479
-You forgot to say grace.
-Thank you for the food.

44
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,616
-Don't touch--
-It's from Dad.

45
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,418
Stop! Give that here!

46
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,054
You don't need to read it!

AS HIS FATHER…

48
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,657
I WANT TO MEET AKIRA

49
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,399
-And you told Shotaro you can't go?
-Yes, for now.

50
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,971
Will you marry me?

51
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,708
I want to keep teaching here until
my students graduate,

52
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,078
and get married next year.

53
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,113
Then why do you keep eyeing your phone?

54
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,817
I haven't heard from him since.

55
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,285
What?

56
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,056
Shotaro's bummed!

57
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,559
I get it, it's a lot easier
when you decide to get married

58
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,797
get swept up and hitched,
and reach the finish line.

59
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,601
If you miss your timing,
it really dampens things.

60
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,236
-Marriage is momentum.
-Really?

61
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,870
Yeah. It was with us.

62
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,974
I moved in with my husband
three months after meeting him,

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,742
and then got married at Mach speed.

64
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:05,746
Yeah, momentum is really important.
It's the same for all weddings.

65
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,850
-I'm not sure it's like that for everyone.
-It is.

66
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,586
-Is it really?
-I'm telling you it is!

67
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,655
-Mach speed.
-Mach speed?

68
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:19,193
<i>What are you doing next weekend?</i>

69
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,929
<i>Maybe I'll come to Osaka.</i>

70
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,032
KOBOSHIDAIRA

71
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,467
OSAKA

72
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,903
She was so happy when I proposed.

73
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,306
Now she wants to keep teaching.

74
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,177
Like where did all that excitement go?

75
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,913
You thought she'd quit right away.

76
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:46,954
I, the great and handsome Shotaro Kawai
who has everything to offer

77
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:51,091
asked you to be my wife,
so get over to Osaka and take care of me.

78
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,295
You make me sound like a real bastard.

79
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,433
You thought she'd just rush over,
but she pressed pause instead.

80
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,202
I'm sure it hurt your pride.

81
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,272
It's making me a little sad
you putting it that way.

82
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:12,212
I hate that there might be a sleazy
part of me that actually feels that way.

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,781
Yes.

84
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,884
Speaking of sleazy. That night…

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,754
-Is this an invitation?
-I'm just hungry.

86
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,457
So?

87
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,958
You coming?

88
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,199
I graciously decline your offer.

89
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:37,037
I was just offering you dinner
out of the kindness of my heart.

90
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:37,805
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,541
You acted like I was trying
to sleep with you.

92
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,143
I didn't think we should be alone.

93
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,081
But I was overthinking it
since you have a girlfriend.

94
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,055
Whoa.

95
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,257
Wait, um…

96
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,627
What's happening now?

97
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,329
Be careful.

98
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,765
-Up we go.
-Sorry.

99
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,968
I'm a little drunk.

100
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,004
You didn't need to drink that much. Okay.

101
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,108
We're here.

102
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,076
Okay, put on your shoes.

103
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,079
This isn't funny.

104
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,849
Come on, put them on.

105
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,083
Okay.

106
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,653
Watch out!

107
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,792
You're so thin.
How do you even fit your organs?

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,103
What's wrong?

109
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,938
I got off early, so I came to see you.

110
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,112
-Did he force you to drink?
-I didn't do anything.

111
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,651
See you.

112
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,664
They switched to their summer
uniforms today.

113
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,498
Good morning.

114
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,234
-They look so cool.
-Good morning.

115
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,303
Good morning.

116
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,608
Good morning, Kuroiwa.

117
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,278
You're supposed to switch
to your summer uniform today.

118
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,948
I didn't notice until I turned the corner.

119
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,250
It's too late now.

120
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,058
Good morning.

121
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,260
Kuroiwa!

122
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,030
Sorry, thought you were a target.

123
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,866
-What's up?
-Still the winter uniform?

124
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,435
-You did it on purpose.
-No.

125
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,472
-Good morning.
-You have makeup on!

126
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,540
Good morning.

127
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,643
'Morning.

128
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,078
-Hello.
-Hello.

129
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,031
Wait, we're covering that in class now.

130
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,407
Any sections you need help with?

131
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,712
Well…

132
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,584
Let's see.

133
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,465
Why didn't you sit next to me?

134
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,108
I've been thinking since then.

135
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,943
About what?

136
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,152
I don't think loving you is enough.

137
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,125
I…

138
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,164
I want you to fall in love with me

139
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:27,968
too.

140
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,743
Sorry.

141
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,817
That's something I can't do.

142
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,895
EBIHARA, VERY GOOD JOB.

143
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,307
<i>Sorry, I'm visiting my folks this weekend.</i>

144
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,409
<i>I haven't told them we're engaged yet.</i>

145
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,614
<i>I'd like to pay my respects too.</i>

146
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,951
I'D LIKE TO PAY MY RESPECTS TOO.

147
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,086
<i>Okay!</i>

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,463
-You can do it!
-Keep going!

149
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,998
Go, Kuroiwa!

150
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,835
Go, Akira!

151
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,103
Kuroiwa's so fast.

152
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,472
-Go!
-Akira!

153
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,178
<i>I wanted to see Shotaro.</i>

154
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,315
<i>But why?</i>

155
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,891
KUROIWA

156
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,342
<i>I'm going to keep my distance for now.</i>

157
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,385
Sport's Day is coming up.

158
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:43,723
There have been
a number of changes this year.

159
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,292
First, no group gymnastics.

160
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:50,496
For the obstacle course,
we'll place mats under the balance beam

161
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:54,934
and have students remove hair accessories
before they crawl under the net.

162
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,471
-And absolutely no pets allowed.
-Pets?

163
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,541
And make sure they don't pitch
any tents in the schoolyard.

164
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:02,875
Tents?

165
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:04,644
We need to be careful.

166
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:09,315
This is way more concerning,
spreading all these false rumors.

167
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:11,417
We can't delete them fast enough.

168
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:13,586
Stay on top of the information management.

169
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:14,287
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:17,223
HER FIANCE IS THE HEAD OF AN IT COMPANY
HE OWNS AN ISLAND IN THE CARRIBEAN

171
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:23,329
IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT THIRD YEAR
XXXXIWA'S GOT A THING FOR HIJIRI.

172
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,737
THREE-EIGHT

173
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:33,906
Cut it out already.

174
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,209
So that boy was serious.

175
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,778
"I want you to fall in love with me."

176
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:39,712
Very serious.

177
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,848
I don't know how seriously to take it.

178
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:44,617
But I'll be careful.

179
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,185
I'll keep my distance.

180
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,587
Try not to agitate him.

181
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:49,689
Good idea.

182
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:54,427
Just remembered, I bought these
as they were on sale. Here!

183
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,996
Thank you, I will gladly accept it.

184
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,434
What? You're going out?

185
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,337
-I'm going to visit Shotaro's parents.
-His parents?

186
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,405
<i>Just dropping by to pay my respects.</i>

187
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:08,574
You're girlfriend is visiting
your parents?

188
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:10,743
How'd you know?

189
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,111
Konishi told me.

190
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,613
That's scary.

191
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,182
Huh? Word really gets around fast.

192
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,520
-I'll keep to myself then.
-I know your plan.

193
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:24,490
You're going to use your parents
to pressure her to come to Osaka,

194
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:27,326
so she'll be in reach, you sly tactician.

195
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:30,763
I can only imagine what you think of me.

196
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,433
Just a little neighborly warning.

197
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,803
-Yes?
-Families can be tricky.

198
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:41,040
My married friends
all have issues with their in-laws.

199
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:44,210
The sooner the families meet, the better.

200
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,814
I'll take my consultation fee now.

201
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,851
I believe I took care of you
when you got blackout drunk.

202
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,320
Not to mention
I got knocked down for my trouble.

203
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:56,923
She gets jealous easily.

204
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,693
-I have tomorrow's presentation materials.
-Thanks.

205
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,839
<i>I know it's sudden but</i>
<i>would you like to invite your parents?</i>

206
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:13,940
What?

207
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:16,809
Your parents?

208
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,545
<i>I asked my folks,</i>
<i>and they invited them to dinner.</i>

209
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:23,282
-Wait, my parents are going too?
-Their first meeting?

210
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,484
-<i>Is it too short notice?</i>
<i>-</i>Yes!

211
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,820
What will you do? You need to change!

212
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,088
First, I'll call my…

213
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,093
-Hey Mom, can you make it?
-Your hair.

214
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,562
-Let's put your hair up.
-Ow!

215
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,297
Have a nice day.

216
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,668
They're out? Why now?

217
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,705
What's wrong?

218
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,075
The manufacturers are backing
out of the India deal.

219
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:51,410
-What?
-Were the price terms too harsh?

220
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:53,112
Or they got poached?

221
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,248
It's okay, I will convince them.

222
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,550
-Konishi, call the chief!
-Yes, ma'am!

223
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,986
Send this to Vietnam and India.

224
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,789
We're counting on you.

225
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,791
You can't make it?

226
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,494
Sorry, there's a work emergency.

227
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,131
I can't get out of it.
Sorry could you go without me.

228
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,401
What? Just me and our parents?

229
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:17,436
I'm really sorry! I'll call you later!

230
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,337
Wai--

231
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,544
What?

232
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:30,149
-Kawai, good work on your day off.
-What?

233
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:32,184
You may go. Make sure to make it up.

234
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,920
But we're in a crisis!

235
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:38,124
This is Konishi's account, and
the presentation is tomorrow.

236
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,127
To be blunt, you being here
would change nothing.

237
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:44,497
-Maybe, but there's a chance I--
-Are you thick?

238
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:47,066
I'm saying go meet each other's families.

239
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:50,036
Pulling out last minute
will impact their faith in you.

240
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,538
And again, you being here will
change nothing.

241
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,407
That's a bit hurtful.

242
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:58,811
But if someone asks you where you went,

243
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,580
I'll probably have to act angry.

244
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,649
-Just a heads up.
-I won't go then!

245
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,184
I'll be angry now if you don't!

246
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:12,525
Thank you!

247
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:15,328
Hijiri!

248
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:16,595
You made it!

249
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:19,899
-I'm sorry this was so sudden.
-Do you think this outfit is okay?

250
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,601
When I pulled it out, it was so wrinkled.

251
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,503
I frantically ironed it.

252
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,706
You're taking this too seriously.

253
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,975
We're not going to some mansion.

254
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,276
-Right?
-Yeah.

255
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,178
Oh, my…

256
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:37,450
-What an impressive house.
-It really is.

257
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:42,154
-I'm so sorry for the sudden invitation.
-Alright!

258
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:46,225
-And Shotaro can't even make it.
-I'm sorry about this.

259
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,096
-We hate to intrude.
-Thank you for your hospitality.

260
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:51,731
-Honey!
-Sorry.

261
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:53,733
Please excuse me.

262
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,969
-Yes? How did it go?
-Please eat.

263
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,305
He must be busy.

264
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,874
He works sales at an advertising firm.

265
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,910
I'm just your typical office worker.

266
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,581
Why did you want to be a teacher, Hijiri?

267
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,484
It was my dream as a child.

268
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,453
-She copied her friend.
-What?

269
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,623
Remember Miyu from the neighborhood?

270
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,527
She said she wanted to be a teacher,
and you said me too.

271
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,829
No, I have my own reason.

272
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:27,767
I saw a school documentary that moved me,

273
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:32,038
and the students I met through
student teaching were so wonderful.

274
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm sorry about that!

275
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:38,544
So, why did you want to become a teacher,
Hijiri?

276
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:40,780
She copied her friend.

277
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,281
Ow!

278
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,016
-What?
-Have some beer.

279
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,251
Here you go.

280
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:46,619
Thank you very much.

281
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,824
Here you go.

282
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,361
So the wedding will be next year?

283
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,196
Yes, I think so.

284
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,467
You'll be moving to Osaka
after your class graduates, right?

285
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,502
We're discussing it.

286
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,605
-Let me see your bowl.
-Thank you.

287
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,243
Shotaro was assigned
to Osaka for two years.

288
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,848
So I either go there for one year,
or keep teaching at my current school.

289
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:20,086
We can get married first and think
about our options later.

290
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:24,090
What are you talking about?

291
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,058
You should live together once married.

292
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,627
But I want to build
my teaching experience.

293
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:31,730
-So career-minded!
-It's nothing.

294
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:34,834
But Shotaro works for a trading company.

295
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,736
He'll probably be
assigned overseas someday.

296
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,272
Sooner or later, your job…

297
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:46,412
Yes, you should quit.

298
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,852
-More beer?
-Thank you.

299
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:55,955
Actually, how about some wine instead?
I've got a great one.

300
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,926
What made you fall for Shotaro?

301
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,734
Back in college…

302
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:16,642
as part of my outdoor activities group
we went hiking up a mountain.

303
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:20,679
But I was inexperienced and fell behind.

304
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:21,747
It was tough.

305
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:28,053
But there was always
a green backpack in front of me.

306
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:33,292
<i>Everyone had gone ahead,</i>
<i>but it was always there in front of me.</i>

307
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,660
<i>Like a guide.</i>

308
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:40,733
Shotaro has always been my goal.

309
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:45,304
He always gives me inspiration
and the energy to go forward.

310
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:49,542
I know that everything
will be okay if I follow him.

311
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:54,747
I want to be a wife worthy of him.

312
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,184
Not just support him,

313
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,388
but be someone
who can stand alongside him.

314
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,757
That's how I'd like us to be.

315
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:10,396
That's why it's my goal right now
to become a great teacher.

316
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,501
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

317
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:17,703
Well, shoot.

318
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,972
I'm sorry to say
my son isn't that special!

319
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,541
Come on, eat up! You're still young.

320
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,343
Thank you.

321
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:31,283
KUROIWA, GOOD JOB.

322
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,186
<i>Are you getting married?</i>

323
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:43,062
-It was four against one.
-Yeah.

324
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:47,333
The first time our parents are meeting,
and I'm suddenly on my own!

325
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,903
The silence was so awkward!

326
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:56,141
Stop trying to deflect!

327
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,519
I'm not that special.

328
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,756
I'm happy you called me your goal.

329
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:13,158
But I'm not that special.

330
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,295
I'm so boring.

331
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:21,433
Someone in Osaka told me I was boring.

332
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:24,870
That's harsh.

333
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,041
If tired I go to bed at 8:00 p.m.,
plus I watch porn.

334
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,043
You do? You watch porn?

335
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,145
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

336
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,848
Even when there was a work emergency,

337
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:39,518
Ms. Haraguchi was like "we don't need you,
get out of here already!"

338
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,256
I'm glad you made it.

339
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:50,062
I don't deserve such high praise.

340
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,865
I will cherish you.

341
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,971
I guess we shouldn't rush things.

342
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:03,075
You should do what you want.

343
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:07,279
When we get married,
when we start living together,

344
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:09,448
your career path,

345
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,517
you can decide.

346
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:16,288
I will be waiting.

347
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,433
-The pose of confidence.
-What the heck is that?

348
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,169
-Was it funny?
-Yeah, maybe I'll try it.

349
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:32,838
-Next time.
-What? Do it now.

350
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,740
<i>He went back to Osaka?</i>

351
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,109
He made his last train.

352
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,080
Huh? The light won't turn on.

353
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:44,883
What a shabby lifestyle.

354
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,352
<i>So sorry.</i>

355
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:53,258
I can't believe how nice Shotaro's
parents' home was.

356
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,762
We could never invite them
over to our place.

357
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:00,265
But you are so fortunate.

358
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:02,801
You should thank your lucky stars.

359
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,504
I swear, you'll never find anyone

360
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:09,541
that amazing ever again.

361
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:10,576
I know that.

362
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:15,481
<i>But it's good to know</i>
<i>you're working hard being a teacher.</i>

363
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:17,683
I can't reach. Whoops.

364
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,152
So how are your students?

365
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:24,323
Well, we're finally settling in,
so we're on our way I'd say.

366
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,658
You have any troublemakers?

367
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,363
I suppose there's one student
I'm worried about.

368
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:33,365
What are they like?

369
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,835
<i>Good grades, good athlete,</i>

370
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:40,005
<i>but they're unsure of their future.</i>

371
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:42,674
And get strangely aggressive sometimes.

372
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,578
But then tells me they love a poem.

373
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:48,947
<i>Welcome Rain on a Spring Night.</i>

374
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,049
<i>They memorized the poem I taught.</i>

375
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:56,021
Made me glad I became a teacher.

376
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:57,890
Is that right?

377
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:03,462
When I lost all my confidence
and was about to give up, they saved me…

378
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,635
I'm glad to hear it's fulfilling.

379
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:12,771
-I'll come visit soon.
-Okay.

380
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:16,775
Thanks for today. Good night.

381
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:29,822
Who's in love?

382
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,356
Your boy Akira.

383
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:35,160
I noticed he was acting weird lately.
That's when I realized.

384
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:36,995
Acting weird?

385
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,064
Like how?

386
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:40,866
He's always spacing out.

387
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:46,672
He's been spacing out most of his life.

388
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:51,543
When he was a kid,
he'd always wear his shirt backwards.

389
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:57,316
Well, lately he's always listening
to music on his own.

390
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:58,584
Do some work.

391
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:03,422
18, 19, 20, 21,

392
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,691
22, 23!

393
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:09,795
What're you doing, Kokonoe!

394
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,965
Your skirts distracted me!

395
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:14,566
We have pants under!

396
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:17,769
-Come on, stop that.
-You shattered my dreams!

397
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:19,905
-Idiot.
-Cut it out, Kokonoe!

398
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:20,839
Kuroiwa!

399
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,210
Ebihara, can you take over for me?

400
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:26,345
Sure thing.

401
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,782
-Here.
-We're going again?

402
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:33,685
-Good luck, everyone!
-You're leaving?

403
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:37,556
-Sorry.
-Now I've lost motivation.

404
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:44,396
-Where you going?
-Home. I'm ditching.

405
00:25:44,463 --> 00:25:48,400
What about your bag? Kuroiwa!

406
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:54,306
He seems irritated,
and his mind is elsewhere.

407
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:56,909
-I was like that once.
-When?

408
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:00,445
Back when you were a delinquent?

409
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:05,484
-Or when you were in that comedic band?
-Listen, it was a Hawaiian band.

410
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:08,053
I've been watching
Akira since he was a kid.

411
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:13,792
-I can tell that something's off.
-I'm sure he has a crush or two.

412
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:15,093
He's already 15.

413
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,795
<i>Yes, he's 15.</i>

414
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:23,001
<i>I hate to tell you,</i>
<i>but being in love at 15</i>

415
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,606
<i>takes a physical and mental toll.</i>

416
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:31,209
It's not just finding a girl cute.

417
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:35,280
You want to see them, touch them,
and touch them some more!

418
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:39,585
Your head is filled with these
fantasies and desires.

419
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:43,088
That's what being in love at 15 is.
Love in the prime of youth!

420
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:44,823
Love, huh?

421
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:01,106
Here you go.

422
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:02,774
Thanks.

423
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:07,646
-Where's your mom?
-In the warehouse.

424
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,354
I see.

425
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:19,391
It's an all Asian décor. It's nice.

426
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,425
What?

427
00:27:20,492 --> 00:27:22,995
You have a cold or something?
Dosage is hard.

428
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:27,633
We're still 14, but we're almost 15.

429
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,836
It's hard to gauge if
we can take the adult dosage.

430
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,240
I guess you already turned 15 in April.

431
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,778
-Here.
-What did you come here for?

432
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:45,651
You should really forget about Suenaga.

433
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:52,224
I mean, it's partly her fault
for being so friendly.

434
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,893
-Right?
-Go home.

435
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:00,032
She has a fiancé.

436
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,902
You're just going to get hurt.

437
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,004
-And this is an important--
-Enough!

438
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,841
-Go home.
-Fine, I was going to!

439
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:12,511
But at the very least,

440
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:19,551
unlike Suenaga,
I came here prepared to get a little hurt.

441
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:23,889
We have a visitor?

442
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:27,025
Oh, if it isn't Runa!

443
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,861
What are you two…?

444
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:35,367
-Wait, I see…
-No, we're not.

445
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,503
-Really?
-I have to go! We're not!

446
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,807
That's why you two… Wait, Runa!

447
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:51,149
Akira.

448
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:58,356
I'm just going to ask,
how should I be taking this?

449
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:03,462
You know, just to prepare myself.

450
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,564
Am I ready for this?

451
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,768
She

452
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:12,704
creeps me out.

453
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:14,940
About as much as me.

454
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:16,408
What?

455
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:22,447
KOBOSHI JUNIOR HIGH SPORTS DAY

456
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:28,320
Please put your valuables in this bag.

457
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:31,022
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

458
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:37,062
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

459
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:40,265
Thank you.

460
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,168
I'll take it, it's cute.

461
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:48,306
Careful not to get heat stroke.
Make sure you drink plenty of fluids.

462
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,979
Also, did you write your names
on your headbands?

463
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:56,681
-Ugh, just look at them.
-Please check.

464
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,617
What is this, a teen drama?

465
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,219
Maybe I'll also find someone to…

466
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,388
Is there a point to it?

467
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,760
You think you're so cool! Must be nice!

468
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:12,831
-You got so many girls wanting to trade.
-I don't care!

469
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,933
If you can't trade with anyone…

470
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,902
Okay, let's go.

471
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:20,906
-Give it!
-No!

472
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:22,107
What the hell?

473
00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:26,778
Come on, we're heading out.

474
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,617
-Runachi, you got your eye on Kuroiwa's?
-Not really.

475
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:35,353
You could treasure it forever.

476
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,789
Watch out!

477
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,192
Everyone have everything?

478
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:51,401
Three, two, one!

479
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,546
Go!

480
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,215
You can do it!

481
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:11,621
So girly.

482
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,925
I can smell it.

483
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:21,564
You mean my perfume or cleanser?

484
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:28,304
Not from you, but those girls
over there are overflowing with it.

485
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:30,473
What's the goal of Sport's Day?

486
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:36,012
Demonstrate their daily achievements,
deepen their ability for group action

487
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,014
and carry on school tradition.

488
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,150
Yet they've forgotten its true purpose,

489
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:44,821
just screaming and causing a ruckus.

490
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:48,157
But it feels a little nostalgic.

491
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,460
-Nostalgic?
-Yes.

492
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,764
Makes me realize
that we acted like that too.

493
00:31:55,665 --> 00:32:00,436
I feel like I'm transported
back to when I was a student.

494
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,772
You still think that way.

495
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,076
When you reach my age,
you feel just the opposite.

496
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:11,514
I fully realize that I'll never feel
that young ever again.

497
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:20,590
We must protect them

498
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:23,092
at all cost.

499
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,529
-Team Peach wins!
-Yes.

500
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:34,170
<i>Himena in a yellow and blue hat</i>
<i>is looking for her mother.</i>

501
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:38,041
<i>If you know her,</i>
<i>please come by the main tent.</i>

502
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:41,711
Ms. Suenaga!

503
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,682
I'm sorry about before.

504
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:47,984
-Akira must be a handful.
-It's nothing.

505
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,419
Are you off work?

506
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:54,857
I do my best to make it
to events like these.

507
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:58,695
-You can tell how much they've grown.
-Start when I say get set, go!

508
00:32:58,761 --> 00:32:59,662
Even now.

509
00:33:00,863 --> 00:33:02,065
Kuroiwa!

510
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,068
Give me that.

511
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:09,172
-This?
-Yeah.

512
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,076
It'll help motivate me to run
the final relay faster.

513
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:15,878
So…

514
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,249
Trade with mine.

515
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:24,253
I've been worried about Akira's
recent erratic behavior,

516
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,389
then I see they're so close.

517
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:31,060
First loves can be so cute.

518
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:35,498
Exchanging headbands with
your crush seems to be popular.

519
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,871
But seeing him suddenly get a crush,

520
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:45,975
I realize he'll soon start dating
and then get married,

521
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:48,344
and before too long
will be leaving the nest.

522
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:51,347
Yes, one day.

523
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,451
What kind of adult will he become?

524
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,290
As long as he can keep laughing
and he's happy,

525
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,360
that's all that matters.

526
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:10,233
I hope I can help as his teacher.

527
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:12,168
Sincerely.

528
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,440
That's reassuring, Ms. Suenaga.

529
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:20,743
Thank you.

530
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,617
Yuko Kawashima.

531
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:30,286
Kosuke Tsubota.

532
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:34,390
Here you go.

533
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,327
-Ms. Suenaga.
-Here.

534
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:45,401
<i>Okay, all second years gather up</i>
<i>for the ball rolling event!</i>

535
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,905
<i>Gather round!</i>

536
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:52,975
<i>The next event will be</i>
<i>the second year girls'…</i>

537
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:29,643
<i>Yamamoto from Class 3-2…</i>

538
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,914
What is this?
You need to stop messing around.

539
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:38,419
Why?

540
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,924
Why are you actively avoiding
looking at or talking to me?

541
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,796
Is it because I said I liked you?

542
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,667
Of course not.

543
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,804
It may not look it, but I'm pretty busy.
You're overly concerned.

544
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,640
Now come on, the relay is next.

545
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:08,115
<i>Once again, group A for the relay</i>
<i>semi-finals, please come to the gate.</i>

546
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,917
Don't treat me like a kid.

547
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:15,589
Why are you running away?

548
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,729
Let me be clear then.

549
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:24,965
I don't appreciate this.

550
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,800
So stop.

551
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:34,108
I will root for you as your teacher.

552
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,244
Nothing more, nothing less.

553
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:41,715
So please stop.

554
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,398
<i>What is this?</i>

555
00:36:58,933 --> 00:36:59,967
<i>It's not right.</i>

556
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,807
<i>I thought it was supposed</i>
<i>to be something special.</i>

557
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:09,910
<i>Love.</i>

558
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,914
<i>And they're off!</i>

559
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,050
<i>Red team is in the lead…</i>

560
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,658
Ms. Haraguchi is being taken off?

561
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,061
The India project leader is a hard ass.

562
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:27,962
But why?

563
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,231
That mistake of ours…

564
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:33,801
It was a setup from the beginning.

565
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,937
You know the rumors with her and the boss.

566
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,672
It's office politics.

567
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,574
No…

568
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:47,248
-Hey!
-We received a phone call.

569
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:50,551
They'd like another meeting when
they're back next month.

570
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,921
-What?
-We need Ms. Haraguchi.

571
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:57,558
I'm sorry.
I know it's not my place to say this.

572
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,793
-But she's needed.
-Kawai.

573
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,964
She's close with the locals, and being
the boss's mistress is just a rumor.

574
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,567
-She has someone--
-Our presentation was a success.

575
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,571
-What?
-They accepted the deal.

576
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,039
I was just telling the chief.

577
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,876
Is that right?

578
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,913
What's this about the boss's what?

579
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,483
Well, that's…

580
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:25,185
Is an explanation required?

581
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:29,256
Well, I heard what I heard.

582
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,526
-My wing's broken.
-What?

583
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:34,395
I can't believe I had to tell him

584
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:38,065
that there was a rumor
about me and the boss.

585
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:41,201
-My wing's broken.
-You mean spirit?

586
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:43,504
-Kawai.
-Yes?

587
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,573
-You get caught by the dumbest things.
-I'm sorry.

588
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,576
Do you get that my
spirit and wing is broken

589
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,545
because you decided to butt in?

590
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,180
I'm sorry!

591
00:38:53,747 --> 00:39:00,421
I couldn't help myself after I heard from
Konishi that you were being taken off.

592
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:02,790
I'm going to have to throttle Konishi.

593
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:07,027
But it's better now that
the rumor was put to rest.

594
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:11,532
-What?
-Might as well go out with me.

595
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,133
What?

596
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,436
<i>We're down to the final event.</i>

597
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:20,240
<i>It will be the school-wide team relay!</i>

598
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:25,179
We're counting on you, Anchor!

599
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:29,717
Huh? Kuroiwa?

600
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:32,419
You got this!

601
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,490
Huh? Kuroiwa?

602
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:39,059
Ms. Suenaga! Kuroiwa's missing!

603
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:01,446
My keys.

604
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:10,389
Don't hang up, you idiot.

605
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,694
I managed to reach him.

606
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:18,764
He went home because he
wasn't feeling well.

607
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,268
But then he felt better
and decided to go out.

608
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:24,503
Did he mention where?

609
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:26,104
That's when he hung up.

610
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,741
I'm so sorry for causing such a commotion!

611
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:33,578
Please contact us if anything happens.

612
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:37,749
Yes, I'll be sure to give him
a proper scolding later.

613
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,052
-I'm so sorry.
-Take care now.

614
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,889
-I'm so sorry.
-Please take care now.

615
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:44,923
I'm so sorry.

616
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:50,896
I think that wraps things up on our end.

617
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:55,333
I can't believe he went home
right before the relay.

618
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,102
He needs to face consequences!

619
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:02,274
Kuroiwa has caused a little
too much trouble lately.

620
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:06,745
Any reason he might be acting out?

621
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,648
Now come on, the relay is next.

622
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:11,316
I don't appreciate this.

623
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:12,851
So stop.

624
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,254
He's your student.

625
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:23,128
Please work on understanding
what is on his mind right now,

626
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:25,197
or what matters might be troubling him.

627
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:27,833
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,679
I'm exhausted!

629
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:44,816
All right, let's got to Miyoshiya.

630
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:48,954
Not the boxed lunch place,
the place by the beach.

631
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,189
-What about Ms. Shioya?
-She went home.

632
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:53,892
She had to put
together something for the BOE.

633
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,528
-I'll go park my car somewhere first.
-Okay.

634
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,029
We can head there now.

635
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:23,288
KUROIWA

636
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:20,310
Everyone wants to put a label on me.

637
00:43:21,778 --> 00:43:25,148
Women will just get married
and quit right away!

638
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,585
Why tennis?

639
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:31,087
If they don't,
they're mistresses or old maids.

640
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:33,590
Or mentally unstable!

641
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:37,427
Damn it.

642
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:43,800
Or others close themselves off
when they find out I have a girlfriend.

643
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:51,040
But you didn't change.

644
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:52,875
Why not?

645
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,744
Who knows.

646
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,949
Because you're you?

647
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:02,819
What's that mean?

648
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,791
-Huddle up.
-Okay.

649
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:18,134
Hijiri called you her goal?

650
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:20,370
Uh, yes.

651
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,641
You haven't realized a goal is
something that feels distant?

652
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:30,546
There's a chance she's feeling
distant from you.

653
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,686
<i>Living long distance,</i>
<i>you start drifting apart,</i>

654
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:38,121
<i>unable to be honest.</i>

655
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:40,490
Unable to be vulnerable.

656
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:45,294
You gradually become strangers.

657
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,165
Be careful, Kawai.

658
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,637
So I guess being long-distance
isn't going to work, huh?

659
00:44:55,872 --> 00:44:58,408
If you're worried, start making moves!

660
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,212
Damn it!

661
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:05,214
I thought I returned that one!

662
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:07,950
It wasn't bad.

663
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:23,766
What?

664
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:47,290
Kuroiwa, you okay?

665
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:49,092
Did you fall?

666
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:51,327
Did you hit your head?

667
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:03,639
Your leg!

668
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:07,009
Can you stand?

669
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:13,249
Does it hurt?

670
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:26,963
Ms. Suenaga.

671
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:32,101
Please don't come to hate me.

672
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,938
Kuroiwa.

673
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:43,079
Your bone is digging into me. It hurts.

674
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:48,951
Come on, we need to patch you up, okay?

675
00:46:49,752 --> 00:46:52,421
And if someone sees us--

676
00:46:55,825 --> 00:47:00,363
I don't care if anyone sees us.

677
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:05,735
You need to calm down.

678
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:21,217
I'm going home.

679
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:24,821
Hold on.

680
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,569
You think your mom's still working?

681
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:45,608
I'll try calling her again.

682
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,989
So you like that song, Ms. Suenaga?

683
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,024
This?

684
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:06,362
It's not mine, it's his.

685
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:20,743
I wasn't joking when I said it.

686
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:25,348
I love you.

687
00:48:34,523 --> 00:48:40,563
So you can try to twist reality all you
want and try to avoid this situation,

688
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:46,035
but it's just who I am.

689
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:04,620
-Is that the last of it, boss?
-Yeah!

690
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,128
She's not answering. What should I do?

691
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:14,230
Can I take you home?

692
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:18,834
I don't have a key.

693
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:20,970
Oh right, you mentioned that.

694
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,576
We need to treat your leg too.

695
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:29,946
How about the hospital?

696
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:32,081
No, I'm okay.

697
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,460
He's your student.

698
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,600
Okay, I'll take you to my place
to treat you until I reach your mom.

699
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:17,827
I forgot the light was out.

700
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:18,828
Come in.

701
00:50:22,865 --> 00:50:24,567
Wash your wound and wait for me.

702
00:51:13,382 --> 00:51:14,250
Here.

703
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:55,858
Does it hurt?

704
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,161
I'm okay.

705
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:23,652
Can I ask you something?

706
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,028
Why are you…

707
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:40,803
Why are you helping me?

708
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:43,772
Going this far.

709
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,476
You're hurt, I'm doing what any
teacher would do.

710
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:49,478
Is that all?

711
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,975
<i>Am I…</i>

712
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:24,079
<i>being too sensitive?</i>

713
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,021
<i>This isn't good.</i>

714
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,197
Are you okay now?

715
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,101
Kuroiwa.

716
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:49,905
Listen,

717
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,576
I have someone I love.

718
00:53:57,813 --> 00:53:58,714
So…

719
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:16,765
Could I borrow some money?

720
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,070
I'd like to get something
from the store downstairs.

721
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:25,374
Right, you must be hungry.
I'll get you a drink.

722
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:29,044
No, I'll go. I'm worried you might
buy something weird.

723
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:31,814
-But your leg.
-I'm okay.

724
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:33,716
Do you need anything?

725
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:36,218
No, I'm okay.

726
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:15,124
<i>The person you are</i>
<i>trying to reach is not available.</i>

727
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,803
Kuroiwa, I'll just drive you back--

728
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:30,239
I bring gifts.

729
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:36,211
-Thank you.
-Sorry for the surprise.

730
00:55:36,278 --> 00:55:38,747
I had the urge to come see you.

731
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:50,392
Found something.

732
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:53,796
It's Akira's crush.

733
00:55:54,596 --> 00:55:55,464
Really?

734
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:05,374
Isn't this Hijiri his…?

735
00:56:06,075 --> 00:56:07,209
It can't be.

736
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:11,714
Ms. Suenaga?

737
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:33,402
Have you done anything to warrant
these torrid rumors?

738
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:34,570
<i>Kuroiwa's got a girlfriend!</i>

739
00:56:34,636 --> 00:56:36,772
-It's none of your business!
-Of course it's my business!

740
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,974
<i>You can't erase your feelings for someone.</i>

741
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:39,875
<i>It's impossible.</i>

742
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:40,909
