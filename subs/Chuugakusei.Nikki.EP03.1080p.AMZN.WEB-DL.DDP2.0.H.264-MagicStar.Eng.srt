<i>"I want to have fun with you, Hijiri."</i>

00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,343
JUNE 2015

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,013
<i>"That's all I wanted then.</i>

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,751
<i>I wonder if these are my blunder years."</i>

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,988
Why are you helping me?

6
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,091
Going this far.

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,795
You're hurt, I'm doing what any
teacher would do.

8
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,797
Is that all?

9
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,235
<i>This isn't good.</i>

10
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,403
Listen,

11
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,040
I have someone I love.

12
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:41,976
So…

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,045
I'd like to get something
from the store downstairs.

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,781
Right, you must be hungry.
I'll get you a drink.

15
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,182
No, I'll go.

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,791
Kuroiwa, I'll just drive you back--

17
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,660
I bring gifts.

18
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,732
-Thank you.
-Sorry for the surprise.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,501
I had the urge to come see you.

20
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,027
Hijiri, your phone's ringing.

21
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,211
No, I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,213
Yes, goodbye.

23
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,849
The light bulb's out?

24
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,623
You heard me say Kuroiwa, didn't you?

25
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,894
-That was his mother on the phone.
-Hmm?

26
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,497
She managed to reach him.

27
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,500
That right? There we go.

28
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,669
It was so surprising.

29
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,306
I was driving and
I found him after he fell from his bike.

30
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,975
-He had hurt his leg, and…
-Oh!

31
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,043
Yes, it's on!

32
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,314
Okay.

33
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,215
Good.

34
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,751
All done.

35
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:34,955
Hijiri.

36
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,167
I missed you so much.

37
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,375
Me too.

38
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,627
<i>So grown up.</i>

39
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,398
<i>He's really handsome too.</i>
<i>They look good together.</i>

40
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:23,003
<i>I've got no chance.</i>

41
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,846
<i>Like a moth to a flame.</i>

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,320
Akira.

43
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,561
-Let me see it.
-I can do it myself.

44
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,495
It's fine.

45
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,437
How could you just leave
Sport's Day like that?

46
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,638
And get hurt!

47
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,474
Causing your teachers so much trouble.

48
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,377
Hey.

49
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,946
What happened?

50
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,649
Leave this here for me.

51
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,598
How is he?

52
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:30,371
No matter how much I ask,
he doesn't give me a straight answer.

53
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,074
He still mad about the letter?

54
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,949
-Don't touch--
-It's from Dad.

55
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:46,353
Stop! Give that here!
You don't need to read it!

56
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,289
Maybe.

57
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,828
I'm not sure I should be making a big deal
of that Internet post about Ms. Suenaga.

58
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,798
You don't want to come off
as over involved.

59
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,369
I guess I'll have to wait and see.

60
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,775
-You get any sleep?
-Yeah, enough.

61
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,277
-Sorry I only have one pillow.
-It's fine.

62
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,547
Should we go pick one up?
We could drive to IKEA.

63
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:16,984
What's this?

64
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,888
Probably the student from last night.

65
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,790
I'll put them inside.

66
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,370
Great weather.

67
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,817
Yeah, I figured.

68
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,486
I don't appreciate this.

69
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,288
So stop.

70
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,090
She's right.

71
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,699
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

72
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,036
Good morning.

73
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,472
Good morning.

74
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,807
Hey!

75
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,015
Good morning Kuroiwa, how's your leg?

76
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,962
Good morning.

77
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,014
Bye.

78
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,555
Good morning.

79
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,661
-We just parted ways.
-Hmm?

80
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,864
What?

81
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,867
It's a four day study camp.

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,171
Apparently, it was started
last year and was a big hit.

83
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,505
With the parents you mean?

84
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:23,477
-My senior said it was hell.
-No, it's heaven. Study heaven.

85
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,013
-There's no heaven like that.
-Ten hours of studying a day?

86
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,051
Participation is voluntary,
but half of you already signed up.

87
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,887
-It's like cram school.
-No way I'm going.

88
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,391
This isn't for fun.
It's written right here.

89
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,594
This year's theme is
"Independence and self-control."

90
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,430
You all set up your own study plans.

91
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,566
We want you to learn initiative.

92
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,969
-Sounds perfect for you, Kokonoe.
-Yeah.

93
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,237
Too perfect.

94
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,511
XXXXIWA GAVE HIS HEADBAND TO SUENAGA.

95
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,281
KOBOSHI JUNIOR HIGH RUMORS

96
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,485
There's another post on Kuroiwa.

97
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,154
XXXXIWA GAVE HIS HEADBAND TO SUENAGA.

98
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,156
-Headband?
-Is this true?

99
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,425
He didn't say when I asked.

100
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,631
Seems true though.

101
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,301
-You wrote it, didn't you?
-What? No.

102
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,604
-Then who?
-It was you!

103
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,038
No, it wasn't me.

104
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,940
XXXXIWA GAVE HIS HEADBAND TO SUENAGA.

105
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,010
I'm pissed off.

106
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:35,716
Where's Kuroiwa?

107
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,818
He just left.

108
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,858
Kuroiwa!

109
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,467
I think you should date me.

110
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,372
I think you should forget about
Suenaga and date me.

111
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,676
I'm not sure what you want.

112
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,446
I'm never going to fall in love with you.

113
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,552
Fine.

114
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,587
That's okay.

115
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,600
Say it already!

116
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:33,006
You jerk, you're gonna pay for that!

117
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,042
-How did you start dating?
-Huh?

118
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,510
-She confess her love?
-What?

119
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,380
Hey, what are you doing?

120
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,282
Hey!

121
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,855
-That's cold!
-The hell are you doing?

122
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,192
Ow!

123
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,429
Come on, get out.

124
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,799
Ms. Suenaga, Kuroiwa got a girlfriend!

125
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,468
He's dating Iwasaki!

126
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:05,005
Shut up, Kokonoe, you idiot!

127
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,608
Congrats, Runachi!

128
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:12,512
-Stupid Kokonoe!
-When did this happen?

129
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,649
-Just drop it!
-Tell me now!

130
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,650
<i>What is this?</i>

131
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,253
<i>Why do I even feel relieved?</i>

132
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,557
<i>I'm his teacher.</i>

133
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,801
Just shut up!

134
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:39,139
Tell me!

135
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,876
Come on, guys!

136
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,646
Get out of the pool!

137
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:07,323
I was like "What?"

138
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,126
Can you change that fast?

139
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:15,764
Going from "I love you, Ms. Suenaga"
to "I got a girlfriend, so bye!"

140
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,533
That's a sudden turn.

141
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,401
I mean, that's fine.

142
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:23,639
I'm actually relieved because it was
going to get me in trouble.

143
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:26,976
But it does make me question it.

144
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,912
Now I feel a little dumbfounded.

145
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:35,084
He's a young Millennial.
Kids these days are like that.

146
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,521
They're a bit shallow,
but that's what makes them cute.

147
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,324
Women of our generation should be ready.

148
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,293
But I'm a Millennial.

149
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,931
I see, well, here's the border.
Gen X over here, Millennials over there.

150
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,466
Make sure you don't cross it.

151
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:54,203
I told you to stay on your side!

152
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,073
We don't have time for this.

153
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,042
Shotaro really didn't notice?

154
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:04,013
You mean when Kuroiwa came to my room?

155
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,248
As I was going to give him a ride.

156
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:11,587
-Ding dong, Shotaro appeared.
-Plus I was all like "Kuroiwa?"

157
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,759
-Did you just laugh?
-Of course not.

158
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,995
I bet you think
this is all stupid and silly.

159
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,064
Was it that obvious?

160
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,770
But Shotaro doesn't seem to have noticed.

161
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:30,172
He's a special kind of thick.

162
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:35,010
But that kind of person makes
for the best husbands.

163
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:37,813
Or else life gets really testy.

164
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,184
Shotaro is piling up all
the good qualities.

165
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,619
OSAKA

00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,088
-Pretended?
-Yes.

167
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,590
I pretended not to hear.

168
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:52,761
Your girlfriend said the name
of another boy called Kuroiwa?

169
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,863
My danger dodging ability kicked in.

170
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,966
I once got bitten by a leech while hiking.

171
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,968
It's important not to panic.

172
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,938
Just stay calm and spray
some alcohol on it.

173
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,106
It comes right off.

174
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,007
What?

175
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,943
It means it's important
not to react right away.

176
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,416
Besides, that Kuroiwa turned out
just to be a student.

177
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,617
Student?

178
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,388
This one?

179
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,257
There was such a site?

180
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,292
It's crazy.

181
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,727
So much information.

182
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:28,797
"Coworker T might have
the hots for Hijiri?"

183
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,070
"Hijiri is on a car date with a man!"

184
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:35,971
No way!

185
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:38,173
But it's just you.

186
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,043
Hijiri's so cute.

187
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:43,779
Ms. Haraguchi.

188
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:50,686
But they say there's
no smoke without a fire.

189
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:53,655
-Kawai.
-Yes?

190
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:55,023
There are signs.

191
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:59,561
Like when you think back, there
were a lot of strange things going on.

192
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,631
Is this from experience?

193
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:05,033
You could say that.

194
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:07,736
I want a taco party.

195
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:09,771
What? <i>Takoyaki</i>?

196
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:13,242
I want to have a taco party.
I'll bring over some tortillas.

197
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,646
There's been another post!
"The decisive moment!"

198
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:21,817
The students love these types of rumors.

199
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:25,187
Someone is really
proactively posting these.

200
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:26,588
Who is it?

201
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:31,827
Please don't be offended,
but I figure I should ask.

202
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:35,130
Have you done anything wrong?

203
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:36,965
What?

204
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:42,704
Have you done anything
to warrant these rumors with Kuroiwa?

205
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:46,341
-No, not at all.
-I thought as much.

206
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:51,280
Ms. Suenaga is engaged with a fiancé
who comes and visits all the time.

207
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,781
There's no way.

208
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,850
I'll put in a request to delete it.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:58,086
Here's a science test
we gave the other day.

210
00:14:58,153 --> 00:14:59,488
That's a high score!

211
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:02,291
I put in a
really hard question at the end.

212
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,594
A very difficult high school
entrance exam level one.

213
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:08,564
It was about the orbital period of Venus.

214
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,134
Kuroiwa was the only one who got it right.

215
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:17,306
AKIRA KUROIWA

216
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,650
Kuroiwa.

217
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:36,992
DELETE PHOTO

218
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,206
Good luck. Off you go.

219
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,277
Kuroiwa?

220
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,781
Finally, where have you been?

221
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:04,386
That's for the study camp.

222
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,688
I'll submit it later.

223
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,761
Have you found a high school
of your choice yet?

224
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,731
There'll be a seminar at the camp.

225
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:21,270
There are many science oriented schools
as well as tech ones,

226
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:23,538
and others that specialize
in astronomy or biology.

227
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,341
You fill it out?

228
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,278
Yeah, I did.

229
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,647
I was the one who invited him.

230
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,349
-I see.
-Yeah.

231
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,319
That's great.

232
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,056
Let's go, we'll be late.

233
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:44,426
-Bye, Ms. Suenaga.
-Good luck.

234
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,296
Come on, it's biology.

235
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,565
-Biology?
-Yeah.

236
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,348
Let's talk some more about
your future next time.

237
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,285
Really think about high school.

238
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,431
Come on, hurry up!

239
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:23,498
Run!

240
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,336
OSAKA

241
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:36,912
What?

242
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,181
-Surprised?
-Hijiri.

243
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,351
That's too big a reaction.

244
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,722
I had some time today,
so I decided to come visit you.

245
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,225
What are you doing here, Hijiri?

246
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:55,731
-This is, uh…
-Were you in the middle of work?

247
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:56,498
A taco party.

248
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,538
Oh, an office party?

249
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,672
Just us two.

250
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:07,576
Tacos.

251
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:11,046
-Want to eat with us? Come in.
-Hold on, Ms. Haraguchi.

252
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:14,183
-Sorry, you can have your slippers back.
-You're confusing her.

253
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,084
Come in.

254
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:20,055
Breakup?

255
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:24,360
You know, with her girlfriend.

256
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:29,832
I mean, she doesn't seem that affected.

257
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,567
She's like an ice queen.

258
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:37,039
Anyway, maybe she was bored or something,
she suddenly said she wanted a taco party.

259
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:39,675
-Isn't she weird?
-Who'd you call an ice queen? Weird?

260
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:40,476
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,544
Look at what he has.

262
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:45,281
He wants to go on a honeymoon with you.

263
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:47,483
Hey, don't show her those!

264
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:48,550
Here.

265
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,389
SOUTH AMERICAN TOURS

266
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,458
These are the places
I said I wanted to go.

267
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,997
I wanted to go somewhere
off the beaten path with you.

268
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:07,703
It'd be nice if we could go sometime soon.

269
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:11,807
Uruguay.

270
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:14,410
Okay, shall we get started?

271
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,881
-No thanks.
-Vegetarian?

272
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,151
-Do you want some?
-Thanks.

273
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,719
Cheers.

274
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,622
Huh? We're out already?

275
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:29,258
Kawai, beer me now.

276
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,492
Here you go.

277
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,393
Me too.

278
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,598
-You two sure drink a lot.
-Can you blame me?

279
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:39,868
I got transferred to Osaka,
working with a bunch of men.

280
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:42,705
I give my all to work
only to get cheated on.

281
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:43,806
She cheated?

282
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes.

283
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:50,379
She's the one who came after me first,
saying I was the one and everything.

284
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:54,817
And after all that, she suddenly
flipped a switch or something.

285
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,418
Like give me a break.

286
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:57,820
Kawai, beer run, now!

287
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:00,155
Okay, I'm going.

288
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:01,056
See you soon.

289
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:08,697
She was younger, wasn't she?

290
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:11,266
Yes, so carefree.

291
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,736
She led you around?

292
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,504
I'm the adult, after all.

293
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:19,508
I've got my responsibilities,
but she doesn't care.

294
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,045
You don't know what they're thinking.

295
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,847
Yeah, not at all.

296
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:29,218
They always suddenly come and tell
you whatever they want,

297
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:32,654
then when you think they're gone,
you can't tell what they're feeling.

298
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,724
What do you think--

299
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:39,094
Is that from experience?

300
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:40,629
No.

301
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:47,569
It must have been hard for you.

302
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,508
Let's drink tonight!

303
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,309
I'll drink with you.

304
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,211
Here.

305
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:00,849
Here.

306
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:03,852
Cheers.

307
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,867
Boss.

308
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,771
I keep checking,
but it's definitely wrong.

309
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:26,141
The wrong product's been delivered!

310
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,211
Okay, just calm down.
In situations like this…

311
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:33,315
You just need to calm down
in situations like this.

312
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:36,685
You're the one who needs to calm down!

313
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:39,388
I'll ask an associate if they
have any in stock.

314
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,756
If not, I'll have to…

315
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,260
Sorry, I'll call you back.

316
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:51,333
Akira, make sure you talk
with your teachers during camp

317
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,035
and decide on a high school.

318
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,670
The local one is fine.

319
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:57,673
What're you talking about?

320
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:00,876
You need to aim higher or you won't
get into a good college.

321
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,678
I don't need to go to college.

322
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,813
I see.

323
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,316
What'll you do instead?

324
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,086
Become a furniture-maker.

325
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:12,688
Like Dad.

326
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,065
It's your future,
so you need to decide it yourself.

327
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:25,033
You can't blame me for how it turns out.

328
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:28,804
If you're gonna keep hiding Dad from me

329
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:31,974
then I have nothing to say.

330
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,477
You could at least say goodbye!

331
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:46,088
Alright, let's take a group picture!

332
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:47,756
Say cheese!

333
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:48,924
Nice!

334
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:51,026
-Thank you, Ms. Suenaga.
-Thank you.

335
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,962
-You seen this?
-It's you, right?

336
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,964
-Who's writing these?
-Who?

337
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:57,466
Kokonoe.

338
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,502
Read the room.

339
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,840
There you go.

340
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,642
That's a good boy.

341
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,277
Good.

342
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:17,019
What you listening to?

343
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:20,822
What you listening to?

344
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:23,091
Can I?

345
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,463
You listen to this?

346
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,102
Hold on, my bad!

347
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:36,939
Don't delete it!

348
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:40,042
Everyone get ready, we're almost there.

349
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,810
Hurry up.

350
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:53,820
-Everyone turn in your cell phones!
-What?!

351
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:55,222
-Me too?
-Yes.

352
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:56,890
What about an emergency?

353
00:23:56,957 --> 00:24:00,794
If you need to use it for a real purpose,
you can ask your teacher.

354
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,329
I want to check my e-mail.

355
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:05,432
Your e-mail's not going anywhere.

356
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,501
Don't forget to turn your phone off first.

357
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:13,306
Once you turn in your phone,
you can head to your room.

358
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:16,376
Come on, hand them over.

359
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:17,877
Give it up now.

360
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,247
Thank you.

361
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,053
Basically the same.

362
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:28,989
Also comes in.

363
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:33,493
Okay, what happened in
the Asuka period of 663?

364
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,961
-Battle of Baekgang.
-The Taika Reform.

365
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:37,731
Correct. How about 672?

366
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:38,832
-The Jinshin War!
-The Taika Reform.

367
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:40,834
Correct. Then how about 701?

368
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,003
-The Taiho Code.
-Correct.

369
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,304
When was the Taika Reform?

370
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:46,406
Did someone say the Taika Reform?

371
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:49,609
Civilizations don't have
reformations all the time.

372
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:52,912
In this case, what does "courage" mean?

373
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,916
Please explain in 30 characters or less.
Time starts now.

374
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,239
-Uno!
-Damn it!

375
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:23,376
-You scared me!
-We're coming in!

376
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:27,414
I can't believe you came.
How'd you sneak past everyone?

377
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:31,351
It was totally easy.

378
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,755
-Anyone want some snacks?
-Yes.

379
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:56,976
If you're not asleep by the time I come
back, you're sitting in the hallway.

380
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,050
For real?

381
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:06,486
Ow!

382
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,668
-It's another one!
-Really?

383
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:24,204
But we confiscated their phones.

384
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,939
Someone must have hidden theirs.

385
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:27,407
Give us a break…

386
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:29,609
The kids are restless enough as it is.

387
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:32,846
Confess your feelings at a study camp?

388
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:36,483
I guess it's better now
than it used to be.

389
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,686
I mean, not too long ago,

390
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,692
they'd all sing about love on the TV,
how it was all that mattered.

391
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:47,093
Thank you.

392
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:54,801
I mean, love,
especially when you're still a child,

393
00:26:54,868 --> 00:27:00,006
is just a way to escape reality and
seek out approval.

394
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,743
The students need to focus on…

395
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,146
Oh, it's getting late.
We should get going.

396
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:07,180
…objectives.

397
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:08,314
Objectives, yes.

398
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:12,485
You have that point covered.

399
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:14,387
Totally.

400
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:16,523
You already have a fiancé.

401
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:20,527
Mr. Tanabe, it's time you settle down.

402
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,862
If only I had a partner to do it with.

403
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,231
-You know…
-Okay then.

404
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:30,703
I also struggled between
choosing work or marriage.

405
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,641
Someone on a matchmaking date
once told me we were well matched.

406
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:37,944
Never mind, I shouldn't.

407
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,646
No, we're interested!

408
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:40,880
We'd love to hear it.

409
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:42,615
-Really?
-Yes.

410
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:45,518
It's a long story. You don't mind?

411
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:49,756
I can't anymore.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

412
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:53,326
It was Ms. Shioya's
one woman show last night.

413
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:58,097
Iwasaki?

414
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:01,801
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

415
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,070
No.

416
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,574
What's wrong?

417
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,178
I…

418
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:17,417
Kuroiwa dumped me.

419
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:20,787
Sorry.

420
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:25,825
I just don't have…

421
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:30,196
feelings for you.

422
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:40,306
Did something happen?

423
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,484
You tell me.

424
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:55,321
What happened between you and Kuroiwa?

425
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,194
Nothing happened.

426
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:05,098
There's no way that's true.

427
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:08,568
I watch him more than anyone--

428
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:11,204
I already have someone.

429
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,675
I have someone I care about.

430
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:18,011
This puts me in a bad position.

431
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:21,214
Is he your boyfriend?

432
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:23,349
That's right.

433
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,619
But it's long distance, isn't it?

434
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:29,756
That's right.

435
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:36,596
He might fall for someone else
when you're apart.

436
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,835
But I trust him.

437
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,472
Does he trust you back?

438
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:49,842
He does.

439
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:53,947
-Thank you for your time today.
-Thank you.

440
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,615
-Good day.
-Goodbye.

441
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:05,692
Okay, want to grab some food?

442
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:07,360
No, I'm good for today.

443
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:09,128
Have a good one.

444
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:15,568
Bye.

445
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,257
Treat me to dinner.

446
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:41,628
-What?
-I'm really in the mood for meat.

447
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:55,942
The schedule for the India project
is going to be brutal.

448
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:59,278
-Nonstop business trips.
-Shall I go for you instead?

449
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:02,248
-Make sure you cook it well.
-Thanks.

450
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:07,353
I mean, you're so heavily involved.
Isn't it hard?

451
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:09,856
Not at all.

452
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:13,826
I mean, I suddenly find myself
with ample free time.

453
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,095
I can make things go quicker.

454
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:19,198
So you pretend.

455
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:23,136
You pretend to be strong, an ice queen.

456
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,774
I'm starting to understand who you are.

457
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:40,753
I wonder how things would be if I didn't
try to act cool and be more myself.

458
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:44,991
-Here.
-It's not ready.

459
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:45,992
Okay.

460
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:50,997
What about you?

461
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:51,898
Huh?

462
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:55,702
You don't ever try to act
all cool and mature?

463
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:04,610
Something feeling off,
being away from Hijiri.

464
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:08,314
When you both can't sense what
the other is feeling,

465
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,652
it's best to open up and initiate.

466
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,695
Wait, weren't you a vegetarian?

467
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:25,264
I'm macrobiotic.

468
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,266
I eat what I want.

469
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:31,104
I see.

470
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:39,145
Runachi never showed up.

471
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:43,816
It's all your fault.

472
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:46,352
You're acting scary.

473
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,055
Kuroiwa made Runachi cry.

474
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:51,023
-Why?
-He dumped her already.

475
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:53,092
Stupid Kuroiwa.

476
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,561
You suck!

477
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:56,462
Watch it.

478
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:29,428
How about it? Something like this.

479
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:33,633
They're all handmade and one-of-a-kind.

480
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:37,336
I'll write it down here for you.
If you have any issues…

481
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:41,107
What? Boss?

482
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:44,811
Are you okay, Boss?

483
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,181
Boss!

484
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:51,184
Ms. Suenaga.

485
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:57,790
Sorry doesn't cut it!

486
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:08,393
-Stop, Kuroiwa!
-Kuroiwa, stop!

487
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,896
-Stop, Kuroiwa!
-Kuroiwa!

488
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:13,332
What's this commotion!

489
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,766
Ms. Suenaga!

490
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,401
Stop!

491
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,104
What are you doing?

492
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:21,640
Stop this.

493
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:24,009
Kuroiwa, stop!

494
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:25,444
What is going on here?

495
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,947
What are you doing? What happened?

496
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,250
-It's none of your business!
-Of course it is!

497
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,652
You caused a scene.

498
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:37,122
What did you come here to do?

499
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,293
Everyone came to study.

500
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,629
They're doing the work seriously.

501
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:48,000
You just decided
to ruin things for everyone!

502
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:52,437
If you don't want to study go home.

503
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,343
I'm disappointed.

504
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:03,115
This is a crucial time for you.

505
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:08,687
You may think you'll decide your future
sometime down the road,

506
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:12,624
but the high school you choose
will have a profound effect.

507
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,727
Your life will change.

508
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:18,230
And at such a crucial time,

509
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:21,567
all you can do is
disappoint everyone around you.

510
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:25,771
You're throwing away all your
talent and abilities.

511
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:28,273
How disappointing.

512
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:33,478
Come with me.

513
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,948
Are you okay?

514
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,549
You too, Ms. Suenaga.

515
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:38,517
Okay.

516
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:40,586
Are you okay?

517
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,589
-Ms. Suenaga, I'll look after him.
-Thanks.

518
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:52,798
Your mother collapsed.

519
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:58,570
We just received word that she collapsed
at work and was taken to the hospital.

520
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:00,672
You should go to her.

521
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,343
Ms. Suenaga,
please arrange his return home.

522
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,644
Of course.

523
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:11,183
Hey.

524
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,954
Can you tell me what happened?

525
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,928
Why did you attack Ebihara?

526
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,749
The train will be here soon,
take it to the last stop.

527
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:47,819
Mr. Jofu from your mother's work
should come by to pick you up.

528
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:48,720
Here.

529
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:58,130
Yes?

530
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,431
<i>Ms. Suenaga.</i>

531
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:00,999
We just reached the station.

532
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,935
I'll return once he's on the train.

533
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,738
After some questioning,

534
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,708
it turned out he made those posts.

535
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:10,842
What?

536
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:14,646
You know,
all of those posts relating to you.

537
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:19,718
Ebihara was the one behind them.

538
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:26,792
He was also the one
who found your login and password,

539
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:30,662
<i>and sent all those e-mails</i>
<i>pretending to be you.</i>

540
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:38,203
<i>He just uploaded images for fun</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

541
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,137
Michiru!

542
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:42,774
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

543
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:45,610
<i>When he saw the reaction he got,</i>

544
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,315
<i>he couldn't stop.</i>

545
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,286
Crap.

546
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:57,789
WITCHY WOMAN

547
00:37:57,856 --> 00:38:02,194
Ebihara, Ms. Suenaga needs help
carrying some things in.

548
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,662
Okay, I'm coming.

549
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:20,579
<i>Kuroiwa found the tablet and</i>
<i>questioned him.</i>

550
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,319
What the hell is this?

551
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:30,789
"Dirty woman."
"Has a fiancé but will do it with anyone."

552
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:33,091
"Wily." "Witchy woman."

553
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:41,199
My bad, but everyone was eating it up.

554
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,935
It became kinda fun, but I promise--

555
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:44,803
Screw you!

556
00:38:46,505 --> 00:38:50,509
-You hurt Ms. Suenaga!
-Kuroiwa!

557
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,077
Sorry doesn't cut it!

558
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:54,746
Kuroiwa! Let's go!

559
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:57,983
You hurt Ms. Suenaga,
sorry isn't gonna cut it!

560
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:00,152
Kuroiwa!

561
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,953
What are you doing?

562
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:06,258
<i>So I think we should</i>
<i>overlook this incident.</i>

563
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:24,409
Okay.

564
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:26,845
I understand.

565
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:30,782
Goodbye.

566
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,431
Does she have a fever?

567
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:22,601
She's usually around 35 degrees.

568
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:26,605
She said she gets dizzy with
just a little fever.

569
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,874
Your mom?

570
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:37,816
I found a letter.

571
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,218
From my father.

572
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:50,996
I didn't know about it.

573
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:55,367
And she won't tell me.

574
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,806
So before I came to camp,

575
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:05,911
we got in a fight.

576
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,392
"Take a gander, take a gander."

577
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:26,631
Do you know it?
It's an old poem by Mokichi Saito.

578
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:32,304
He wrote it as a song while he was on
a train to see his dying mother.

579
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:37,609
<i>"In Yamagata, my mother is close to death.</i>

580
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:41,479
<i>Make haste so I may catch a glimpse."</i>

581
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:46,384
If you understand how that feels,

582
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:51,890
then you'll be okay,
you and your mom are connected.

583
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,992
She's not dying is she?

584
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,160
What?

585
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,895
No, of course not.

586
00:41:57,462 --> 00:41:59,397
Just a little anemia from overwork.

587
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,600
Is what Mr. Jofu said.

588
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:05,470
Sorry.

589
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:11,543
It's a nice song.

590
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:25,390
What happened

591
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:30,562
with Ebihara.

592
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,599
You can't go punching people.

593
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:39,237
No matter the reason.

594
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:44,609
Even if it's for me.

595
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,082
Mr. Jofu will be waiting at the last stop.

596
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:54,683
What?

597
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:57,352
Huh?

598
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,342
What will you do during summer break?

599
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,443
What?

600
00:44:23,945 --> 00:44:27,616
I'll give supplementary lessons
and coach swimming.

601
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:31,786
I'll also go to IKEA.

602
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:34,256
-Then I'll go with you.
-No.

603
00:44:38,293 --> 00:44:39,494
I see.

604
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,286
Excuse me.

605
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,887
I'm sorry.

606
00:46:46,154 --> 00:46:47,455
Over here, Akira.

607
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,693
Akira.

608
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:54,162
-How's Mom?
-Hello, Ms. Hijiri.

609
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:57,132
-Does she have a fever? Is she awake?
-She's fine.

610
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,013
Ms. Suenaga!

611
00:47:13,948 --> 00:47:15,450
Thank you!

612
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,423
You finally don't look like death.

613
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,458
Thank goodness.

614
00:47:57,992 --> 00:47:59,027
Were you worried?

615
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:04,332
Not really, they already said
you'd be fine.

616
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,210
I was dreaming.

617
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:21,549
Back when we first moved here.

618
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:29,991
You were so worried.

619
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:34,129
Yeah, you were worried about robberies.

620
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:38,366
And also meteors falling from the sky.

621
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:45,840
You said "Because if you leave me,

622
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:49,944
I'll be all alone."

623
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:55,784
I'm sure

624
00:48:58,253 --> 00:48:59,487
you were worried.

625
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:04,359
I'm sorry.

626
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:32,654
Bye, take care.

627
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,322
Great job.

628
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:36,724
-Bye.
-Bye.

629
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:40,428
-Bye.
-Be careful.

630
00:49:40,495 --> 00:49:41,963
<i>She was already released?</i>

631
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,833
Yes, Kuroiwa's mom is okay.

632
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,703
I'm sure he was worried
when he heard she collapsed.

633
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,441
-So she went with him to the last stop.
-What?

634
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:57,045
Ms. Suenaga said she was
worried about his behavior,

635
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:59,848
so she went with him to the last stop.

636
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:02,784
She can be so earnest.

637
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:10,558
I hope this doesn't start
some more stupid rumors.

638
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,357
It made me realize
I didn't have any plans.

639
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:43,892
For summer vacation.

640
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:47,562
He asked me what I'll do.

641
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,266
This would be too far to travel.

642
00:50:51,332 --> 00:50:54,369
So I'm thinking I may go to Osaka.

643
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,139
It could be nice living
like newlyweds at Shotaro's.

644
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:01,442
Kind of like a test run of married life.

645
00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:03,711
So, are you not going with him?

646
00:51:04,913 --> 00:51:06,781
No, I'm not going to IKEA.

647
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:11,920
There's no reason for us to go together,
and it's to buy Shotaro a pillow.

648
00:51:13,254 --> 00:51:14,656
I meant a vacation.

649
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:16,157
What?

650
00:51:17,425 --> 00:51:21,696
I'm asking you if you're not going to go
on a trip with Shotaro.

651
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:28,136
We will, some day.
Probably for our honeymoon.

652
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:32,407
Shotaro recommends a place called
Fray Bentos in Uruguay.

653
00:51:32,473 --> 00:51:33,207
Just stop.

654
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:37,679
Just stop.

655
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,250
You're lying.

656
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:45,153
Ever since you met that boy…

657
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,057
"Nothing would happen with a student."

658
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:53,728
"Just to treat his wound."
"I was worried to leave him alone."

659
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:54,963
All lies.

660
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:57,598
Lying to yourself.

661
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:05,707
Runa!

662
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,545
What's wrong?

663
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,247
Akira went to the drug store.

664
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:15,850
He went to get me medicine.

665
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:18,920
Akira is being preyed on.

666
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,521
What?

667
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:22,523
I'm not sure how much you know,

668
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:27,228
but our teacher Ms. Suenaga constantly
looks over at Kuroiwa during class,

669
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:31,399
totally seducing him,
or ignores him to pull away.

670
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:35,303
She's leading Akira around,
even getting jealous of me.

671
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:40,808
When you were in the hospital, she took
the opportunity to be alone with him.

672
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,878
I don't know if she's a predator
or getting cold feet,

673
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:46,347
but everyone says she's weird.

674
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,649
I'm worried for Kuroiwa!

675
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:58,726
What about Ms. Suenaga?

676
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,131
Excuse me.

677
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:06,734
Runa!

678
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:07,969
Runa!

679
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,379
I'll just say this.

680
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,315
You can't erase your feelings for someone.

681
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:22,817
It's impossible.

682
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,795
<i>Your true feelings will be found out.</i>
<i>Always.</i>

683
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:37,465
<i>No matter how hard you try to hide them,</i>
<i>feelings don't lie.</i>

684
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,272
It may not seem like it,

685
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:46,307
but I know that.

686
00:53:47,742 --> 00:53:51,479
But he takes in what I teach him,

687
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:55,349
and says thank you.

688
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:04,592
Like even someone like me

689
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:09,664
has some value.

690
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:17,772
Before I even realized,

691
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,108
my eyes

692
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,145
would follow him.

693
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:29,784
You know, I've noticed lately.

694
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:34,188
Hijiri's been acting different.

695
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:38,259
Like there's another guy in the picture.

696
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:41,963
You felt that?

697
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,466
Someone was there in Hijiri's room.

698
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:50,204
I was relieved when I found out
it was just a student.

699
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,744
But then I started wondering
if there was someone else.

700
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:02,550
So I'm just pretending.

701
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:06,621
Pretending not to notice.

702
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:24,238
Why do you always pull away
when you talk to me?

703
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:27,642
It's hurtful.

704
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,190
I'm being crazy.

705
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:46,527
Something's wrong with me.

706
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:07,715
He's a student.

707
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:15,189
It'll ruin your life.

708
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,294
I know that.

709
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:24,732
Nothing more will happen.

710
00:56:27,001 --> 00:56:27,868
I promise.

711
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:30,771
Ms. Suenaga.

712
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:32,073
I need to speak with you.

713
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,541
<i>Let's go to the festival together.</i>

714
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:35,476
I want you, Kawai.

715
00:56:35,543 --> 00:56:37,178
<i>I don't deserve to be called a teacher.</i>

716
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:38,412
I don't care what anyone says.

717
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,847
<i>I love you.</i>

718
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:40,881
