00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,271
JULY 2015

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,806
<i>"I was so happy</i>

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,343
<i>I could be kind to you.</i>

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,749
<i>I never imagined it would</i>
<i>turn out like this."</i>

5
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,486
You're lying.

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:20,688
Lying to yourself.

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,723
I know that.

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,594
But before I even realized,

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,965
my eyes would follow him.

10
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:31,999
I…

11
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,769
I've fallen in love with you.

12
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,307
Please don't come to hate me.

13
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,621
<i>I'm being crazy.</i>

14
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,689
Something's wrong with me.

15
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,324
He's a student.

16
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,495
It'll ruin your life.

17
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,264
I know that.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,601
Nothing more will happen.

19
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:10,938
I promise.

20
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,278
Your teaching career is just beginning.

21
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,184
Don't look at me like that.

22
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,387
Remember what you said before?

23
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,857
You fell for your husband after
your trip to Okinawa.

24
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,627
At the hotel pool!

25
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,298
That wiry and ripped plain-faced guy.

26
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,899
Totally my type.

27
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,103
He blew up my swimming ring with ease.

28
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,270
It made my heart beat.

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,374
Yes, that's all it is.

30
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,746
-That's all.
-But that's all thanks to Shotaro.

31
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,552
When you get engaged
you see your life plan ahead of you,

32
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,722
and everything around you
suddenly feels safe.

33
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,195
That's why you start seeking out
something dangerous.

34
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,197
Listen, Hijiri.

35
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:14,468
You need to be grateful towards
Shotaro for your happiness.

36
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,572
You're right.

37
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,642
I totally agree with you.

38
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,925
Good morning.

39
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,993
Good morning.

40
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,695
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

41
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,931
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

42
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,733
Good morning.

43
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,834
Good morning.

44
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,770
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,606
Is it just me, or is Hijiri
in a really good mood today?

46
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,075
Maybe.

47
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,146
Good morning.

48
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,081
Good morning.

49
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:06,620
Today, I'll be announcing the
long-awaited results for your finals.

50
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,622
We haven't been waiting at all!

51
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,357
Quiet down!

52
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,327
Okay, Iwasaki.

53
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,296
Yes.

54
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,332
Akira is being preyed on.

55
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,333
What?

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,169
I don't know if she's a predator
or getting cold feet,

57
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,171
but everyone says she's weird.

58
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,440
I'm worried for Kuroiwa!

59
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,510
What about Ms. Suenaga?

60
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,680
Great job in home economics.

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,748
Thank you.

62
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,018
Ebihara.

63
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,954
What's wrong, Runachi?

64
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,957
Just a bit of self-loathing.

65
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,260
Kuroiwa.

66
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,833
Great job, but your English
needs a little work.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,834
Okay.

68
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,437
Kosaka.

69
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,845
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

70
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,814
I promise--

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,782
-Screw you!
-Stop, Kuroiwa!

72
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,418
What are you doing? Stop!

73
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,689
Stop that.

74
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,359
Hold on, come on.

75
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,426
Give it back.

76
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,128
Not bad, man.

77
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,697
-Sit down.
-Let me get in on this.

78
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,332
Sit down!

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,734
One sec.

80
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,405
With the term ending,
summer vacation is around the corner.

81
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,207
-And summer vacation means…
-Ding!

82
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,742
The Fireworks Festival!

83
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,144
Thank you!

84
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,947
Yes, there's that, too.

85
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,383
But we have the summer course.

86
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,553
-It's a five day course.
-You're not listed as teaching.

87
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,090
Are you going on summer vacation?

88
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,860
That's so unfair!

89
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,295
Don't be like that.

90
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,032
I'll be here to chaperon the festival,
so see you there.

91
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,199
Okay!

92
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:06,073
I guess that means
we'll barely see Hijiri this summer.

93
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,276
Where are we going, anyway?

94
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,479
Summer?

95
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,182
What? That's so stupid.

96
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,954
It's so hot, it's melting so fast.

97
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,460
-Hey.
-Huh?

98
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,696
-I won.
-What?

99
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,130
You won a twofer!

100
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,432
Give it!

101
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,000
-Idiot!
-Trade with me!

102
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,301
You idiot!

103
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:37,371
Don't try to steal my first kiss!

104
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,741
You'll pay for that.

105
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,311
It's still here.

106
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,580
Where you going? A bike?

107
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,549
What's it doing here?

108
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,520
Kuroiwa, did you fall?

109
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,756
Did you hit your head?

110
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,732
Are you serious about Hijiri?

111
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,035
Like for real serious?

112
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,941
You're ambitious, I'll give you that.

113
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,744
You know what your chances are
of it being reciprocated?

114
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,746
Zero! Nothing!

115
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:20,781
You think so?

116
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,815
Hmm?

117
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,921
<i>I'll be here to chaperone the festival,</i>
<i>so see you there.</i>

118
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,823
What, you want to go to this?

119
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,725
Hey!

120
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,828
Don't leave me! Wait! Kuroiwa!

121
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,734
Hey you, that's dangerous!

122
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,102
Sorry!

123
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,107
<i>Okay, this is good.</i>

124
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:52,646
<i>As long as I don't see him</i>
<i>during summer vacation. I'm sure</i>…

125
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,424
Ms. Suenaga.

126
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,494
Ms. Kuroiwa.

127
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,696
Hello.

128
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,532
You're feeling better now?

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,334
I need to speak with you.

130
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,504
About Akira.

131
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,109
Fireworks!

132
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,361
Ms. Suenaga, after the fireworks…

133
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,897
I want you, Kawai.

134
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,468
<i>Saying you were watching Akira,</i>
<i>I was just a little worried.</i>

135
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,069
I like you the way you are!

136
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,573
Iwasaki said that?

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,009
Of course I didn't take her seriously.

138
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,044
But she said

139
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,382
you would watch Akira during class.

140
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,419
During the study camp, instead of
just dropping him off at the station,

141
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,622
you stayed with him
until the last train stop.

142
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,094
After hearing her say all that,
I got a little worried.

143
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,965
For Runa.

144
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,701
What?

145
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:30,442
I'm sorry to trouble
you with this, Ms. Suenaga.

146
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,847
It seems that things
didn't work out between her and Akira.

147
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,487
There's a chance she resents you for it.

148
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,524
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

149
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:52,297
Anyway, she's not acting normal,
so please keep an eye out for her.

150
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,300
Of course, I understand.

151
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,670
Look at the time.

152
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,974
I should get back to work.

153
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,367
KOBOSHIDAIRA FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

154
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,703
That's amazing! Wow!

155
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,083
AKIRA KUROIWA

156
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,523
Ms. Suenaga!

157
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,058
Thank you!

158
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:02,734
THESE ARE VERY GOOD GRADES.

159
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,172
TRY TO FOCUS ON YOUR LIBERAL ARTS STUDIES.

160

<i>The person you are calling is not</i>
<i>able to answer the phone at this time.</i>

163
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,606
Kawai.

164
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,875
Hand in your latest proposal.

165
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,143
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,545
-Konishi, the operator manual?
-Coming up!

167
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,547
-This isn't a soba restaurant.
-Sorry.

168
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,394
Um.

169
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,329
I…

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,699
I appreciate the sentiment, but…

171
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,637
-I have Hijiri.
-I think it's time to go.

172
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,605
-Huh?
-Good night.

173
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,674
U-Um…

174
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,379
-What?
-Nothing.

175
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,414
Oh, right.

176
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,518
You're going to have to go
on the Singapore trip for me.

177
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,619
Singapore?

178
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,122
With Ms. Haraguchi.

179
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,223
What?

180
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,991
We're at the crucial early stage.

181
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,361
The hotel will be the Seawood.
For dinner Bak Kut Teh.

182
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,529
Can you arrange it?

183
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,699
Affirmative.

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,168
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

185
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,281
<i>I was able to take time off this summer.</i>

186
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,783
<i>Can I come visit you?</i>

187
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,986
<i>When?</i>

188
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,289
<i>July 20th to the 24th.</i>

189
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,293
<i>Sorry, they just told me I had</i>
<i>to go to Singapore.</i>

190
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,895
<i>Really?</i>

191
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,698
<i>That's too bad then.</i>

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,317
SUMMER VACATION

193
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,419
Hold up, you guys.

194
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,154
Now you've done it.

195
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,624
-Hold up, Shiraishi.
-Oh, boy.

196
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,760
I can't show this to my mom.

197
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,129
Wanna hang out somewhere?

198
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,665
Shake!

199
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,366
Nice, let's go!

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,601
Shake!

201
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,371
-Score!
-Hey!

202
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,408
-You got two fives!
-Give it back!

203
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,076
Show me!

204
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,515
SWIMMING COMPETITION ENTRY FORM

205
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:40,085
It's never ending.

206
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,655
How do we have more work during vacation?

207
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,659
Three courses in July and
a practice game in between.

208
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,395
-Plus there's "that."
-"That"?

209
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,598
-The fireworks.
-Oh, it's your first time, isn't it?

210
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,001
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!

211
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,136
I hear its known for
its underwater fireworks!

212
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,037
So naive!

213
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,872
You won't get to see them.

214
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,474
We have to patrol.

215
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,211
The students love to wander and
get in fights with rival schools.

216
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,646
Really?

217
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,648
-Ms. Suenaga.
-Yes!

218
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,584
Congratulations on surviving
your first term.

219
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,888
I wasn't sure you
were going to make it at first,

220
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,657
but you managed to get through it.

221
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,328
-Thank you so much for all of your help.
-It's nothing.

222
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,799
It's always tough when you first
get to a new school.

223
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:34,406
The very first junior high I was assigned,
it was such a rough school!

224
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,241
-They had bamboo swords!
-Swords?

225
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,044
Yes, swords! And the principal--

226
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,648
This is a long story,
so I should tell it over drinks.

227
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,118
Ms. Suenaga, this is missing
a parent's signature.

228
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:49,554
-Huh?
-You'll need to get it signed right away.

229
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,057
-Isn't that right, Ms. Shioya?
-Right?

230
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,359
Yes, please do.

231
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,361
And this is missing the course.

232
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,963
-I'm sorry.
-Check it over.

233
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,905
AKIRA KUROIWA

234
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,916
-Oh, Ms. Suenaga.
-Hello.

235
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,087
Akira didn't mention it at all.
I'll sign it right away.

236
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,656
Would you like some tea?

237
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,591
That's okay, I won't be staying.

238
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,927
Ms. Suenaga?

239
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,697
Why are you here?

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,868
She came to get this signed.

241
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:38,703
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,372
-Here.
-Thank you.

243
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,073
-I should be going.
-My future!

244
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,009
Can we discuss it?

245
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,678
Just for a second?

246
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,481
The local high school?

247
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,919
That's all I've really come up with.

248
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:01,393
Come on, why don't you have
a more serious discussion?

249
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,162
You made her stay after all.

250
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,070
What do you want to be?

251
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,542
-What…
-How about this.

252
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,011
Instead of the coming three years.

253
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,717
Imagine the person you want to become,
and think of the steps you have to take.

254
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,619
Can you picture the school?

255
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,758
Think about it over the summer.

256
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,697
KANAGAWA HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAM GUIDE

257
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,140
You've reached the Kuroiwas.

258
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,277
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

259
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,314
Thank you for calling.

260
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:57,849
Yes.

261
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,553
Is that so?

262
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:05,190
I will check things on my end.

263
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,261
Well.

264
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,530
I should be going.

265
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,437
-Ms. Suenaga.
-What?

266
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,540
Yes, I understand.

267
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:27,245
After the fireworks, would you…

268
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,583
Yes, understood.

269
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,151
I'll call back later.

270
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:00,319
Goodbye.

271
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:06,859
Ms. Suenaga.

272
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:07,960
Are you leaving?

273
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:09,662
Yes, excuse me.

274
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,133
I'm sorry for the trouble.

275
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,734
Thank you.

276
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,136
Goodbye.

277
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,104
-Take care.
-Thank you.

278
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,016
Alright! All done.

279
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,219
<i>My five days of summer vacation</i>
<i>have started.</i>

280
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:08,854
<i>How is work coming along?</i>

281
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:10,356
Let's go.

282
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,257
Okay.

283
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,661
<i>I'll start getting things ready.</i>

284
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:20,065
<i>So we can get married next year.</i>

285
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:25,804
<i>Thanks!</i>

286
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:27,573
<i>You're the best.</i>

WEDDING PLANNING 101

288
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,916
HOW MUCH TO SPEND ON THE HONEYMOON

289
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:44,256
All of these sentences
use "to" plus the root verb.

290
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,260
Take this sentence for example.

291
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:51,664
"Buy" becomes an infinitive.

292
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,704
This means purchasing the book was…

293
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:00,606
Kuroiwa!

294
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,743
You want Suenaga's phone number?

295
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,246
Only the parents know this one.

296
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:11,283
I got it easy because
my mom's password is my birthday.

297
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:17,423
Want to go to the fireworks together?

298
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:20,893
You can have the number if you do.

299
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,996
So? I'll be wearing a <i>yukata</i>.

300

KUROIWA

301
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,423
I don't appreciate this.

302
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,158
So stop.

303
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,496
<i>I wasn't joking when I said it.</i>

304
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:32,364
I love you.

305
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,355
KUROIWA

306
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,393
<i>I want to see you the day</i>
<i>of the fireworks.</i>

307
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,603
<i>I'll be waiting at the</i>

308

SINGAPORE

309
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:09,559
Let's go strategize for
the meeting over drinks.

310
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:13,630
What's with that dazed pigeon look?

311
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:16,933
I'm not sure.

312
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,905
What do you think?

313
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:24,674
Um.

314
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,445
Um, what?

315
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:29,946
You know.

316
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,451
Isn't this awkward?

317
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:40,557
Never mind.

318
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:41,925
Let's drop it.

319
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,362
Let's talk about tomorrow.

320
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:49,199
The night I kissed you.

321
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:52,903
I'd been thinking.

322
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:55,739
Something felt strange.

323
00:23:56,706 --> 00:23:58,041
Like in my gut.

324
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:00,810
Or maybe not.

325
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:04,314
But also something exciting.

326
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:06,816
Or maybe not.

327
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,153
Seems really vague.

328
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,089
Which is why I wanted to know.

329
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:15,859
What this feeling was.

330
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,128
Did I fall for you?

331
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,063
Or not.

332
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:22,332
But

333
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,735
I have Hijiri.

334
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:29,873
Your rocky relationship.

335
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,841
We're doing fine, probably.

336
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:35,679
There's probably
someone else in the picture.

337
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:37,080
No, there's not.

338
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:38,581
Probably.

339
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:39,783
Did you ask her?

340
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:41,217
Straight up.

341
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:42,886
What?

342
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:47,624
You need to ask her directly.

343
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,960
"Things have been off."

344
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:52,662
-"Is something going on?"
-Ms. Haraguchi.

345
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:56,032
"If you don't tell me the truth,
then you'd better get to Osaka…"

346
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:59,536
Your own room, please.

347
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,077
Let me know what happens.

348
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:10,981
Knock once for no issue, or if there is…

349
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,386
Knock twice on our wall here.

350
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,022
Good night.

351
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:37,974
So bland.

352
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:43,613
What a fail.

353
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:47,050
MEAT AND POTATO STEW

354
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:50,086
I'LL BE WAITING AT THE
AMANOSAKI SHRINE AFTER THE FIREWORKS.

355
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:58,194
DELETE

356
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:13,443
CAN YOU TALK?

357
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:18,415
<i>Sorry I couldn't be with you</i>
<i>over summer break, Hijiri.</i>

358
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,350
Your trip must be tough.

359
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,254
I just got back to the hotel.

360
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,256
<i>Take a load off.</i>

361
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:28,358
That's right.

362
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,128
<i>I'll be in Tokyo next Saturday,</i>
<i>so I'll try to swing by.</i>

363
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,565
<i>-That's the fireworks.</i>
<i>-Fireworks?</i>

364
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,801
There's a big festival here.

365
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:39,302
You going?

366
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:41,938
With who?

367
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:45,975
<i>I'll be on patrol with the other teachers.</i>

368
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,947
I see, for work.

369
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:56,186
-So…
<i>-Oh!</i>

370
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:58,922
<i>I found a few interesting venues.</i>

371
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:03,726
<i>Look, it has a pool.</i>

372
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:07,197
<i>You can add balloons for 70,000 yen.</i>

373
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:08,098
So expensive!

374
00:27:08,164 --> 00:27:10,133
<i>This one is like a camping style.</i>

375
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,802
<i>You can cut the cake while barbecuing.</i>

376
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,738
-Huh…
<i>-There's so many options.</i>

377
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:17,507
<i>-I'll send the links later.</i>
-Okay.

378
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:57,814
KUROIWA

379
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:28,144
KOBOSHIDAIRA FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

380
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:31,981
<i>You got asked out?</i>

381
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:33,616
To meet today?

382
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,885
The <i>yukata</i> suits you.

383
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:38,721
-So pretty.
-Yeah?

384
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:41,457
Who cares, forget about me for now!

385
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:46,062
Don't tell me you're going to
take up that boy's invitation

386
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,664
and go to the meeting place.

387
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,001
I didn't reply.

388
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:01,211
I already blocked the number.

389
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:03,580
I see.

390
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,117
It's all over now.

391
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,589
That's good then.

392
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,962
Anyway, what is Shotaro up to
during such an important time!

393
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:21,397
He seems busy.

394
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,233
He does text me regularly though.

395
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:29,806
You're not doing this wedding alone,
you two need to share the planning.

396
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:32,542
-Or you'll lose the heat.
-Heat?

397
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,479
Just like tea, if you leave it,
your feelings begin to cool.

398
00:29:37,413 --> 00:29:42,885
Which is why you need to be together,
and keep things nice and hot.

399
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:47,957
Old construction machinery
are simpler compared to newer models,

400
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:50,326
making them easier to repair on site.

401
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,862
To establish this set of businesses,

402
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,032
we should conduct research
on emerging markets…

403
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,905
HIJIRI

404
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,912
Akira, lunch is ready.

405
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:11,547
Later.

406
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:23,426
Act like you can live without that person.

407
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,729
Love works out better
when you think that way.

408
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,264
Strangely enough.

409
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,037
Well, not like things
ever actually work out

410
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:36,572
which is why I'm still single.

411
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:45,782
Not seeing Ms. Hijiri over summer break
might be good for you.

412
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,487
When you fall for a teacher,
you don't have a chance.

413
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:54,891
Why?

414
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:58,394
Why does everyone say that?

415
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,565
Why can't I fall for Ms. Suenaga?

416
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:06,469
Well, because that's the rule.

417
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:10,406
Well, I don't care about
your grown-up rules.

418
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:17,313
But Ms. Hijiri has to
live following those grown-up rules.

419
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:24,287
Eating is a rule.

420
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:33,296
I microwaved it.

421
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,332
TOKYO

422
00:31:47,477 --> 00:31:50,780
Checking social media for
any trace of cheating?

423
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:51,748
You scared me.

424
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:52,915
-Kawai.
-Yes?

425
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:55,151
That's the beginning of the end.

426
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:57,820
It's unbearable to watch.

427
00:31:58,654 --> 00:32:00,056
Stop the act, please.

428
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:06,162
These business trips are exhausting.

429
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:07,997
You think we'll get off early?

430
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:12,235
I need to stop by somewhere,
so I'm only going with you part way.

431
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:13,603
Where are you going?

432
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:15,805
KOBOSHIDAIRA FIREWORKS

433
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,807
That's Hijiri's?

434
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:20,443
Do you want to come with me?

435
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,590
Okay, Ms. Suenaga, your flashlight and ID.

436
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:39,360
-Watch your step around here.
-Okay.

437
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:41,495
-You'll be in charge of the east side.
-Okay.

438
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:44,131
-Let's go then.
-Let's go.

439
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,935
Looks like everyone is having fun.

440
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:48,769
It's nice.

441
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,138
You'd usually come with a boyfriend.

442
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,378
<i>Yakisoba</i>, <i>takoyaki</i>, or something else?

443
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:59,814
Kuroiwa and Iwasaki?

444
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:02,983
When did that happen?

445
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:07,488
<i>Yakisoba</i>?

446
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,023
You ready to eat?

447
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,526
-I'm not hungry.
-You're not?

448
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:14,595
I'm glad they're having fun.

449
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,598
Let's head that way.

450
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:18,599
Hey.

451
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,367
Hey.

452
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:24,004
I told you ahead of time.
Why didn't you dress up like me?

453
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:26,707
I don't own a <i>yukata</i>.

454
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:29,443
It's Sis's boyfriend!

455
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,645
So handsome!

456
00:33:31,712 --> 00:33:33,147
Hey, come on!

457
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:36,016
Go back to Mom.

458
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,585
Have fun!

459
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,790
How big was your family again?

460
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:45,125
It's my mom and five siblings.

461
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,961
My dad got sick and died.

462
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:53,667
Are you like really remarkable?

463
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:56,270
What?

464
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:57,738
Let's go.

465
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:05,880
It's not ripped yet.

466
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:11,519
One more please.

467
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:13,087
Here you go.

468
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,856
I have four, no five.

469
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:17,958
Come on.

470
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,464
-Wait…
-You suck at it.

471
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,935
I got one!

472
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:29,036
YAKITORI

473
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,740
It's been a while since my last festival.

474
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,176
You think you can tell me now?

475
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,145
Why did you come here?

476
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:39,480
Isn't it obvious?

477
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:40,681
I came for…

478
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:41,849
Oh!

479
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,450
-Hijiri.
-Candy apples.

480
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:44,451
What?

481
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:52,893
You're not going?

482
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,330
I don't want to disturb her working.

483
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,065
I see.

484
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,036
Could you find us a seat then?

485
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,305
-I'm going to buy a candy apple.
-Okay.

486
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:22,289
CANDY APPLES

487
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,027
It's beautiful.

488
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,537
Summer!

489
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,541
It's so pretty.

490
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:43,978
Wow!

491
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,481
Kuroiwa, let's go over there.

492
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:52,620
Hurry!

493
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:06,567
Hey, watch it you guys. Be careful.

494
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:08,969
Can you check over that way?

495
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,904
-I'll go this way.
-Okay.

496
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,106
Meet up later.

497
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:18,846
What's this?

498
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:23,384
Is that shaved ice?
Careful not to eat too much.

499
00:36:23,884 --> 00:36:24,985
Okay, sorry.

500
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,094
-Joffe.
-Yes?

501
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:37,598
You don't need to go see the fireworks?

502
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:40,567
I have sensitive eardrums.

503
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:42,102
Thank you.

504
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,072
So I don't like fireworks.

505
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:49,443
Which is why I'm in an
environmentally friendly Hawaiian band.

506
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,577
Ta-da!

507
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,281
-What about you, Boss?
-Hmm?

508
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:57,785
How about it?

509
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,255
You used to go out all the time.

510
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,090
Lucky you.

511
00:37:03,157 --> 00:37:05,359
That's ancient history.

512
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:26,480
You know,

513
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:29,750
I feel so good right now.

514
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,455
You said before,

515
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:37,591
that you're prepared.

516
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,426
But at the very least,

517
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:44,298
unlike Suenaga,
I came here prepared to get a little hurt.

518
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,670
You're strong and remarkable.

519
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:54,708
And I've just…

520
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

521
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:05,986
I told Ms. Suenaga

522
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:09,022
that I loved her.

523
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:11,091
What?

524
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,794
But she didn't take me seriously at all.

525
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,631
And everyone keeps warning me.

526
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,336
TAKOYAKI

527
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,610
I just…

528
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:35,749
want to have fun with her,

529
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:38,719
and be nice to her.

530
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:42,122
That's all.

531
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,133
I just want

532
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,435
to punch you.

533
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:57,738
What?

534
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,841
You tick me off so much!

535
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,463
Excuse me.

536
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,101
Ms. Haraguchi!

537
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,069
Why are you here?

538
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:13,904
And you, Hijiri?

539
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:15,773
Why are you so rattled?

540
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,175
Oh, I'm not.

541
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:20,678
Kawai's here too.

542
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:21,812
With me.

543
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:23,280
What?

544
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:26,717
Do you love Kawai?

545
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:30,020
Why would--

546
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,355
Answer me, Hijiri.

547
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:35,159
Do you love Kawai?

548
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:40,998
Yes.

549
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:45,536
More than anyone else?

550
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,438
He's number one?

551
00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:00,418
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
what this is about.

552
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,521
Of course I love him.

553
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,623
We're engaged.

554
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:08,025
We're getting married.

555
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,728
Why?

556
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:12,596
You don't have to.

557
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:18,369
If there's someone else,
what's wrong with that?

558
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:23,707
You know,

559
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,978
now I'm interested.

560
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,051
To see plain old Hijiri hold such passion.

561
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:41,325
It's interesting, and it'd be
a disservice for you not to enjoy it.

562
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,430
Pretending to be normal,
worried about society.

563
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:47,798
Hiding your true self.

564
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,302
Now, that's lame.

565
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,145
Have a proper talk with Kawai.

566
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,181
Or else nobody can

567
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:08,018
progress any further.

568
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:12,456
And that's a problem for me.

569
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:17,027
What do you mean by that?

570
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:22,366
Ms. Suenaga.

571
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:24,768
Long time!

572
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:26,270
How've you been?

573
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,207
I should get back to work.

574
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,780
-Keep up the good work.
-You too.

575
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:03,340
ENTER PINCODE

576
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:07,011
HIJIRI

577
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:08,779
I WANT TO SEE YOU THE DAY
OF THE FIREWORKS.

578
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:16,887
<i>Attention all attendees,</i>

579
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:20,491
<i>the Koboshidaira Fireworks Festival</i>
<i>has concluded.</i>

580
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:26,096
<i>Please ensure you have all of your</i>
<i>belongings as you make your way home.</i>

581
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:27,565
I can't.

582
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:28,465
I give up.

583
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:30,334
You can have the rest.

584
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,402
No answer.

585
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,038
Maybe she's still working.

586
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,212
I want more.

587
00:43:43,314 --> 00:43:44,148
Of what?

588
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:45,616
Of you.

589
00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:52,423
So…

590
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:57,094
if you guys are having trouble,

591
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:03,834
and it looks like you're heading into an
unhappy marriage, I'll stop it.

592
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:09,473
So tell me.

593
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:14,144
If it's one knock or two.

594
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:22,486
Good job tonight.

595
00:44:22,553 --> 00:44:23,787
So strange.

596
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:26,724
I can't believe nothing happened.

597
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,093
This year was nice and mellow.

598
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:31,795
Lots of students came
with family this year.

599
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:40,004
Oh it's Sis!

600
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,138
Nice, right?

601
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:42,640
Did you have fun?

602
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:43,974
Okay, folks.

603
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:49,380
This year was miraculously uneventful.

604
00:44:49,446 --> 00:44:51,315
Good work, everyone.

605
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:54,952
We'll be entering summer break now.

606
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:00,457
But kids these days are harder to read.

607
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:04,261
There will always be signs
if someone is troubled.

608
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:09,633
Please keep a careful eye out
for your students.

609
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,435
Thank you.

610
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:30,721
Excuse me, I have to get off.

611
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:39,797
You know,
I think she said her boyfriend's here.

612
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,498
Or maybe not.

613
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:43,000
Which is it?

614
00:47:28,572 --> 00:47:30,974
SHOTARO

615
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,391
Ah! No!

616
00:47:58,902 --> 00:47:59,736
Ms. Suenaga.

617
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,684
What are you doing?

618
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:18,488
It's dangerous.

619
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,626
Also, people will think you're crazy.

620
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:32,936
Hot!

621
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:35,172
Oh, crap!

622
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:40,043
It's over already?

623
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,511
What about you?

624
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:43,881
Why?

625
00:48:44,615 --> 00:48:45,616
Why?

626
00:48:48,252 --> 00:48:50,988
Because you never showed up.

627
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:56,793
Here.

628
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:00,597
Please wear it.

629
00:49:01,932 --> 00:49:04,134
There's a lot of glass around here.

630
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:08,505
But then you'll cut your foot.

631
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:15,746
I wanted to see you

632
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:19,349
to ask you something.

633
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:24,955
How do you feel about me?

634
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,693
I wanted to hear it directly from you.

635
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:34,865
So, how do you feel?

636
00:49:49,813 --> 00:49:50,647
I…

637
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:55,585
I'm getting married.

638
00:49:58,755 --> 00:49:59,923
I know.

639
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:03,393
He's a really great guy.

640
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:05,495
I know.

641
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,302
Smart, and positive.

642
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:16,239
When I'm with him,

643
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,977
I feel like I'm getting pulled up.

644
00:50:24,114 --> 00:50:29,319
Not as the failure I am,
but to make me a better, more positive--

645
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:31,221
I like you as you are now!

646
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,659
I like you the way you are!

647
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,365
Even if it

648
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:45,369
has to be an affair.

649
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:54,344
I can't do that.

650
00:51:01,918 --> 00:51:02,919
Then.

651
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:06,289
Be with me,

652
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,592
just for today.

653
00:51:10,827 --> 00:51:12,329
Then I'll…

654
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:17,601
give up on you.

655
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:25,442
And what would we do?

656
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:30,447
I…

657
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:36,086
I want to be kind to you.

658
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:41,458
You being my teacher,
me being your student,

659
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,360
you having a fiancé…

660
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:46,930
Just forget all that.

661
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,968
I want to get to know you.

662
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:56,139
I want you to learn--

663
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:59,910
So once you get to know me,
you'll be able to forget me?

664
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,344
Yes.

665
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:05,515
Even if learning more,

666
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,154
could make you fall harder for me.

667
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:15,826
But if I don't forget--

668
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:17,094
Sorry, never mind.

669
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:20,564
If I don't, I'll get you in trouble,
as my teacher!

670
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:24,668
Don't call me that.

671
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:38,882
I don't deserve to be.

672
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,552
I don't deserve to be called a teacher.

673
00:52:52,362 --> 00:52:53,663
<i>What is this?</i>

674
00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:57,367
<i>Making me embarrass myself.</i>

675
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:00,137
<i>Not giving me an answer.</i>

676
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,106
<i>It's all</i>

677
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:05,976
<i>becoming a pain.</i>

678
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,313
What is it

679
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,350
that you want to do?

680
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:19,856
I want to go home.

681
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:25,862
Honestly, me too.

682
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:57,994
May I do it again?

683
00:54:01,231 --> 00:54:02,065
Calm down.

684
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:03,767
I don't care what anyone says.

685
00:54:06,603 --> 00:54:07,437
I…

686
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:11,174
I love you.

687
00:54:57,254 --> 00:54:58,588
<i>I was happy.</i>

688
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:02,125
<i>So happy that I could be kind to you.</i>

689
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:08,031
<i>I was happy just with that.</i>

690
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:14,137
THREE-EIGHT

691
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,325
<i>"I was so happy</i>

692
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,663
<i>I could be kind to you.</i>

693
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:42,265
<i>I never imagined</i>

694
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,002
<i>it would turn out like this."</i>

695
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:02,852
Akira!

696
00:56:29,913 --> 00:56:32,449
How dare you use my Akira
as some plaything!

697
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:33,917
<i>Don't make Ms. Suenaga quit!</i>

698
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:35,118
That was a mistake!

699
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:38,088
-Get married and go to Osaka.
<i>-Ms. Suenaga!</i>

700
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:39,856
I'll never see him again.

00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:40,890
