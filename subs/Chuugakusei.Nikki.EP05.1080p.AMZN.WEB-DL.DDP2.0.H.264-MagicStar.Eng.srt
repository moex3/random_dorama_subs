00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,125
Don't call me that.

00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,395
I don't deserve to be.

7
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,837
I don't care what anyone says.

8
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,674
I love you.

00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,437
Akira!

10
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,812
We're going home.

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,947
No.

12
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,584
Akira.

13
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,353
Akira!

14
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,355
Don't make me angrier.

15
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,304
I ran a bath, you should clean your foot.

Shotaro.

17
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,645
I have to talk to you.

18
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,847
About everything.

19
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,850
-That was--
-You don't have to say it.

20
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:32,887
I trust you.

21
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,159
That was your student, Kuroiwa, was it?

22
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,494
The one giving you all that trouble?

23
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,431
You were trying to be a good teacher,
and he dragged you in.

24
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,332
But I--

25
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,334
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

26
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:54,341
Although, you should
address it for his parents' sake.

27
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,344
You need to nip this in the bud.

28
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:21,802
You know,

29
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,740
I'm in love with Ms. Suenaga,
and I kept telling her.

30
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,377
Then she also--

31
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,279
Don't be an idiot!

32
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,985
You're still in middle school.

33
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,054
A child.

34
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,590
Forget about her.

35
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,160
-No.
-I'll never let you meet her again.

36
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,863
-This isn't okay.
-I don't care what you say.

37
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,735
No matter what you think,
you won't get to be with her.

38
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,938
It's not just me, society won't allow it.

39
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,542
-So let it be over--
-It's not over!

40
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,044
I'll marry her one day!

41
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,747
Have you lost your mind!

42
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,451
Go wash your face and snap out of it.

43
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,970

<i>It's Shioya.</i>

Yes.

Where is it?

57
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,175
Your phone's not here.

58
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,912
Your mom's canceling it.

59
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:52,946
What?

60
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,748
After she stops by your school.

61
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,785
School?

62
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:12,966
Excuse me.

63
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,751
Sit down.

64
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:51,138
You're being accused of sexual misconduct.

65
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:57,411
From the first day you started
up until the events of last night,

66
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,181
please tell us everything
that has occurred.

67
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:51,851
Looking back,

68
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,888
from the very beginning

69
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,392
he was different from the other students.

70
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:01,160
Kuroiwa.

71
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,195
You okay?

72
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,563
Did you hit your head?

73
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:11,370
Please! You need to stop annoying me.

74
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,874
Nothing went well when I first started.

75
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,678
When I was feeling at my lowest, he…

76
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,380
"The good rain knows its season,

77
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:24,116
When spring arrives, it brings life."

78
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:28,120
He recited something I taught the class.

79
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,092
He depended on me.

80
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,728
Kuroiwa, did you fall?

81
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:37,963
Did you hit your head?

82
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:42,501
Please don't come to hate me.

83
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:49,041
I'm an inexperienced teacher,
when Kuroiwa showed interest in me,

84
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:53,145
he gave me the support I needed.

85
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,486
I was also having wedding doubts.

86
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,989
I wasn't sure

87
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:06,959
if it would work out.

88
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,664
So rather than face reality,

89
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,568
being with Kuroiwa

90
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:18,437
gave me excitement,

91
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,210
<i>and heartbreak like I was back in school.</i>

92
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,214
<i>When Kuroiwa sensed my feelings,</i>

93
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:31,450
he was even harder to stop.

94
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,788
And last night,

95
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,658
on the way home from the fireworks,

96
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,163
I ran into him.

97
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,635
And we kissed.

98
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,343
I regret it deeply.

99
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,013
It was thoughtless

100
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:03,649
and foolish.

101
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,155
RESIGNATION LETTER

102
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,160
I will quit teaching.

103
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:18,230
I will never go near Kuroiwa again.

104
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:25,371
When Akira was born,

105
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,908
he was 3,080 gram.

106
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:33,279
He became yellow,

107
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:35,948
and was taken to an incubator.

108
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,552
He cried through the night,

109
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,154
and was quite the handful.

110
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:49,595
When he got a high fever,
and passed out after foaming at the mouth,

111
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,565
I took him to the emergency room.

112
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:58,070
I thought there was an earthquake
but it was just me shaking.

113
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,607
He was a late talker,

114
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:06,412
so I'd check out three picture books
from the library every week,

115
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,348
reading to him every night,

116
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,718
until we both fell asleep.

117
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:19,625
The reason I worked so hard every day

118
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:23,162
raising my son the best I could

119
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,466
was to make him a respectable person.

120
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,503
To have a good life.

121
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:33,872
Ms. Kuroiwa!

122
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,311
Not so you could have your way with him.

123
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,615
He's not a present for you.

124
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,317
-Ms. Kuroiwa.
-Wedding doubts?

125
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,853
I don't care!

126
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:52,124
How dare you use my Akira
as some play thing!

127
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,659
Who do you think you are!

128
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:56,962
Your anger is justifiable. But please.

129
00:12:58,063 --> 00:12:59,565
Please refrain yourself.

130
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:18,951
Did you think you would be allowed
to make this decision for yourself?

131
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:25,924
Kanagawa Prefecture
Juvenile Protection Ordinance article 31,

132
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:28,761
"No juvenile should be subjected

133
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:34,066
to a sexual act or indecent behavior."

134
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,870
Such a crime will be punished.

135
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:41,807
You have both failed as a teacher

136
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,177
and as a person.

137
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,682
The school will internally discuss
your discipline.

138
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:52,718
You are to remain at home
in the mean time.

139
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,720
Do not come to school.

140
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:58,457
And do not interact with any students.

141
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:00,659
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,494
I understand.

143
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:04,897
I am truly

144
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,667
sorry for everything.

145
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,914
Oh, boy, that's hot.

146
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,582
Hot.

147
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,084
Okay.

148
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,586
Okay.

149
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,328
Akira.

150
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,997
I made you some cold noodles
with sesame dressing.

151
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,036
Akira?

152
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,711
<i>He got me.</i>

153
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,433
Ms. Suenaga!

154
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,414
Ms. Suenaga.

155
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:29,848
Are you okay?

156
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,652
-What did my Mom say?
-Leave it.

157
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,889
Just go home.

158
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:41,994
Ms. Suenaga?

159
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:48,534
Kuroiwa, what are you doing?

160
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:53,138
You aren't allowed contact until
her discipline is decided.

161
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,506
Discipline?

162
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:56,341
Your mother already left.

163
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:57,910
You should--

164
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,411
Kuroiwa!

165
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:27,606
Ms. Suenaga.

166
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,679
What do they mean discipline?
Are you quitting?

167
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,848
-That's right.
-Will I never see you again?

168
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:38,584
That's right.

169
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,488
Are you marrying him?

170
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:45,858
That's right.

171
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:50,996
Sorry, just forget about me.

172
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:51,897
No.

173
00:16:51,964 --> 00:16:53,031
That was a mistake.

174
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:54,266
No.

175
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,200
It was wrong.

176
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,368
Why?

177
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,373
Because you're fifteen!

178
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,627
-Ms. Suenaga!
-Kuroiwa!

179
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,663
-Kuroiwa!
-Please don't make Ms. Suenaga quit!

180
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,964
Please!

181
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:29,301
I'll quit instead!
I'll drop out of school!

182
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:32,337
-What are you saying?
-You can't quit.

183
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:35,874
Then I won't talk to her or even
look at her face!

184
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:37,576
I'll give up.

185
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:41,713
So please, let her stay at the school.

186
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:43,081
I'm begging you!

187
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:45,450
Please!

188
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,211
OSAKA

189
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,447
-Your girlfriend's coming?
-Hey.

190
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:21,084
You finally get to have
that newlywed life you wanted.

191
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:23,486
Sorry to move on without you.

192
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:25,388
So annoying.

193
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:28,525
But leave the wedding party to me,
I give great speeches.

194
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:29,693
Thanks.

195
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,505
Weird and suspicious.

196
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,007
What is?

197
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:46,776
Last night at the fireworks,

198
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:50,814
Hijiri wasn't answering your calls
and was mysteriously missing.

199
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,517
Things were off, now this sudden turn?
You're moving in together?

200
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:56,019
I see.

201
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,588
Don't laugh. Stop it.

202
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,824
What do you want me to do?

203
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,427
What happened last night?

204
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,696
Well,

205
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:12,102
we talked afterwards,
and Hijiri decided to quit and move here.

206
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,638
Things just worked out this way.

207
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,740
-She's quitting teaching?
-Yes.

208
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,608
When she cares about it so much?

209
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,810
This all seems fishy.

210
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,817
Which means I…

211
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,352
You know,

212
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:31,788
can't grant you your request.

213
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,623
I want more.

214
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,625
Of what?

215
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,027
Of you.

216
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,706
Congratulations, I'm happy for you.

217
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:07,824
I thought I'd find you here.

218
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,392
No, you can't.

219
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,627
Think long and hard.

220
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:15,065
The more you try to talk to your teacher--

221
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,066
Hold up.

222
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,802
The worse you make her situation.

223
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:22,505
If you really care about her,
you can't see her, okay?

224
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,374
Hey!

225
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,610
Your bike! Akira!

226
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,927
<i>Hijiri is being disciplined!</i>

227
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,261
Disciplined?

228
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,263
Kuroiwa came by and told me.

229
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,199
Why is she getting disciplined?

230
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,376
Does it involve Kuroiwa?

231
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,513
Something about his mom
catching them together.

232
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,215
What, sexual misconduct?

233
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,118
Where's Kuroiwa now?

234
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,286
He asked to borrow money.

235
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,255
Money? Why?

236
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,792
He wanted to go somewhere.

237
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,295
-My name is Kuroiwa.
-Okay.

238
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:23,900
I'm looking for Mr. Shotaro Kawai
from the Construction Department.

239
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:26,736
Mr. Kawai from where?

240
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:33,042
There are a lot of companies in
this building, can you tell me which one?

241
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,178
Oh, right, um…

242
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,048
You there.

243
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:41,918
Are you Young Kuroiwa?

244
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,957
Here you go.

245
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:51,294
What's this?

246
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,495
Juice.

247
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:55,932
Thank you.

248
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,202
You prefer coffee?

249
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,838
I'm out of touch.

250
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:05,642
I barely interact with middle schoolers.

251
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:08,311
You saw this and came here?

252
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,312
SHOTARO KAWAI

253
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,917
Where is Mr. Kawai?

254
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,451
Out of the office.

255
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,688
Looks like you came for nothing.

256
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:22,926
So Hijiri's being disciplined.

257
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:26,796
It's my fault.

258
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,003
So what's your plan when you meet Kawai?

259
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,807
I don't know.

260
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,810
Tell him to give you Hijiri?

261
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,280
Would that work?

262
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,283
I doubt it.

263
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,156
If I see him,

264
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:56,726
then maybe something would change.

265
00:22:57,594 --> 00:23:00,797
Maybe he'd understand if we talked.

266
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:03,733
I did a lot of thinking.

267
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:07,937
Because

268
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,940
Hijiri is the only one for me.

269
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:14,544
You know,

270
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:17,180
that's nice.

271
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,716
Having one person for you.

272
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,253
It's nice feeling that way.

273
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,189
It seems like nothing,

274
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,292
but it feels like everything.

275
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,063
I'm impressed, kid.

276
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:38,034
I'm Akira Kuroiwa.

277
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:42,171
You're just a boy.

278
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,875
So go home.

279
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,177
I'm sure your mom is worried.

280
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:55,852
If you don't leave,
I'll call the cops to take you.

281
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,758
If you're frustrated,

282
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,494
then grow up fast,

283
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:06,029
young lad.

284
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,002
Thank you very much.

285
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,479
KOBOSHIDAIRA SPORT'S DAY

286
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:39,789
Where have you been!

287
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:43,126
Akira!

288
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,462
-Let go!
-Come on!

289
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,497
Hurry up!

290
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,371
If you pull something like this again,
I'll call the school board

291
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,573
and have that woman fired.

292
00:25:58,741 --> 00:26:00,176
This isn't a bluff.

293
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:04,180
If she's the reason

294
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:09,519
you're acting this crazy,
then I'll hold her responsible.

295
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:13,022
If you don't want that to happen,
then stay here

296
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,359
and sit tight.

297
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,694
Wait!

298
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,667
Okay.

299
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:26,836
I'll do what you say.

300
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:32,742
I'll study if you say so,
and if you tell me to give her up,

301
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:38,781
then I will.

302
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:41,617
So please,

303
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:47,890
I'm begging you.
Don't let Ms. Suenaga quit.

304
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,626
Please!

305
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:52,829
Please!

306
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:55,932
I won't do anything until

307
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,969
we hear from the school.

308
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,272
Please.

309
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,578
Iwasaki.

310
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:09,846
Good morning.

311
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:09,846
What's this about?

312
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,616
Is Ms. Suenaga quitting?

313
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:15,319
Who told you that?

314
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:17,955
Please tell me.

315
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:19,857
What happened with her and Kuroiwa?

316
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:22,059
Something scandalous?

317
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,995
Then she'll have to be fired.

318
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:30,301
It can't be wrong for a male teacher,
but okay for a female teacher.

319
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:36,507
Do you want Ms. Suenaga to quit?

320
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:40,711
Probably…

321
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:44,982
Yes.

322
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:50,020
But it's not because I hate her.

323
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:52,690
Not that I like her either.

324
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:58,696
But I feel myself becoming a worse person.

325
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:03,434
I can't stop myself anymore.

326
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,804
It's hard.

327
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:15,279
Did they decide?

328
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:16,213
Yes.

329
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,617
They just called.

330
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:25,556
They will be treating my resignation
as voluntary retirement.

331
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:28,192
Hijiri.

332
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:29,560
But

333
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,596
I don't care about that.

334
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:34,231
What?

335
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,532
I'm just

336
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,336
so sorry for Kuroiwa.

337
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,473
I wasn't able to stop

338
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,277
or redirect the feelings
he expressed to me.

339
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:50,281
And I wasn't able to

340
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:55,286
guide my other students either.

341
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,229
I was never suited for this.

342
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,066
I will

343
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:12,803
never teach again.

344
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,507
So quit and do what?

345
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:20,244
Shotaro told me to come to Osaka.

346
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:25,783
But I'd just be taking advantage
of his kindness again.

347
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:33,123
I'm trying to decide
if I shouldn't go home.

348
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:35,960
Okay.

349
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:39,964
Then let's go.

350
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,266
Go where?

351
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:46,236
SUENAGA

352
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:55,145
Go and tell your parents.

353
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,315
That you fell for a student and got fired.

354
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,151
Did you actually think?

355
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,287
About how this happened.

356
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:08,125
After everything I said,
why did you go cross the line?

357
00:30:08,192 --> 00:30:10,995
I guess that's all
being a teacher was to you.

358
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,332
Something you can easily give up.

359
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:20,671
Well, if that's the case, go tell
your supportive parents

360
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,573
everything that happened.

361
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:27,077
Hijiri?

362
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:36,653
It's been so long, Ms. Chizuru.

363
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:40,524
What's the matter, Hijiri?

364
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,235
-Where's Dad?
-He went to the driving range.

365
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,937
After I did all this cooking.

366
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:59,242
Why don't you stay and eat?

367
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,177
Okay.

368
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:06,816
Here.

369
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,652
Come on, sit down.

370
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:12,054
Thank goodness.

371
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,091
It didn't have to go to waste.

372
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:17,693
Here you go.

373
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,534
Thank you for the meal.

374
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:33,709
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:40,116
I'm sorry, Mom.

376
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,620
I had to…

377
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,657
quit the school.

378
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:51,661
The wedding

379
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:55,197
is probably off.

380
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:02,938
I fell for a student.

381
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,144
We got caught when we were together,

382
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:11,981
so I had to leave.

383
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:22,558
Does Shotaro know about this?

384
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,528
Yes.

385
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,838
If Shotaro doesn't mind,

386
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,408
you should still get married.

387
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:41,310
What?

388
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,511
If

389
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,214
he's able to forgive you,

390
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,251
you should go through with the wedding

391
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:51,921
and move to Osaka.

392
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:53,956
But I--

393
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,558
You fell for someone else?

394
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,096
Are you going to be with him?

395
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,434
It's not impossible.

396
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,903
You could run away together,

397
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,441
and then you could find another job,

398
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,678
and wait until his
compulsory education is over.

399
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:21,784
Once he turns eighteen,

400
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,086
then you could get married.

401
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,126
Can you picture all that?

402
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:35,631
But Shotaro

403
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:41,337
despite knowing everything
still asked you to come to Osaka.

404
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,740
I don't deserve it.

405
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,944
I'm sure it'll work out.

406
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:53,482
-I can't imagine it.
-No.

407
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,452
It will.

408
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,158
Because, Hijiri,

409
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,327
you'll be forever grateful.

410
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,031
That's what's important.

411
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:13,402
That you owe a debt to them.

412
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:18,140
The man who saved me and changed my life.

413
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:24,480
That kind of thinking
will lead you to a good marriage.

414
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:32,521
You can find happiness with Shotaro.

415
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,926
You will make him happy.

416
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,500
I'm cooking, go take a bath.

417
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:18,467
Wait, what?

418
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:28,644
It's almost done.

419
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,079
Thank you.

420
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,961
Find comfort in food in times like these.

421
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:47,696
Macrobiotic.

422
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:52,067
The way to find balance in your food.

423
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:53,402
Huh…

424
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,245
Call me crazy,

425
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,982
but you don't look like a man
looking forward to married life.

426
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,752
I'm perfectly happy.

427
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:13,222
Kawai, this isn't like you.

428
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:21,697
It's time to stop.

429
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:23,899
Your special ability…

430
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,369
Turning a blind eye,
pretending not to hear,

431
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,737
acting like it's all okay.

432
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,976
You don't need to act tough.

433
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:36,879
Eat, sleep,

434
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:39,281
and feel better.

435
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:45,287
My competition

436
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:48,591
is a middle school kid.

437
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:03,739
Thank you for the meal.

438
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:12,414
Thank you for the meal.

439
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:27,596
Akira, I heard you haven't
touched your food.

440
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:31,200
Are you on a diet?
Or is this a hunger strike?

441
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:34,937
Pardon me.

442
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:43,545
I brought you your favorites.

443
00:37:58,293 --> 00:37:59,628
It was for the best.

444
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,297
It's good Ms. Hijiri quit.

445
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:07,770
She can't rely on a man
who gets all sullen like this.

446
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:10,606
No wonder you have everyone worried.

447
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,142
If you want people's respect,

448
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:17,379
then you'd better step up as a man.

00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,330
Yeah.

456
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:10,966
I'll come pick you up soon.

OSAKA

Huh? Kawai took the day off?

464
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh, he said he was going to go
pick his girlfriend up.

465
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,669
He's pretty thorough that way.

466
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:30,879
-This as well.
-Okay.

MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHING, CAREER GUIDANCE

468
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,226
<i>Hijiri is leaving!</i>

469
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:45,127
What?

470
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:49,231
I saw a moving truck
when I went by Hijiri's place.

471
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,733
She's leaving today.

472
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,801
You need to go!

473
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:53,702
Go see her.

474
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:58,407
I admire you for real.

475
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,679
I never thought Hijiri
would look your way.

476
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:07,416
I thought your chances were zero.

477
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,719
Go over there

478
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:14,056
and nab Hijiri!

479
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,726
Bro friendship attack.

480
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,000
Where are you going?

481
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:26,835
No.

482
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,172
You can't!

483
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,206
Stop!

484
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:34,209
-Why not?
-If you go, there's no coming back.

485
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:37,980
Your emotions will overwhelm you,
and take over your thoughts.

486
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:40,949
You'll ruin your life!

487
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:43,118
-You don't know that!
-I do!

488
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,455
I was the same!

489
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:48,223
Come with me!

490
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,961
There's something I haven't told you.

491

KOSUKE SHIMAZAKI

492
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:23,311
As I told you,

493
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,316
your father left when you were five.

494
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,587
Because he was struggling with work,
right?

495
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:37,292
That's the reason
I gave you for our divorce.

496
00:42:46,134 --> 00:42:47,035
But I

497
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,405
fell in love with someone.

498
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:52,907
What?

499
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:56,111
He helped me after your father left.

500
00:42:57,145 --> 00:43:00,515
He was an architect who bought
your father's furniture.

501
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:03,985
Being with him was fun.

502
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:06,187
I became obsessed.

503
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:11,860
After the divorce I thought
I would move us in with him.

504
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:14,295
But he had a family too.

505
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:16,231
It didn't work out.

506
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,135
I thought I could never recover.

507
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:22,504
But you will forget.

508
00:43:23,705 --> 00:43:27,575
No matter how strong your feelings
are now, you'll forget with time.

509
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:32,247
It's like suddenly waking from a dream.

510
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:36,051
There is no such thing as a one and only.

511
00:43:36,818 --> 00:43:38,453
It's just temporary.

512
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,558
No matter how much you regret it
afterwards, it'll be too late.

513
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,261
You won't be able to take it back.

514
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,596
-At your age--
-I'm not like you!

515
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:53,134
Don't compare me to your stupid life!

516
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,703
Wait, Akira!

517
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,904
Akira!

518
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,537
Ready to go?

519
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,239
Yeah.

520
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,042
You told him about the letters?

521
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:39,581
I wanted him to listen.

522
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,421
You think he went to see Ms. Hijiri?

523
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:55,230
I wish she'd just disappear from
our lives already.

524
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:26,694
I don't care what anyone says, I love you.

525
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,598
Just forget about me, that was a mistake.

526
00:45:30,665 --> 00:45:31,800
No.

527
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:32,834
It was wrong.

528
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:34,002
Why?

529
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,504
Because you're fifteen!

530
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:42,043
Ms. Haraguchi. Here you go.

531
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,278
Thanks.

532
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:56,324
Because Hijiri is the only one for me.

533
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,698
My competition is a middle school kid.

534
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,069
Seriously…

535
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:11,606
What the hell am I doing?

536
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:17,946
I'll just be a sec.

537
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,085
Hello?

538
00:46:25,186 --> 00:46:26,054
<i>You're sure?</i>

539
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,623
You're okay with all this?

540
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,124
What now?

541
00:46:32,894 --> 00:46:34,028
I'm frustrated.

542
00:46:34,662 --> 00:46:35,496
What?

543
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:39,133
You're better than this.

544
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,470
Deep down you're
more dependable than you look.

545
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:45,106
But still a little ditzy,
yet good at your job.

546
00:46:45,173 --> 00:46:47,275
You are a man with great qualities.

547
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:53,715
I want you.

548
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:56,851
I love you.

549
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:02,590
But Kawai,

550
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:07,695
<i>you're just acting like a chump trying</i>
<i>to keep the two of them apart.</i>

551
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:09,964
<i>It makes me frustrated.</i>

552
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,800
You know it deep down.

553
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:15,403
She found someone.

554
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,008
Hijiri met someone
she loves more than you.

555
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:32,553
He's in middle school.

556
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:34,789
<i>Yeah, he is.</i>

557
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:37,492
So she distanced herself.

558
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:40,194
But he's the one she loves.

559
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,364
<i>If you're happy, then fine.</i>

560
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:44,465
But if not,

561
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,202
then it's not okay.

562
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:53,308
<i>Kawai, I'll ask you one more time.</i>

563
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:57,178
Are you really okay with all of this?

564
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:20,568
Sorry.

565
00:48:57,472 --> 00:48:58,573
That's…

566
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:10,985
<i>"I wanted to express how deeply sorry I am</i>

567
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,089
<i>for all the trouble I have caused.</i>

568
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,725
<i>While it was only for one term,</i>

569
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:21,729
<i>I was very happy with the time</i>
<i>I spent with everyone</i>

570
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:23,865
<i>as a teacher.</i>

571
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,602
<i>I loved the sounds</i>

572
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:30,505
<i>of the students in the halls.</i>

573
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,642
<i>I loved teaching.</i>

574
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:39,647
<i>I truly admired all the teachers</i>

575
00:49:41,149 --> 00:49:42,583
<i>dedicated to the students.</i>

576
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:47,789
<i>And yet I ruined everything for myself,</i>

577
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:51,859
<i>and I'm truly sorry for it."</i>

578
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:55,763
SINCERELY, HIJIRI SUENAGA

579
00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:59,667
I can't believe she fell for a student.

580
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:03,037
She's not suited for the work.

581
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:08,242
THE TEACHER I ASPIRE TO BE
BY HIJIRI SUENAGA

582
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:14,215
I wish

583
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:19,921
I could've taught her more.

584
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:29,757
Ms. Suenaga!

585
00:51:40,168 --> 00:51:41,135
Ms. Suenaga!

586
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:54,916
Ms. Suenaga!

587
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:58,586
Ms. Suenaga!

588
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,623
Hijiri!

589
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:06,194
Hijiri!

590
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:08,162
Hiji--

591
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,588
Hijiri!

592
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:41,495
I decided my future!

593
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:44,932
GENERAL COURSE

594
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:49,537
I'm going to

595
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:51,906
be an adult soon!

596
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:55,443
So

597
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,511
don't go!

598
00:52:58,813 --> 00:52:59,914
Wait!

599
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:04,986
Hijiri!

600
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:26,340
Shotaro.

601
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:28,109
Stop the car please.

602
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,578
No, I don't want to hear it now.

603
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:33,748
Please stop the car.

604
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:47,528
I can't go with you.

605
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:51,499
As things are

606
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,601
right now

607
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,738
I can't marry you.

608
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:01,642
Don't tell me

609
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:03,778
you're going back.

610
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,550
I'll never see him again.

611
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:14,322
But being with you in this situation

612
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:17,992
I'd just be taking advantage of you,
making things--

613
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,827
And whose fault is it!

614
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:25,366
Whose fault is it that we're in
this stupid, shameful situation…

615
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,469
You even know what I--?

616
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:43,250
I'm sorry.

617
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:58,899
Then

618
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,371
you should be alone

619
00:55:07,508 --> 00:55:08,542
and lose everything.

620
00:55:48,315 --> 00:55:49,583
<i>And then</i>

621
00:55:51,419 --> 00:55:53,020
<i>you disappeared.</i>

622
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,325
<i>From this town.</i>

623
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,836
<i>It was the summer when I was 15</i>

624
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:20,881
<i>when you disappeared.</i>

625
00:56:34,395 --> 00:56:35,229
<i>Then</i>

626
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,300
<i>I turned eighteen.</i>

627
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:40,868
