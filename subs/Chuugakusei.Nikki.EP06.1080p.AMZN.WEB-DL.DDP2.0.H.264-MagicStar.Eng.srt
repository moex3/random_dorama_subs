00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,639
<i>"Ms. Suenaga.</i>

2
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:10,811
<i>Back then I was a little crazy.</i>

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,447
<i>I'd get irritated for no reason,</i>

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:15,816
<i>and lose control.</i>

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:21,589
<i>To a point where I couldn't see</i>
<i>myself or my surroundings.</i>

6
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,993
<i>That's how much…</i>

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,431
<i>I loved you."</i>

8
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,733
I LOVED YOU

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,668
You're being accused of sexual misconduct.

10
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,003
RESIGNATION LETTER

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,772
I will quit teaching.

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,042
What do they mean discipline?
Are you quitting?

13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,077
-That was a mistake.
-No.

14
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,679
-It was wrong.
-Why?

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,648
Because you're fifteen!

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,385
Ms. Suenaga!

17
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,486
Hiji--

18
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,529
Hijiri!

19
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,698
I decided my future!

20
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,568
I'm going to be an adult soon!

21
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,571
So don't go!

22
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,442
Hijiri!

23
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,678
<i>"And then</i>

24
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,614
<i>you disappeared.</i>

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>It was the summer when I was 15</i>

26
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,054
<i>when you disappeared."</i>

27
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,660
WHEN YOU DISAPPEARED

28
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,417
How about a class reunion?

29
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,119
We're doing a reunion?

30
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,154
When?

31
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,555
Next month?

32
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,993
Nice, it's been like three years
since we graduated junior high.

33
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,263
Easy for you to say when you
don't have exams.

34
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,165
I'm taking over our family liquor store.

35
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,001
I'm thinking of inviting Kuroiwa.

36
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,569
What?

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,205
-Kuroiwa?
-He may not come anyway.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,441
He won't.

39
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,144
He stopped coming to school.

40
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,514
-We didn't even graduate together.
-Have you not seen him either?

41
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,616
Nope.

42
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,854
Not since the fireworks.
Zero explanation, zero contact.

43
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,088
Absolutely nothing!

44
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,492
I thought we were friends.

45
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,100
Just kidding!

46
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,637
-Not to mention Suenaga suddenly quitting.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,640
There were lots of rumors,
like she ran away with Kuroiwa.

48
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,944
-Or Kuroiwa got her pregnant.
-Or had a shotgun wedding.

49
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,947
Or she got abducted by aliens!

50
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:33,981
That didn't happen.

51
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,284
I wonder where she is now.

52
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,153
<i>Probably a housewife.</i>

53
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,489
Here is your fried chicken
and potato salad lunch box.

54
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,258
-Thanks.
-Please come again.

55
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,761
-The seaweed and chicken set.
-Right away.

56
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,364
-One seaweed and chicken set.
-Got it.

57
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,733
Your change is 200 yen.

58
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,137
I'm off then.

59
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,640
Have a good one.

60
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:03,978
Welcome!

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,736
KOMIYA DAI-ICHI ELEMENTARY

62
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,111
Hijiri!

63
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,946
That's Ms. Hijiri!

64
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,716
-Thank you!
-My pleasure. Here.

65
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,318
Oh! It's from our store!

66
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,655
Did you get forced to help again?

67
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,456
Just a little bit.

68
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,792
Yuto's mother needed to go to the dentist.

69
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:56,230
-You're so kind, Ms. Suenaga.
-Let's play, Ms. Hijiri!

70
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,334
Later, I have some work to do now.

71
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,503
Yes!

72
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,739
Now you've done it!

73
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,110
Hit them over there!

74
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,545
Ready?

75
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,551
-You must be disappointed, Ms. Chizuru.
-What?

76
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:22,122
Ms. Suenaga took your throne
as queen of the campus.

77
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,291
Don't be ridiculous, Nogami.

78
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,694
I got inducted in the hall of fame.

79
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,931
I passed the torch to my protégé.

80
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,399
I'm a generous woman.

81
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,969
You're so kind, even though
you typically hate young women.

82
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,073
What are you talking about?
I like the troubled ones.

83
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,877
Does Ms. Suenaga have a boyfriend?

84
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,246
There it is! You've asked a hundred times.

85
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,949
No.

86
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,617
Maybe twice.

87
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,520
Oh, yes. You're not interested at all.

88
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,762
Come on, Hijiri!

89
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,365
It's Ms. Hijiri!

90
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,805
It's so nice we got a good teacher.

91
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,606
Throw it!

92
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,007
She's great with the kids.

93
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,410
She used to teach junior high.

94
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,380
She came here after her
engagement fell through?

95
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,783
So Ms. Suenaga has some baggage?

96
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,186
Well, I wouldn't know.

97
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,255
Really?

98
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,193
Why did her engagement fall through?

99
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,864
What happened?

100
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,133
I need to lock up the gym!

101
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,100
I forgot!

102
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,279
Catch it, Yuto!

103
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,248
Ow.

104
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:55,783
Tachibana!

105
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,317
You okay?

106
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,622
That must hurt.

107
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,656
Are you okay?

108
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,098
Just a little scrape, you're all okay now.

109
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,900
Thank you.

110
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,671
Were you in the library again today?

111
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,144
I love this book too.

112
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,547
The cat is so cute.

113
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,282
Do you like it, too?

114
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,425
<i>Please! You need to stop annoying me.</i>

115
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,397
Mosquito.

116
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,766
What? Mosquito?

117
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,634
Oh, my!

118
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,903
That was a good catch!

119
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,806
You caught me by surprise.

120
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,075
Thank you.

121
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,612
-Can I see you, Ms. Hijiri?
-Okay.

122
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,316
To her home?

123
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,686
Her mom should be home.
Would you mind walking Tachibana home?

124
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,089
Of course, I'll need to explain
her injury anyway.

125
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,495
That's part of it, but she hasn't
turned in the field trip fee yet.

126
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,830
Could you collect it?

127
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,198
-Yes.
-Also.

128
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,935
I haven't seen her mother around lately.

129
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,271
Check on her for me.

130
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:26,874
Understood.

131
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,386
Here?

132
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,267
Mom.

133
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,538
Hello.

134
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,173
Ms. Suenaga, thank you so much.

135
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,110
-So today, Ayano--
-I heard she fell!

136
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,112
Thank you.

137
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,548
Also, there's a field trip--

138
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,316
Right, the payment.

139
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,451
-I'll send it with her tomorrow.
-Okay.

140
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,326
-Sorry, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

141
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,738
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

142
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,753
<i>She sent you away?</i>

143
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,624
Yes, it seems she had a guest over.

144
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,759
She said she would
send the payment tomorrow.

145
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,328
So the rumors were true.

146
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,598
-Huh?
-She's got a man or something?

147
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:01,168
But she's a single mother,
she's free to find romance.

148
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,738
Still, I hear men are constantly
coming and going.

149
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,641
Her family is a bit complicated.

150
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,675
Complicated?

151
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,944
You didn't know?

152
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,114
The Tachibanas are big landowners.

153
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,084
But Ms. Miwa, that's Ayano's mother--

154
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,119
She graduated from here.

155
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,955
She cheated on her husband
with his best friend.

156
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,492
-It was forbidden love.
-That's right.

157
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,197
They knew it was wrong,
but I bet they just lost control.

158
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,734
-It must have been hard.
-She got divorced.

159
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,871
And moved into an old family
property to raise Ayano alone.

160
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:39,773
How shameful.

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,878
-It's a small town.
-Rumors get around quick.

162
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,647
Once out, it's curtains.

163
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,682
Heaven forbid.

164
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,089
-Ah, shoot.
-Are you okay, Hijiri?

165
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,257
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,065
I'm heading home.

167
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,604
See you soon.

168
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,206
-Bye.
-Be careful.

169
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,977
<i>It was forbidden love.</i>

170
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,514
How dare you use my Akira
as some play thing!

171
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,450
Who do you think you are!

172
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,918
I had to…

173
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:00,954
quit the school.

174
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,291
I fell for a student.

175
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,160
<i>Rumors get around quick.</i>

176
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,234
MACHIGURA CITY MARKET

177
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,174
-I'd like this.
-Okay.

178
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,878
I'm so glad I could buy the same one.

179
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,947
I was sure he said it was bought here.

180
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:31,118
The principal is away today,
so you can replace it without him knowing.

181
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,620
Sorry to make you come with me.

182
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:37,524
Please, you're always helping me
as my assistant teacher.

183
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,262
Sorry.

184
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,730
Sorry.

185
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,199
Sorry.

186
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,034
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

187
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,878
I wanted this book.

188
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,147
This looks useful for class.

189
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,421
They're cheap, we should buy a few.

190
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,322
Let's.

191
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,977
AUTUMN READING

192
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,499
You picked a good one!

193
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,035
-Take your time.
-Okay.

194
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,171
It's almost cherry blossom season.

195
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,873
Yes.

196
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,376
Not bad, right, Ms. Suenaga?

197
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,613
Ms. Suenaga?

198
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,971
Once an offender, always an offender.

199
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,505
What happened three years ago?

200
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,874
Suenaga? Who's that again?

201
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,141
<i>I'm interested in you.</i>

202
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,879
What if they find out
and it ruins the life I have now.

203
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:01,565
Hold on.

204
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:09,907
-Something wrong?
-What?

205
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,910
I just wanted to look over here too.

206
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:14,912
Oh!

207
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,481
These are cute too.

208
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,116
Yeah.

209
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:21,885
That's nice.

210
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,555
-We could decorate our office.
-Yes.

211
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:27,124
-Look!
-That's huge.

212
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:30,894
I wonder how many would fit.
We could give everyone one.

213
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,299
We could all pitch in.

214
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,301
Hey, Akira.

215
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,870
Look at the treasure I found!

216
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,805
I saw something Sayuri would like.

217
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,607
Was it jewelry?

218
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:46,377
Sayuri likes emerald green, right?

219
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,812
Yeah, she likes emerald green.

220
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,387
Shall we get going?

221
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:57,287
Sure.

222
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:05,963
Because you're fifteen!

223
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,665
I'm going to be an adult soon!

224
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:18,206
Akira?

225
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,975
How's he been lately?

226
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:23,011
You have nothing to worry about.

227
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:28,483
Every day, he wakes up early

228
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,654
to do his workbooks,

229
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,223
and goes back to studying when
he comes home.

230
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:39,661
Thank you for taking care of him, Mother.

231
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:43,465
Akira, I got a birthday card.

232
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:44,766
-Write something.
-Okay.

233
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:48,537
Your mom's here.

234
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,912
Your place is close to his school,

235
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:01,550
and because you and Joffe
are looking after him,

236
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,885
he was able to settle down.

237
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:06,221
Here.

238
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:09,024
That reminds me.

239
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:12,928
Here is this month's room and board.

240
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,898
And this is for your birthday.

241
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,633
Happy birthday.

242
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,403
You all have been so lovely today.

243
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:36,384
Don't worry, he'll come around soon.

244
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:43,592
I should get going.

245
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,028
Do you have a second?

246
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:52,467
-You saw her?
-At the market in Machigura.

247
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,637
It was really her
and not just a look alike?

248
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,472
It was definitely her.

249
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,642
<i>I almost shouted in surprise.</i>

250
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,778
Did Akira notice her?

251
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:05,280
No, but it was a close one.

252
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,051
It's been three years now.

253
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:12,053
I'll never let you meet her again.

254
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,356
This isn't okay.

255
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,091
I don't care what you say.

256
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:17,526
I'll marry her one day!

257
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,195
Have you lost your mind!

258
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:21,930
<i>That summer,</i>

259
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:25,233
I ripped them apart

260
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,669
to get my little boy back.

261
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:30,739
But now he hates me,

262
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,642
and won't even see me.

263
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,445
I'm sure he's just mixed up emotionally.

264
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:41,449
You'll get there eventually.

265
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:47,989
His exams are coming up.

266
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,692
Then off to college.

267
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,230
<i>He'll probably live on his own,</i>
<i>get a part-time job,</i>

268
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,632
<i>and get his driver's license.</i>

269
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:01,570
If he just grows up a little year by year,

270
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,905
I'll be happy.

271
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:09,878
How was she?

272
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,546
She seemed well.

273
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:13,949
She was with a guy.

274
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:16,918
Maybe she got married.

275
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,254
She had a fiancé, didn't she?

276
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,689
TOKYO

277
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:26,461
To be perfectly honest,
this contract is totally unnecessary.

278
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:29,464
We would increase our share
by staying the course.

279
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:30,966
We don't have a choice.

280
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:34,035
If you abandon our partner
for short-term profits,

281
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:35,437
then I quit!

282
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:36,905
Hold on.

283
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:38,773
Kawai!

284
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,311
You're quitting?

285
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,182
What now?

286
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,184
Good question.

287
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:53,989
Want to mull it over together over dinner?

288
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:55,590
Sounds good.

289
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,059
Chief wants to see you first.

290
00:19:58,827 --> 00:19:59,661
The chief?

291
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:01,763
You're quitting?

292
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,598
Chief Haraguchi.

293
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:04,866
Today's your first day?

294
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,002
Welcome to Tokyo HQ.

295
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:11,306
So my first day as chief,
and I hear you want to resign.

296
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:13,308
Well, denied.

297
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,543
Don't be so flippant.

298
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,145
But Asia Heavy Industries--

299
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,881
I will look over it myself.

300
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:21,616
Do you trust me?

301
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,418
Well,

302
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:25,120
okay.

303
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:28,223
Thank God.

304
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,759
Honestly, I was a little scared.

305
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:33,395
What are you doing?

306
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,500
When did you get so hot-headed anyway?

307
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:41,069
Oh, from that.

308
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:46,708
Three years ago, your fiancé H
broke off the engagement.

309
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:47,976
You mean, Hijiri.

310
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:51,613
Ever since, you threw yourself in work,
becoming hardened.

311
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:55,016
Thank you for letting me vent then.

312
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,284
Three years since then,

313
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:59,454
H was 25, now 28.

314
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,790
And the middle schooler

315
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:03,925
could be eligible to vote.

316
00:21:04,793 --> 00:21:06,528
I don't really care.

317
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:12,033
That's what I mean, Kawai.

318
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,146
-Hijiri.
-Yes?

319
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,048
-Open up.
-Coming.

320
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:02,484
There we go.

321
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,086
I went pear picking with the hubby.

322
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,122
-Really?
-Take what you want.

323
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:08,857
Really?

324
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:10,725
Thank you!

325
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,895
-Just one?
-That's all I need since I'm on my own.

326
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,563
You're kidding me.

327
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,233
-Heave-ho.
-Do you want to join me?

328
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,601
Thanks.

329
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:22,404
That's all you're eating?

330
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:28,376
You used to eat
three helpings on your own.

331
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,713
No, I didn't.

332
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,448
Maybe two.

333
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,051
Thank you for this meal.

334
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,188
Something happen?

335
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,090
I think I boiled them too long.

336
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:45,060
Hijiri, you promised to share if
something happens.

337
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,169
Today

338
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,205
I saw him.

339
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,106
Who?

340
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,344
You're joking.

341
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:06,848
But I mean,
it was just a glance from far away.

342
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:09,484
He didn't notice at all.

343
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,485
Do you want egg?

344
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,253
How was he?

345
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,624
I was relieved to see he was well.

346
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:18,726
That's it?

347
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:21,963
When I saw him,

348
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:24,899
it reminded me of three years ago.

349
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:30,772
When I had nowhere to go,
I went to my parents' first.

350
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:42,016
-I'll do that.
-You don't have to.

351
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,451
Just let me.

352
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:48,356
Go answer it.

353
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:56,297
<i>Neither my mom or dad said anything,</i>
<i>just took me in.</i>

354
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,466
Is Hijiri here?

355
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,870
She's staying with us after
she quit the school.

356
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,905
Is that so?

357
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,374
She had some health issues.

358
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,943
I'm sorry to hear that.

359
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:14,182
<i>I knew something had to change</i>
<i>after I overheard her.</i>

360
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:17,719
Making your parents lie means
you have them worried.

361
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:19,187
That's right, Hijiri.

362
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:24,125
So I started working at a cram school.

363
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:25,894
…is your answer.

364
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,863
-You got them all right!
-Yes!

365
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,899
-I got it, too!
-You did?

366
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,968
You searched hard
for something you could do,

367
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:38,473
but it was clear you still had
a longing to teach,

368
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,344
so when there was an opening at my school,
I called you.

369
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,982
I can't be grateful enough.

370
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,518
Plus I got a letter.

371
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:51,986
Letter?

372
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:56,024
When I talked to the principal,
we reached out to Koboshi Junior High

373
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:58,993
and spoke to a Ms. Shioya.

374
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,128
I wish

375
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:05,533
I could've taught her more.

376
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,669
<i>She wrote a letter for you.</i>

377
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,839
How she was continuing to root for you,

378
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,310
and asked us to give you a chance.

379
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:21,149
I didn't tell you so you
wouldn't get complacent.

380
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:25,587
When I saw him,

381
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,889
I had an instant thought.

382
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:34,062
What if they found out
and it ruins the life I have now.

383
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:38,166
Next thing I know,

384
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,702
I had distanced myself.

385
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:45,240
I ran away.

386
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:50,445
I just want to get recertified in Tokyo

387
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,984
and live on as a teacher here.

388
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,722
That's all I want now.

389
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:07,462
I want to settle down and work hard here.

390
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:08,997
I know that.

391
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,800
Don't worry,
that stuff won't happen again.

392
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:21,876
Still, Hijiri, you need to stop wallowing
and find yourself a good man.

393
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:25,079
What about Mr. Nogami?

394
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:27,882
What do you mean?

395
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:32,687
Nogami may seem careless,
but he has his act together.

396
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:36,057
I always thought you two would
make a good couple.

397
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:38,960
Yeah, right.

398
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:43,464
Listen, Hijiri, if you want
to take teaching seriously,

399
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:45,733
settling down is part of it.

400
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,101
No way.

401
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:49,871
I don't have the bandwidth right now.

402
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:54,042
Open up!

403
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:55,643
That voice.

404
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,811
Isn't that your husband?

405
00:26:57,745 --> 00:26:59,881
Good evening.

406
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,116
-I came to pick you up.
-Thanks, Hubby.

407
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,618
Look, Hijiri!

408
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:05,820
-Pears!
-Yes.

409
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:09,724
I already brought her some!

410
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:12,794
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

411
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,131
So you did.

412
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:18,700
She can't eat that much.

413
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,570
-I can share them at work.
-And Micchan.

414
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:23,638
Right, Micchan!

415
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:28,109
Micchan is the type who would eat
pears instead of drinking water.

416
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:30,545
-Really?
-Let's give her lots.

417
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:36,084
KOBOSHIDAIRA JUNIOR HIGH
CLASS OF 2015 REUNION

418
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,519
Hold up, I want in.

419
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:40,021
Let me in.

420
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,156
MS. SHIOYA

421
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:49,364
-Hey, Runachi.
-Yu! Long time!

422
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,232
-Yay!
-Kosaka.

423
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,301
-Long time no see.
-Hey!

424
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:54,602
She's changed.

425
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:58,072
All right, is this everyone?

426
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:00,375
-Yeah!
-Is it?

427
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:02,577
Okay, shall we get started then?

428
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,778
Yeah!

429
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,381
I'll be your host, Michiru Ebihara!

430
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,082
Yeah!

431
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,450
Long time no see!

432
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:41,549
Right in the gut! You okay?

433
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,418
You alright?

434
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,720
You watch the super
bantamweight fight yesterday?

435
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:48,790
Yeah, knocked out in the seventh.

436
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:50,591
Hold on.

437
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:51,793
What?

438
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,294
What's with them?

439
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:54,262
No idea.

440
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,865
Was that them making up?

441
00:28:57,932 --> 00:29:00,201
I wanted to be a little more disappointed.

442
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:06,407
Hey, Kuroiwa!

443
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,277
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

444
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:12,980
What happened three years ago?

445
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,715
Was it related to Suenaga?

446
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:16,117
Do you still see her?

447
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,953
Suenaga?

448
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:21,222
Who's that again?

449
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:24,892
Yeah, right!

450
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,865
You were so obsessed.

451
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:37,338
The weather report said 30 percent.

452
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:40,441
-Just make sure they have rain gear.
-Good point.

453
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,344
If it rains, we can go to
the community center and play.

454
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:46,247
-Got it.
-Unless it's just drizzling.

455
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:49,584
Right, we'll just wait and see…

456
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,217
I'll see you later then.

457
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:25,219
Okay.

458
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:59,088
-Bye!
-You have to come!

459
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:01,824
I'll walk you home.

460
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,026
-What?
-Why? You going somewhere?

461
00:31:05,527 --> 00:31:07,429
I want to talk to Iwasaki a bit.

462
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

463
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:12,968
I'll text later.

464
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:14,603
Sure.

465
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:17,473
-Bye.
-Bye.

466
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:20,209
-Take care.
-See ya.

467
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:29,718
I've always thought
Kuroiwa was a jerk in sheep's clothing.

468
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:42,731
That part of you hasn't changed.

469
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:48,404
You invited me out, and don't even talk.

470
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:50,606
Sorry.

471
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:54,009
I was worried when you dropped out,
you know.

472
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:57,780
Sorry.

473
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,948
You also moved out without telling anyone.

474
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:03,485
Sorry.

475
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:05,521
Stop apologizing.

476
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:07,423
Today,

477
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:10,392
I'm apologizing to everyone.

478
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,667
Where'd you go for high school?

479
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:20,502
Seitoichi High.

480
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:24,873
Wow!
That's the best school in the Prefecture!

481
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:27,176
I had a lot of free time

482
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,079
so I just spent my time studying.

483
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:42,524
So,

484
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,029
what if I told you

485
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:50,632
that I still liked you,
would you be creeped out?

486
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:54,937
You would, right?

487
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,441
I never thought about it.

488
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,477
I didn't either.

489
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,713
To think I'd confess my love to you today.

490
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,114
For the fourth time.

491
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,884
-Fourth?
-Yeah, four times by my count.

492
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:12,254
I see.

493
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:14,556
Four times, huh?

494
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:23,932
Do you have someone you like now?

495
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:27,769
I'm not sure.

496
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:31,273
God, you're such a player
despite who you are.

497
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,942
-What's that mean?
-You heard me!

498
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,112
Here, I got your address
from your parents.

499
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:38,280
Sorry for dropping by.

500
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,816
Thank you for coming.

501
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,051
You could've mailed them.

502
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:47,389
It's been bothering me.

503
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,359
How I left things…

504
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:51,960
I was in the wrong.

505
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,328
I said such awful things.

506
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:57,099
I can't marry you.

507
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,001
Then you should be alone

508
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,540
and lose everything.

509
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:06,241
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:18,086
It took me three years to get here.

511
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:23,158
Honestly, it feels like

512
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:26,261
I wasn't myself back then.

513
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:28,697
How could I have done something so stupid?

514
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:30,766
Me too.

515
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,469
Thinking back, I was full of pride,

516
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,972
and a part of me was trying
to control you.

517
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:37,873
No way.

518
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:47,749
I should go.

519
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:58,760
Was that guy you were with your…

520
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,062
Mr. Nogami?

521
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:03,065
He's the head teacher of my class.

522
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,334
He seemed nice.

523
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:10,572
It's nothing like that,
I've got my own problems.

524
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:15,944
Probably time we both move on.

525
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:22,050
I think it's time we should
face our lives and move forward.

526
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,622
So, have a good life.

527
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,094
What about you?

528
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:34,396
You have anyone?

529
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:35,297
Yeah.

530
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:37,366
I'm about to.

531
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:53,949
Good morning.

532
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:54,850
Good morning.

533
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:06,094
Did you hear?

534
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:11,066
When we took a look at the long-term,
Asia Heavy Industries seemed better.

535
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,768
So we extended the contract.

536
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:13,835
No need to thank me.

537
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm interested.

538
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:20,676
What?

539
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:22,611
In the contract?

540
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:26,648
A manager who works hard,

541
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:30,619
but whose voice would shake
during presentations.

542
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:37,225
She can't hold her liquor,
but listens to my rants,

543
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,194
and eats meat with me.

544
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:42,497
When I was at my lowest,
she'd cheer me up,

545
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,100
and supported me.

546
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:48,203
I'm interested in you.

547
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:52,841
For some reason.

548
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:59,581
How were the results?

549
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,784
Pretty good this time.

550
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:08,023
<i>I think it's time we face life</i>
<i>and move forward.</i>

551
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:15,628
Planetarium?

552
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,797
Music? Sobafurukinoko's?

553
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,566
-Let's all go together!
-Yeah!

554
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:24,671
It ends this week.

555
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:26,139
I can't make it.

556
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:28,475
And I have a practice test.

557
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,277
-Really?
-Akira?

558
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,781
Long time.

559
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,219
Who is this hottie?

560
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:41,354
Congrats on your college admission.

561
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:44,190
That was six months ago!

562
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:46,826
Too bad.

563
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,428
I got a boyfriend now.

564
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:55,034
I'm here! Sorry you had to wait!

565
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,469
Was that…

566
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:58,805
An ex?

567
00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:02,175
Don't you care about me?

568
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:04,410
Stop it, okay!

569
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,412
-Got it?
-Buzz Cut.

570
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:07,547
Alright.

571
00:38:08,548 --> 00:38:10,350
So I guess this is out.

572
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,218
-None of us can make it.
-Yeah.

573
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:13,787
The two of us could go.

574
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:16,623
What? The two of us?

575
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:17,524
Yeah.

576
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,525
What was that?

577
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:20,627
You want to?

578
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:24,130
That guy's a total wolf.

579
00:38:24,197 --> 00:38:25,231
You sure?

580
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:26,166
That's Kuroiwa.

581
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:27,233
Sure.

582
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:29,702
Then we're on.

583
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,107
Akira started hanging out with
his old friends?

584
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:35,041
He has.

585
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:40,079
Maybe he's finally ready to open up.

586
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,648
I'm glad.

587
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,185
What a relief.

588
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:51,558
I'm just worried he might
hear rumors about Ms. Suenaga.

589
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:55,028
She was definitely
buying something that day.

590
00:38:55,662 --> 00:39:01,034
<i>So I told the shop owner</i>
<i>that I think I knew one of his customers.</i>

591
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,402
Then he said that

592
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,004
she's a teacher.

593
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:07,307
Teacher?

594
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:10,643
He said they mentioned a teacher's lounge,

595
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,647
so they were probably teachers
at some school.

596
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:17,450
She's still teaching?

597
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:19,352
Her?

598
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:22,989
Okay, keep going.

599
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:25,325
We're almost there.

600
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,561
I need help, Mr. Nogami!

601
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:31,497
-Okay, I'll help you.
-That's a big one!

602
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:32,832
Keep digging!

603
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:34,267
Don't stop.

604
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:38,538
-That's a big one.
-It's big.

605
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:45,745
This is a tough one.

606
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:54,587
You're so lame!

607
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:56,723
Size doesn't matter!

608
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:01,628
Excuse me.

609
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:04,297
Were you okay?

610
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:05,899
What?

611
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:07,700
That person we ran into,

612
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,470
was he your former…?

613
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,975
Yes, we were engaged to be married.

614
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,213
He came by to see me,

615
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:24,617
and we got to catch up.

616
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:28,521
You looked well suited.

617
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:30,790
I'm surprised you broke up.

618
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,594
A lot happened.

619
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:44,370
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something--

620
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,072
-Tachibana.
-Huh?

621
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:48,841
-Her lunch…
-Did you forget your lunch?

622
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,010
What? She forgot?

623
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:56,082
You can have this.

624
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,186
You can have mine too!

625
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,422
Mine too.

626
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:05,191
I don't want it!

627
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,794
-What are you doing?
-Tachibana.

628
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,396
But salmon is so good.

629
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,415
Okay, let's go.

630
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:32,085
Have some more.

631
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:42,829
Okay, time to go home.

632
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:45,698
-Goodbye!
-Be careful.

633
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:47,000
Okay, take care.

634
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:49,569
-Bye, Ms. Suenaga.
-Bye.

635
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:51,871
-Bye.
-Bye.

636
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:53,106
Bye.

637
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:55,441
Bye.

638
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,046
Bye, take care now.

639
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:09,756
Should we talk to her mother
about her lunch?

640
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,760
That might be good.

641
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,429
Tachibana.

642
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:25,538
-We dug up so many today.
-Yeah.

643
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:28,107
Do you like sweet potatoes?

644
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,918
Please, stop!

645
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:43,156
-Mom!
-Shut up!

646
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:46,826
-Is everything okay?
-It's a misunderstanding!

647
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,360
No!

648
00:42:57,427 --> 00:43:03,433
Someone told me they've seen
my husband come here multiple times!

649
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,435
It's a misunderstanding.

650
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:08,371
-He just helped with the plumbing.
-Oh, please!

651
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:11,608
-How dare you!
-Stop!

652
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,880
Please calm down!

653
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,381
Stay out of it!

654
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:21,985
-It's your fault!
-Hey!

655
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:23,053
It's all your fault!

656
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,388
-Mom.
-It's all your fault!

657
00:43:25,455 --> 00:43:27,324
That's enough!

658
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,559
There's a child here!

659
00:43:30,393 --> 00:43:33,330
Let's calm down and talk this over.

660
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,267
This woman isn't capable of talking.

661
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,270
You've done this before, right?

662
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:45,775
Cheated with your husband's best friend,
so he divorced you.

663
00:43:47,744 --> 00:43:52,616
Like I'd ever trust the likes of you!

664
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,486
The whole town

665
00:43:58,054 --> 00:43:58,989
knows your past.

666
00:44:00,757 --> 00:44:02,092
People don't change.

667
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:07,831
-Once an offender, always an offender.
-Please stop.

668
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:13,036
If my husband ever comes here again,
I'll make you pay.

669
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:24,514
Are you okay?

670
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,050
I'm used to it.

671
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:33,857
Let me help.

672
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:35,859
Could you leave?

673
00:44:36,393 --> 00:44:37,861
I'm very tired today.

674
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:39,262
But Ayano's lunch--

675
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:40,363
Please leave.

676
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:44,567
Ms. Suenaga.

677
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:46,903
We should call it a day.

678
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:51,508
Okay.

679
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,043
Bye.

680
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,381
See you later, Tachibana.

681
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,430
You're not going home yet?

682
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:15,732
I'll be finishing up soon.

683
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:17,600
Okay.

684
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,569
-I'm heading out now.
-Okay.

685
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,037
See you tomorrow.

686
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:22,005
See you.

687
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:27,644
Um, Ms. Suenaga.

688
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:30,413
You know,

689
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:35,885
I believe the past is the past.

690
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:42,158
That woman said she couldn't
trust Tachibana's mother.

691
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,295
But if you live long enough,

692
00:45:46,296 --> 00:45:47,931
you will make mistakes.

693
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:52,836
History, failure, regret.

694
00:45:55,138 --> 00:45:57,307
A society that never forgives mistakes,

695
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:00,710
or one that roots for those
doing their best.

696
00:46:02,746 --> 00:46:04,514
The answer becomes easy

697
00:46:06,382 --> 00:46:09,419
when you think which we want for our kids.

698
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:16,760
Ms. Suenaga,

699
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:19,796
you sometimes look sad.

700
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:24,801
No, I don't.

701
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:29,773
Is it hard to forget him?

702
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,742
Marrying him wasn't--

703
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:33,643
No.

704
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:36,146
I don't mean him.

705
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,416
The high school student we saw
at the used book store

706
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:44,154
wearing the Seitoichi High uniform.

707
00:46:47,657 --> 00:46:48,858
Do you still

708
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:51,294
care for him?

709
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:59,102
400 years ago, you could still
see many stars even in Tokyo.

710
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:01,671
A shooting star.

711
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:02,939
Hey.

712
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:10,880
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

713
00:47:12,115 --> 00:47:15,752
A friend of a friend
teaches at Koboshi Junior High,

714
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:20,857
so I heard what happened.

715
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:26,162
I'm not trying to blame you.

716
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:31,267
I hoped I could help in some way.

717
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,171
I'm sorry to have pried.

718
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:38,141
If you ever want to talk,

719
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:41,110
I'm here for you.

720
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:45,548
I just wanted to tell you that.

721
00:47:53,122 --> 00:47:54,157
Three years ago,

722
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:00,463
I was supposed to get married.

723
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,733
But

724
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,338
I fell for someone else.

725
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:13,176
It was him.

726
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:16,546
It's this late already?

727
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:18,781
I'll walk you home.

728
00:48:25,054 --> 00:48:26,122
I want to be with you.

729
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:28,691
What?

730
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,560
I don't want to go home.

731
00:48:31,895 --> 00:48:35,531
I want to spend
the rest of today with you.

732
00:48:38,134 --> 00:48:39,369
What's the rush?

733
00:48:40,036 --> 00:48:43,439
More like it's been dragging on for years.

734
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,175
<i>He was</i>

735
00:48:47,176 --> 00:48:48,111
my student.

736
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:52,448
So I ran away and distanced myself

737
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:55,752
to avoid seeing him.

738
00:48:58,521 --> 00:48:59,522
But I remember

739
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:04,527
over and over

740
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:07,597
how he was that day.

741
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:13,670
I'm glad he seemed well.

742
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:15,838
I'm relieved

743
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:18,241
to see him smiling.

744
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,315
He worked hard,
getting into the best school in the area.

745
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,218
He's facing forward.

746
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:33,323
That's good to know.

747
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,528
But me,

748
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:43,366
I'm the only one still where I was,

749
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:46,736
unable to move forward.

750
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:57,380
It's huge!

751
00:49:57,947 --> 00:49:59,782
Wow, this is crazy.

752
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:01,384
Hey, the bath is huge!

753
00:50:06,222 --> 00:50:07,090
Oh, no!

754
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:08,358
Kuroiwa!

755
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,794
What are you doing?

756
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,262
It won't turn off!

757
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:45,528
I…

758
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,064
I want to see you naked.

759
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,002
Because I like you.

760
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:55,705
We swam together in junior high.

761
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:57,607
Not like that.

762
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:00,209
It was always just me looking at you.

763
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:04,614
You were always focused on Suenaga,
and I get that.

764
00:51:09,886 --> 00:51:13,189
I was a little crazy back then.

765
00:51:14,757 --> 00:51:15,691
That's how much

766
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:18,161
I loved her.

767
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:20,830
Ms. Suenaga.

768
00:51:27,703 --> 00:51:28,538
And now?

769
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:33,509
I'll never see her.

770
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:37,346
She's probably

771
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:40,817
already married by now.

772
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:47,790
Let's forget.

773
00:51:51,227 --> 00:51:52,895
I'll help you forget.

774
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,177
You have moved forward.

775
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:12,081
Ms. Suenaga.

776
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:14,817
You're moving forward.

777
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,387
I've watched you.

778
00:52:19,122 --> 00:52:20,523
Coming to this school,

779
00:52:21,757 --> 00:52:23,459
talking to all the students,

780
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:25,928
getting to know everyone.

781
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:30,166
You help the other teachers,

782
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,503
gained the parents' trust,

783
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:39,375
and just work hard every day.

784
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,252
Slowly, one step at a time,
you're moving forward.

785
00:52:52,388 --> 00:52:53,589
You're okay.

786
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:04,000
Thank you.

787
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:05,034
It's nothing.

788
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,105
If…

789
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:11,674
If you really…

790
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:19,849
I'm sorry.

791
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:24,487
It's okay.

792
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:32,895
It's okay.

793
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:54,650
-Chief, um--
-Good work today.

794
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:59,455
What? Hey!

795
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:01,724
Hey!

796
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:04,060
What do you want?

797
00:54:06,495 --> 00:54:07,430
Hey!

798
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:13,002
Not again.

799
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:16,372
If you're still

800
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,609
hung up on Hijiri,

801
00:54:21,143 --> 00:54:22,378
and just using me…

802
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,514
Treating me

803
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:29,585
like some substitute.

804
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,355
I can't take it.

805
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:16,399
It's okay.

806
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:20,436
It's okay.

807
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:28,344
Your wife was all crazy.

808
00:55:28,844 --> 00:55:30,846
She barged in and yelled at me.

809
00:55:31,514 --> 00:55:32,882
Let's go out next time.

810
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,484
Ayano?

811
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,287
She's used to being home alone.

812
00:55:39,955 --> 00:55:40,956
Anyway,

813
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:44,060
there's an interesting new teacher.

814
00:55:45,928 --> 00:55:47,430
I found a good one.

815
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:50,633
How?

816
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,134
I did some research.

817
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:55,971
After you said she was teaching,
I asked around everywhere.

818
00:55:57,006 --> 00:56:02,278
After causing such a scandal,
how could she still be teaching?

819
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:07,049
Is what she did really forgivable?

820
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:31,674
I was hoping you could love me.

821
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:33,175
Are you okay?

822
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:35,378
Do you see us working out?

823
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:36,846
<i>Wanna know where Suenaga is?</i>

824
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:39,815
You have a secret, don't you?

825
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:40,850
