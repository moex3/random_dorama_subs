1
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,575
Three years ago,
I was supposed to get married.

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,579
But I fell for someone else.

3
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,647
<i>It was him.</i>

4
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>He was my student.</i>

5
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,321
I'm the only one still where I was,

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,957
unable to move forward.

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,558
Let's forget.

8
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,727
I'll help you forget.

9
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,864
You have moved forward.

10
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,299
Ms. Suenaga.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,735
You're moving forward.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,208
Slowly, one step at a time,
you're moving forward.

13
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:46,981
If you're still hung up on Hijiri,
and just using me…

14
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,917
Treating me like some substitute.

15
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,820
I can't take it.

16
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,365
It's okay.

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,534
It's okay.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,504
It's okay.

19
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,113
Ms. Chizuru, your mouth.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,981
Your mouth.

21
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,316
Ah, yeah.

22
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:27,721
Wait, so you're saying that despite
knowing everything about your past,

23
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,391
Mr. Nogami still hugged you
saying it was okay?

24
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,261
I know I can't take advantage
of his kindness.

25
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,631
But I was relieved.

26
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:44,505
It made me think that maybe it's
okay for me to stay here.

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,275
I'm relieved too.

28
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,880
It's been three years since we've talked
about your love life. It's a good match.

29
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,448
No, please.

30
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,286
Mr. Nogami hasn't acted
any differently since then.

31
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,790
We did grab a bite to eat
together once at the next station over.

32
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,658
Then I'll be your matchmaker.

33
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,993
That's okay.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,728
I'm kidding.

35
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,863
Listen, Hijiri.

36
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,599
Your next boyfriend will
probably be the man you marry.

37
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:15,269
So wish for the best and go for it.
Just ask him out yourself!

38
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,405
Take the lead and ask him out. Hurry!

39
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,740
Don't run. Don't fall.

40
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,942
Good morning.

41
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,444
Ow…

42
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,312
Hey!

43
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,056
Tachibana?

44
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,896
-Tachibana!
-Are you okay?

45
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,597
-You okay?
-Are you okay?

46
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,533
-Is it your stomach?
-Are you alright?

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,369
-Nogami, get the school nurse.
-Okay.

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,604
Let me grab your bag for you.

49
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,542
<i>-Malnutrition?</i>
<i>-And the resulting anemia.</i>

50
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,744
<i>There are more and more cases.</i>

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,446
They get enough calories,
but not nutrition.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,048
Where's her mother?

53
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,817
She said she was working all weekend.

54
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,254
No way, I bet she was with a guy.

55
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,094
<i>No answer.</i>

56
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,729
<i>But I left a message.</i>

57
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,699
<i>I heard a rumor she got dumped</i>
<i>and is taking it badly.</i>

58
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:23,938
There are women like that
who need a man to keep her life stable.

59
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,973
What a mess.

60
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,443
You prioritize your kid, obviously!

61
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,747
Anyway, I'll stay behind
and wait for her mother to pick her up.

62
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,583
-Please do.
-I'll stay with you.

63
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,721
-Thanks.
-No problem.

64
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,191
Excuse me.

65
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,060
What're you reading?

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,862
Let me see.

67
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,850
It's been three years now.

68
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,453
<i>I ripped them apart</i>

69
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,688
<i>to get my little boy back.</i>

70
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,092
<i>But now he hates me,</i>
<i>and won't even see me.</i>

71
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,027
If you go, there's no coming back.

72
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,031
I'm back.

73
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,166
You're looking again.

74
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,204
Come on, you need to let this go.

75
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,006
Take deep breaths.

76
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,141
What if Akira finds out about her?

77
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,709
And breathe out.

78
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,614
He's finally settled down,
if he gets dragged back in again,

79
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,684
there's no coming back.

80
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,920
Akira's not going to find out,
I'd never tell him.

81
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,455
I'll go see Ms. Shioya.

82
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,591
From his junior high school?

83
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,295
I'm going to ask if the school
knows about this.

84
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,577
Sorry for the short notice,
and for not contacting you.

85
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,579
I've been working nonstop.

86
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,519
You're working that much?

87
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,455
I don't want my mom paying for me.

88
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,592
What's your job again?

89
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,394
Bread factory.

90
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,433
I brand the bread after
they're done baking.

91
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,001
Brand?

92
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,937
-That's funny.
-Not really.

93
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,585
I want to hold hands.

94
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,367
Sorry about before.

95
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,604
For not going through with it.

96
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:15,843
You know, I don't think I was ready.

97
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,381
I just went for it,
but I didn't know what you were thinking

98
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,551
or how you felt about me.
I still don't know, so--

99
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,453
What?

100
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,893
Damn.

101
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,262
I like this.

102
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,198
What?

103
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,040
Can I get used to this?

104
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,684
Can we say that we're dating?

105
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,190
DON'T CRY ANYMORE, KURIZURA

106
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:11,031
<i>If her mother can't come get her,</i>
<i>Ayano can come stay with me.</i>

107
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:11,965
That'd be great!

108
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,136
I'm glad you were here.

109
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:20,641
Please, if I were alone,
I think I would've just panicked.

110
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,542
It's nothing.

111
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,011
I'm glad you're the head teacher.

112
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,379
Oh, please.

113
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,217
Um.

114
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:32,886
Um.

115
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,192
Come to think of it, we haven't

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,195
talked about it.

117
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,664
If…

118
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:47,868
If you'd like…

119
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,739
No, now's not the time.

120
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,580
But we don't get to talk much like this.

121
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,823
Um…

122
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,831
I'm sorry I'm late.

123
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,034
I couldn't get out of work.

124
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,071
No one's on the register's now.

125
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,139
I called your work.

126
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,979
The manager said you had
the day off today.

127
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,483
Actually, I wasn't feeling well.

128
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,185
I was resting at home.

129
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,220
I spoke to Mr. Nogami.

130
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,156
If this happens again,

131
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,859
your parents…

132
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:50,531
-My parents?
-In case something happens to Ayano.

133
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,633
We could have her grandparents--

134
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,634
Please stop.

135
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,404
I've cut ties with my parents.

136
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,108
I'm only staying in their home,
but that's all.

137
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,276
We're no contact.

138
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,115
Did you call them already?

139
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,351
No, not yet.

140
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,956
-But if--
-If you overstep…

141
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,692
I'll reveal your secret.

142
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:28,869
You have a secret, don't you?

143
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,681
I don't know what you're talking about.

144
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,784
I know about it.

145
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,757
Mom!

146
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,928
Ayano, I'm sorry I'm late!

147
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,331
Here.

148
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,767
Clip.

149
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,106
Ms. Tachibana, you had me worried.

150
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,475
-I'm sorry, Mr. Nogami.
-We're fine.

151
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:13,013
But I think your daughter was missing you.

152
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,050
Considering her health as well.

153
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,489
Perhaps you should rely on your parents--

154
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,293
No, I promise not to cause
any worry again.

155
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,930
-Just please don't involve them.
-But--

156
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,000
If you involve them,
they'll take Ayano from me.

157
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,373
I may not be a good mother,
but I love Ayano.

158
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,776
You understand, don't you?

159
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,446
Ms. Suenaga?

160
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,524
I'm sure Ayano is tired,

161
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,228
so I think it's best

162
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,631
if she took her home for today.

163
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,838
Okay.

164
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,676
But if something happens again,

165
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,278
I will be contacting your parents.

166
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,348
Let's go, Ayano.

167
00:11:58,604 --> 00:11:59,972
-Thanks, Akira.
-Sure.

168
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,675
-I'm off then.
-Have a good day.

169
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,810
Kokonoe.

170
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,746
-Yo.
-Long time, cadet.

171
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:10,349
Like I said, Mr. Joffe,
this is just my hairstyle.

172
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,851
What's up?

173
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:14,962
-Iwasaki?
-Yeah.

174
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,299
We're going out, why do you ask?

175
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:23,704
What, you came all this way to ask me?

176
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:27,708
Do you like Iwasaki?

177
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:30,378
I do.

178
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:33,648
We're not kids anymore,
there's different levels of like.

179
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,218
What kind of like is it?

180
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:46,994
I don't have to see
the scary part of myself.

181
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,509
Why now?

182
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:04,011
Kuroiwa's mom found this.

183
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,047
Really?

184
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:11,285
Ebihara's little brother happened
to see her talking to the teachers.

185
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:13,588
-Did you tell Kuroiwa?
-No.

186
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,556
<i>I haven't, but…</i>

187
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,559
<i>Honestly, I'm torn.</i>

188
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:23,164
But I wanted to talk
to you about it first.

189
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,870
Damn it, stay away.

190
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:32,006
It's too late.

191
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:35,276
No, we have to keep it secret.

192
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,945
It's finished if he sees her.

193
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,281
His feelings will come back.

194
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,884
You think so?

195
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,853
I told you not to get involved with him.

196
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:51,959
But it's also not fair
to keep this from him, right?

197
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,897
I mean, he might not think anything of it.

198
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:59,967
I'm a high school girl now,
we've also hooked up.

199
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,471
You think I'd lose to the memory
of some teacher pushing 30?

200
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:08,109
I'd be careful, men don't have
to have feelings to handle a girl.

201
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,177
I want to fight on even ground.

202
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:13,447
Then you tell him.

203
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,785
Do whatever feels right.
You're his girlfriend after all.

204
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:23,824
I need to go pee.

205
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,726
What is it, Yu?

206
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,795
We had this teacher Ms. Suenaga.

207
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:30,831
Rumor is that she
messed around with a student.

208
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,833
<i>So they found her.</i>

209
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,171
Okay, we'll be making
the flowers for the recital.

210
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:41,442
You two, listen to Mr. Nogami!

211
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:42,944
Hey.

212
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,146
Stop fooling around.

213
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,847
Sit down.

214
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:51,185
-Take a seat.
-Sit down.

215
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:54,689
We'll be making flowers like these.

216
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,791
Those are so good, Ms. Hijiri.

217
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:57,825
-You made them?
-Yes.

218
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,828
Each of you will make three.

219
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,230
-What's that?
-A star fish?

220
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,765
A crushed can?

221
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,735
They're clearly flowers!

222
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:15,343
Terrible!

223
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,944
All of you sit down.

224
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,380
Okay, I was wrong.

225
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,849
TOKYO

226
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,086
Do you have the report on
the renovation project?

227
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:26,887
I'm almost done.

228
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,332
Um, so like,

229
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:44,171
I totally understand girls who need to ask
what their relationship status is.

230
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,007
What?

231
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:58,886
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,731
Damn it.

233
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:20,374
Could you take me out to Roppongi?

234
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,942
W-What?

235
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:23,878
What?

236
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,180
Where are we going?

237
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,216
I was going to go home and cool down.

238
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,621
The Mongols say
to strike while the iron is hot.

239
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,089
They say that here too.

240
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:37,258
I don't want my clothes to wrinkle.

241
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:39,860
So lend me something to wear.

242
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:43,597
Okay.

243
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,201
-Are you free tonight?
-Why?

244
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:49,503
I can lend you clothes again.

245
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,442
Your t-shirt was lame.

246
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:57,611
Sorry, I don't know fashion.

247
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,847
Sometimes your suit is lame too.

248
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:03,250
Well, I get whatever's on sale.

249
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:06,253
But I like that about you.

250
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,761
That's good.

251
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,467
-Make sure to add pictures to the report.
-Yes, ma'am.

252
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,772
The digital camera…

253
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:37,218
<i>I forgot to copy the data</i>
<i>from the camera I returned.</i>

254
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:39,086
From your boyfriend?

255
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,055
Hello.

256
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,958
Were you out shopping?

257
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:49,130
Don't worry, I'm cooking for her.

258
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,832
Okay, that's good.

259
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,735
It's so awful.

260
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:59,707
Small towns like this are always looking
for something to talk about.

261
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:03,310
I can't even shop in peace.

262
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,546
It's suffocating.

263
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:08,949
But I hope

264
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,254
I can count on you to be on my side.

265
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:23,063
Let's go, Ayano.

266
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:28,702
Ms. Suenaga.

267
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,447
I want everyone's names
on a screen after the play ends.

268
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:42,950
Then we could take pictures of rehearsals.

269
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,019
Oh, yes, we can put those up too.

270
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:45,953
Yes.

271
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,325
Thanks for walking me home.

272
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:54,361
It's nothing, it's on the way.

273
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,106
Um…

274
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:08,475
-The other day…
-Huh?

275
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,745
-A stink bug. It's a stink bug.
-What?

276
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,747
-Is it a stink bug?
-Yeah.

277
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:14,748
-What?
-It stinks.

278
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:17,151
Oh, crap!

279
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,854
It stinks!

280
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,157
It stinks!

281
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:37,471
Sorry, maybe we can talk about
this another time.

282
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:39,473
Okay.

283
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,374
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:42,476
Good night.

285
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:43,711
Good night.

286
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,518
It stinks.

287
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:55,623
It really stinks.

288
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,895
Over there?

289
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:02,596
Yeah.

290
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,839
-Do I have hair stinking out?
-No.

291
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:14,875
Your feet look painful.

292
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:19,747
Does it hurt?

293
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:21,782
I'm okay.

294
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:23,150
Let's go.

295
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,688
Hold on.

296
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:39,066
Then you tell him.

297
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,269
<i>Do whatever feels right.</i>
<i>You're his girlfriend after all.</i>

298
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:45,806
Here.

299
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:50,477
Thanks.

300
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:56,350
How much?

301
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,485
Forget it, it's my treat.

302
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:02,022
Thanks.

303
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,503
-Hello?
-It's me, Yu.

304
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:18,973
Wanna know where Suenaga is?

305
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:21,875
What?

306
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,577
<i>So you don't know, huh?</i>

307
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:27,648
It was going around.
So I wondered if you'd heard.

308
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,452
<i>I saw Runa whispering</i>
<i>about it with her friends.</i>

309
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,489
<i>I feel sorry that they're keeping</i>
<i>you in the dark.</i>

310
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:38,759
FYI, Suenaga is still teaching.

311
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:42,196
<i>I'll send you a picture. Anyway, bye.</i>

312
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:49,870
What's up?

313
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:53,741
KOMIYA DAI-ICHI ELEMENTARY

314
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,253
I was gonna tell you about this today.

315
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:08,622
But, you know,

316
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:11,325
I didn't get a chance yet.

317
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,359
Kuroiwa?

318
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:33,879
<i>I'll be there soon,</i>
<i>thank you for the camera.</i>

319
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:35,047
Camera…

320
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:45,590
<i>The school?</i>

321
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,923
KOMIYA BRIDGE

322
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,233
KOMIYA DAI-ICHI ELEMENTARY

323
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,906
Kuroiwa?

324
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:11,610
Is that you?

325
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:13,712
Remember me?

326
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,648
I guess not.

327
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,883
You're her…

328
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,092
You came to see Hijiri?
I'm here to see her too.

329
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:34,399
Those three years
really made a difference.

330
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,902
What?

331
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:37,836
Nothing.

332
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:47,712
Huh?

333
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:49,047
You're leaving?

334
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:54,252
She didn't exactly invite me.

335
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:55,954
So why'd you come?

336
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,294
I just learned that she was here today.

337
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:04,262
So I rushed here.

338
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,904
Could you stay away from Hijiri?

339
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,441
Hijiri

340
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:19,844
has me.

341
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,386
Oh, right.

342
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:30,956
Makes sense.

343
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:36,261
It seems yet again,
I was wrong about a lot of things.

344
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:41,032
I'll leave.

345
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,118
Found it.

346
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,486
Tachibana.

347
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,055
What's wrong?

348
00:26:38,323 --> 00:26:39,224
Where's your mom?

349
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,535
Hey.

350
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,505
What's your favorite pasta dish?

351
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,508
MR. PICTURE AND MR. WORD

352
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:07,018
Sorry, I know it's not
the carbonara you like,

353
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:11,556
but it's my quick and easy
mushroom pasta I make all the time.

354
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:12,557
Dig in.

355
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,993
Here.

356
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:23,668
Let's eat.

357
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:28,139
It's yummy.

358
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,607
You like it?

359
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:53,531
MS. TACHIBANA,
I'M SORRY FOR LEAVING THIS NOTE

360
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:55,567
SUENAGA

361
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:08,511
-Who's she?
-One of my students.

362
00:28:09,412 --> 00:28:12,983
Her mom wasn't home when she
got back from the library,

363
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,318
and she got locked out.

364
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:17,621
Being a teacher sounds tough.

365
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:19,756
Here.

366
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:21,858
Right.

367
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,096
Good, it's all here.

368
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:29,833
I'm saved!

369
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,301
-Thanks.
-No problem.

370
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:36,973
I just learned that she was here today.
So I rushed here.

371
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,209
Hey, so…

372
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:44,581
I need to get back to work.

373
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,784
-Thanks.
-Sure.

374
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,919
Later, Hijiri.

375
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:12,309
Ms. Suenaga,
what a wonderful boyfriend you have.

376
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:15,445
He seemed very metropolitan.

377
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,681
Why are you keeping him secret?

378
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:19,950
He's just an old friend.

379
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,185
Anyway, Ayano--

380
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:25,021
She forgot to take her key with her.

381
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:31,227
But it's worrying when this
keeps happening.

382
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:34,064
It's just a misunderstanding, no big deal.

383
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:39,202
You don't want people talking either,
do you?

384
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:44,341
Mom.

385
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,111
Ayano, sorry I'm late.

386
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:51,381
Are you okay? Sorry I was late.

387
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:52,282
Let's go.

388
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,021
Did you eat?

389
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,156
Want me to cook you something?

390
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:06,396
TOKYO

391
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:09,099
I got the pictures right away.

392
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:10,567
Here you go.

393
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,536
Which means you met Hijiri.

394
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,973
Not just her, but him too.

395
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,908
Him?

396
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,881
So, did you meet her?

397
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,084
Or didn't you?

398
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:35,158
Then

399
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,762
at least answer this.

400
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:44,134
Do you like me?

401
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,571
Even just

402
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,174
a little?

403
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:56,413
Even if it's

404
00:30:58,681 --> 00:30:59,582
past tense?

405
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:36,352
Runa!

406
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:38,988
Long time no see!

407
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,525
You're dating Akira?

408
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,994
That's what I heard from
your mother Sayuri.

409
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,364
I had no idea.

410
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,735
It's amazing.

411
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:53,803
Huh?

412
00:31:55,939 --> 00:32:01,311
When I call him, he would come over.

413
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:04,848
We'd spend time alone.

414
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,485
He'd be kind to me.

415
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:18,828
Even if it was just his way
of handling me.

416
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:20,563
Handling?

417
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,031
What do you mean?

418
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:24,534
But…

419
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,304
If…

420
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,275
Suenaga steals him again…

421
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,445
You mean that Suenaga?

422
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:38,748
They haven't met, have they?

423
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,187
That's a bit of a gray area.

424
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:46,256
-What?
-Gray area?

425
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:49,826
It seems like he wasn't able to meet her.

426
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:55,131
But he headed straight for her when
he found out where she was.

427
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,333
In a second.

428
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,347
It's yummy.

429
00:33:11,414 --> 00:33:13,850
If you involve them,
they'll take Ayano from me.

430
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:18,521
<i>You don't want people talking either,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

431
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:49,018
So basically,
when the boy showed up to see Hijiri--

432
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,554
He's a young man now, basically an adult.

433
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:55,225
You acted like you married her
and turned him away.

434
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,926
He just assumed.

435
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,696
And you didn't tell
Hijiri anything on top of that.

436
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,998
I didn't have time.

437
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:06,970
I'm going home.

438
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,838
What? Why?

439
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,074
Hey, hold on.

440
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,910
What is it?

441
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,113
Since when do you talk to me like that?

442
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:20,350
Wait, are you jealous?

443
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:23,453
What?

444
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:26,889
Because I went to see Hijiri
and turned him away?

445
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:29,959
You think I'm not over her?

446
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:32,729
Don't be cocky.

447
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:34,631
You don't need to worry.

448
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,036
But, it's just…

449
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,538
Just?

450
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:46,309
What?

451
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:49,646
In that moment,

452
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,049
the feeling I felt when I saw him

453
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,487
was unforgiving.

454
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:06,763
If they meet again,
and everyone says that their love is real.

455
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:08,865
<i>That it's destiny.</i>

456
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,268
I can't forgive it.

457
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,876
Hijiri was wrong.

458
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:30,687
Kawai.

459
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:34,857
I don't hate your true thoughts.

460
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:39,796
Yes, Hijiri was wrong.

461
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:43,066
But that's how it is.

462
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:48,805
When you fall for someone,
there's no right or wrong.

463
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:54,177
It doesn't matter
if it's real or destined either.

464
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:56,646
You just love them.

465
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,316
<i>It's hopeless attraction.</i>

466
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>That's love.</i>

467
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,761
<i>Poor Hijiri.</i>

468
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,666
<i>All alone in an unfamiliar city,</i>
<i>not even knowing he came.</i>

469
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,271
Imagining how hard she's working,
I feel bad for her.

470
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:25,541
Makes me want to

471
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:28,311
go give her a hug.

472
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:30,713
What?

473
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:34,117
That's how I am.

474
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:42,392
Kawai, the way things are going,
do you see us working out?

475
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:09,185
Akira.

476
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,360
Welcome home.

477
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,901
Wait, Akira!

478
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,369
Hey!

479
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,776
It's late, why don't you stay the night.

480
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,550
You saw your room, didn't you?

481
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:43,686
I left it the way it was.

482
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:46,456
You can come home whenever you want.

483
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:53,563
This is your home after all.

484
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:33,569
APRIL 2015,
MY NEW CLASS TEACHER WAS HIJIRI.

485
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,110
MAY 2015, I TRY TO COMMUNICATE
SOMETHING AND SELF-DESTRUCT.

486
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,778
HIJIRI

487
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,815
HIJIRI

488
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:54,457
HIJIRI

489
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:00,763
MS. SUENAGA, BACK THEN
I WAS A LITTLE CRAZY.

490
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,333
IF ONLY I WASN'T 15.

491
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,315
MR. NOGAMI

492
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:23,452
LET'S FOCUS ON ACT TWO
FOR TOMORROW'S REHEARSAL.

493
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:27,490
Roger that.

494
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:32,929
SORRY, THAT WAS A MISTAKE!

495
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,964
IT CAME OUT SO WELL

496
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:37,099
SO I MEANT TO SAVE IT.

497
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,901
SORTY.

498
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,605
SORRY.

499
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:53,215
-Goodbye, Ms. Hijiri!
-Goodbye.

500
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:54,650
Hello!

501
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:56,819
Bye!

502
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:58,621
Good bye, don't run.

503
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:03,659
Goodbye.

504
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:07,930
Good work today.

505
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,504
Why did you call them!

506
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:17,273
-What?
-I told you not to!

507
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,309
-Why Ayano!
-Did something happen to her?

508
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,477
They took her away!

509
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,715
My parents sent a car and took Ayano away!

510
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:26,849
Calm down!

511
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,118
-What's this commotion?
-Please stop!

512
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,187
You're all liars!

513
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:34,857
Pretending to be on my side,
but you were lying!

514
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:36,726
We're all on your side!

515
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,261
I know about it.

516
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:58,401
Ms. Tachibana?

517
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:03,773
Ms. Suenaga, you and Mr. Nogami
are an item, aren't you?

518
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,142
What?

519
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,111
I saw you two eating together.

520
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:11,882
-You even went to the next town over.
-It's a misunderstanding.

521
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:14,918
And what was that yesterday, an affair?

522
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,320
Bringing over that businessman.

523
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,957
No, he's an old friend.

524
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:23,260
You're no different.

525
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:26,763
Your girlfriend's two-timing you
and acting all superior.

526
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,731
We're not!

527
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:29,132
You're being tricked!

528
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,233
No!

529
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:35,005
This is just a one-sided crush on my end.

530
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:38,074
What?

531
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:39,342
What'd you say?

532
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,111
Oh, no, really?

533
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:46,449
We haven't done anything inappropriate.

534
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,786
And Ms. Suenaga didn't know.

535
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:54,224
I'm the one who called your parents.

536
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:59,996
I called them when I heard Ayano
was locked out.

537
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,631
<i>They said they'd take her.</i>

538
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:05,068
Grandma, Nana fetched!

539
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:12,375
-I told you not to contact them.
-And I warned you too!

540
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:18,615
If you neglected Ayano's care again,
that I would call your parents.

541
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,686
I never neglected her!

542
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,387
You put her in danger!

543
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:31,294
We can always talk about
how we can move forward.

544
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:35,065
Call me any time.

545
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:44,140
Unforgivable.

546
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,478
If Ayano never comes home again,

547
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,148
I'll never forgive you!

548
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,121
What is her problem?

549
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:00,056
What a hypocrite.

550
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:02,592
I'm glad he made that call before
something happened.

551
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:04,628
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

552
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:06,930
Ayano is often left home alone at night.

553
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:08,965
It's our job to protect children.

554
00:43:09,032 --> 00:43:12,569
-That's right.
-Maybe I should go talk to her again.

555
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:15,905
More importantly,

556
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,577
has she been harassing you like that
for a while now?

557
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:24,247
Yes.

558
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,387
I'm sure you don't want to be
the target of any rumor,

559
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:33,390
but we need to be firm
with parents like her.

560
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:36,092
Please talk to me next time.

561
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:41,898
Understood. I'm sorry.

562
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:44,834
Good.

563
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:49,172
Can you believe the two of them?

564
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:51,641
What's going to happen now?

565
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:06,356
I'm sorry about that.

566
00:44:08,425 --> 00:44:09,292
But

567
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:12,562
that's how I feel.

568
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:16,333
I do hope

569
00:44:18,435 --> 00:44:20,337
to date you someday.

570
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,676
I know you don't think of me that way yet.

571
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,915
But maybe

572
00:44:33,249 --> 00:44:36,286
we could slowly build something

573
00:44:39,956 --> 00:44:43,059
so someday you might have feelings for me.

574
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,832
I don't need an answer right away.

575
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:54,771
Just think about it.

576
00:44:57,574 --> 00:44:58,408
Okay.

577
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:03,146
We just got word.

578
00:45:04,214 --> 00:45:06,950
-Ayano is missing.
-What?

579
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:16,190
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

580
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:20,328
-Have you seen Ayano Tachibana?
-No, I haven't seen Ayano.

581
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:22,163
You haven't?

582
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,965
Tachibana!

583
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:26,200
Tachibana!

584
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:30,938
A neighbor saw her leaving alone.

585
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:33,908
-Maybe she's trying to go home.
-Yes.

586
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:37,445
Damn, I can't get a hold of her mother.

587
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:46,354
Tachibana.

588
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:48,923
Tachibana?

589
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,825
Excuse me!

590
00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:53,961
Have you seen a little girl around here?

591
00:45:54,695 --> 00:45:55,930
Tachibana!

592
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:00,768
Tachibana!

593
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,838
Tachibana.

594
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:08,509
Tachibana!

595
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,480
Are you okay?

596
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:17,185
Thank goodness, we were worried.

597
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:22,890
Were you going home?

598
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:25,827
Your mom wasn't home?

599
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:31,699
I tried to go back to Grandma's,

600
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,303
but I got lost.

601
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:38,773
Then this big brother helped me.

602
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,441
Ms. Suenaga!

603
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:17,645
Thank goodness you found her.

604
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,688
Let's go, Tachibana.

605
00:47:28,823 --> 00:47:29,657
Wait!

606
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:32,026
I can take her.

607
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,694
What?

608
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:41,269
I'll be waiting at the school.

609
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:52,580
Ready?

610
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:56,851
Let's go.

611
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:58,753
Later.

612
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:21,042
What?

613
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:24,345
Wait, no way, yuck! Hey!

614
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:27,214
Is it a stink bug?
It's a stink bug, right?

615
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:28,916
No.

616
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:46,067
Stinks.

617
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:51,672
Kuroiwa.

618
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:56,210
Why are you here?

619
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,749
Well, what are you doing here?

620
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:08,322
That little girl said you weren't married.

621
00:49:12,093 --> 00:49:15,796
I thought you got married
to that Shotaro guy

622
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:19,200
and were buying IKEA furniture together.

623
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:25,706
Maybe you'd already have a kid,
and became a housewife or something.

624
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:31,078
So why are you still teaching?

625
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:35,583
You came this far to ask me that?

626
00:49:37,385 --> 00:49:38,586
No, I didn't.

627
00:49:39,086 --> 00:49:41,756
I'm dating Iwasaki now.

628
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:48,162
She has a good head on her shoulders.

629
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:49,997
Not to say you don't--

630
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:51,132
Can I…

631
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,201
Can I come here again?

632
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:56,771
What?

633
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:59,640
You're not with that
Shotaro guy anymore, right?

634
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:04,045
And you're not my teacher anymore, right?

635
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,552
I'm 18 now.

636
00:50:18,325 --> 00:50:19,860
I will break up with Iwasaki.

637
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:25,166
There's no reason
I can't come see you, right?

638
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:30,037
Now I'm…

639
00:50:34,842 --> 00:50:35,910
I'm still…

640
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:40,781
the same as on that day.

641
00:50:43,818 --> 00:50:47,722
Back on that beach
after the fireworks festival,

642
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:51,225
still…

643
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:56,464
No matter who is against it,

644
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,835
I will come see you.

645
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:10,578
I will always--

646
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,351
Never come again.

647
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:19,820
If you come here,

648
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:23,124
I'll have to move away.

649
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:35,302
I have

650
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,640
students I care about here.

651
00:51:42,543 --> 00:51:43,811
I can't lose them.

652
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:50,151
Never come again.

653
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:01,662
You'll miss your last train.

654
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:03,464
You'll be stuck here.

655
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:08,803
You can borrow my bike.

656
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:11,872
Just park it in front of the station.

657
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:13,774
Here.

658
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:32,526
Thanks.

659
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:07,688
HIJIRI, I WANT TO SEE YOU.

660
00:54:07,755 --> 00:54:10,190
I WANT TO SEE YOU. KUROIWA.

661
00:54:46,226 --> 00:54:47,594
Ms. Suenaga!

662
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,364
What're you doing here?

663
00:54:56,103 --> 00:54:58,238
-Mr. Nogami.
-Yes?

664
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:05,079
Can I give you my answer now?

665
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,448
Of course.

666
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:09,116
Hold on.

667
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:10,884
Okay.

668
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:18,359
If you would have me,
maybe we could get to know each other

669
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:22,963
a little bit at a time.

670
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:25,866
Yes!

671
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:29,603
I would be honored!

672
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:46,053
Sorry.

673
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,087
Sorry.

674
00:55:47,988 --> 00:55:49,390
Crap, we need to hurry!

675
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:51,392
You're right!

676
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:13,380
Why?

677
00:56:30,164 --> 00:56:33,667
You messed around with your middle school
student three years ago?

678
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,469
I'm disappointed.

679
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,104
I can't become a good teacher.

680
00:56:37,171 --> 00:56:39,640
Would you leave this town with me?

681
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:41,141
