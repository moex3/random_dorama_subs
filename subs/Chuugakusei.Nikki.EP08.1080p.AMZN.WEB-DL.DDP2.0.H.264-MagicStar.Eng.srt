1
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:08,809
Kuroiwa.

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,945
Why are you here?

3
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,514
I'm 18 now.

4
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,352
No matter who is against it,

5
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,421
I will come see you.

6
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,624
Never come again.

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,326
If you come here,

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,729
I'll have to move away.

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,099
<i>I have students I care about here.</i>

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,168
Never come again.

11
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,273
-Mr. Nogami.
-Yes?

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,677
If you would have me,
maybe we could get to know each other

13
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,082
a little bit at a time.

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,083
Yes!

15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,720
I would be honored!

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,934
Why?

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,514
It has been a while.

18
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,822
You seem well.

19
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,094
Um, what are--

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,063
Did Akira come?

21
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,669
Did he come here to see you?

22
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,611
Yes.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,148
Just once.

24
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,751
But he left right away.

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,822
I don't think he'll be coming back again.

26
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,999
I'm terribly sorry.

27
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm sure he was a bother.

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,943
I'm not sure how much you all know,

29
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,547
but even after that scandal,

30
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,117
to find out that you are still teaching.

31
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:35,556
I have to say, I was surprised.

32
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,793
But I'm sure it took a lot
to return to work,

33
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,632
so you must be a good teacher.

34
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,141
Excuse me. May I say something.

35
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,244
I'm her colleague Nogami.

36
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,851
I'm currently dating Ms. Suenaga.

37
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:10,858
So I don't believe you need
to worry about your son.

38
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,699
I see, you have a partner.

39
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,569
For us,

40
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,338
the incident from three years ago

41
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,408
caused us to live separately,

42
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,411
and the time we have as a family

43
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,680
has been as good as ruined.

44
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,984
But you…

45
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,323
You haven't lost anything.

46
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,831
I'm sorry for dropping by.

47
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,701
May you have a good life.

48
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,236
OCTOBER 23, TUESDAY

49
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,143
HIJIRI, I WANT TO SEE YOU.
KUROIWA.

50
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,880
<i>Never come again.</i>

51
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,682
If you come here,

52
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,885
I'll have to move away.

53
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,693
The booklet Ms. Suenaga is handing out

54
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,763
shows you how to make the props
and costumes for the recital.

55
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,667
-Show it to your parents at home.
-Okay.

56
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,436
<i>They took her away!</i>

57
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,473
My parents sent a car and took Ayano away!

58
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,751
-Costume?
-Yes, for a fairy.

59
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,786
MIMI AND THE RAINBOW FOREST

60
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:20,621
Here.

61
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,825
Is that something you can do?

62
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,261
For Ayano.

63
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,365
Um…

64
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,913
Please come to the recital.

65
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,352
We don't want things this way either!

66
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,624
So take these small steps
to prove to them that you're needed,

67
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,094
and earn your parents' trust back.

68
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,564
Then you'll be able to be

69
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,734
reunited with Ayano again.

70
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,707
Please do this.

71
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,276
It will make Ayano happy.

72
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,586
MIMI AND THE RAINBOW FOREST

73
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,527
What's with that woman?

74
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:40,968
Excuse me.

75
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,606
You knew Ms. Suenaga from her old school?

76
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,744
She's been treating my daughter well.

77
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,715
She used to teach junior high, right?

78
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,197
HIJIRI SUENAGA KOBOSHI JUNIOR HIGH

79
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,704
DISAPPEARS AFTER A RUMORED AFFAIR
WITH STUDENT

80

KOMIYA DAI-ICHI ELEMENTARY

81
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,446
Everyone's gotten so much better
with their lines.

82
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,015
Now we should focus
on the parts without lines.

83
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,183
Yes.

84
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,218
Why don't we do a run through.

85
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,619
-Good idea.
-Okay.

86
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,088
Good morning.

87
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:35,989
Good…

88
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,758
Huh?

89
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,526
Why?

90
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,331
Hijiri, the parents are all here.

91
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,066
They want to speak with you.

92
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,821
What is this about?

93
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,426
Ms. Suenaga, I'll just come out and ask.

94
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,996
Were you involved in a case
of sexual misconduct?

95
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:20,634
Someone said they saw that child's
mother come complain to the school.

96
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,102
Who did?

97
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,605
I did.

98
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:34,314
Something seemed really off,
so I got curious and read some articles.

99
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,683
They said that three years ago,

100
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,287
you messed around
with your middle school student

101
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,259
You were chasing that boy around.

102
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:50,998
Running off alone in the school,
often sneaking away together.

103
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:56,003
Then you had to suddenly quit because
you got pregnant or something.

104
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,272
It's so surprising.

105
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,375
People aren't always as they seem.

106
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,477
After hearing that,

107
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,446
we thought it needed to be
addressed directly.

108
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,921
Ms. Suenaga, do you admit to being

109
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,424
a sexual predator?

110
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,331
I…

111
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,300
That is ridiculous.

112
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,605
I've known her a long time,
but I've never heard such rumors,

113
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,906
nor are they true.

114
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,944
Spreading around such gossip,

115
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,681
attacking her personally,
won't bring Ayano back.

116
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,283
Don't run from your own problems.

117
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,319
This isn't--

118
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,188
If something happens,
please call me anytime.

119
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,390
I will do my best to listen.

120
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:55,295
Right, Ayano is with her grandparents now,
I heard.

121
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,531
-That's why she did this?
-No.

122
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,104
More importantly,
the school recital is coming up.

123
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:08,008
Your children are working very hard.

124
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,779
Please continue to watch over them.

125
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,119
Of course, we'll
send them over right away.

126
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,588
I'll call the other mothers to explain.

127
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,024
I'm so sorry, Ms. Suenaga.

128
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:24,925
After you.

129
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,005
Stop with that face.

130
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,942
You would've just confused
the situation with the truth.

131
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,945
There's no need to talk about
that incident anymore.

132
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,614
Just ignore them from now on.

133
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,718
But now

134
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,156
Ms. Tachibana is getting blamed.

135
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,129
It's not like everything
she said was baseless and untrue.

136
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,532
But some of that stuff
was totally malicious.

137
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,038
You mentioned before

138
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,307
that you want to spend your life
teaching here.

139
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,843
That it was your wish.

140
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,547
Then get it together.

141
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,217
Just focus on what you
need to do as a teacher now.

142

Ayano!

145
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,716
I'm so glad to see you today!

146
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:14,619
I heard you're going to be
a fairy for the recital.

147
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,255
Should I make your costume?

148
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:20,392
Ayano?

149
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,827
Wait, Ayano!

150
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:27,466
I already thought I'd add
your favorite pink flowers--

151
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,366
It's fine!

152
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,602
I'm having Grandma do it.

153
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:36,241
You talked bad about Ms. Hijiri,
didn't you?

154
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,077
Said mean things?

155
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:42,280
I hate you for that.

156
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:58,196
What?

157
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,032
Want to say something?

158
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,437
I feel like an idiot!

00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:51,850
<i>What a surprise.</i>

163
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:55,453
I mean, I'd like to go to the reception,

164
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,356
but I'm so busy I'm probably not
going to make it.

165
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,826
Could you give them my gift?

166
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:03,128
Yeah, sure, of course.

167
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,063

By the way, I've been meaning to tell you,

169
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,339
<i>I'm actually</i>

170
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:15,974
dating someone.

171
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,108
What?

172
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,177
You've met her before.

173
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,413
What? I have?

174
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:23,648
Ms. Haraguchi.

175
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:26,284
That Ms. Haraguchi?

176
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:29,421
Capable, enigmatic and hard to pin-down.

177
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:32,591
I feel like she's always testing me.

178
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,092
Testing you?

179
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:36,494
She's not like you at all.

180
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:41,666
Well, I'm not sure you needed to add that.

181
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,736
I didn't mean anything by it.

182
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>You must like her.</i>

183
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,413
Just being with her

184
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:57,749
is more than enough.

185
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:02,287
Congratulations.

186
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,925
Thanks, Hijiri.

187
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:18,737
Kuroiwa!

188
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:23,875
Do you like me?

189
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:28,546
Even just a little?

190
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,585
-Here you go.
-Yay!

191
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:36,421
It's their limited time only,
Berry Special Pancake.

192
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:40,058
Looks so good.

193
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,160
Ice cream.

194
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:51,803
Yummy!

195
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:56,241
Why are all the best dishes
only offered for a limited time?

196
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:02,213
Here.

197
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:08,987
What's with you?

198
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:10,922
You haven't said a word.

199
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,590
Totally ruining the vibes.

200
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,428
I'm a little rattled.

201
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:25,937
I saw Ms. Suenaga.

202
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:28,606
-No.
-She hadn't changed.

203
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,411
I realized my feelings hadn't either.

204
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,183
What did Suenaga say?

205
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,019
Never to come again.

206
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,091
Then stay with me.

207
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,261
I'm sorry.

208
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:55,867
I can't treat you
the way you should be treated.

209
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,402
Stop it with that.

210
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,840
Even if it's devious and unfair,

211
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,909
some people don't care as long
as they're together.

212
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,213
You're smart, it's okay to
take advantage of this.

213
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:18,823
Let's end this.

214
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:21,226
I'm sorry.

215
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,374
No.

216
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm not breaking up.

217
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:45,150
You're the one who's wrong.

218
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:48,319
I'll never break up.

219
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:21,419
AIKO KUROIWA

220
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,427
One chicken stew.

221
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:34,999
<i>There's no need to talk about</i>
<i>that incident anymore.</i>

222
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,601
<i>Just ignore them from now on.</i>

223
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:48,913
Delivery.

224
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,182
Here you go.

225
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,289
KOSUKE SHIMAZAKI

226
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,158
<i>There's something I haven't told you.</i>

227
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:04,028
<i>Your father left when you were five.</i>

228
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,667
<i>Your school contacted me.</i>

229
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,171
You missed two days of school last week.

230
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,074
Why?

231
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:22,712
And your career path.

232
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:27,250
You decided to skip college
to go into the workforce?

233
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,920
I was surprised too.

234
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:35,091
Akira.

235
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,427
You have great grades.

236
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,429
You're also in the advanced classes.

237
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:42,198
It's such a waste.

238
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,234
Is there something you want to do?

239
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,739
I want to be independent.

240
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:51,574
What?

241
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,776
I can attend school part-time
while working.

242
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,712
which would help our finances.

243
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,283
-I just want to work.
-Is it for her?

244
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,021
You want to hurry up and be equal

245
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,590
so you can be with her?

246
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:16,065
I met Ms. Suenaga the other day.

247
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,701
She said you saw her.

248
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:21,237
-I can't believe--
-I know, I'm sorry.

249
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:24,807
Was I worried for nothing?

250
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:32,648
Ms. Suenaga is dating someone
who works at her school.

251
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:37,887
He even told me I don't need to worry
about you coming around again.

252
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:40,790
So

253
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,095
if it has nothing to do with her,

254
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,132
then can you tell me why you want to work

255
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,002
and what kind of person

256
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,471
you want to be?

257
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:00,810
Okay.

258
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,915
I'll decide myself
and take responsibility.

259
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,585
Akira! Hey!

260
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,523
What am I supposed to do?

261
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,399
TO AIKO KUROIWA

262
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,234
BECAUSE I'M HIS FATHER

263
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,069
I'M COMING BACK
I WANT TO SPEAK TO HIM

264
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,072
I'LL BE WORKING IN YAMAEJIMA.

265
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,114
TOKYO

266
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,016
-Kawai.
-Yes?

267
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,717
Come with me.

268
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,091
You might be getting sent overseas.

269
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:49,992
What?

270
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,295
An overseas assignment?

271
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,664
The chief is reviewing it.

272
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,435
If you get it, we're all counting on you.

273
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,222
Am I being tested?

274
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:22,358
What?

275
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,293
The overseas assignment.

276
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,829
Are you testing me to see

277
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,331
how I'll answer?

278
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,269
I see. Maybe I am testing you.

279
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,839
I can't even tell myself anymore.

280
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,476
Is that what you think I'd say?

281
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:44,847
It's just a post for two years,
three years maximum.

282
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,586
Going will improve your future prospects.

283
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,758
But a long-distance
relationship won't work.

284
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:59,995
So should we make a clean break
to send you off without regrets?

285
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,232
But I mean, someone else might
get chosen for the position.

286
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,169
It wouldn't be fair of me
to push for you too much.

287
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,739
That's my dilemma.

288
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:15,878
Oh, I thought you were testing me.

289
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,314
Open this.

290
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,550
Long-distance won't work?

291
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,221
It's true that it didn't work with Hijiri.

292
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,093
Which is why I've been thinking.

293
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,829
Even if I get posted overseas,

294
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,602
I still want to be with you.

295
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:43,272
So

296
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:47,643
if I go, I want to make us official.

297
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,380
-Huh?
-So basically, marry me?

298
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:56,852
Get married and do what?

299
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:05,227
Ultimately, I don't care
whether you come with me or not.

300
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:09,365
We'd be married,
so I wouldn't worry about being apart.

301
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,268
In other words,

302
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:16,672
we'd get married
just to secure this relationship?

303
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,809
Let's get married.

304
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,458
You don't need to test us.

305
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,494
We can be free

306
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:42,031
to love each other.

307
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,569
Unlike with Hijiri.

308
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:03,219
Miwa.

309
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:04,987
Miwa.

310
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,328
Ms. Tachibana.

311
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:15,331
BAR ICHIRIKI

312
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:19,502
-Are you okay?
-I'm totally fine.

313
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,870
We're almost there.

314
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,172
-I said I'm fine!
-Huh? Ah!

315
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,144
What?

316
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,847
What? Really?

317
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:34,283
BARLEY TEA

318
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:38,921
What is this about?

319
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,790
You're acting awful nice.

320
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,194
Because we're the same?

321
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:49,265
Because love makes you do
crazy things too?

322
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,635
You want to be friends?

323
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:57,072
Answer me, Ms. Hijiri.

324
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,087
You made the costume for Ayano!

325
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:14,990
Forget it, she doesn't want it.

326
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:18,093
No, don't!

327
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,628
I'm sure Ayano will love it!

328
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:21,263
I already told you…

329
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:25,668
Please come to the school
before the recital!

330
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:28,504
-Let's give it to Ayano.
-Leave it!

331
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,040
Just leave me alone!

332
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,275
It's no use anyway.

333
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,377
She won't wear it even if I make it.

334
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:38,914
She's never coming back.

335
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:43,052
No matter what I do, nothing will change!

336
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,058
Even so,

337
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,928
you should make the effort.

338
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,033
You should work to change your situation.

339
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,368
What about you?

340
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,272
Aren't you just running away?

341
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,891
BAR ICHIRIKI

342
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,885
What are you doing here?

343
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:07,587
I was looking for you.

344
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,891
Then I stepped in a ditch.

345
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:15,695
I told you not to come.

346
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,832
-Hey!
-Please listen.

347
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,468
-I said no!
-I found a letter when I got home.

348
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:22,369
Right now,

349
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:25,672
I'm in hot water.

350
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:32,612
Because of what happened
with you three years ago.

351
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,482
Honestly, I'm in trouble.

352
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:37,951
For me,

353
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,322
all I have is teaching.

354
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:47,060
Maybe I'm not suited to being
a teacher like you said,

355
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,730
but this is all I have.

356
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:53,934
So please,

357
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:57,137
just leave me alone.

358
00:28:57,704 --> 00:28:58,572
And stay away!

359
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,191
Okay.

360
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,563
You want to discard it.

361
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,635
Throw away your past,
cutting off everything.

362
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,239
You think you can reinvent yourself
somewhere new.

363
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,409
But it's just an illusion.

364
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,449
I won't pretend

365
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,086
the past didn't happen.

366
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:47,887
I can't.

367
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:51,358
I won't forget because
it's all precious to me.

368
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,134
I broke up with Iwasaki.

369
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:05,472
But that's something I did on my own.

370
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,977
Just how I forced everything
three years ago.

371
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,483
So don't worry about it,

372
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,885
and become a good teacher.

373
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,626
Although, I'm not sure what
kind of teacher that is…

374
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,699
I'm a little disappointed.

375
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,502
Disappointed in you.

376
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:33,059
I hate you for that.

377
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,462
You should make the effort.

378
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:38,832
<i>You should work to change your situation.</i>

379
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,804
KOMIYA DAI-ICHI ELEMENTARY

380
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,639
RECITAL

381
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:55,046
Next, the third and fourth graders
present "Mimi and the Rainbow Forest."

382
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,784
Such a nice day, Popo!

383
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,851
Woof woof!

384
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:03,854
Such a nice day, but nothing ever changes.

385
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:08,259
A large tornado approaches Mimi and Popo.

386
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,928
There's a tornado getting closer!

387
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,563
Let's get a closer look!

388
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,733
Look at this tree,
the leaves are like rainbows!

389
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:20,771
This whole forest used
to shimmer like a rainbow.

390
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:23,441
What Mimi and Popo found

391
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:27,645
was a magical rainbow tree
displaying its true colors!

392
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,149
Who are you?

393
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,719
I'm the Rainbow Forest fairy.

394
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,621
I knew you would be coming.

395
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:40,224
Do you know where the sword of courage is?

396
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,661
Only the chosen one can find
the sword of courage.

397
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:50,101
Stars sparkled in the night sky.

398
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,810
Okay!

399
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:44,115
-Don't run! You'll bump into each other!
-Ms. Tachibana, your mom's here.

400
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,926
Ayano, I'm sorry I'm late.

401
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,662
I didn't make it in time.

402
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:04,368
I had so much trouble getting
the flower to look good.

403
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,171
I tried to make it in time.

404
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,043
Sorry, I'm sure you don't want it now.

405
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:22,453
Look Ayano, I'll be going away
for a little while.

406
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:29,059
I'll be doing my best to find
a new job and home.

407
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,429
So we can live together again.

408
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,931
What?

409
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,769
Take care.

410
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:41,939
Be a good girl.

411
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:51,749
They said

412
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,323
you're careless

413
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:01,458
and a liar.

414
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,461
Not to meet you.

415
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,600
But

416
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,670
I love you.

417
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,979
So promise to come get me.

418
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,087
Ms. Suenaga.

419
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,691
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused

420
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,428
spreading baseless rumors.

421
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,813
<i>Throw away your past,</i>
<i>cutting off everything.</i>

422
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,483
You think you can reinvent yourself
somewhere new.

423
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,885
I'm a little disappointed.

424
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,754
<i>Disappointed in you.</i>

425
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,295
Wait!

426
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:53,771
It's true.

427
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,373
That rumor

428
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:58,976
is true.

429
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,914
At my previous school,

430
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,652
I had an incident with a student.

431
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,722
Then the rumors…?

432
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,324
She got pregnant?

433
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,658
That didn't happen!

434
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:16,927
However,

435
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,033
I can't make any excuses for what I did.

436
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,636
At that time,

437
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:32,543
I had inappropriate feelings
for a male student.

438
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:33,677
Ms. Suenaga!

439
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,980
We also met alone.

440
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:39,650
Which is why

441
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,287
I quit my former school.

442
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,927
Fortunately, this school
gave me another chance.

443
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,365
I wanted to continue to teach.

444
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:58,802
I was afraid the rumors would spread,
so I stayed quiet.

445
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,875
For betraying all of you,

446
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,145
I'm truly sorry.

447
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:26,962
-Komiya Dai-Ichi Elementary.
-We are currently investigating.

448
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:30,699
What a mess!

449
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,102
This is going to be like a hornet's nest.

450
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:37,539
Ms. Niwa, you knew about this, didn't you?

451
00:39:38,774 --> 00:39:42,444
-I wanted to give her a chance.
-But sexual misconduct!

452
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:45,280
-In this day and age?
-Right?

453
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:47,783
I'm the one who approved it.

454
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,551
Principal Aida!

455
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:52,187
I mean, at this stage,

456
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:56,958
<i>it would be best for Ms. Suenaga</i>
<i>to explain things herself.</i>

457
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:01,263
Hijiri.

458
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:07,436
They're asking you not to return
to the classroom for now.

459
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:10,839
Until they make a decision,

460
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:12,941
you're on desk duty.

461
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:18,847
Okay.

462
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:25,287
I'm sorry.

463
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:29,324
To end up like this
after all of your help.

464
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:34,596
Why did you decide to tell them?

465
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:41,503
Because I couldn't change.

466
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:45,273
By pretending it didn't happen,

467
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:48,677
running away, lying to myself,

468
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:50,712
nothing would change!

469
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:54,483
I can't become a good teacher.

470
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:56,518
Not like this.

471
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:02,524
That's what I realized,

472
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:05,494
so I told them.

473
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,599
I'm not surprised.

474
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,804
But if this loses you your job,
then it's all for nothing.

475
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:38,793
Ms. Suenaga is dating someone
who works at her school.

476
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,128
I'm in hot water.

477
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:44,299
Because of what happened
with you three years ago.

478
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:48,103
All I have is teaching.

479
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,905
<i>Just leave me alone.</i>

480
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:04,519
There's food for you.

481
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:13,562
Akira.

482
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:17,098
Take a seat.

483
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,268
Sit.

484
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,745
Your work called me.

485
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,548
You've missed several days now.

486
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,219
Plus you're skipping school?

487
00:42:38,453 --> 00:42:39,554
What's going on?

488
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,927
I'm not going to college anyway.

489
00:42:47,395 --> 00:42:50,031
-Wait. Time to cut the crap.
-Ow.

490
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:53,268
I mean, what the hell?

491
00:42:54,035 --> 00:42:55,670
What aren't you happy with?

492
00:42:55,737 --> 00:43:00,742
To your mother who has been holding in
her sadness at being apart from you,

493
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:02,510
you barely spoke a word!

494
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:05,113
What'd be the point?

495
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:08,049
You know, don't you?

496
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:11,653
What Mom did?

497
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,889
Your father left when you were five.

498
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:17,559
Because he was struggling with work,
right?

499
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:22,264
That's the reason
I gave you for our divorce.

500
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,498
But I

501
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:27,469
fell in love with someone.

502
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:30,272
She's one to talk after what she did,

503
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:32,707
falling for a married man.

504
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:34,042
That's exactly why.

505
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:36,244
She doesn't want you to make the same--

506
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,014
Still! She doesn't tell me
anything important.

507
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,917
She kept Dad's letters from me.

508
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:46,121
Then she tells me to suck it up
and work hard? To forget!

509
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:47,622
Screw her.

510
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:48,890
You watch it, boy.

511
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:53,295
Say what you want,

512
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:56,431
but your mom's paying for your school.

513
00:43:57,899 --> 00:43:59,234
All your living expenses,

514
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,971
she's the one paying for your
room and board every month.

515
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,373
She's been protecting you.

516
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,342
Do you understand?

517
00:44:08,076 --> 00:44:12,981
-So just give her some peace of mind.
-Okay.

518
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:15,550
-Whatever, I'm done.
-Hey.

519
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:17,519
Akira!

520
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:18,553
Akira!

521
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:43,778
You should take a bandanna.

522
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:44,879
Good morning.

523
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,415
Didn't she mess with a student?

524
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:50,919
You wouldn't think it from looking at her!

525
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:52,921
TEACHER'S LOUNGE

526
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:00,095
Good morning.

527
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:02,297
Huh?

528
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,602
Good morning.

529
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:17,345
Good morning.

530
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,381
Good morning.

531
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:26,688
Akira, you're gonna be late.

532
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:29,457
You're not missing school today--

533
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:30,859
Huh?

534
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:36,798
<i>He what?</i>

535
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:37,866
Here.

536
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:40,168
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING

537
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:41,069
What is this?

538
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:41,870
GOODBYE. AKIRA.

539
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:44,038
What is this?

540
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:48,209
-Where did Akira go?
-Please calm down.

541
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:52,180
I'm going to call around, okay?

542
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:56,651
Don't tell me he…

543
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:13,868
Ms. Suenaga.

544
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:18,440
You have a visitor.

545
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:27,615
Iwasaki.

546
00:46:29,984 --> 00:46:32,120
I came here to punch you.

547
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,059
Just kidding.

548
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:40,795
Is Kuroiwa here now?

549
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:43,765
Huh? Why?

550
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:46,501
-Of course not--
-Really?

551
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:48,903
Really.

552
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:52,941
What? Why?

553
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:55,076
What happened?

554
00:46:57,312 --> 00:46:58,513
Kuroiwa disappeared.

555
00:46:59,314 --> 00:47:01,616
His mom said he left a note and vanished.

556
00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:03,818
She gave us a call.

557
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:05,753
He probably ran away.

558
00:47:07,288 --> 00:47:09,657
-Since when?
-I don't know.

559
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:10,725
Yesterday or today.

560
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:13,795
His mom was asking everyone.

561
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:16,731
I was sure he'd be here.

562
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:22,403
I don't know, I haven't seen him.

563
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:26,140
Where did he go?

564
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:27,675
That idiot.

565
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:30,211
I got better things to do.

566
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,414
He's not even that hot.

567
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:36,184
And started high school
basically a stalker.

568
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:43,825
It's okay if you don't know where he is.
It's not your problem.

569
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,928
Goodbye.

570
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:08,750
INCIDENT / ACCIDENT

571
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,251
RUN AWAY

572
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:21,996
Komiya Dai-Ichi Elementary.

573
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:27,368
Hello?

574
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:29,170
<i>Ms. Suenaga?</i>

575
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:37,879
Um, can you hear me?

576
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,582
Kuroiwa.

577
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,151
Where are you?

578
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:45,687
<i>Iwasaki came by.</i>

579
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:47,388
<i>Everyone's worried.</i>

580
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:49,791
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

581
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:52,060
I wanted to apologize.

582
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:55,530
-Kuroiwa!
-<i>I'm sorry for the other day.</i>

583
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:59,434
For just showing up and lashing out.

584
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:01,803
It's fine.

585
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:06,341
Everything you said was true.

586
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:11,379
<i>I loved your lessons.</i>

587
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:14,816
Your writing on the chalkboard,

588
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:18,553
the lilt in your voice…

589
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:22,223
I still remember them now.

590
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,792
<i>Welcome Rain on a Spring Night.</i>

591
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:27,629
"The good rain knows its season."

592
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:31,199
When spring arrives, it brings life.

593
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:35,436
<i>Ms. Suenaga.</i>

594
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:39,207
Good luck.

595
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:43,978
Kuroiwa.

596
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:48,750
Please tell me where you are right now.

597
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,787
I just wanted to say that one last thing.

598
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:55,623
Last?

599
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:01,629
<i>The ferry for Yamaejima</i>
<i>is now allowing all cars to board.</i>

600
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:04,165
Goodbye, Ms. Suenaga.

601
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:08,536
Kuroiwa, wait!

602
00:50:22,383 --> 00:50:23,451
Yamaejima?

603
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:31,693
YAMAEJIMA FERRY

604
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,095
Ms. Suenaga.

605
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:40,301
Are you ready to leave? It's getting late.

606
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:53,614
Ms. Suenaga!

607
00:50:56,217 --> 00:50:57,085
We should talk.

608
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:04,892
Okay.

609
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:11,799
Could you come with me?

610
00:51:14,102 --> 00:51:14,936
Huh?

611
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:17,505
Instead of staying here,

612
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,074
come with me.

613
00:51:26,214 --> 00:51:27,081
Actually,

614
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:30,918
I have to quit the school.

615
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:34,722
My father fell ill.

616
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:38,126
I'm taking over his business.

617
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:40,661
Then

618
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,598
you won't teach again?

619
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:49,704
So,

620
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:52,306
come with me.

621
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,210
Would you

622
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:00,281
leave this town with me?

623
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:22,036
I figured it was a long shot.

624
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:31,012
You have someone you want to see,
don't you?

625
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:37,185
I've fallen in love with you.

626
00:52:38,753 --> 00:52:41,689
I want you to fall in love with me too.

627
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:44,358
I'll also go to IKEA.

628
00:52:44,992 --> 00:52:47,128
-Then I'll go with you.
-No.

629
00:52:47,195 --> 00:52:50,731
Ms. Suenaga! Thank you!

630
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:52,500
I don't care what anyone says.

631
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,303
I love you.

632
00:52:56,304 --> 00:52:57,471
I'll be an adult soon!

633
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:00,141
Hijiri!

634
00:53:00,975 --> 00:53:02,276
I'm still…

635
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:05,813
the same as on that day.

636
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:16,924
You should go.

637
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:23,998
It's okay.

638
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:36,037
Thank you.

639
00:55:12,873 --> 00:55:15,710
The ferry to Yamaejima is leaving soon.

640
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:37,832
Kuroiwa!

641
00:55:49,176 --> 00:55:50,277
Ms. Suenaga.

642
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,220
<i>-The two of them ran off together?</i>
<i>-Do you understand?</i>

643
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:34,488

644
00:56:34,555 --> 00:56:36,791
