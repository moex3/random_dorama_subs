1
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,209
<i>Kuroiwa disappeared.</i>

2
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,845
His mom said he left a note and vanished.

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,947
Don't tell me he…

4
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:15,449
<i>Ms. Suenaga?</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,517
Kuroiwa.

6
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,352
Where are you?

7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,921
I loved your lessons.

8
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,157
I just wanted to say that one last thing.

9
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,158
Last?

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,427
You have someone you want to see,
don't you?

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,397
You should go.

12
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,750
Kuroiwa.

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,868
Why?

14
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:14,275
Because on the phone you said
it would be the last time.

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,013
I came because
I was worried you said last.

16
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:23,884
I heard you ran away from home,
and you seemed off. I thought you'd--

17
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,553
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,090
I meant it would be
the last time I would call you.

19
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,528
You told me never to come back.

20
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,632
And it seems you have a boyfriend.

21
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,970
So that was my way of breaking off.

22
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,576
So why did you come?

23
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,280
-Why?
-I'm okay.

24
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:54,915
You can go home.

25
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,653
How am I supposed to go home?

26
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,791
Why are you on a boat anyway?

27
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,727
Why are you going to Yamaejima?

28
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,031
To see my dad.

29
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,871
Dad lives in Bali,

30
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,641
so I haven't seen him at all,
but he sent letters.

31
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,076
Letters?

32
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,012
AIKO KUROIWA

33
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,482
He sent a letter to mom
telling her he's back in Japan.

34
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,485
I happened to find it.

35
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:37,324
KOSUKE SHIMAZAKI

36
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,493
I want to see him.

37
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,696
I felt that if I talked to him,

38
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,134
something would change.

39
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,846
And your Mom?

40
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,215
Did you call her?

41
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,752
You haven't?

42
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,522
I'm sure she's worried.

43
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,027
I'll call her then.

44
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,129
No, that's okay.

45
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,365
I'll do it myself.

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,648
SORRY, MOM. I'M GOING TO GO SEE DAD.
I'LL COME BACK WHEN I DO.

47
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,701
Do you know where your Dad is?

48
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,669
No, he didn't write his address.

49
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,672
But he mentioned he's building
furniture at his friend's shop.

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,140
-That's it?
-Yes.

51
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,709
And if you don't meet him?

52
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,178
Do you think you will?

53
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,081
I'll think of something if it comes to it.

54
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,018
-But--
-I'm fine now.

55
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,953
Thank you.

56
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,138
Kuroiwa.

57
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,875
Maybe go to the visitor's center first.

58
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,345
Okay.

59
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,919
-Welcome.
-Hello.

60
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,755
-First time here?
-Yes.

61
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,957
-Did you just arrive?
-Yes.

62
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:55,896
Perfect! Today's the first day
of our Neptune Festival.

63
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,332
-The parade should--
-Um…

64
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,534
Do you know any furniture makers?

65
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,171
I'm sorry, I don't know of any.

66
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:18,719
Excuse me, are there any
furniture makers around here?

67
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,989
-You know any furniture makers?
-No.

68
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,724
Thank you.

69
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,126
<i>Do you know any furniture stores?</i>

70
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,263
I might know a place.

71
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,198
Where?

72
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,502
Do you know the furniture maker
Kosuke Shimazaki?

73
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,404
I don't.

74
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,940
I don't know any Kosuke Shimazaki.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,345
What are we going to do now?

76
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,381
Mr. Shimazaki? You mean Shimayan?

77
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,149
You know him?

78
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,587
He makes furniture over at
the Kajio Lumberyard.

79
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:57,191
-Kajio?
-Could you show us where it is?

80
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,633
Yes, we found it.

81
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,640
Um, excuse me.

82
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,644
Is there a Kosuke Shimazaki here?

83
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,483
He's not here right now.

84
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,118
When will he be back?

85
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,722
No idea, he went out to fish
so probably not for a while.

86
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,890
I'll wait.

87
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,928
Who are you?

88
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,898
Akira Kuroiwa.

89
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,535
I'm Mr. Shimazaki's son.

90
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:47,975
I see, then maybe
I can tell you the truth.

91
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:56,583
He's actually trying to keep
a low profile.

92
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,484
What?

93
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,556
He's in hiding.

94
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,491
Loan sharks.

95
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,862
So he's avoiding any contact--

96
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,098
Um, could we meet him?

97
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,103
Maybe when we learn his situation,
we could be able to help.

98
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,071
Okay, I get it.

99
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,940
I'll tell you the real truth.

100
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,411
-He's in the hospital.
-Really?

101
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,946
Yeah, in the hospital.

102
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,651
He just suddenly collapsed.

103
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,752
Dad?

104
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,490
You're him, right?

105
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,971
You caught me.

106
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,117
Akira.

107
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,474
You're so damn big and strong!

108
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,245
I can't believe how much you've grown!

109
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,145
So strong!

110
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,581
-Muscly.
-What was that about?

111
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,016
About loan sharks.

112
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,486
Sorry, it was just so sudden.

113
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,623
I mean, I wasn't ready for this yet.

114
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,959
And Aiko told me not to see you
without asking first.

115
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,565
It's been 13 years, huh?

116
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,138
And who is this?

117
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,075
Nice to meet you, I'm Hijiri Suenaga.

118
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,848
Look at you, bringing your girlfriend.

119
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,583
-She's not.
-No, I'm his teacher!

120
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,555
Technically, I'm his former teacher,
and he's my former student.

121
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,523
It's complicated, but I'm his chaperone.

122
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,026
But

123
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,530
I'm glad he got to meet you.

124
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,733
I'll leave you to the rest.

125
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:32,139
I guess I will go catch
the return ferry home.

126
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,740
There aren't any.

127
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,410
Excuse me?

128
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,078
<i>It's one trip per day.</i>

129
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,246
<i>One?</i>

130
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,849
Yes, you had to be
on the ferry you came on.

131
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,020
One second please.

132
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,557
The next ferry is…

133
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,559
-You can crash with us.
-Sunday?

134
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,462
-Huh?
-You don't have a choice.

135
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,231
You two come stay with me tonight.

136
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,533
It'll be cramped.

137
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,116
-Son?
-Yeah.

138
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,386
This is my son Akira and Ms. Hijiri.

139
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:36,789
This is Kajio.

140
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:37,857
And his wife Wakako.

141
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:40,126
-Hi there.
-Can we join you for lunch?

142
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,094
Of course! Come eat!

143
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:46,198
No, I should go look for some
accommodations.

144
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:50,436
-It's no use, they're all full.
-It's the Neptune Festival.

145
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:54,240
And also people are here for
the fishing season.

146
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,808
Now come inside!

147
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,511
-It's a bit messy.
-This is my house!

148
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,346
Eat up!

149
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:04,517
Good, you found Shimayan!

150
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,921
Mr. Kusunogi, this is Shimayan's son!

151
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:10,322
What?

152
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,326
Welcome home!

153
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:16,328
-Go wash your hands!
-Wash your hands!

154
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,031
Kajio is an old fishing buddy.

155
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:23,736
I was just being polite inviting him
here if he was back in Japan.

156
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,304
Then he actually came!

157
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,208
I make furniture here to sell online.

158
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:34,280
So your son brought
his girlfriend to meet you?

159
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,081
-She's not.
-No, I'm his teacher.

160
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:37,883
What?

161
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,553
Former teacher, former student.

162
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:43,255
We just ended up here together.

163
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:46,125
-Mom, we're hungry.
-Okay.

164
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,494
-Could I get your help?
-Yes?

165
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,797
Sorry to ask but
the squid needs to be gutted.

166
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,899
Um… Gutted?

167
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,770
Of course, you're a city girl!

168
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,173
You don't cook for your boyfriend?

169
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,809
I don't have anyone like that.

170
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,179
Okay, I'll do it.

171
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,848
I can do it.

172
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,918
-Huh?
-You can do it?

173
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,557
You're so good.

174
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:20,226
Where'd you learn?

175
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:23,262
I helped do it at the boarding house.

176
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:27,199
-Give it back.
-No!

177
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,835
-It's mine!
-No!

178
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:32,838
Now, now, don't fight.

179
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,975
I can't believe she let you.

180
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:41,480
Your mom never
responded to any of my letters.

181
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,382
So why the sudden change?

182
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,820
I didn't tell her I was coming.

183
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,555
This is the stuff.

184
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,156
What?

185
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,226
Ms. Hijiri told me to tell her,

186
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:59,365
but I tricked her and sent
an e-mail to my own account.

187
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,734
What are you thinking?

188
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,471
If I told her, she'd lose her mind
and rush over here.

189
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,372
Still.

190
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,747
You know, whatever.

191
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,286
I've waited 13 years,
she can cut me some slack.

192
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:26,325
This seaweed is really good.

193
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,160
Did he reach out to you?

194
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,328
No.

195
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:34,199
I hit all the places he might be,
but turned up nothing.

196
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,734
What about the police?

197
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:40,572
I called a station, and
they'll contact me if there's anything.

198
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,942
Akira can handle himself,
and he could be with someone.

199
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,813
Do you think

200
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,582
he's with her?

201
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:55,754
There's no way to know,
I don't have her number.

202
00:13:58,257 --> 00:13:59,491
Wait!

203
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:01,327
Hold on.

204
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:03,662
Um…

205
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,500
This person might know!

206
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,203
Him!

207
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,304
SHOTARO KAWAI

208
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:15,774
Mr. Kawai?

209
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:21,880
It's been a long time.

210
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:23,549
Um?

211
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:24,483
It's Kuroiwa.

212
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,986
I'm Akira Kuroiwa's mother.

213
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,456
I'm sorry for coming to your work.

214
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,692
I hate to ask,

215
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:37,963
but would you happen to have
Ms. Suenaga's contact information?

216
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:39,832
Hijiri's?

217
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,009
Ms. Suenaga.

218
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,513
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:02,354
Akira is a troublemaker, isn't he?

220
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,289
Dragging you out here.

221
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,292
Not enough parental discipline.

222
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:11,530
No, Aiko is doing her job.

223
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,300
He has my bad genetics.

224
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:17,903
Not at all.

225
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:24,376
He was a very earnest,

226
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,678
and dedicated student.

227
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:33,118
An excellent learner who listened
to my lessons intently.

228
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:36,889
Huh, not like me at all.

229
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:44,730
But he was also awkward,

230
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:47,199
like when he wanted something,

231
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:50,803
he pushed them away instead.

232
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,740
He was hard to grasp.

233
00:15:56,975 --> 00:16:00,045
I'm sure he still is.

234
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:04,450
Now that sounds like me.

235
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:20,699
She's not answering.

236
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:23,802
I see.

237
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,574
I will let you know when
I get a hold of her.

238
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,245
Here's my card. Call me anytime.

239
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,646
Thank you so much.

240
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:37,282
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you.

241
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,187
He's already 18.

242
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:45,123
I probably don't need to worry.

243
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:49,328
But maybe he's done something
with Ms. Suenaga again.

244
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,965
When it comes to her,

245
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,934
he loses sight of everything.

246
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:02,174
I just want to know
where he is and if he's safe.

247
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,086
That seaweed was good, right?

248
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,121
Yeah, it was.

249
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:17,422
We'll have more.

250
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,027
This is me.

251
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:22,928
Huh?

252
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:25,831
-Here?
-It's mostly my tools.

253
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,167
It's clean inside.

254
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,704
Please come in.

255
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:39,878
DAISUKEMARU

256
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,616
You can put your things down
anywhere around there.

257
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:53,392
Why did you become a furniture maker?

258
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,330
I started off making chairs,

259
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,599
and they said I had talent.

260
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,635
It became fun and I just got hooked.

261
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:07,406
Luckily, I got to join a big company.

262
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,742
That's where I met Aiko.

263
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:20,052
Where's my charger?

264
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,920
You've got exams this year, right?

265
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,389
Anything you want to do?

266
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,558
I haven't decided yet.

267
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:31,029
So you fought over that and ran here.

268
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:34,700
Aiko's gonna be pissed.

269
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:36,735
Leave me out of it.

270
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,137
I'm staying out of it. Got it?

271
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,607
-Um.
-Why did you divorce?

272
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,445
Because she fell for someone?

273
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:51,850
It's complicated.

274
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,454
Well, when you fall in love one day

275
00:18:56,121 --> 00:19:00,192
and learn what a relationship is,
then maybe I'll tell you.

276
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,294
I know already.

277
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:06,965
I've had my struggles too.

278
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:09,635
And someone I like.

279
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:12,704
Your teacher?

280
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,412
I doubt I'll love anybody as much again.

281
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:23,281
Not more than her.

282
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:34,391
TOKYO

283
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,206
This is so hard to watch.

284
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,277
You only have one thing on your mind.

285
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:56,146
What?

286
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,548
Kuroiwa with Hijiri.

287
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:02,085
Of course I'm worried.

288
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,555
Do you think it's something serious?

289
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,291
-Surely not.
-Or maybe…

290
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,061
The two of them ran off together?

291
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,698
One thing lead to another,
and they ran away for love.

292
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:18,435
-No way.
-But they have reunited.

293
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:23,673
<i>Which is why his mother</i>
<i>can't help but be worried.</i>

294
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,544
<i>You can't underestimate</i>
<i>a mother's instincts.</i>

295
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:32,716
Seeing the level of worry she has,
it could be serious.

296
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,287
Hijiri's not that stupid.

297
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:42,292
It doesn't matter how smart you are,
love hits everyone the same way.

298
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:45,361
It makes you want to be together.

299
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:49,099
Thank you for the charger.

300
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,301
I'm going to the store.

301
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,036
Okay, see you later.

302
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:53,837
Shopping?

303
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:59,142
Yes, I need a toothbrush and other things.

304
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,344
-You know where it is?
-I've go this.

305
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,880
You should go with her.

306
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:07,383
It gets dark early, so just in case.

307
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,185
I'll be fine on my own.

308
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,160
That way?

309
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:21,798
I told you.

310
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,234
Give it.

311
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:29,739
What's wrong?

312
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,144
We're trying to get to
the shopping district.

313
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:38,248
That's pretty far.

314
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,850
You should take my bike.

315
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,855
The weather will turn,
so just be quick about it.

316
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,991
Alright, it's that way!

317
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,114
Hey!

318
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,253
Rainbow's Chocolate!

319
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,555
I'm buying it.

320
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,390
Look! There's--

321
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,962
Hey… So sorry.

322
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:07,036
Congratulations!

323
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,539
YAMAEJIMA BOOTS

324
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:50,780
It's beautiful.

325
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,624
<i>Find any leads?</i>

326
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,029
No, I mean, I asked
all my friends from back then,

327
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,598
but nobody's been talking to Kuroiwa.

328
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,701
I had Ebihara ask around, but no luck.

329
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,379
I don't want to apologize.

330
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,717
-I mean, why should I?
-What?

331
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,387
-You're right.
-Now hold on.

332
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:35,158
She told Kuroiwa where Suenaga was,
so he dumped--

333
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,494
It's fine, I didn't like hiding it
from him anyway.

334
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:40,430
It wasn't fair.

335
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:41,731
There's no fair in love.

336
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,734
Whoever cares more loses.

337
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,569
Why fight to lose?

338
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:51,341
Ever since middle school,
watching you pissed me off.

339
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,543
That's why you meddled?

340
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:55,778
Girls are scary.

341
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:58,448
I'm saying it's a waste.

342
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:02,819
Kuroiwa probably disappeared
to go after Suenaga.

343
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:05,621
Just realize you can't beat her already.

344
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:09,492
She's the one who can't win,
he's her student!

345
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,860
Society won't let them.

346
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:14,030
<i>They don't have a future.</i>

347
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:43,926
You took pictures like that before.

348
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,440
This is my favorite time of day.

349
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:02,512
No matter how bad a day I'm having,

350
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,015
it all just melts away.

351
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,691
You love sunsets,

352
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,995
you can gut a squid,

353
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,998
you're good with kids,

354
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:26,702
and you like these.

355
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,709
I never knew.

356
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:40,950
I know a lot about you.

357
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:43,553
Sure you do.

358
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,421
I feel like I do.

359
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,991
Back when you were my teacher,

360
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,129
you tried so hard to act like one.

361
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,698
<i>Welcome rain on a spring night.</i>

362
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,668
The good rain knows its season.

363
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,404
<i>Even though you weren't really confident.</i>

364
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:06,943
I don't think you were
the only one to think that.

365
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:09,846
But now you're confident,

366
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:13,783
and you're having fun teaching.

367
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:19,288
At my previous school, I had
an incident with a student.

368
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,591
For betraying all of you,

369
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,193
I'm truly sorry.

370
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,397
You don't know me at all.

371
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,771
I told my school

372
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:42,445
everything that happened with you.

373
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,348
Why?

374
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:48,784
I wonder why.

375
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,954
I didn't think I could hide it for one,

376
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:58,194
and I also didn't think
I could be a teacher that way.

377
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,835
So they took me out of the classroom.

378
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,872
I don't know what will happen.

379
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:14,377
But I plan to stop running away.

380
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:17,613
I love my current school,

381
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,584
and my students.

382
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,455
That all remains true.

383
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:43,306
I promise to protect you from now on.

384
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,314
I'll drop out of school and find a job,
then we can go anywhere--

385
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,415
Hold on.

386
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,151
You're dropping out?

387
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,486
And college?

388
00:28:57,553 --> 00:28:59,889
I'm not going because it doesn't matter.

389
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,026
As long as I have you…

390
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:15,605
Let's go back.

391
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:17,840
Your dad's waiting.

392
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,438
SHOTARO

393
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,073
<i>Leave a message after…</i>

394
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:06,654
So many sweet potatoes.

395
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,225
I went ahead and took a bath.

396
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,394
This is from Mr. Kajio.

397
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,632
What is this?

398
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,201
Huh?

399
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,209
Idiot.

400
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,312
What're you imagining?

401
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:33,480
We sleep here, she sleeps upstairs.

402
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,217
Of course.

403
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:38,118
Idiot.

404
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:40,988
Of course.

405
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,424
Of course.

406
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:51,899
I promise to protect you from now on.

407
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,576
I'll drop out of school and find a job.

408
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:03,977
You're dropping out?

409
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:05,679
And college?

410
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:28,902
Thank you so much
for your hospitality today.

411
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,974
It's nothing, thanks for all your help.

412
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,142
I didn't do much.

413
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:38,212
And thank you for the charger.

414
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:43,550
FROM SHOTARO: ONE TEXT, FIVE MISSED CALLS

415
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:55,262
URGENT! PLEASE CALL ME!

416
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,410
-Hijiri?
<i>-Sorry, just saw your calls.</i>

417
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:10,477
Where are you now?

418
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:12,679
<i>Are you alone?</i>

419
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:16,016
Why do you ask?

420
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,519
Kuroiwa's mother came to me.

421
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:20,687
What?

422
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,923
She said he ran away from home.

423
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,725
She came to me worried.

424
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,194
She thinks he's with you.

425
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:28,095
No…

426
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,497
He said he messaged--

427
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:31,432
You're with him?

428
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:35,869
You are.

429
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:43,744
I don't know how to explain.

430
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:48,882
Um, Kuroiwa called me.

431
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:52,553
He seemed off, so I went
after him, then the ship left.

432
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,655
We're with his father.

433
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,959
But we haven't done
anything to worry about.

434
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:00,294
Do you get it?

435
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:04,498
Do you know what kind
of commotion you're causing?

436
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,169
I tried to come home today.

437
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:10,504
This could be a crime!

438
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,444
-I wasn't done talking.
-You need to calm down.

439
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,221
Ms. Suenaga, Dad said to give this to you.

440
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,290
What?

441
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,394
You lied about contacting your mother?

442
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:38,065
-What?
-Did you lie about it?

443
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:44,204
I thought she might stop me
from seeing my dad.

444
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:46,240
But how?

445
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,543
I need to talk to your father.

446
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,878
Wait.

447
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:59,119
I just came along to see
that you made it because I was worried.

448
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,624
That's all.
I can't have people get the wrong idea.

449
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,694
I'll have him call her
so she won't be worried.

450
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,763
Wait, where are you going?

451
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,534
I checked again and found
a hotel with available rooms.

452
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:15,402
Right now?

453
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:20,207
I don't think we should be spending
the night together in the same place.

454
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,677
Then I'll go home tomorrow.

455
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:53,974
Who are you calling?

456
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,844
His mother?

457
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,182
I promised her I would.

458
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:05,285
Is it jealousy?

459
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,354
What?

460
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:11,992
Finding out that
Hijiri still cares for that boy?

461
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:13,994
-No.
-Then your pride was hurt--

462
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,829
No, it's not that!

463
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:20,434
I'm pissed off he keeps
using Hijiri's nurturing instincts

464
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,136
to confuse and manipulate her.

465
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,838
I'm also pissed at Hijiri

466
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,408
for falling for it every time,
maybe even knowingly!

467
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:31,778
This isn't jealousy.

468
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,714
-I'm just--
-Then just leave it!

469
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:36,717
If it's not jealousy,

470
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,987
and you don't have feelings for Hijiri,

471
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:41,521
then just leave it!

472
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:48,295
What does it matter?

473
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:13,220
Stop.

474
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:16,957
I just…

475
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,327
<i>This is Kuroiwa.</i>

476
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:22,896
<i>Hello?</i>

477
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:25,666
<i>Hello?</i>

478
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,067
It's Kawai.

479
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,271
Um…

480
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:48,689
I managed to reach Hijiri.

481
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:52,459
She's with your son.

482
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:06,604
TICKET COUNTER

483
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:43,775
Good night.

484
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:53,718
Wake up, ma'am.

485
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,754
Ma'am, wake up.

486
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,723
Wake up, ma'am.

487
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:01,559
There's no ferry today.

488
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:05,497
-What?
-There's going to be a storm.

489
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,098
<i>Do they have a room?</i>

490
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:11,503
They can offer a camp site
bungalow if there's no other option.

491
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:13,238
Yes, please.

492
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,540
Thanks for the food.

493
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:42,467
I promise to protect you from now on.

494
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,969
<i>I'll drop out of school and find a job.</i>

495
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,292
Where you headed?

496
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:09,494
-What?
-Come on, get in.

497
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:11,262
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, come on.

498
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,103
<i>Sorry about yesterday.</i>

499
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,338
I lost my cool.

500
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:26,277
But understand,
I don't have feelings for Hijiri--

501
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,245
Jealousy.

502
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:28,580
I'm not.

503
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:31,482
No, I'm the one who's jealous.

504
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:33,551
What?

505
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:38,223
Every time you say Hijiri's name,

506
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:41,426
every time you get worked up
like yesterday,

507
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,194
I realize I'm jealous.

508
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,333
Three years ago with Hijiri,

509
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,704
the messy way things ended,

510
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,707
it must have hurt you.

511
00:39:57,141 --> 00:40:00,311
I can't marry you.

512
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,948
Whose fault is it that we're in
this stupid, shameful situation…

513
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,351
I'm sorry.

514
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,256
There's nothing I can do for you.

515
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,424
You don't have to.

516
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:14,659
And still,

517
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,363
I tried to be by your side anyway.

518
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,034
About that overseas position,

519
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:27,538
I'm still hesitating whether or not
to recommend you.

520
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,877
Which is why I'll focus on work.

521
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:37,048
Going overseas will help your career.

522
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:42,620
I officially nominate Shotaro Kawai
to the Singapore position.

523
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:45,556
What?

524
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:49,327
But then

525
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:51,896
what about us?

526
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,631
We're through.

527
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,502
Broken up.

528
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,707
Let's end things, Kawai.

529
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:09,180
This is our Last Supper.

530
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,283
Even though it's lunch.

531
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:17,755
Thank you!

532
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:29,904
CAMPING AREA 2.1KM

533
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:38,897
I took you to the park on a windy
day like this before.

534
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,868
I think you were still about
three or four.

535
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:48,408
When I told you we should go home
because thunder's coming,

536
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,477
you said you'd catch it,

537
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,714
and you're not leaving until you do.

538
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:55,982
What?

539
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:58,952
I don't remember that.

540
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,789
That stubborn part of you

541
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:05,592
just like your Mom.

542
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,230
That's why you two probably clash.

543
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:14,401
Forget mom.

544
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:17,104
<i>She doesn't listen.</i>

545
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,673
<i>Especially about Ms. Hijiri.</i>

546
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,942
YAMAEJIMA

547
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:22,976
NO FERRIES

548
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,812
<i>She won't talk about you either.</i>

549
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,915
<i>She keeps treating me like a child.</i>

550
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,351
That's why

551
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:34,955
I don't expect anything from her.

552
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,457
I gave up on her.

553
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:39,626
That's why she didn't.

554
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,764
Because you're a child, her son.

555
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,033
She protected you.

556
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:54,741
I was absolutely horrible back then,

557
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,846
just the worst.

558
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:04,818
But she didn't tell you any of that.

559
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,626
DANGER! NO ENTRY

560
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:26,606
I was irritable because work
wasn't going that well.

561
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:31,077
So I'd go out and drink.

562
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:36,449
Whenever you cried, I blamed your mother.

563
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:37,951
I'd yell and shout.

564
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:43,657
But she held on.

565
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:48,595
<i>She didn't want you to lose a father.</i>

566
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,597
<i>So she decided to bottle it in.</i>

567
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,570
<i>I got even more pissed</i>
<i>when she told me so.</i>

568
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,807
I just yelled at her and left.

569
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:08,648
I ran away.

570
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:15,255
So if she then met someone
that she felt attracted to,

571
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,626
even if she had,

572
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,963
it didn't matter if we weren't divorced,

573
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,532
I'm in no position to say anything.

574
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:29,736
<i>In the end, she took it all</i>

575
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,407
and raised you without saying anything.

576
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,184
Listen, Akira, if you really
love your teacher,

577
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,989
you have to make the effort
to convince your mom.

578
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:53,493
Don't run away like me.

579
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,964
If you really love Ms. Hijiri,

580
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,701
become a good man.

581
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:21,988
<i>Why did he go with her?</i>

582
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,792
Why won't he call me?

583
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,162
Tell me Joffe.

584
00:45:31,298 --> 00:45:32,966
What's happening to Akira?

585
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:36,903
When will he come home?

586
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,143
Please someone tell me.

587
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:25,051
Hey! Is Ms. Hijiri here?

588
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:28,355
She stayed at a hotel last night.

589
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:32,492
Apparently, she spent the night
at the ferry station.

590
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:33,660
What?

591
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,328
The ferry was canceled today,

592
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:38,798
but she hasn't shown up
to the bungalow she reserved!

593
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,417
-I'll call you back later.
-Any luck?

594
00:47:30,483 --> 00:47:33,920
Welcome back. We haven't found her.

595
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,955
<i>Where did she go?</i>

596
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:39,192
Ms. Suenaga!

597
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:43,663
Ms. Suenaga!

598
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:55,308
Somebody.

599
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:57,377
Help!

600
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:01,381
Ms. Suenaga!

601
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:04,451
Ms. Suenaga.

602
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:32,946
Ms. Suenaga.

603
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:42,722
Help!

604
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:48,128
Somebody!

605
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:53,266
Somebody, help!

606
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:06,779
Ms. Suenaga!

607
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,194
Kuroiwa.

608
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:23,029
Hold on, I'm coming!

609
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:31,237
Are you okay? Can you stand?

610
00:49:32,238 --> 00:49:34,073
I dropped my map.

611
00:49:34,674 --> 00:49:36,676
Why didn't you call me?

612
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,082
Don't make me worry.

613
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:50,890
I'm sorry.

614
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:57,764
Are you okay?

615
00:49:58,598 --> 00:49:59,432
Yeah.

616
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:04,704
Are you okay?

617
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:07,273
I'm fine.

618
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:15,448
Let's rest there.

619
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:34,467
Kuroiwa.

620
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,003
Here.

621
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:41,007
That's alright, I'm okay.

622
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,978
You must be cold.

623
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,013
Come here.

624
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:48,681
I'm fine here.

625
00:50:51,517 --> 00:50:53,186
When the rain dies down,

626
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,022
I'll leave.

627
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,325
Dry off already.

628
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:00,560
I'm fine.

629
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:02,629
Kuroiwa.

630
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:14,040
Look,

631
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:17,310
I'm a man, you know.

632
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,950
So I'm fine here.

633
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:29,922
Besides, the reason this happened

634
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,662
is all my fault.

635
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,618
Yes, it is.

636
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:02,388
It's your fault!

637
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:08,494
It's all your fault.

638
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:14,400
The reason I'm on this island,
the reason I'm stuck here,

639
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:19,572
it all goes back to you.

640
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,387
If I never met you,

641
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,692
I'd still be working at the school.

642
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,531
I could've stayed a teacher.

643
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,202
But I'm back in hot water,

644
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:52,638
so…

645
00:52:59,612 --> 00:53:00,546
So…

646
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,550
I distanced myself to run away.

647
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:11,624
But I don't know anymore,

648
00:53:13,826 --> 00:53:15,661
what kind of excuse I can give,

649
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:19,065
what I can blame it on.

650
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:28,708
It's so hard.

651
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,151
I'm also…

652
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:43,790
Still the same,

653
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:46,993
as on that day.

654
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:52,432
Back on that beach
after the fireworks festival.

655
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:56,869
I'm also still…

656
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,976
What can I do to forget you?

657
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,888
I love you.

658
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:23,362
I love you.

659
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:50,616
Yes?

660
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:57,056
I'm here to talk about your daughter.

661
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:07,500
-I love Kuroiwa, not as his teacher.
-Hijiri!

662
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,768
<i>What are you doing?</i>

663
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:09,969
<i>But I can't ignore you.</i>

664
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,504
I'm over you.

665
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:14,607
<i>-Go ahead and cry.</i>
<i>-I wouldn't regret it.</i>

666
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:15,641
