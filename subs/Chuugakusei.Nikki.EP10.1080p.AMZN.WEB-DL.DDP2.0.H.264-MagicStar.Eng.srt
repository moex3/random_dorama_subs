1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,506
Ms. Suenaga!

2
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,513
Hold on, I'm coming!

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,148
Are you okay?

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,250
Let's rest there.

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,552
It's your fault!

6
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,156
It's all your fault.

7
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,162
If I never met you,

8
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,167
I'd still be working at the school.

9
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,103
I could've stayed a teacher.

10
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,739
But I don't know anymore,

11
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,509
what kind of excuse I can give,

12
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,778
what I can blame it on.

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,816
I love you.

14
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,488
I love you.

15
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,200
As it is now, nobody will understand.

16
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,037
You'd just get blamed for everything,

17
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,775
I don't want you to shoulder it all.

18
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,216
Thank you.

19
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,501
I hoped to find you here!

20
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,637
I'm so glad you're alive!

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,947
I promise to protect you from now on.

22
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,218
<i>Do you know what kind</i>
<i>of commotion you're causing?</i>

23
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,552
This could be a crime!

24
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,940
Thank you for letting me stay.

25
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,277
Yup.

26
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,417
That's it?

27
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,131
This is bee's wax.

28
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,133
It comes from a beehive.

29
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,571
We use it like this to mend cracks.

30
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:35,909
I probably

31
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,848
kept sending those letters to your mother

32
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,685
to try to mend the cracks

33
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,890
I made years ago in our relationship.

34
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,826
But unlike wood,

35
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,862
the cracks in people

36
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,598
can't be mended so easily.

37
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,668
But

38
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,671
you still have time.

39
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,178
Thanks.

40
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,050
I'll come back here to see you again.

41
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,932
Mr. Shimazaki.

42
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,141
Here, take this.

43
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,744
Thank you.

44
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:50,084
Thank you so much for all your help.

45
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,984
It's nothing.

46
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,255
Please…

47
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,460
Please look after

48
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,129
Akira for me.

49
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,398
Ms. Suenaga.

50
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,613
I got a text from Akira!

51
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,514
What?

52
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,416
Hold on.

53
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,587
SORRY FOR WORRYING YOU.
I'M COMING HOME TODAY.

54
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,588
Finally.

55
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,757
I guess he's done running away from home.

56
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,059
Thank goodness.

57
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,231
He's going to come back with her,
isn't he?

58
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,649
JOFFE WILL COME PICK YOU UP.

59
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,614
Will you call me this time?

60
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,888
AKIRA KUROIWA

61
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,890
I want to see you again.

62
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,072
We have to talk to your mother.

63
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,345
And I'll also decide on my career path.

64
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,381
I'll work to gain her acceptance

65
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:02,950
and then

66
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,652
think about our future.

67
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,683
Thank you.

68
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,159
Sorry to have worried you.

69
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,214
Mom?

70
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,453
What are you doing, Hijiri!

71
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,226
-What are you doing?
-Don't blame her.

72
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,161
-Akira.
-I can explain.

73
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,729
Just come with me!

74
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,798
Ms. Suenaga!

75
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,170
Ms. Suenaga!

76
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,429
So he called you first,

77
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:15,367
and you went after him because
you were worried he was acting strange.

78
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,205
Yes.

79
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:20,473
Then--

80
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:24,777
The ferry just happened to get
cancelled and you couldn't get home.

81
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,681
Kuroiwa stayed at his father's place.

82
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:29,582
Yes.

83
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,752
You were only worried about him
as his teacher, right?

84
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:41,627
-Yes, at first--
-Oh, good.

85
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,564
I almost had a heart attack.

86
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:50,803
I assumed you two did something stupid.

87
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:56,208
Kuroiwa's mother was so worried.

88
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,812
I'm here to talk about your daughter.

89
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,349
My son isn't coming home.

90
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,786
After searching everywhere,

91
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,457
we found out he's with Ms. Suenaga.

92
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:15,661
Please, would you get in touch with her?

93
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,868
But I couldn't get through to your phone.

94
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,607
It got wet in the rain and broke.

95
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:34,046
Well, we got even more worried.

96
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:36,215
That's why…

97
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,855
I'm sorry for hitting you.

98
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,934
But Mom, I…

99
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,708
It's okay.

100
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,582
We'll go see Ms. Kuroiwa tomorrow
and tell her what you just told me.

101
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,084
Once you explain,

102
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,520
she's sure to understand.

103
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:16,722
It'll be okay.

104
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:19,625
Now.

105
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:28,701
My tie!

106
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,103
You can stay home from school today.

107
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:32,871
My phone!

108
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,673
Um…

109
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,810
You can go back tomorrow.

110
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,946
What happened?

111
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,750
What about your Dad?

112
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:50,456
How about the two of us go
to a public bath and have a nice talk?

113
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,561
I promise we'll talk when I get home.

114
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:57,997
Yeah?

115
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:02,635
And have you thought about what you did?
Feeling remorseful?

116
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:05,471
Yeah.

117
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,541
So I'm going to school.

118
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,511
Bye.

119
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:31,297
KUROIWA

120
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,776
I'm so sorry about this.

121
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:45,477
Come in.

122
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:08,298
As I understand, my son first called you

123
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:10,734
and dragged you into this.

124
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:13,770
Is that correct?

125
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,909
No, that's not what we're trying to say.

126
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:24,147
It all started three years ago.

127
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,418
You are understandably worried.

128
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,887
Please accept my apology.

129
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,426
Hijiri just went to chaperon.

130
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,030
She was concerned as his former teacher.

131
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:44,067
She simply ensured he made it safely
to his father, nothing more.

132
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,436
Right, Hijiri?

133
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,248
I'm sorry, Mom.

134
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,017
Hijiri.

135
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm very sorry.

136
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,562
I love your son.

137
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,433
Not as a teacher.

138
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,836
I'm in love with him.

139
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,039
What are you saying?

140
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,675
What's gotten into you?

141
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:27,544
Hijiri?

142
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,146
Do you know what you're saying?

143
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,046
I do.

144
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,917
I understand your judgment.

145
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:36,987
-But--
-Then!

146
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,922
Stop this!

147
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,927
How many times are you
going to repeat the same mistake?

148
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:49,633
Apologize to Ms. Kuroiwa,
and swear you'll never see her son again!

149
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,135
Hijiri!

150
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:55,839
I can't do that.

151
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,976
I can't…

152
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,280
I can't keep lying.

153
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,886
I promise you,

154
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,957
I won't do anything to hinder
your son's life.

155
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,259
Not until

156
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:19,863
I get your blessing.

157
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,471
If only I could tell you

158
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,374
that you have my blessing.

159
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,643
But

160
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,513
I can't do that.

161
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:38,615
For Akira right now,

162
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,452
being around you makes him unstable.

163
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,123
Just like three years ago.

164
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:49,759
The two of you

165
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,663
<i>were so desperate to explore</i>
<i>your feelings,</i>

166
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:55,999
<i>you became blind,</i>

167
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,436
<i>and lost so much.</i>

168
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,774
Both of your lives
will be ruined at this rate.

169
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:10,981
For right now,

170
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,586
if we work hard to do what we can,

171
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,556
waiting for the right time--

172
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,659
You say you will wait,

173
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,029
but how can you have so much faith?

174
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:30,267
Akira is still just 18.

175
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:38,408
What if Akira has a change of heart,
and falls for someone else.

176
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,746
If that were to happen,
the one who would lose everything

177
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,981
is you.

178
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,156
I believe in Kuroiwa.

179
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,825
Besides,

180
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,628
even if that happens,

181
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,264
I wouldn't regret it.

182
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,814
When I heard you two were on the island,

183
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:24,588
I thought it was some kind of
kidnapping or something.

184
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:29,392
Akira's still in high school.

185
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,028
A minor.

186
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:35,899
You are also a teacher.

187
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,902
It is only natural for you

188
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,371
to take responsibility.

189
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:47,310
Hijiri!

190
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:51,214
I also,
haven't said everything I've wanted to.

191
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,717
If this continues,

192
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,720
I will have to take legal action.

193
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,193
Please, anything but that!

194
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:05,495
She…

195
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,765
She doesn't understand

196
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,535
what she's doing is a crime

197
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,605
that can be punished.

198
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:19,843
She's just getting swept up by emotion.

199
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,316
I promise to make her listen.

200
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,621
She's actually such a good person.

201
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,591
Whenever I catch a cold,

202
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:38,561
she comes to help
around the house immediately

203
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,563
like a good daughter.

204
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,768
But now,

205
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,838
it's like the floodgates have been opened.

206
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,010
She'll come to her senses soon.

207
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:56,546
I promise to make her listen.

208
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,249
So please…

209
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:01,818
Please!

210
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:05,822
Please

211
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,092
don't press charges!

212
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:30,814
Ms. Suenaga.

213
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,483
Please

214
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,020
understand our feelings.

215
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:39,889
Please don't

216
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,326
break your parents' hearts any further.

217
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,863
Please don't make them

218
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:49,632
go through this.

219
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:03,913
I'm really sorry for all of that.

220
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:08,118
But I want you to understand
how I feel some day.

221
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,386
Are you really prepared for it?

222
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,391
Being with him

223
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,128
means you can't teach anymore.

224
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,164
You'll lose everything you've worked for.

225
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,999
Is that what you want?

226
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,240
If you see him again, she will sue you.

227
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,009
What will you do then?

228
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:38,448
This love can never happen.

229
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,351
Just give it up.

230
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:14,617
I met Dad.

231
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,621
I know, he just called me.

232
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,590
What?

233
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:26,862
I'm sorry

234
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,566
that I had trouble talking to you

235
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:33,302
about your Dad.

236
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm sorry too

237
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,910
for taking off.

238
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:48,551
But Ms. Suenaga was with me,
helping me talk to him, so I--

239
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,187
She came here with her mother today.

240
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,124
She told me everything,
including your feelings.

241
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,095
But I told her that I can't allow

242
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,897
your relationship.

243
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,678
I'm about to decide my career

244
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:19,482
and think about my future.

245
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,752
She's the one

246
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,154
who got me to.

247
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,460
So even if it's not now,

248
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,198
I want you to accept her some day.

249
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:44,940
Come back home.

250
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:49,779
That will be a start.

251
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,918
Okay.

252
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:21,844
SHOTARO KAWAI

253
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,479
Have a good day.

254
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:28,818
Good work.

255
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,854
Could we go somewhere and talk?

256
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,291
I guess not, since
we're not together anymore.

257
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,396
I'm willing to listen.
Is this about Hijiri?

258
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,466
She came back.

259
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:46,836
With the boy?

260
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,139
She went to his mother
and told her she loves him.

261
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:56,112
She said she was going to wait
until she received her blessing.

262
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,280
I see.

263
00:24:59,014 --> 00:24:59,715
She finally--

264
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:03,452
She finally went crazy.
She's like a different person.

265
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,187
She finally admitted it.

266
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,122
What?

267
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,559
It took her a while to be able
to say she loved him.

268
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:13,963
I hope she can be happy.

269
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:16,866
Of course she can't!

270
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:34,550
I knew you two wouldn't last.

271
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,620
Let's go, we'll be late.

272
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,565
Seriously?

273
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,603
I'll be going home tonight, okay?

274
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:56,806
What?

275
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:58,507
Why?

276
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:04,513
I need to go to school tomorrow
and tell them everything.

277
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,183
Tell them what?

278
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,553
About the incident three years ago.

279
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,889
I'll be explaining it to the parents.

280
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,662
But with what just happened,

281
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:24,366
I don't think I can stay.

282
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:26,268
Then…

283
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:29,572
you won't teach again?

284
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,176
Thanks for dinner.

285
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:43,619
You should try to break your lease

286
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,088
and move back here.

287
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,027
Okay.

288
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,221
MS. HIJIRI / OTOHA

289
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,359
Hijiri!

290
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,629
I was worried when
you were gone for two days!

291
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,898
Felt under the weather?

292
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:08,003
<i>So with that former student?</i>

293
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,638
I'm sorry.

294
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,007
I wanted to talk to you

295
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,944
about this sooner if I could.

296
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:18,647
I'm thinking

297
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,119
I should quit as well.

298
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:29,224
Okay.

299
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,463
Then never think of becoming
a teacher again.

300
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:37,967
I trusted the incident three years ago

301
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,969
wouldn't be repeated.

302
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,340
You've really disappointed me.

303
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,877
You're not qualified
to be a teacher anymore.

304
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,017
I'm sorry.

305
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,892
Look what you threw away.

306
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:09,398
You were supposed to retake
your certification, right?

307
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,169
Becoming a class room teacher
was your goal.

308
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,273
But in the end, this possibly
fleeting relationship

309
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,946
with a boy ten years your junior
was more important to you.

310
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,518
You're a teacher who messed with a minor.

311
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,920
That truth won't go away.

312
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:35,090
Even if you worked
100 times harder than anyone,

313
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:36,859
you can't even be on the starting line.

314
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,495
But you're fine with that
because you love him, right?

315
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:42,264
You love him.

316
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,134
That gets to be your convenient excuse.

317
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,340
Congratulations.

318
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:53,776
I wish you the best.

319
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,383
Good morning!

320
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:24,840
GREET WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE

321
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,099
<i>Hey, Joffe.</i>

322
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,133
Yeah?

323
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,167
Where's Akira?

324
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,437
He's back home, right?

325
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:57,506
He wasn't upstairs.

326
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:00,709
He stepped out to go to
the convenience store.

327
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:03,612
I see.

328
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,834
Hello? Kuroiwa?

329
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:28,670
Ms. Suenaga?

330
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,674
Is it really you?

331
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,043
I haven't bought a new phone yet.

332
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:38,781
<i>Mom said you came to see her.</i>

333
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,284
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

334
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,052
It's okay.

335
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:49,625
Anyway, are you going to school?

336
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:52,694
Yeah, from home.

337
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:54,429
Huh?

338
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,697
I moved back home.

339
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:58,400
Mom told me to.

340
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:00,569
I see.

341
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,672
I'm sure she's relieved.

342
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,374
What about you?

343
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:07,676
Your school?

344
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:17,419
Don't worry, I got that handled.

345
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,664
What's wrong?

346
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:31,867
It's the same as that day.

347
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,954
I wish I could go back and tell myself…

348
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:56,525
Tell yourself what?

349
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:59,795
Just how amazing

350
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,998
falling in love is.

351
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:16,545
Akira!

352
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,051
Sorry, I have to go.

353
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,653
Okay, later.

354
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:33,262
What's wrong?

355
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,467
I forgot to buy something

356
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,672
from the convenience store.

357
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,807
Bread for tomorrow!

358
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,901
Shotaro!

359
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:17,406
Why are you here?

360
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,473
SUENAGA

361
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:29,416
I can't believe my mom
asked you for advice.

362
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:33,320
She asked me to come talk to you.

363
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:35,622
I heard.

364
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,558
You're quitting teaching?

365
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:46,733
I'm planning on finding different work.

366
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:51,738
It's my own decision.

367
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:57,877
It's all his fault.

368
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:03,917
I should have

369
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,387
given up on teaching way before.

370
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,757
I was being stubborn.

371
00:35:14,294 --> 00:35:16,396
But now I'll just cause problems.

372
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:25,071
Then come with me.

373
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:30,777
-Let go.
-I'm going to be assigned to Singapore.

374
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,247
Come with me, Hijiri.

375
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,785
I'm single again.

376
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,122
Hey.

377
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,492
She said

378
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,828
that I haven't moved on from you.

379
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:53,500
-No way.
-I told myself no way.

380
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,368
But I can't ignore you.

381
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,107
Back then,

382
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,245
I pushed you away,
didn't even try to go after you.

383
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:09,082
Whose fault is it that we're in
this stupid, shameful situation…

384
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:11,384
I'm sorry.

385
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:17,624
<i>I should've fought to stay by your side.</i>

386
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:23,730
If you come with me,
you can put this all behind you.

387
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:25,632
-If you distance--
-Shotaro.

388
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,037
I'm sorry.

389
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,240
I can't go with you.

390
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,177
-Don't.
-I already decided.

391
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:38,111
They'll shun you.

392
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:43,716
I know you're serious about this.

393
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:44,651
But

394
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:49,289
the more serious you are,
the crazier they'll think you are.

395
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:55,261
Being in love should be celebrated,
but instead they'll think

396
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,930
you're stupid and crazy.

397
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:00,500
Are you okay with that?

398
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:04,237
That's

399
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:07,607
so painful.

400
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,882
I don't expect people to understand.

401
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:20,987
I'm going home.

402
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:37,370
You quit your school rather quickly.

403
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,005
Twice at that.

404
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:42,876
I would take any job that doesn't
ask for experience.

405
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,645
I'm willing to learn.

406
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:20,980
<i>Kuroiwa, I bought a cell phone.</i>

407
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:23,783
<i>Contact me if you need me.</i>

408
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,398
I'm home.

409
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:06,159
This property?

410
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:07,227
Yes.

411
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:10,763
It's quite affordable,
but you need a guarantor.

412
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,165
Of course.

413
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,133
It can be a relative or friend.

414
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,302
Just get them to sign here.

415
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:20,373
Okay, thank you. I'll be in touch.

416
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,356
Hijiri.

417
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:43,563
Long time, how've you been?

418
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,066
Guarantor?

419
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:50,770
I don't want to burden my parents
any more than I have.

420
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:52,839
Is there anything you could do?

421
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:57,844
I need to quickly find work and
a new place so I can move out.

422
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,416
You've changed.

423
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,985
You're stronger.

424
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:10,757
It's the opposite.

425
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,294
I'm a mess.

426
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:16,095
But you have courage.

427
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:20,767
A coward who lives righteously
out of fear of judgment

428
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:25,405
compared to a fighting hero
who endures constant ridicule.

429
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:31,210
I will always support the heroes.

430
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:35,481
You're fighting.

431
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:39,652
Thank you very much.

432
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,858
Okay, I can be your guarantor.

433
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,661
Really?

434
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,831
Sorry to put you on the spot.

435
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,868
I promise not to bring you any trouble.

436
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:58,571
-Thank you--
-Sorry, one sec.

437
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,333
GUARANTOR: RITSU HARAGUCHI

438
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,743
KUROIWA

439
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:50,490
Hello?

440
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:52,492
<i>Ms. Suenaga?</i>

441
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:56,028
What is it?

442
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:57,597
<i>I won't be long.</i>

443
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:03,369
<i>I went back to school,</i>

444
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:07,039
so I've been thinking about my future.

445
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:12,412
<i>About you too.</i>

446
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,815
<i>I was happy at first,</i>

447
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:20,686
but then I was over it.

448
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:24,524
<i>I'm over you.</i>

449
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:29,595
<i>So I wanted to tell you before</i>
<i>we do anything</i>

450
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,664
<i>we can't take back.</i>

451
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:34,634
<i>Right now,</i>

452
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,770
<i>I can't think about you.</i>

453
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,074
Why?

454
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,044
<i>Let's</i>

455
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:48,648
<i>not do this.</i>

456
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:53,386
<i>Bye.</i>

457
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:14,773
An open campus?

458
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:19,378
-This place seemed nice.
-Let me see.

459
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,381
I'm going to go check it out.

460
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:24,817
This place is like super famous.

461
00:43:24,883 --> 00:43:26,618
They just had a teacher win a Nobel prize.

462
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:31,090
I can't believe you're thinking
about going somewhere so challenging.

463
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:32,291
I'm not sold yet.

464
00:43:33,392 --> 00:43:34,526
I want to check it out first.

465
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:37,196
For real?

466
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,199
I feel happy.

467
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:41,967
Joffe is so happy.

468
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:45,004
Huh?

469
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,841
-Look!
-Hey! Oh, sorry.

470
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:51,710
Wow.

471
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:59,918
Let me know when you're finished.

472
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,554
Direction, good.

473
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,860
No issue with the flow.

474
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:10,729
I don't sense negative energy.

475
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:12,531
This place seems good.

476
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:18,704
Hijiri?

477
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:23,375
I'm sorry for making you
come with me on a day off.

478
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:27,846
I should be able to move
here thanks to you.

479
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:31,450
Although I have nothing.

480
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:35,487
You do. You have him.

481
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,558
Last night,

482
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,827
Kuroiwa told me

483
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:45,330
he's over me.

484
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,399
That we should stop.

485
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:49,668
What?

486
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:51,503
Youth these days.

487
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,273
They change their minds so easily.

488
00:44:57,209 --> 00:44:58,944
But I mean,

489
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:02,414
I can't blame him.

490
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:05,984
I'm way too old for him.

491
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:14,026
How could I be so dumb?

492
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,042
It's okay, you can cry.

493
00:45:32,544 --> 00:45:36,315
You're free to smile, you're free to cry.

494
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:44,123
Not having anything
means you're free of attachments.

495
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,661
Good morning.

496
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:26,832
-I held Hijiri in my arms yesterday.
-What?

497
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:31,203
-What?
-I became her guarantor for a new lease.

498
00:46:32,604 --> 00:46:36,141
The poor thing has nobody else
she can turn to.

499
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,076
She cried in my arms.

500
00:46:41,513 --> 00:46:44,216
It means that's all it was.

501
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:47,186
I saw this coming a mile away.

502
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:50,022
Totally expected.

503
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:51,557
Hold up.

504
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:53,859
What'd you say?

505
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:08,006
Hijiri.

506
00:47:08,974 --> 00:47:11,009
A job agent is here for you.

507
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,413
-What?
-They found work that might suit you.

508
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:15,881
They came here?

509
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:24,556
-Ms. Haraguchi!
-Hello.

510
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:26,592
I'm here from Hello Work.

511
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:31,063
I have an interesting opportunity.

512
00:47:35,901 --> 00:47:38,337
-Where are we? Wait…
-Hold on.

513
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:45,477
I'm supposed to meet the boy here.

514
00:47:47,112 --> 00:47:48,113
What?

515
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,015
Department of science and engineering.

516
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:52,184
Why don't you go talk to him.

517
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,023
There's nothing to say at this point.

518
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:02,160
Why? You're not going to ask him?

519
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:06,965
How do you not have questions?

520
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:09,835
Why the sudden change?
Doesn't it seem weird?

521
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,606
If you have questions,
you have to pursue them.

522
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:19,278
That's how we discovered the black hole,
neutrinos, and cloning.

523
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,647
Excuse me?

524
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:22,814
Damn it!

525
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:27,052
You threw everything away and chose him,
didn't you?

526
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,588
You're okay for it to end?

527
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:33,358
Shouldn't you at least talk face to face

528
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:35,727
one last time?

529
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:40,732
If you miss this chance,
you'll never see him again.

530
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:47,339
Fight, Hijiri!

531
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:17,336
To be young.

532
00:49:35,754 --> 00:49:37,389
SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

533
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,995
Is this science and engineering?

534
00:49:44,062 --> 00:49:46,465
-Yes, right that way.
-Okay.

535
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:30,909
I'm sorry for just showing up. Wait!

536
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:35,947
Kuroiwa, just tell me why.

537
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:43,288
Why did you decide

538
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:46,491
on science and engineering?

539
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:51,897
What future did you see?

540
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:56,535
That's all.

541
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:00,238
Please tell me.

542
00:51:05,677 --> 00:51:06,745
What about you?

543
00:51:07,446 --> 00:51:08,747
What?

544
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:10,749
You're giving up teaching?

545
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:14,186
You quit again

546
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:17,923
because of me.

547
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:21,860
Are you planning to never teach again?

548
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:24,362
How did you…?

549
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:27,866
I was told to really think about it.

550
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,238
Did you know Hijiri resigned?

551
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,708
Because of you.

552
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:43,148
That might be fine for you,
you have a future.

553
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:45,851
You have dreams and goals.

554
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:47,953
The world's your oyster.

555
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:50,489
But Hijiri?

556
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,058
What does she have?

557
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,435
That's why all of a sudden…

558
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,171
Why didn't you tell me you quit?

559
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:10,475
I didn't want to worry you right now.

560
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:14,546
I think the way you do that is stupid.

561
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:22,354
He was right.

562
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:27,025
I can't do anything.

563
00:52:29,528 --> 00:52:30,662
Except distance myself.

564
00:52:34,432 --> 00:52:36,334
I don't want you to quit teaching.

565
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:42,908
You said it was fun.

566
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:47,045
All my students are so cute, I love them.

567
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:49,915
<i>How greeting the class gave you energy.</i>

568
00:52:50,415 --> 00:52:52,384
<i>How the school meals were delicious.</i>

569
00:52:55,086 --> 00:52:56,788
You loved your job,

570
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,391
do you really want to quit?

571
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:04,629
I don't want you to regret this.

572
00:53:13,171 --> 00:53:14,639
-I…
-Mom!

573
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,875
Where is science and engineering?

574
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:20,679
-The booth is that way.
-Thank you.

575
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:25,050
If she sees you now…!

576
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:51,977
You're right.

577
00:53:52,744 --> 00:53:54,212
I absolutely loved

578
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:56,615
being a teacher.

579
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:02,988
But do you remember what I told you?

580
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:10,895
To imagine the person you want to become
and think of the steps you have to take.

581
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:12,731
Can you picture the school?

582
00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:18,169
So that's why

583
00:54:19,904 --> 00:54:21,206
I thought about it too.

584
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,009
Who I wanted to become.

585
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,144
I want to be me

586
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:29,714
and not live a lie anymore.

587
00:54:32,283 --> 00:54:33,585
Whatever happens,

588
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,889
I want to take responsibility.

589
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,360
I want to be

590
00:54:44,562 --> 00:54:45,597
by your side.

591
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:00,078
Me too.

592
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:06,017
I want to be by your side.

593
00:55:07,752 --> 00:55:08,953
From now until forever.

594
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:19,130
Are you Hijiri Suenaga?

595
00:55:31,176 --> 00:55:32,343
And Akira Kuroiwa?

596
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:37,515
-Yes.
-Could we see some ID?

597
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,454
AKIRA KUROIWA
HIJIRI SUENAGA

598
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,588
Excuse me.

599
00:55:44,823 --> 00:55:48,993
We received a call
that a minor was kidnapped.

600
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:53,965
Would you mind coming to the station
for some questioning?

601
00:56:02,674 --> 00:56:05,443
Next, I need a check on a woman.

602
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:08,546
One Hijiri Suenaga.

603
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:11,249
THE FINALE IS NEXT!

604
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:14,119
<i>Kuroiwa, I'm glad I met you.</i>

605
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,854
