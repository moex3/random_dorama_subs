1
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:08,409
We received a call
that a minor was kidnapped.

2
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,011
Would you mind coming to the station?

3
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,717
<i>Ms. Hijiri Suenaga.</i>

4
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:20,721
You are suspected of kidnapping a minor.

5
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,324
Kidnap?

6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,495
This has to be a misunderstanding.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,498
We just met and talked.

8
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,734
His parent has lodged a complaint.

9
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:37,505
If this continues,
I will have to take legal action.

10
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:43,711
If I could speak with Ms. Kuroiwa,
I'm sure I could clear this up.

11
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:46,547
Not until we're finished talking here.

12
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,417
I'm the one who led her around.

13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,085
If she sees you now…!

14
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,389
<i>My mother was about to catch us together.</i>

15
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:58,592
That's why I did.

16
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,095
He's still a minor.

17
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:06,133
Kidnapping a minor carries a sentence of
three months to seven years.

18
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:11,338
If there's sexual misconduct,
that's one to ten years of prison.

19
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,407
We

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,944
We just…

21
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,581
By the way, even if a minor consented,

22
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,717
if it goes against their
guardian's wishes,

23
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,886
it's considered a crime.

24
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,825
Everyone always claims it's consensual.

25
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,668
I communicated
the severity of the situation.

26
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:46,240
However, I doubt this case
can be taken any further.

27
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,776
I see.

28
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:53,714
If you are not happy with this,
there are other measures you may take.

29
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:01,789
Akira.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,725
Where is Ms. Suenaga?

31
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,829
Why did you do this?

32
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,832
If she gets charged with anything--

33
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,802
Don't worry, she can
go home once they're done.

34
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,471
It's not her fault.

35
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,240
-I'm the one--
-Yes.

36
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:23,010
You're the one who
was pulling her out of there.

37
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,445
What?

38
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,156
It's your fault this happened.

39
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,861
I warned her there would be no next time.

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,130
But she met you in secret.

41
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,035
She's lost my trust
and I'll hold her accountable.

42
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:51,405
-I'm the one responsible.
-You're a minor.

43
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,074
You can't take responsibility.

44
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,677
Your phone.

45
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,647
Give me your phone.

46
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm deleting her number.

47
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,085
You'll only make it worse for her.

48
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,955
Is that what you want?

49
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,876
-Can you take Akira home?
-Yes.

50
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,547
Boss, I know you're worried,

51
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:38,352
but if you push too hard,
it'll have the opposite effect.

52
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,453
HIJIRI

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,555
Akira!

54
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,323
DELETE

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,557
DELETED

56
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,661
It's for the best.

57
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,012
Ms. Kuroiwa, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,615
Um, I'm the one who approached him.

59
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,184
But we weren't trying to
run away together.

60
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,853
Why don't we talk tomorrow instead.

61
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,589
Here at one o'clock.

62
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,429
Okay.

63
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,871
Mom?

64
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,208
-How?
-This was in your room.

65
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,813
Imagine my surprise,

66
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,951
since I thought you were
going to move back home with us…

67
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,221
I didn't want to burden you any more.

68
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,558
You were planning
to meet with that boy here?

69
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,929
Ms. Kuroiwa just called me.

70
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,433
The police were involved?

71
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,469
I'm going to talk
with Ms. Kuroiwa tomorrow.

72
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,505
I'm sure if I just explain, she'll--

73
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,374
Do whatever you want.

74
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,145
I can't believe you.

75
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,918
You're on your own now.

Yes?

79
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,909
My name is Isogai, and I'm an attorney.

CLAIRE SOGO LAW OFFICE

82
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:02,823
A settlement?

83
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,694
After some deliberation,
Ms. Kuroiwa is willing to forego

84
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:13,000
escalating the matter
to the police or the school board.

85
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,772
However, it's under the condition
that you sign this legal agreement.

86
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,207
Agreement?

87
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:26,313
"I Hijiri Suenaga will sever all
communication with Akira Kuroiwa.

88
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,349
Should I break any of these conditions,

89
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,520
I will pay a compensation fee
of five million yen to Aiko Kuroiwa

90
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,156
for violating her custodial rights.

91
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,325
No matter the consequences I face,

92
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:42,596
I agree that I will make
no object to this stipulation."

Could I speak to Ms. Kuroiwa directly?

<i>She does not wish to see you.</i>

You have one week,
I shall await your call.

AGREEMENT

98
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,936
I'll submit this.

I'll do what you say

101
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,409
and focus on my exams.

102
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:47,246
So please promise to consider
Ms. Suenaga someday--

103
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:48,447
Once this is over.

104
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,485
Just focus on your exams right now,

105
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,954
then we'll talk.

106
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,159
Okay.

<i>You have one week,</i>
<i>I shall await your call.</i>

Ms. Chizuru?

109
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:28,254
Here, your belongings
that were left at the school.

110
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,224
Thank you.

111
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,562
I knew it.

112
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,165
Of course it didn't work out.

113
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:43,035
Everyone was against it,
but you two were infatuated.

114
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,204
This is the result.

115
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,373
You did it to yourself.

116
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:20,573
I have the worst mentee!

117
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,783
Eat, sleep, talk.

118
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,986
Whenever you feel
like you can't take it anymore…

119
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,355
Just eat, sleep,

120
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,824
and talk to someone.

121
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:44,463
If you have nobody to talk to,
you can call me.

122
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,333
I'll swing by if I'm free.

123
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:51,570
Okay.

124
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,240
Now stop crying.

125
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,145
You are such a crier.

126
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:00,713
Fine, cry it out.

127
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,882
Cry all you want.

128
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,898
Do whatever you want.

129
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,833
I can't believe you.

130
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,868
I will have to take legal action.

131
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:24,937
I want to be by your side.

132
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,872
<i>Now until forever.</i>

133

TOKYO

134
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:53,399
Why are you running away
like I have the plague or something?

135
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,837
Not exactly the plague.

136
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,607
More like,

137
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:06,879
some gross obsessed guy
who's not over his ex.

138
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,649
Then come with me.

139
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,284
I'm going to Singapore.

140
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,354
I'm sorry. I can't go with you.

141
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,256
I was worried about Hijiri.

142
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:20,392
No, your pride was hurt.

143
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,963
Because for once in your life,
things didn't go your way.

144
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:29,235
I guess I've got no right
to criticize you.

145
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,909
Hijiri got into it with the kid's mom,

146
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,311
and it's a big deal.

147
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:41,247
What?

148
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:44,783
<i>So the two of them…?</i>

149
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:59,298
Something happened with Hijiri, right?

150
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,335
-Crap, that sucks!
-Yeah.

151
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:08,674
First there's the thing with Hijiri,
and you also pissed off your old lady.

152
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,210
That's a terrible combo right there!

153
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,247
Hey.

154
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:21,053
I wonder what becoming an adult means.

155
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:28,627
Anyway, I just want to go to university
to give Mom peace of mind,

156
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,031
so she'll accept Ms. Suenaga.

157
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,233
I'm not giving up until she does.

158
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,637
Well, I always thought

159
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,974
it'd be nice if you ended up together.

160
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:43,609
Really?

161
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:50,783
I may not look it,
but I love true romance!

162
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:53,118
Cut it out! What's wrong with you!

163
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:57,456
Let's go Kuroiwa,
the man who cannot be stopped!

164
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,458
Kuroiwa, is the man!

165
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,960
-Okay, that's enough.
-Sorry.

166
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:16,842
MS. HARAGUCHI

167
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,144
I bought this body cream in New York.

168
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:23,749
And I'm regifting this soup set.

169
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:27,453
This is detergent, and here's
an electric blanket.

170
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:31,824
Thank you, but why are you
giving me all this?

171
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:34,860
This hardly makes up for it,

172
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,198
but my meddling got you in
trouble with his mother.

173
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:42,234
Please, it was my own decision.

174
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,805
What about eloping?

175
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,343
I have friends who run
a hostel for riders.

176
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,344
Riders?

177
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:56,415
Not the super heroes. Bikers and cyclists.

178
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,884
I think they were looking for workers.

179
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:03,856
I guess you can't.

180
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,026
I know you're dealing with a lot.

181
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:12,398
I was told

182
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,069
that I have to promise

183
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,572
never to see Kuroiwa again.

184
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,209
They want me to sign an agreement.

185
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,879
You mean they took legal action?

186
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:34,186
I told myself that I wouldn't lie
about my feelings anymore.

187
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:39,458
What do I do?

188
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,095
What's best for everyone?

189
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,567
I'm so lost.

190
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,105
Well,

191
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,009
that goes for everyone.

192
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,915
Sorry, one sec.

193
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,962
Ms. Haraguchi! Are you okay?

194
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,598
-Please call an ambulance.
-Okay.

195
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:23,335
Are you okay, Ms. Haraguchi?

196
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,605
LOC is 200, blood pressure 169 over 98.

197
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:29,341
Pulse is 125, saturation is 94 percent.

198
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:30,509
Let's hurry, make way!

199
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:35,047
I'm sorry, could you see if she has any
insurance information or hospital card?

200
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:36,648
Of course.

201
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:43,255
MATERNITY JOURNAL

202
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,141
How is she?

203
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,276
She's being treated.

204
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,778
They're running other tests as well.

205
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:10,714
What tests?

206
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:16,820
MATERNITY JOURNAL

207
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:17,721
Here.

208
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,860
She's three months pregnant.

209
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,696
You didn't know?

210
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,067
Not at all.

211
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:33,937
Totally clueless.

212
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,440
Why did she not…?

213
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:41,378
We just finished her examination.

214
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,347
Her CT and MRI results were cleared.

215
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:49,619
<i>But her blood pressure isn't stabilizing.</i>
<i>We'll keep her here for observation.</i>

216
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,237
Ms. Haraguchi.

217
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,139
How are you feeling?

218
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,742
I brought you a change of clothing.

219
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,311
Oh, Hijiri.

220
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,880
Thanks, you didn't need to.

221
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,116
-I was just about to leave.
-To go where?

222
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,918
Home, and then work.

223
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,454
You should be resting.

224
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,189
I need to wrap this work up.

225
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,891
I'll be back tonight though.

226
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:29,659
Ms. Haraguchi!

227
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,795
-You should stay.
-I'll be fine.

228
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,898
-This is a crucial--
-Yes, it's a crucial project.

229
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,666
It's an ODA for Africa.

230
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,568
-A big dam--
-Which is more important?

231
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,106
There's a baby inside you.

232
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,543
I was surprised at first,

233
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:49,546
but I'm happy.

234
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,349
This is a blessing.

235
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,085
Nothing should be more important!

236
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,122
Please go back and rest.

237
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,632
Yes, Ms. Suenaga.

238
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:23,780
I decided.

239
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,917
I'll become a mother.

240
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,355
I'll raise them on my own.

241
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,497
I made up my mind just now.

242
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,699
Thanks to you.

243
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:53,710
Congratulations.

244
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,651
But what about Shotaro?

245
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,322
I gave it some thought as well.

246
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:11,795
What would be best for everyone,
just like you did.

247
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,831
What is the right answer?

248
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,235
But then I realized something.

249
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,372
There is no right answer.

250
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,507
It's unknowable.

251
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,310
That's why

252
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,481
you have to find your own right answer.

253
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:35,985
As I move forward on my own,

254
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,389
I have faith the answer is ahead.

255
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,613
NOW HIRING

256
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,882
WINTER LECTURE APPLICATION

257
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,919
Kuroiwa?

258
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:13,456
Thought that was you!
I heard a lot happened.

259
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,625
I heard from Kokonoe that you and…

260
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,330
Kuroiwa.

261
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,573
-Thought you were a target.
-Ow.

262
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,076
Let's both do our best.

263
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:42,652
Let's go.

264
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:47,157
-Did you study for the vocab test?
-No.

265
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,066
-Ms. Suenaga.
-Yes?

266
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,602
-Can you get this to Takahashi?
-Yes.

267
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:01,171
Thanks.

268
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,945
<i>You have one week,</i>
<i>I shall await your call.</i>

269
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,882
<i>Has she contacted you?</i>

270
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,818
No.

271
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,152
She hasn't reached out?

272
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,787
The deadline is tomorrow.

273
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:25,028
Do you think she's not planning
on signing the agreement?

274
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:30,900
If she doesn't, we will bring
formal charges to the police.

275
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:37,841
I hate to cause all this trouble
right before exams.

276
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:41,811
Yes, that is what this agreement is for.

277
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,747
I will go visit her directly tomorrow.

278
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:47,650
-She will promise never to--
-Agreement?

279
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,621
-Akira.
-What is this?

280
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:54,490
-What about your test?
-The hell is this!

281
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:55,358
Akira!

282
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,961
You said you'd think about
Ms. Suenaga after my exams!

283
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:58,895
That's why I've--

284
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,998
Think about what?
You making the same mistake again?

285
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:04,934
You never told me about any agreement!

286
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:07,203
Akira, please calm down.

287
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:10,540
Who the hell are you?
What did you do to Ms. Suenaga!

288
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,909
Stop it, Akira!

289
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,579
You may not understand now,
but you will someday!

290
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,781
Why I'm going this far.

291
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:23,286
That I'm doing this so you can
have a proper childhood!

292
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,664
Akira.

293
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:36,766
Stop!

294
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,042
AGREEMENT

295
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,021
SIGNATURE

296
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:33,389
Turn left after that diner.

297
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,398
<i>There is no right answer.</i>

298
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,234
You have to find your own right answer.

299
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,083
Yes?

300
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,021
Ms. Suenaga.

301
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:10,626
It's me.

302
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:14,330
You're there aren't you?

303
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:16,766
Please open the door.

304
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:27,410
I want to see you,

305
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,413
to hear your voice.

306
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,718
Please, Ms. Suenaga.

307
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:14,424
Excuse me.

308
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,660
May I come in?

309
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:21,564
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

310
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,545
I'm sorry for dropping by.

311
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,481
I'm here about that.

312
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,653
I was just about to call you.

313
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:53,527
I'm sorry for asking you to meet me today.

314
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:58,399
I wanted to speak with you properly--

315
00:26:58,466 --> 00:26:59,767
The agreement?

316
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:10,878
Kuroiwa came to see me last night.

317
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,915
He said he wanted to see me.

318
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:19,487
Ms. Suenaga.

319
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:25,159
I don't care what anyone says.

320
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,430
As long as I have you.

321
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:32,700
So please…

322
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,477
<i>I didn't open the door.</i>

323
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:52,186
<i>He eventually left.</i>

324
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,759
I was planning to tell you the following.

325
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,964
Our resolve is strong, we can wait.

326
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,233
To please trust us.

327
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:12,806
But Kuroiwa is still 18.

328
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,209
A dangerous age,

329
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,580
easily swayed by emotion.

330
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,715
He will regress,

331
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,486
back to the past.

332
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:33,360
I can now painfully understand

333
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,531
your worry.

334
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:51,579
HIJIRI SUENAGA

335
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,983
What is most important to your son

336
00:28:58,586 --> 00:28:59,853
is his future.

337
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:06,427
No matter how strongly we felt,
we should have left it buried.

338
00:29:08,462 --> 00:29:12,566
If I truly cared for him,
there was so much I should've given him.

339
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:18,606
Like time, distance, and potential.

340
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:24,778
That was my responsibility as an adult.

341
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,248
But I failed.

342
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:36,323
For that,

343
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,526
I offer my apology.

344
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,134
I will never see him again.

345
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:51,238
Please tell

346
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,908
Kuroiwa that for me.

347
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,518
Excuse me.

348
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,016
You're down here early.

349
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,053
Usually, you never come when I call you.

350
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:41,989
Get the soy sauce out.

351
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,166
So what happened?

352
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,738
Did you see her today?

353
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,408
Please.

354
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:04,978
Tell me.

355
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:19,827
AGREEMENT

356
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,095
HIJIRI SUENAGA

357
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,764
This was her answer.

358
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,067
Do you understand, Akira?

359
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:30,871
PROMISE NOT TO MAKE CONTACT OF ANY KIND.

360
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:32,873
Understand why this happened?

361
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,910
Understand what she felt

362
00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:39,613
when signing this.

363
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:43,650
What is it you can do?

364
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:50,224
How will you meet her sacrifice?

365
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:56,997
Think about that, Akira.

366
00:32:04,304 --> 00:32:07,007
HIJIRI SUENAGA

367
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,685
Thank you for this food.

368
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,873
-Thank you.
-Please come again.

369
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,142
You can clock out now.

370
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,679
You've done such a great job.

371
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:50,217
Would you like to work full time?

372
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:54,988
Thank you.

373
00:32:56,323 --> 00:33:00,260
But there's something else
I'm considering right now.

374
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:35,295
NATIONAL JAPANESE LANGUAGE JSL EDUCATORS

375
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:42,169
HIRING JAPANESE LANGUAGE TEACHERS

376
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,709
If it isn't Kawai.

377
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:51,378
Um.

378
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,548
I'm good.

379
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,251
I haven't said anything.

380
00:33:58,085 --> 00:33:59,887
But you're about to.

381
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,723
Those words I absolutely hate.

382
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:06,193
"I'm responsible as well, let's get
married, I will support you.

383
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,161
Come to Singapore with me."

384
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:09,796
No thank you, to it all.

385
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:14,101
You said everything I wanted to say.

386
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,370
You're so easy to read.

387
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,074
Or do you already have someone?

388
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,778
Oh, you mean her?

389
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,149
I knew you two wouldn't last.

390
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:30,584
<i>We were just catching up.</i>

391
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,619
There's no-one else.

392
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,891
-Then I--
-This is my child.

393
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:39,826
I'm fine on my own.

394
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:48,302
-Hijiri.
-Glad to see you discharged.

395
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:52,139
Thank you for everything.
I'm sorry I made you worry.

396
00:34:57,477 --> 00:34:58,745
I'm glad you're here.

397
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:03,450
I have some news for you.

398
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:11,525
AGREEMENT

399
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:22,736
Ms. Shioya!

400
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:25,672
It's been a long time.

401
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,876
Bullying SOS?

402
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,612
It's my new work place.

403
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:37,985
We provide counseling to anyone
experiencing trouble at school.

404
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,788
I'm glad to see you well.

405
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:47,628
I ran into Kokonoe the other day.

406
00:35:49,496 --> 00:35:52,165
He told me about your son.

407
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,336
He's still seeing Ms. Suenaga?

408
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:00,073
I don't plan to allow for them

409
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:03,076
to continue.

410
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:05,345
However,

411
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:10,317
sometimes I falter.

412
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,555
When I know how much

413
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,360
my only son hates me.

414
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:25,732
To be honest, it is tough sometimes.

415
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:30,037
You aren't wrong about this.

416
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:33,140
You only did what any parent would do.

417
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,410
The one in the wrong,

418
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:39,613
is Ms. Suenaga.

419
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,482
It's okay.

420
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:47,287
People always grow
stronger through hardships.

421
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:52,759
They're all precious experiences.

422
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:58,465
It's sure to help in his life ahead.

423
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,024
THAI TRAVEL WORDS AND PHRASES

424
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:50,749
2015, APRIL

425
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:56,488
AFTER A WHILE, HIJIRI ARRIVED.

426
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,524
I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HER.
BE CLOSER TO HER.

427
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,262
IF ONLY I WEREN'T 15

428
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:08,166
YOU DISAPPEARED.
IT WAS THE SUMMER WHEN I WAS 15.

429
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:25,984
Thank you very much.

430
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,059
<i>What is it you can do?</i>

431
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:38,563
How will you meet her sacrifice?

432
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:42,767
Hello.

433
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,703
<i>Think about that, Akira.</i>

434
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,168
Hello, Shotaro?

435
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:22,941
Thanks for seeing me.

436
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:27,145
It's no problem, I just have
a lot of papers to fill out.

437
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,087
You've changed.

438
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:42,961
You're no longer that reserved,
over-accommodating girl.

439
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,232
You have yourself a goal.

440
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,735
It encourages me.

441
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:55,240
I need to find my answer.

442
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,977
Well, thanks for saying that.

443
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:03,514
That encourages me in return.

444
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,287
How is Ms. Haraguchi?

445
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:13,892
Well, I got my orders.

446
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:15,526
Orders?

447
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,130
I'm supposed to get on here?

448
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:23,001
Ms. Haraguchi insisted.
You know how weird she is.

449
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:24,936
-One please.
-Okay.

450
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:27,105
Go on.

451
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:28,706
Have fun.

452
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:42,353
Hello, Ms. Haraguchi?

453
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,657
<i>Sorry, Hijiri, but I wanted your</i>
<i>advice on something.</i>

454
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:46,557
Advice?

455
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:49,294
<i>Hey.</i>

456
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:51,062
<i>Can you see me?</i>

457
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,302
There you are.

458
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,541
-<i>What did you want to talk about?</i>
<i>-</i>Kawai.

459
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:09,781
When you get to the bottom, could you
tell Kawai I'm not an eccentric woman,

460
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,116
I'm a smart woman who loves deeply

461
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,419
and is a bit meddlesome.

462
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:16,554
What?

463
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:17,455
<i>I mean,</i>

464
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,959
I do something like this because
I was asked to.

465
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:30,168
Here.

466
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:55,317
Ms. Suenaga?

467
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,188
<i>Kuroiwa.</i>

468
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:01,990
Ms. Suenaga.

469
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,595
<i>I'm not your teacher now.</i>

470
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:10,599
Hijiri.

471
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:16,305
I wanted to

472
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:21,376
see and tell you one last time.

473
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:28,283
But now that I'm here,
I don't know what to say.

474
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:30,419
I'm panicking.

475
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:39,761
Up until now,

476
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:45,167
being with you made me happy,

477
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,571
and I only thought about myself.

478
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:52,841
But now

479
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:56,211
I want you to be happy.

480
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,985
So I won't come meet you again.

481
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:05,320
I won't even call.

482
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,423
But I'll always be wishing

483
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,661
for your happiness.

484
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:28,176
<i>Kuroiwa.</i>

485
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:32,347
I…

486
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:37,019
I'm leaving Japan.

487
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,655
What?

488
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:41,857
<i>I'm going to be working abroad.</i>

489
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:45,260
I can't believe it myself.

490
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,031
I've hardly even traveled,

491
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:53,402
and I'm going to some
unknown place on my own.

492
00:43:57,906 --> 00:43:59,207
You changed me.

493
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:08,150
You are the one

494
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:12,254
who gave me the strength.

495
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:15,757
The strength

496
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:21,096
to stand on my own.

497
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,172
I'm glad I met you.

498
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,848
Goodbye.

499
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,453
Goodbye, Kuroiwa.

500
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:54,830
I'm sure you'll become a good teacher.

Hijiri.

502
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:10,145
Good luck!

503
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:16,218
Good luck!

504
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:24,493
Good luck!

505
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:48,350
Thank you.

506
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:54,423
Kid.

507
00:45:57,459 --> 00:45:59,094
Become a good man.

508
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:07,436
He said this wouldn't count as meeting.

509
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,505
You just rode on a Ferris wheel.

510
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:15,076
-Thank you.
-One more thing.

511
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:20,248
He asked me to give you this.

512
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:22,083
There you go.

513
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:27,722
Mission complete?

514
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:30,792
-Mission accomplished.
-Good work, Kawai.

515
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,435
-I've decided.
-Huh?

516
00:46:40,502 --> 00:46:42,070
I'll be by your side.

517
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:47,142
Or should I say the both of you.

518
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:51,780
I didn't ask. We're done with that--

519
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:54,516
Sometimes, feelings aren't enough.

520
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,852
But if there's still a chance,

521
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:00,188
I'm taking every opportunity.

522
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:02,023
So,

523
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,593
I'll be here.

524
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:07,796
I'll succeed at work too.

525
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,166
Even if I pass up on this position abroad.

526
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:16,204
You're naive to pass up
on this opportunity.

527
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:19,941
-But I--
-I recommended you as your boss!

528
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:37,792
I'll wait for you.

529
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,395
So go become your own man,

530
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:45,534
and come home.

531
00:47:58,446 --> 00:48:01,483
I promise to support you in any way I can.

532
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:05,554
I hate when you say crap like that.

533
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:07,255
Why?

534
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:10,859
-You can't do this alone.
-I'm fine.

535
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:12,894
-No, you can't.
-I'm fine.

536
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:15,730
-That's so like you.
-Go to Singapore already!
