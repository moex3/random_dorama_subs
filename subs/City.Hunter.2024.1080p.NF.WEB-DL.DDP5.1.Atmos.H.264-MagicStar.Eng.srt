He can go, Officer Ito.
This was voluntary questioning.

That's all, then. You can go.

Don't know.

Are you talking about this?

265
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,500
Apparently, she's a cosplayer.

266
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,041
Thirty thousand followers.

267

Hmm. I don't care.

268
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,875
The one for me is Miss Sweater Melons.

It's pretty hot, my man.

Nah, dude.
Um, send me that, would ya?

278
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,000
It's evidence.

Don't hit on her.

-[Makimura sighs]
-[chuckles]

286
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,000
You're gonna tell her, aren't you?

287
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,791
When my dad first brought her
home with him,

288
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,875
she was only, like, this big. [chuckles]

289
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,041
Is telling her really necessary?

290
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,833
So what, you're not actually related?

291
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,875
It's just my dad said

292
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,166
he would tell her once she was an adult.

293
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,166
Well, it's up to me.

294
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,791
I'm glad it's not me.

295
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,416
[both chuckle]

296
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,000
-[inhales deeply] I'm gonna get going.
-Yes, sir.

297
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,416
Hey.

298
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:20,958
Off-limits.

299
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,708
I don't know. [chuckles]

300
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,333
[Makimura] I am asking you, dude!

301
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,375
-Off-limits, got it?
-I hear you. All right, man?

302
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,583
This way, sir.

303
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,541
Sorry, Kaori.

304
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,791
[Kaori] Ugh.

305
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,375
-I've been waiting for you for an hour.
-Yes, you have.

306
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,291
We could've just stayed in.

307
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
[Makimura] No, no way! Sorry.

308
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,541
I was looking for someone's lost pet.

309
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,666
This dog was just running and barking.

310
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,750
And then… [chuckles]

311
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,666
…we finally catch it,
and after all that, it bit us. [laughs]

312
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,583
[Kaori] Mmm.

313
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,500
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

314
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,583
I was just thinking,

315
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,541
"So that's the guy who dragged
my poor brother into this risky business."

316
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,541
Risky?

317
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,041
Searching for lost pets?

318
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,083
It's… It's not risky at all.

319
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,125
The message board.

320
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,166
"XYZ," no?

321
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,833
"Taking on any job, no matter what."

322
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,750
-City--
-Yeah, okay.

323
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,250
Yeah, I got it.

324
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,958
You know, I'm an adult now.

They injected me with something.

Can I ask you what the thinking
behind this event was?

The conceit is to express
the concept of nature in a playful way.

969
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,375
We made anime characters,

970

and we asked cosplayers
to attend this event dressed as them.

971
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,750
In doing so, we hope to introduce Lore
to an even wider audience.

972
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,791
Perhaps the reason
why people like you so much

973
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,458
is your bold approach to your work.
