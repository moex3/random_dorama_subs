1
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,112
I'm Nishimura, the prosecutor.

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,181
You have the right to remain silent
if you don't wish to speak.

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,418
You were arrested for the crime
of arson of inhabited buildings.

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,453
Please confirm. First, your name…

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,690
Place of birth, Yokohama.
Currently unemployed.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,796
Do you affirm these facts
I've read as being true?

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,002
Is this all correct?

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,587
<i>I first wanted to become a prosecutor
during the fall of ninth grade.</i>

9
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,892
-<i>I was 15 years old.</i>
-I'm going now.

10
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,328
<i>That morning,
I left the house to go to school.</i>

11
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>But when I came to a traffic light,</i>

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,369
<i>my body froze all of a sudden.</i>

13
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,139
<i>Shaking, premonition, a sense of panic…</i>

14
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,853
<i>Kana Kana, come here.</i>

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,796
CRIMES OF CORRUPTION!
FABRICATED BY THE PROSECUTOR

16
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,813
<i>I rushed back home, and what I saw was…</i>

17
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,291
<i>I wanted to know the truth.</i>

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,528
<i>That was the sole reason
I wanted to become a prosecutor.</i>

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,068
<i>What is this?</i>

20
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,513
<i>My aspiration has become a reality.</i>

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,915
<i>Now, I'm opening the door</i>

22
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,220
<i>to find out if this love is real.</i>

23
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,963
<i>Could I indict the one I love?</i>

24
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,881
<i>And could you judge this love?</i>

25
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,739
SHINANO UNIVERSITY

26
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,577
<i>I met him for the first time in the summer
during my sophomore year at university.</i>

27
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,387
Show me.

28
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,990
W-What?

29
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,091
Please.

30
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,659
-Huh?
-Show me.

31
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,864
-What?
-Your answers, so, I, can, cheat.

32
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,769
I can't flunk this.

33
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,938
N-No. Impossible.

34
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,241
I really need to do this. Come on.

35
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,742
Please! Please!

36
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,844
Just this once, that's it.

37
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,679
No, really.

38
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,580
Please.

39
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,576
<i>That was the first crime</i>

40
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,911
<i>I ever committed.</i>

41
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,726
I'm serious. You have beautiful hair!

42
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,768
Hey.

43
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,771
Hey, wait.

44
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,172
-Wait.
-Don't follow me.

45
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,174
Look what I got.

46
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,475
You dropped this.

47
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,480
Thanks for the other day.

48
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,582
Because of you…

49
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,052
Ta-da.

50
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,889
REPORT CARD GRADES
PASS, FAIL, PASS, PASS…

51
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,557
That's nice.

52
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,326
Law major?

53
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,561
-Yes.
-Me too.

54
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,265
-Don't you know me?
-No.

55
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,200
-Haven't you seen me around?
-No.

56
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,505
-Hey. Stop that, Masaki.
-You're rarely here, calm down.

57
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,108
-Here.
-Thank you.

58
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,744
-You're Kanade Nishimura, right?
-Yes.

59
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,281
I'm Tomomi Mori, I think we're both taking
Social Security Law Studies.

60
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,616
I think so.

61
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,752
My name is Kaori.

62
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,955
Hey, have some manners.

63
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,392
<i>I did kind of know those two.</i>

64
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,364
<i>Law students are mostly male
so they stood out.</i>

65
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,399
And this guy is Masaki.

66
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,869
He's probably in the same class as you.

67
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,275
What? Today's only the third time
you came to school this year?

68
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,945
I do come to school.
I just don't attend lectures.

69
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,614
It's just the third time
you've attended a lecture, right?

70
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,149
That's right.

71
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,485
Why?

72
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm not interested.

73
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,556
But you don't want to fail?

74
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,991
I don't care if I do or not.

75
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,292
What? Then why did you…

76
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,262
cheat on the test?

77
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,663
Because…

78
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,299
isn't it thrilling?

79
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,203
Don't expect
a normal conversation with him.

80
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,738
He's kind of a scumbag.

81
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,807
There's something wrong with him
as a person.

82
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,243
Am I that bad though?

83
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,944
-Isn't he?
-He is.

84
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,114
But there aren't many scumbags
out there today, so it's refreshing.

85
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,049
True.

86
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,987
Thank you very much for harshly
complimenting me. Thank you.

87
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,088
-Give me.
-Aww.

88
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,756
Hey, don't.

89
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,259
Tastes terrible.

90
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,062
-Who cares what you think? I like it.
-How can you drink so much of that crap?

91
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,434
<i>Tomo, Kaori, and Masaki were all
the kind of people I had never met before.</i>

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,968
Hey, stop it!

93
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,271
Is she his girlfriend?

94
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,172
No.

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,240
Probably not.

96
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,477
Hey, you want a drink too, Kana Kana?

97
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,512
Wait. Why are you calling me Kana Kana?

98
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,681
Huh? Well, because of that.

99
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,150
How long have you been using that?
Since kindergarten?

100
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,920
Umm…

101
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,155
Hey, I've got a hunch.

102
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,559
-What?!
-Yoink!

103
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,794
See?

104
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,262
Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,865
-Cute.
-You look good.

106
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,070
Hey. Jeez.

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,038
There you are.

108
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,873
-I wasn't sure.
-You're late.

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,475
Who's this?

110
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,976
Kanade. Isn't she cute?

111
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,679
Yeah. Cute!

112
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,650
<i>In high school, I had made myself
invisible after my father's incident.</i>

113
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,887
<i>I had nothing to lean on
except for studying.</i>

114
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,224
<i>Being a serious student
was my only strong point.</i>

115
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,992
Introduce yourself!

116
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,260
<i>But then I made friends.</i>

117
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,064
-I remember that!
-Seriously?

118
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,999
<i>Kaori, Tomo,</i>

119
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>Masaki, Yuki,</i>

120
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,936
<i>and me.</i>

121
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,957
<i>We were always together.</i>

122
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,328
<i>It was the first time
I was enjoying my youth.</i>

123
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,533
The meat is done. Here you go.

124
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,035
Come on everyone!

125
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,103
You burnt all of them!

126
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,237
I have one more left!

127
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,739
There are only vegetables left.

128
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,749
<i>I felt like I could finally
breathe in deeply.</i>

129
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,987
Hey!

130
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,725
-Ahh!
-Don't do that!

131
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,895
<i>I didn't think the day would come
when I could laugh from my heart.</i>

132
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,166
Take that! And that!

133
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,748
Amazing.

134
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,518
It's so beautiful.

135
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,554
As if it were a painting.

136
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,156
It is…

137
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,060
Guess what?

138
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,564
I'm glad I chose this university.

139
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,805
Let's be friends forever.

140
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,313
Hmm?

141
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,350
Hmm?

142
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,888
Huh? Who just said something
so unbelievably cliché?

143
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,324
You must have misheard. Or hallucinated.

144
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,960
I was serious!

145
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,162
I really thought so, so I said it.

146
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,565
Yeah, don't make fun of her.

147
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,169
Don't mock our… friendship!

148
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:42,074
You're ruining the sunset!
You're ruining our friendship!

149
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,676
"You ruined it!"

150
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,344
Hey.

151
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,646
You know what? My father…

152
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,348
-Huh?
-Your father?

153
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,249
What?

154
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,350
My father…

155
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,589
used to call me Kana Kana
when I was small.

156
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,395
That's why my mother embroidered the name
Kana Kana on my handkerchief.

157
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,632
My father…

158
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,936
died when I was in ninth grade.

159
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,739
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,878
We were living in Tokyo then.

161
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,316
He left my mother and me

162
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,953
and took his own life.

163
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,490
Suicide?

164
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,460
There was a lot going on at work...

165
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,036
Yes. Yes, I understand.

166
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,605
Am I the only one summoned?

167
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,143
He was a public prosecutor in Tokyo.

168
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
Prosecutor.

169
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,046
Yes.

170
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,716
Is that why you're a law major?

171
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,119
I wanted to take the bar exam.

172
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,456
After my dad's suicide,

173
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,293
my mom and I moved to Nagano
where my mom is from.

174
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,765
But eventually,

175
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,501
rumors about my dad quickly spread.

176
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,173
I couldn't make any friends.

177
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,776
So I was always studying.

178
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:31,117
Even after entering university,
it was hard to open up to other students.

179
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,421
I thought for sure the next four years

180
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,390
would be lonely again.

181
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,795
That's why…

182
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,536
I'm so happy right now,
because you all are with me.

183
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,180
Sorry to burden you
with heavy stuff like this.

184
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,450
But I'm glad I told you.

185
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,821
It's my first time
to tell anybody about this.

186
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,593
Let's always be friends.

187
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,731
Forever.

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:22,802
For sure.

189
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,541
Kanade.

190
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,009
Hey.

191
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,979
All right.

192
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,956
Thank you.

193
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,857
Don't mention it.

194
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,593
Look.

195
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,465
<i>My gratitude was genuinely from the heart.</i>

196
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,881
<i>And yet, the one
who first betrayed us was…</i>

197
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,350
TWO YEARS LATER

198
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,892
IT'S RAINING HEAVILY, I CAN'T GO OUT.

199
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,026
IT'S CANCELED FOR SURE.

200
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,094
What are they saying?

201
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,363
Yuki doesn't want to go out in the rain.

202
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,866
Tomo's in the library.
She says the fireworks--

203
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,402
-That scared me!
-It's going to be okay.

204
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,738
I heard lightning doesn't strike cars.

205
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,739
Really?

206
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,944
Huh?

207
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,547
The windshield wipers stopped. Look.

208
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,384
It seems so.

209
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,721
Whoa! It's like a water slide.

210
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,457
I can't see anything in front of me.
Are we okay?

211
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,792
-If we die, we die together.
-No way!

212
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,629
I don't want to.
I really don't want to die.

213
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,097
You don't? I do.

214
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't mind dying if it were with you.

215
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,002
What?

216
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,108
Please stop the car.

217
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,876
-It's fine!
-Just pull over somewhere.

218
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,223
The Shinshu fireworks are canceled,
as we thought.

219
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,759
Kaori and Yuki said they couldn't make it.

220
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,093
Oh yeah?

221
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,462
What are we going to do?

222
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,367
Want to stay here for a while?

223
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,770
Huh? Why?

224
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,907
Instead of fireworks…

225
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,044
Hmm? What?

226
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,503
I've never seen…

227
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,007
such a beautiful starry sky.

228
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,977
First time for me too.

229
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,022
"Such a beautiful starry sky."

230
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,056
Hey.

231
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,859
Then, how did you know about this place?

232
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,760
Why?

233
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,162
Just by chance.

234
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,230
Liar.

235
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,799
You even turned off the headlights--

236
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,804
Kanade.

237
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,343
I love you.

238
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,724
Hey, let me see your hand.

239
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,759
Hmm?

240
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,999
Do you know there's a way to hold hands
that can never be separated?

241
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,470
Use handcuffs?

242
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,140
-Not like that.
-Huh?

243
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,242
Just like an aspiring prosecutor.

244
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,510
What?

245
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,081
Hold your hand like this, L-shaped.

246
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,450
Then I do this.

247
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,886
Like that.

248
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,223
Try to get loose.

249
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,159
Hmm?

250
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,728
See?

251
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,267
I was hyperactive as a kid.

252
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,735
Aren't you still?

253
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,037
Now? I guess I still am.

254
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,278
My mom would always
hold my hand like this.

255
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,547
Oh. I see.

256
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,284
But…

257
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,822
she's gone away.

258
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,262
One day,

259
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,264
she disappeared.

260
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,009
Kanade.

261
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,415
I love you.

262
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,589
I'm never letting you go.

263
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,490
I feel the same.

264
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:41,440
When someone who you thought loved you
suddenly disappears,

265
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,176
it hurts. I know.

266
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,863
What?

267
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,402
I encouraged you so many times,
but you never wanted to.

268
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,303
Huh?

269
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,273
Contact lenses. You switched from glasses.

270
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,076
Yeah. I thought I should give them a try.

271
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,745
Uh-huh.

272
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,716
You look kind of pretty, Kanade.
You're glowing.

273
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,351
What?

274
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,490
Hey.

275
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,093
Do you want to go to karaoke?
I got some free tickets.

276
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,161
Karaoke?

277
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,831
I can't. I have to get to Civil Law class.

278
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,199
Come on.

279
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,868
Kaori!

280
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,604
Don't be a sourpuss like that.

281
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,407
-Show me your face. There!
-I'm not.

282
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,175
Stop it.

283
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,210
-Ow!
-You did it first!

284
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,447
But you're the one who started it!
Man, you have a short fuse!

285
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,686
Kaori said she wasn't accepted at Nanai.

286
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,822
What? But she said she was definitely
going to get the job…

287
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,524
She didn't pass the final interview.

288
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,362
She might be a bit unstable now
since her job-hunting isn't going well.

289
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,396
I see.

290
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,236
You know, Kaori often says

291
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,972
that she never can get
what she wants the most.

292
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,978
Her family's rich, so everything she has
is super expensive

293
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,481
like her car, clothes, and bags.

294
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,049
I don't know what her problem is.

295
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,723
But I guess it's part of her charm
that she openly expresses her feelings.

296
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,558
You're right.

297
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,797
<i>I was aware that
Kaori had feelings for Masaki.</i>

298
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,133
<i>But…</i>

299
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,304
<i>I pretended not to notice
even though I did.</i>

300
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,511
I'M STAYING OVER AT TOMO'S HOUSE
TONIGHT TO STUDY.

301
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,982
You liar!

302
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,886
Yeah, I lied. So what?

303
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,589
Whom do you think I lied for?

304
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,023
You don't have to lie.

305
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,126
I can go to your house and say,

306
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:18,029
"I'm her boyfriend. I often ask her
to stay overnight at my house."

307
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,831
-You would, huh?
-I can do that.

308
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,239
"Boyfriend"? You can say that?

309
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,110
Can't I say that?

310
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,447
Of course, you can.

311
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,820
Careful!

312
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,789
<i>Because</i>

313
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,325
<i>it was my first love…</i>

314
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,238
<i>I didn't want to give Masaki away
to anybody else.</i>

315
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,014
Sorry. Did I wake you?

316
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,616
I was already awake.

317
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,251
No!

318
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,420
What do you mean, "no"?

319
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,024
<i>What a foolish and arrogant</i>

320
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,892
<i>love.</i>

321
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,171
Huh? Where's Kaori?

322
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,040
Career Support Office.

323
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,943
She's getting nervous
about not having secured a job yet.

324
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,778
Really?

325
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,019
Oh, Kaori.

326
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,890
Hi. Long time no see.

327
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,564
-Hey.
-What do you want?

328
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,467
Aren't you going to the library?
Tomo and Masaki are there.

329
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,102
I don't need to.

330
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,573
<i>I knew she was in a bad mood
not just due to failing with job-hunting.</i>

331
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,977
<i>It was also because of me and Masaki.</i>

332
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,648
<i>But I desperately denied it in my mind.</i>

333
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,420
<i>And the entrance exam for law school
was fast approaching.</i>

334
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,659
I decided to apply
to the Metropolitan Law School after all.

335
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,760
Oh, really?

336
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,695
What are you going to do?

337
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:35,767
It's not possible for me to consider
a private school, so only public.

338
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,171
-Kaori's in a super crabby mood.
-I thought so.

339
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,575
How can she take it out on me like that?

340
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,509
Because it's you.

341
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,745
-Yeah.
-What? Me?

342
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,879
That's mean.

343
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,084
Hey, let's study, you guys.

344
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,754
We need to write a graduation thesis.

345
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,489
We don't have time.

346
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:58,823
Jeez.

347
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,694
Kaori still hasn't been
accepted for a job.

348
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,595
I heard.

349
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,497
-You knew?
-Yeah. She called me.

350
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,567
Oh, wait. Let's add this.

351
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,574
Thanks for the meal.

352
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,180
-Listen.
-Hmm?

353
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:29,154
I'm thinking of applying
to a law school in Tokyo.

354
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,324
I see. Are you still trying
to become a prosecutor?

355
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,793
Uh-huh.

356
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,097
It's just amazing to me
how you and Tomo can do that.

357
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,068
After two more years of studying,
you'll be taking the bar exam, right?

358
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,704
That's dedication.

359
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:48,940
Amazing.

360
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,343
What are you going to do
after graduation, Masaki?

361
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,245
I haven't thought about it yet.

362
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,282
I mean,

363
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,686
well, first of all,
I wonder if I can graduate.

364
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:05,991
I feel like…

365
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,060
what are we even doing?

366
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:11,997
What?

367
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,068
Half of Japan
is in a terrible state right now.

368
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,438
Whole towns gone, houses washed away.

369
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,275
So many people lost their family members.

370
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,812
But here we are leading normal lives.

371
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,782
Should we look for jobs
like nothing happened?

372
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,189
Well, maybe it's not for me to say.

373
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,224
Yeah, that's true.

374
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,761
It's not for you to say, Masaki.

375
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,031
Whoa. That hurt.

376
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,634
A future prosecutor for sure.

377
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,436
Don't make fun of me.

378
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,507
We really need to decide about our future.

379
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,609
Isn't it time to do that?

380
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,248
Do you mean that you want me
to follow the path set by society?

381
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,785
What if I followed it

382
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,721
but the path had potholes,

383
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,759
or the path was a rough one,
or it was the wrong one from the start?

384
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,595
Do I still keep running on it?

385
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,401
That's just…

386
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,336
a path to doom.

387
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,777
<i>At that moment,
something reminded me of my father.</i>

388
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,817
<i>I thought of my father
who had been facing his doom on that day.</i>

389
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,586
Don't do something like that.

390
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,921
That's going too far.

391
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,325
But you're the one who told me
how bad it would be if this were true.

392
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,393
-Yes, but--
-That's why I did research.

393
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,796
Why are you trying to stop me?

394
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,933
-But--
-You knew he was going out with her.

395
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,769
That's why you thought it was no good.

396
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,036
Kaori, hold on--

397
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,705
You thought he should know too.

398
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,742
I realize I shouldn't have
told you about it.

399
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,845
But even if it were true,

400
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,782
it's their problem and not ours.

401
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,950
We don't have the right to step in.

402
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,485
What good will it do, anyway?

403
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,355
You're being argumentative again.

404
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,957
I know that you like Masaki.

405
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,225
But that doesn't mean--

406
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,995
I don't have feelings for Masaki.
Not at all.

407
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,930
I'm just saying it because he's a friend.

408
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,767
Didn't I say, "Let's be friends forever"?

409
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,804
Who's the one that betrayed us?
Wasn't it Kanade?

410
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,038
Hey, stop.

411
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,741
I can't take all this
schoolgirl-level talk anymore.

412
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,976
Listen.

413
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,413
I have to finish my thesis,
and study to be able to enter law school.

414
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:20,451
I don't have time for trivial things
like love, so leave me out of it.

415
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,153
My life depends on my studies.

416
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:08,666
Hello?

417
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,991
Good morning.

418
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,425
Good morning.

419
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,498
Where are you going?

420
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,569
I got a call from a girl.

421
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,471
What?

422
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,641
Just kidding. To the store.

423
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,279
Then buy some ice cream.
Oh, maybe I'll go too--

424
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,347
No need to. Is vanilla okay?

425
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,850
Yeah, thanks.

426
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,153
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

427
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,274
I knew you would come.

428
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,444
Are you alone?

429
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,579
Yep.

430
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,917
Is there anyone in your room now?

431
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,622
No. What did you want to talk to me about?

432
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,191
Get in.

433
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,164
Just get in.

434
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,982
KAORI
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE.

435
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,469
So, where are we going?

436
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,577
I shouldn't have come out
wearing only this.

437
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,583
It's cold…

438
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,721
Kaori, you're driving too fast--

439
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,523
Kanade was there, wasn't she?

440
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,831
She was there, right?

441
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,400
Jeez.

442
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,069
Interrogating me?

443
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,073
Whoa, that's dangerous.

444
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,191
You shouldn't be going out with Kanade.

445
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:22,960
Why?

446
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,169
Hey Kaori, say something. What is it?

447
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,305
Kanade's dad didn't commit suicide.

448
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,741
He was murdered.

449
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,077
What?

450
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,296
What the hell…

451
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,170
-What are you doing?!
-Like I said!

452
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,174
You shouldn't be seeing Kanade!

453
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,442
Why?!

454
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,984
Hey.

455
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,821
Do you want to die with me?

456
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,324
Huh?

457
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,825
Let's die together.

458
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,606
BYE

459
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,448
Kaori!

460
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,751
Why can't I ever get what I want the most?

461
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,689
Kaori, stop.

462
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,191
Come on, stop! This is nuts!

463
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,059
Why won't you believe me?!

464
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,269
Quit fooling around!

465
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,170
Because…

466
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,472
Kanade's dad is--

467
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,373
Don't say it!

468
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,682
<i>Hello? Oh, Tomo. Is anything wrong?</i>

469
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,385
<i>Kanade? Where are you?</i>

470
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,724
Tomo.

471
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,227
Kanade.

472
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,504
Why…

473
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,340
Why did Kaori…

474
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,375
Huh? Tomo?

475
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,187
HIGASHI MATSUMOTO POLICE STATION

476
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,790
<i>Kaori had died in an accident,</i>

477
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,192
<i>said the police officer
in a business-like tone.</i>

478
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,163
Did she die instantly?

479
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,664
Yes.

480
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,236
She must have lost control of the car
on a sharp curve on the way to Karuizawa.

481
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,271
The car was totaled.

482
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,543
We wanted to ask you
about Mr. Masaki Nogi who was with her.

483
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,245
Y-Yes.

484
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,147
<i>Masaki lived.</i>

485
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,751
At approximately what time
did Mr. Nogi leave the house?

486
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,826
Um, I think it was about 1 p.m.

487
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,062
Why did Mr. Nogi go out?

488
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,468
To go to the store.
That's what he told me.

489
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,438
Did he receive a call
on his cell phone at that time?

490
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,110
At 12:55 p.m.

491
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,247
-Um, officer.
-What is it?

492
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,516
This accident…

493
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,153
Do you suppose it was a crime?

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,187
Is that why you're…

495
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,656
This is just a formality.

496
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,924
This won't take long.

497
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,630
<i>But after that, I was asked
the same questions repeatedly.</i>

498
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,610
Were you waiting for me?

499
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,117
The police are questioning Masaki now.

500
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,425
And Kaori…

501
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,795
They're going to perform an autopsy.

502
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,935
I wonder if they suspect
it wasn't just an accident.

503
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,544
Hello.

504
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,511
Come with me.

505
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,614
This way, please.

506
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,052
-That man.
-Who?

507
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,087
It's Masaki's father.

508
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,455
Huh?

509
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,198
I'm the father of Masaki Nogi.

511
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,202
I apologize for my son
causing so much trouble.

512
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,471
Thank you for coming all the way here.

513
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,372
Not at all.

514
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,876
I thought I needed to hear
all the details of this accident.

515
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,244
Have you talked to your son?

516
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,480
I went to the hospital,

517
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,616
but I wasn't allowed to see him
since he was still being questioned.

518
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,251
I apologize for the inconvenience

519
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,353
It's proper to investigate an accident.

520
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,156
But personally,

521
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,893
I would like to hear your view
of what happened.

522
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,430
Depending on what you say,
my son might need a lawyer.

523

<i>That night, I went to Masaki's place
one more time.</i>

524
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,715
<i>But Masaki didn't come home.</i>

525
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,000
I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
MESSAGE ME WHEN YOU CAN.

526
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:17,174
<i>He stopped contacting me after that night.</i>

I got a call from a girl.

Just kidding.

538
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,027
I'll be right back.
