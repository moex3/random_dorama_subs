1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,442
I'm so happy right now,
because you all are with me.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,379
<i>Let's be friends forever.</i>

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,614
Kanade. I love you.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,282
<i>I'm never letting you go.</i>

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,550
<i>I feel the same.</i>

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>Kanade's dad didn't commit suicide.</i>

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,520
He was murdered.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,421
What?

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,455
Kanade's dad was--

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,390
Don't say it!

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,126
Why did Kaori…

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,764
Depending on what you say,
my son might need a lawyer.

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,700
Masaki, wait! Don't go!

14
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,768
I'm the one who…

15
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>Someone who I thought loved me
disappeared from in front of me again.</i>

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,343
<i>The patient is male
in his twenties or thirties.</i>

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,811
<i>Identity is currently unknown.</i>

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,546
-There's something I want to tell you.
-What?

19
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,583
I must go somewhere…

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,567
Kanade Nishimura, how many years
have you been a prosecutor?

21
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,403
Sorry?

22
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,179
How long have you been doing this?

23
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,850
Six years and three months.

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,955
You've been a prosecutor
for six and a half years.

25
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,392
Do you truly think
a deposition from an accomplice

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,528
is sufficient to go to trial?

27
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>I was prosecuting a case</i>

28
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,803
<i>involving illegal drug deals
that occurred a week ago.</i>

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,305
-Police!
-Don't move!

30
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,006
<i>The Kanagawa Prefectural Police</i>

31
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,477
<i>obtained information on drug deals
being made at a bar in Yokohama.</i>

32
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,481
<i>The police raided
a private room in the bar</i>

33
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,650
<i>and three men were arrested at the scene.</i>

34
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,122
<i>One of them was the second son
of Akihiko Kawagoe,</i>

35
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,591
<i>the Secretary-General
of the Democratic Liberal Party.</i>

36
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,393
<i>The case suddenly became
the center of public attention.</i>

37
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>But Takumi Kawagoe was the only one
of the three men arrested</i>

38
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,768
<i>who didn't have drugs on him,
and denied the accusation.</i>

39
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,605
<i>He insisted he didn't know anything.</i>

40
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,809
No, not exactly.

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,147
It's just that the other suspects
admitted to the crime.

42
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,249
His statement has many inconsistencies.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,318
Witnesses saw him frequenting the bar.

44
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:37,190
Above all, he was in the small room
while the drugs were being sold.

45
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,993
You don't have to tell me.
I've read what you wrote.

46
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,030
But you don't have his confession.

47
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,332
He was not in possession of any drugs.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,334
Right.

49
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,936
Either get him to confess…

50
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,907
or collect stronger evidence.

51
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,442
You're not an amateur.

52
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,346
I've heard that
Kanade Nishimura is good. But…

53
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,417
Is this all you have to show?

54
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,596
<i>We needed an indictment
in this case at all costs.</i>

55
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>Two years since getting transferred
to Yokohama.</i>

56
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,624
<i>The city's night sky is too light</i>

57
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,559
<i>to see any stars.</i>

58
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,771
Mr. Nogi.

59
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,574
You're not allowed to leave your room
without permission.

60
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,909
What are you doing?

61
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,378
Hmm? I was just looking at the stars.

62
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,946
Stars?

63
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,225
Nurse Hashimoto,
when can I leave the hospital?

64
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,326
-Excuse me?
-Um…

65
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,895
Hasn't this healed enough?

66
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,198
It's not for me to say.

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,101
What did the doctor say?

68
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,403
Nothing.

69
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,939
Should I ask him?

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,074
Yes, thank you.

71
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,728
Confession.

72
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,964
Evidence.

73
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,234
Evidence…

Have you been to Bar Gloire before?

84
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,969
It was my first time there.

85
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,642
-I'm home.
-Hi, Takashi.

86
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,278
-Still working?
-Mm-hmm.

87
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,182
Don't work too hard.

90
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,579
Hmm? What?

91
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,983

What?

105
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,711
Just kidding. To the store.

hearing my answer to his proposal.</i>

165
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,804
<i>Was he feeling awkward
after all this time?</i>

166
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,376
<i>Or was he just expecting</i>

167
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,079
<i>for me to say yes?</i>

00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,547
<i>Yes, I'm planning to.</i>

174
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,951
<i>Okay, I'll talk to you then.</i>

175
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,286
<i>I know you're busy.</i>

176
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,289
<i>It's fine. I look forward to seeing you.</i>

TOSHIKI TAGAWA, AGE 49

00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,326
<i>I'm sorry, but I unexpectedly
have a witness interview.</i>

184
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,560
<i>I might be late.</i>

185
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,729
<i>I'll take the bullet train
as soon as I'm done.</i>

186
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,534
<i>I see.</i>

187
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,236
<i>It must be tough working on a Sunday.
Best of luck.</i>

188
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,778
<i>That day, Tomo said
our friendship might be over.</i>

189
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,853
<i>But as we got together</i>

190
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,956
<i>for Kaori's first, second, and sixth
anniversary memorial services,</i>

191
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,059
<i>our relationship began
to return to what it was.</i>

192
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,999
Mr. Tagawa, the witness, has arrived.

193
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,167
Thank you. I'll be right there.

194
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,772
<i>Sometimes I wonder what it would be like
if Tomo had become a prosecutor.</i>

195
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,476
<i>But after she passed
the entrance exam for law school,</i>

196
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,211
<i>she simply gave up on the bar exam.</i>

197
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,813
<i>The reason was her pregnancy.</i>

198
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,515
<i>And the father was…</i>

199
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,251
Hey, can I wear this today?

200
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,954
No, you have to wear black.

201
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,922
But it's the 12th, and a private event--

202
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,691
-Wear black.
-Yes.

203
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,198
Hey, can I wear this today?

204
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,549
Thank you for coming on your day off.

205
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,450
Well…

206
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,255
You know, our customers
were the ones arrested.

207
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,057
My bar just got caught up in it.

208
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,559
Of course, we understand.

209
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,995
We are asking for your cooperation.

210
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,600
Mr. Tagawa, when the police
questioned you,

211
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,337
you said you didn't know Takumi Kawagoe.

212
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,506
That's right. I didn't know him.

213
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,875
The son of the Secretary-General
of the DLP?

214
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,112
The press is making a big fuss
and it's a nuisance to us.

215
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:01,780
I see.

216
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,587
Mr. Tagawa, you must have heard
about a bar named La Bilance.

217
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,364
Until three years ago,

218
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,503
you owned a bar at the same location
under a different name.

219
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,872
And the name was La Bilance.
Is this correct?

220
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,408
Uh. Yes.

221
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,878
This means the current bar
reopened with a different name.

222
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,585
Don't you know a man
named Eiichi Nakamura?

223
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,589
I do. He was a regular at the last bar.

224
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,823
NAKAMON

225
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,592
EIICHI NAKAMURA

226
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,497
This is from Mr. Nakamura's social media.

227
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,533
If you follow the links back in time,

228
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,969
<i>he was at a party
at La Bilance four years ago.</i>

229
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,437
<i>And you were there too.</i>

230
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,275
OWNER AND FRIENDS
A PRIVATE FAREWELL PARTY

231
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,810
Huh?

232
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,615
And the person
who is next to you in the picture…

233
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,683
POST BY @NAKAMURAXX983

234
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,189
…is Takumi Kawagoe,
the suspect. Is it not?

235
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,130
Have you been to Bar Gloire before?

236
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,065
It was my first time there.

237
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,208
Why were you hiding this fact from us?

238
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,445
Because I…

239
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,815
Mr. Tagawa.

240
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,052
You can lie to us all you want.

241
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,122
But if you keep this up,

242
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,560
we will consider you complicit
in the dealing of illegal drugs.

243
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,364
Furthermore, we will have to view you

244
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,702
as providing the location
and assisting in the dealing

245
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,037
of illegal drugs.

246
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,207
Is that all right with you?

247
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,245
No, I…

248
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,560
Kaji, today's deposition should do it,
can you prepare the indictment?

249
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,331
Yes, ma'am. But do I have
to work overtime on my own?

250
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,600
-I'll buy you lunch.
-No need for that.

251
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,735
Can I have a paid day off instead?

252
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,638
You're always telling me I can,
but it never happens.

253
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,942
Kaji, isn't it an assistant officer's job
to prepare the indictment?

254
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,143
Uh, yes.

255
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,246
You'll get your day off.
I'm counting on you.

256
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,948
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

257
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,224
Thank you both for making time
in your busy schedule to come.

258
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,492
Not at all.

259
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,428
Mr. and Mrs. Oikawa,
I hope you both stay well.

260
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,264
Thank you.

261
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,001
-Take care of yourself, Tomomi.
-I will.

262
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,640
If only that accident hadn't happened,
Kaori would be like you two by now--

263
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,540
Hey.

264
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,010
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,412
I guess it's no use
talking about it in this way.

266
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,414
It's all right.

267
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,251
I hope you'll find happiness,
for Kaori's sake too.

268
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,089
And I hope sometimes

269
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,191
you'll remember Kaori.

270
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,328
I've never forgotten her.

271
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,099
Not ever.

272
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,238
We'll come by to see you again.

273
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,006
-Please do.
-Thank you.

274
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,743
Looks like Kanade couldn't make it.

275
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,213
There are people you can only interview
on weekends, I guess.

276
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,649
Having a job is not easy.

277
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,584
Well, it can't be helped.

278
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,556
"Be happy for Kaori's sake too," she said.

279
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,693
-Huh?
-I was just wondering.

280
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,797
How can I find happiness for Kaori's sake?

281
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,171
Hey, Mom.

282
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
I know where you want to go.
Railway Heritage Park, right?

283
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,511
Yay! Abt system!

284
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,647
Let's go, hurry!

285
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,285
How did he get so simple-minded?

286
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,490
Maybe the existence of that kid
is our happiness.

287
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:40,959
What?

288
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,863
Should we get ourselves
some soda floats and head home?

289
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,233
Uhh… Wasn't that a little cheesy?

290
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,836
-Why would I be?
-Hmm?

291
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,162

294
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,111
<i>After that, I visited the university
for the first time in a while.</i>

295
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,016
<i>Although it was Sunday,</i>

296
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,887
<i>I saw some students there.</i>

297
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,457
<i>Similar to how we were back then.</i>

298
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,893
Hey, stop!

299
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:53,799
<i>That's the seat where Kaori
was always drinking melon soda floats.</i>

300
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,367
-Give me.
-Aww.

301
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,468
Hey, don't.

302
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,570
Tastes terrible.

303
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,808
-Who cares what you think? I like it.
-How can you drink so much of that crap?

304
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,347
-Masaki is mine!
-What are you talking about?

305
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,486
Kanade too! You're mine!

306
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,788
I like both of you!

307
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,158
-Ah-ha!
-What are you doing?

308
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,562
-Tomo is mine too!
-Don't be silly.

309
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,529
How about me?

310
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,665
Yuki? I don't think so.

311
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,433
What? That's mean!

312
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,401
Yuki, come here.

313
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,870
Are you kidding me?

314
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,340
<i>We were so innocent then.</i>

315
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,243
<i>We all liked Kaori.</i>

316
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,214
<i>She was high-maintenance, audacious,</i>

317
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,882
<i>and childlike.</i>

318
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,952
<i>But we liked her nonetheless.</i>

319
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,026
<i>Then why…</i>

320
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,428
To the store.

321
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,463
I'll be right back.

322
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,899
This accident…

323
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,435
Do you suppose it was a crime?

324
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,871
I wonder if they suspect
it wasn't just an accident.

325
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,141
<i>What really happened
between those two at that time?</i>

326
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,578
<i>The accident was blamed
on Kaori's negligence.</i>

327
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,215
Hey! Tell me what happened!

328
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,550
I'm the one who…

329
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:21,887
<i>Masaki…</i>

330
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,257
<i>was saying something to me.</i>

331
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,325
<i>What did he say?</i>

332
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,395
<i>What was he telling me?</i>

333
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,139
What do you mean he's gone?

334
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:45,010
As I said,
the bed was empty before I realized it.

335
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:45,911
And I found this.

336
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,512
THANKS FOR THE CARE
MEDICAL FEE, NOGI

337
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,115
What's the matter?

338
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,484
Oh, Dr. Okuda. Well,

339
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,955
a patient brought in as an emergency case
left the hospital without permission.

340
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,691
Can't you contact him?

341
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,592
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,565
Dr. Okuda,
the patient's family has arrived.

343
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,566
Yes, thank you.

344
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,105
MASAKI NOGI, ADMITTED: JULY 11, 2024
PHYSICIAN: DR. KENTARO NAKAMURA

345
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,587
Wrong room.

346
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,556
Sorry, my mistake.

347
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,991
Are you kidding?

348
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:24,776
Why?

349
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,346
Why are you here?

350
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,352
Did you know
about Kaori's Memorial Service?

351
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,426
Was it you who went to her grave?

352
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:48,800
<i>I wondered how long it had been
since I uttered the name Masaki?</i>

353
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:54,973
Kanade.

354
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,944
<i>The moment I heard his voice,</i>

355
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,048
<i>I was instantly back in those days.</i>

356
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,521
I missed you.

357
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,660
What's that?

358
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,731
After all these years…

359
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,201
What are you saying now?

360
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,074
Where were you this whole time?

361
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,711
And what were you doing?

362
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,014
Masaki.

363
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:41,786
Kanade…

364
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,824
are you a prosecutor now?

365
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,460
Huh?

366
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,162
That lapel pin.

367
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,836
Yes, I've become one.

368
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:02,841
That's amazing.

369
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,946
You kept at it.

370
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:10,682
Yes.

371
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:13,785
I kept at it.

372
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,292
I felt like I wanted to die at one point.

373
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,896
I thought I couldn't believe anyone.

374
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,600
You don't know…

375
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,271
how hard it was for me…

376
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,511
how hard it was for us
to get over the death of Kaori.

377
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,083
Why did you disappear without telling us?

378
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,119
Why didn't you say anything?

379
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,290
How awful of you.

380
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,762
So don't you dare tell me now

381
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,933
that you missed me.

382
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,177
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,415
You're right.

384
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,758
Hey, don't cry.

385
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,938
Sorry.

386
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,250
Wait.

387
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,121
Back then…

388
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,359
what did you say to me?

389
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,697
On that day when I last saw you.

390
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,869
What went on with you and Kaori?

391
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,906
Why did Kaori…

392
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,748
Kanade.

393
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,684
You're amazing.

394
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,593
Seriously.

395
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,062
I think you're amazing.

396
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,098
<i>I was relieved the light was turned off.</i>

397
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,169
<i>I didn't want to face Takashi</i>

398
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,805
<i>feeling the way I did.</i>

399
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,780
<i>Sorry I missed you today.
Come visit us when you have more time.</i>

400
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,415
<i>A gathering to remember Kaori.</i>

401
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,051
<i>Thanks. Sounds great.</i>

402
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,628
<i>By the way,</i>

403
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,365
<i>I saw Masaki today.</i>

404
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,967
<i>I ran into him at--</i>

405
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,469
TOMO

406
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,436
Hello.

407
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,039
-<i>What do you mean you saw him?</i>
-W-Wait a second.

408
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,075
Well, I saw Masaki.

409
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,378
-Where?
<i>-The university.</i>

410
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,248
I didn't make it to the memorial service,
so I visited Kaori's grave.

411
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,051
Then after that,
I felt like seeing the university.

412
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,586
What's that guy doing now?

413
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,487
<i>I don't know.</i>

414
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,156
Did he know that it was
the day of Kaori's service?

415
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,258
I asked him the same question.

416
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:48,826
<i>So, what'd he say?</i>

417
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,762
He said, "Sorry."

418
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,065
<i>That's all he said.
He disappeared again after that.</i>

419
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,935
Hey Mom. I need
my gym clothes for tomorrow.

420
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,938
What? You're just telling me now?
Ask your father.

421
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,007
-What?
-<i>Sorry. I was talking to my son.</i>

422
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,375
Anyway, I can't believe it.

423
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,711
It's like, "Screw you!" Right?

424
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,415
Mom. Dad's asleep.

425
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,418
All right. I'll take care of it now.

426
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,820
Sorry. I'll call you later.

427
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,590
Hey, you've got to come over soon.
Let's talk all about it.

428
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,827
Yeah. Okay, see you then.

429
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,931
-<i>Hey, Kanade.</i>
-Sorry, what?

430
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,035
You'd better not see Masaki.

431
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,405
<i>You have Takashi now.</i>

432
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,009
I won't see him.

433
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,811
I don't have his number--

434
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,746
Absolutely not. You should never see him.

435
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,016
I know.

436
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,851
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-Yeah.

437
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,821
-<i>Bye then.
</i>-Okay, bye. Good night.

438
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,804
Is something the matter?

439
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,973
Umm, uh, I was just talking with Tomo.

440
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,108
Sorry if I woke you.

441
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,642
-No.
-Oh.

442
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,645
Uh, I wanted to ask you
about what I said the other day.

443
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,080
What?

444
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,849
About us getting married.

445
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,852
Yeah.

446
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,453
When's your next day off?

447
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,924
Well… It'll be after
the case I'm on now has been resolved.

448
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:31,362
Let's visit your mother together
and tell her about it on your day off.

449
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,134
Sounds good.

450
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,565
Hey.

451
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,701
Whoa. What are you doing over there?

452
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,804
I couldn't get to sleep.

453
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,977
Kanade said

454
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,548
she ran into Masaki today.

455
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,651
What? No way.

456
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,488
What could he be thinking
after all these years?

457
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,632
Are you listening?

458
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,336
Yeah. I'm listening.

459
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,505
Here.

460
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,815
<i>Kanade's dad didn't commit suicide.</i>

461
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,250
<i>He was murdered.</i>

462
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,484
<i>Do you want to die with me?</i>

463
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,652
<i>Kanade's dad was--</i>

464
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,787
<i>Don't say it!</i>

465
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,403
So you're saying

466
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,307
you obtained the bar owner's statement
to corroborate the crime?

467
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,575
Yes.

468
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,912
Now Masuko and Ikeguchi's confessions
have been substantiated.

469
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,915
There is no doubt
that Takumi Kawagoe was an accomplice.

470
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,718
Are you sure you can win the case?

471
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,619
Yes.

472
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:37,989
I see.

473
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,565
Excuse me. Ms. Nishimura.

474
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,501
The witness from the other day
says he can't testify in court.

475
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,836
What do you mean?

476
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,404
He says he made a mistake.

477
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,139
You must be joking.

478
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,209
I kept asking him repeatedly
but he suddenly started to play dumb.

479
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:02,747
Hello.

480
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,082
-Can you explain?
-He called just moments ago.

481
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,252
Oh… I see.

482
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,455
Yes.

483
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,191
So that's what's happening.

484
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,728
Understood.

485
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,670
Takumi Kawagoe has switched
his attorney to Koichiro Nogi.

486
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,107
This is a tough one.

487
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,944
<i>It's not rare
for the defense counsel to change.</i>

488
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,847
The former prosecutor
has come out to squash us, huh?

489
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,884
<i>How do you feel about the arrest?</i>

490
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,221
<i>Since the accused is the son of Democratic
Liberal Party Secretary-General,</i>

491
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,723
<i>they seem to be very eager.</i>

492
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,258
<i>However,</i>

493
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,861
<i>it was a completely rash move
by the police.</i>

494
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,297
Are you saying
the arrest itself was a mistake?

495
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,033
I think it was an unjust arrest.

496
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,971
I believe the prosecution
will not indict under these circumstances.

497
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,406
An indictment is impossible.

498
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,175
There's just no way.

499
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,977
<i>So Takumi Kawagoe
has no involvement with this case?</i>

500
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,079
<i>Of course not.</i>

501
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,881
That man. It's Masaki's father.

502
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:11,816
Huh?

503
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,219
<i>The man on TV</i>

504
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,255
<i>was Masaki's father
who came to see him after the accident.</i>

505
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,426
<i>Did Mr. Kawagoe frequent that bar?</i>

506
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,729
<i>No comment.</i>

507
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,963
<i>Is the Secretary-General…</i>

508
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,072
<i>But that was not all.</i>

509
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:40,478
<i>I had a feeling I had seen
a similar scene somewhere before.</i>

510
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,948
<i>The case is a fabrication
by the prosecution.</i>

511
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,250
<i>The chief prosecutor forced a confession.</i>

512
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,151
<i>It is outrageous.</i>

513
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,388
<i>It was a fragment in my memory</i>

514
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,023
<i>so faint that I couldn't recall it.</i>

515
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,927
-He's here!
-There he is!

516
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:01,399
<i>In the end, the son
of the Secretary-General of the DLP</i>

517
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,636
<i>Takumi Kawagoe was released
without indictment</i>

518
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,638
<i>and the case was later dropped.</i>

YOKOHAMA SUMMARY COURT

521
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,736
Thank you very much
for all your hard work.

522
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,070
Don't mention it.

523
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,406
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

524
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,256
I have…

525
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,093
something to ask you.

526
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,330
This is out of the blue.

527
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,066
Do you have some time?

528
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,072
All right. Let's go over there.

529
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,945
That patient who ran away the other day?

530
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,882
The patient who was brought in
with blows to the head and stomach.

531
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,691
You still haven't been able
to contact him?

532
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,725
No.

533
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,962
The cell phone number never connects,
and he has no fixed address.

534
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,763
Masaki Nogi…

535
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,533
Where were you? What have you been doing?

536
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,005
Haven't you thought about how much
your family would be worried about you?

537
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,713
-Masaki.
-I'm not a kid.

538
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,215
So stop treating me like one.

539
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,785
What I wanted to ask you is…

540
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,756
about a former Tokyo district prosecutor,

541
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,158
Eisuke Tsuji.

542
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,595
Twenty years ago,

543
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,964
he committed suicide
right before his arrest

544
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,434
in the environmental energy
corruption case.

545
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,309
I don't know what you're doing now,

546
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,246
but did you come to see me
just to talk about something like that?

547
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:37,288
You've been missing
for over ten years, and now this?

548
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,696
There's nothing I can tell you.

549
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,067
Why are you always like that?

550
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,070
You always disappoint me.

551
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,874
Are you able to feed yourself?

552
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,511
-Are you making a living--
-Don't change the subject.

553
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,115
All I want

554
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,952
is to know the truth.

555
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,155
I'm in trouble if I don't know it.

556
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,959
Is somebody

557
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,528
making you do this?

558
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,409
Don't pry with stupid questions.

559
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:36,513
Wait.

560
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,518
Kanade's dad didn't commit suicide.

561
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,686
He was murdered.

562
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,088
I said wait.

563
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,157
You shouldn't be seeing Kanade!

564
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,661
What the hell is this?

565
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,596
-This is nuts!
-Why won't you believe me?!

566
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,231
What's your problem?

567
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,668
Let go of me!

568
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,602
Kaori!

569
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,703
Kanade's dad was--

570
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,804
Don't say it!

571
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,840
Weren't you the one who killed him?

572
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,608
Did you kill Eisuke Tsuji?

573
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,277
Say something!

574
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,215
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

575
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,283
That's why

576
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,252
that accident…

577
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,288
And I…

578
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,525
Kaori was…

579
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,080
<i>The past that I had sealed off</i>

580
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,082
<i>suddenly came rushing back.</i>

581
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,222
Subtitle translation by: Ikuko Sachs

582
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,657
<i>My father was killed.</i>

583
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,893
Why do you think your father didn't fight?

584
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,829
What does that have to do
with Kaori Oikawa's death?

585
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,864
Sometimes the past needs to be sealed.

586
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,266
Marry me.

587
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,435
-You'd better not get close to Kanade.
-Kanade!

588
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,237
<i>I must not go. I know I shouldn't, but…</i>
