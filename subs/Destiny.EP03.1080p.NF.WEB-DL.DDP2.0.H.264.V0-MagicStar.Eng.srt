1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,908
Kanade. I love you.

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,380
Do you know there's a way to hold hands
that can never be separated?

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,382
I got a call from a girl.

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,449
I'll be right back.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,550
Kanade's dad was--

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,451
Don't say it!

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,921
This might be the end…

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,590
of our friendship.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,693
Why are you here?

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,595
-I missed you.
-You don't know…

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,865
how hard it was for us
to get over the death of Kaori.

12
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,634
<i>I've never forgotten her. Not ever.</i>

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,903
You'd better not see Masaki.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,772
<i>You have Takashi now.</i>

15
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,774
Don't you think… it's time we get married?

16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>This is a tough one.</i>

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,981
The former prosecutor
has come out to squash us.

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,649
This is out of the blue.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,384
All I want is to know the truth.

20
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,753
What the hell is this?

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,922
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

22
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,624
That's why I…

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,426
Kaori was…

24
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,612
Kanade, wait!

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,450
Wait a second.

26
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,989
Sorry, I can't. Let's go, Kaji.

27
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:31,925
Are you sure?

28
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,379
<i>Since that day,</i>

29
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,317
<i>Masaki's voice won't stop
echoing in my ears.</i>

30
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,255
<i>There can't be any doubt
about what he said at that moment.</i>

31
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,724
<i>He said Eisuke Tsuji was killed.</i>

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,826
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

33
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,330
Is this your first time?

34
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,598
Yes, it's my first time.

35
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,032
Your…

36
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,103
<i>Masaki's father,
Koichiro Nogi, killed my father?</i>

37
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,540
That's why I… Kaori was…

38
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,178
<i>And what does that have to do</i>

39
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,081
<i>with Kaori's accident?</i>

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,690
ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY CORRUPTION CASE

41
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,600
<i>Hello. This is Nishimura.</i>

42
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,104
It's been a while.
I have a little favor to ask you.

43
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,741
I want to see the documents
for a case from the Tokyo District Office.

44
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,976
Yes. A case around 2004.

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,012
TO KANADE NISHIMURA

46
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,180
FROM TOKYO DISTRICT OFFICE

47
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,717
<i>My father was involved as a prosecutor</i>

48
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,953
<i>in the environmental energy
corruption case.</i>

49
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,789
<i>When the trial was over,</i>

50
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,458
<i>my father committed suicide</i>

51
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,928
<i>right in front of me.</i>

52
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,999
<i>My father was kind.</i>

53
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,702
<i>Kana Kana, come here.</i>

54
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,175
<i>When I was a child,
he used to play with me often.</i>

55
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,243
Way to go!

56
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,648
<i>At the time, I didn't even know
what sort of work he was doing.</i>

57
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,152
What's your job, Daddy?

58
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,555
Daddy's job is called a prosecutor.

59
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,190
What's a prosecutor?

60
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,427
Hmm, it's hard to explain.

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,000
There are people who do bad things, right?

62
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,901
Uh-huh.

63
00:03:54,968 --> 00:04:00,640
We catch those bad people,
and judge if they really were bad.

64
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,143
Then we try to make them
turn into good people by--

65
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,411
I don't understand.

66
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,048
Yeah, it's hard to understand, isn't it?

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,686
<i>For some reason,
I remember that day very well.</i>

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,657
<i>The park at dusk,
walking side by side with my father.</i>

69
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,193
<i>The warmth of my father's hand.</i>

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,833
My commitment to a sense of justice.

71
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,602
That might be it.

72
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,176
You asked me about my job.
Didn't you, Kanade?

73
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,111
Yeah.

74
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,218
Daddy's job is to be committed
to what I believe is justice.

75
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,187
Or…

76
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,325
maybe it's a job that tests you

77
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,896
if you can commit
to a sense of justice or not.

78
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:03,236
<i>My father changed
when I was in the sixth grade.</i>

79
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,938
<i>It was after we moved
from Takamatsu to Tokyo.</i>

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,208
Is Dad not coming home again tonight?

81
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,345
He's on a business trip for a while
so he won't be coming home.

82
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:16,849
<i>His work required him
to be away from home for days at a time.</i>

83
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,154
Welcome home.

84
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,022
Hello, Kanade.

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>At home, he didn't talk much anymore.</i>

86
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,699
<i>I felt scared to talk to him sometimes.</i>

87
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,677
May 19th, 2003…

88
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,745
Kanade.

89
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,648
Don't get in your father's way.
Go to bed now.

90
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,250
On May 19th…

91
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,852
<i>From TV news,</i>

92
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,689
<i>I found out that my father worked
in the special investigation squad</i>

93
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,725
<i>of Tokyo District
Public Prosecutors Office.</i>

94
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,729
<i>He was leading the search
of an office of a sitting Diet member</i>

95
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,897
<i>who was involved in a corruption case.</i>

96
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,466
POLICE SEARCH THE OFFICE
OF DIET MEMBER AZUMA

97
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,635
<i>My father, the prosecutor in charge,</i>

98
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,971
<i>ordered the arrest of the Diet member.</i>

99
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,743
<i>But when the trial started,
it became clear</i>

100
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,613
<i>that the prosecution
had fabricated evidence in the case.</i>

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,616
<i>My father, who was supposed to be
catching bad people,</i>

102
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,320
<i>found himself considered
to be the villain.</i>

103
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,457
<i>And then he…</i>

104
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,726
Am I the only one summoned?

105
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,632
<i>The case is a fabrication
by the prosecution.</i>

106
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,635
It was a completely rash move
by the police.

107
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:44,871
<i>It is outrageous.</i>

108
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,205
An indictment is impossible.

109
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,152
KOICHIRO NOGI

110
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,756
<i>The attorney who exposed
the fabrication by the prosecution</i>

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,826
<i>and caused my father to get arrested was</i>

112
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,162
Koichiro Nogi.

113
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,963
KOICHIRO NOGI

114
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,266
UPSET WIN BY ATTORNEY OF JUSTICE
KOICHIRO NOGI

115
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,434
An indictment is impossible.

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,501
<i>It is outrageous.</i>

117
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,607
Yes.

118
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,975
Do you have a moment?

119
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,377
Yes.

120
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,215
You seem to be researching something
on your own recently.

121
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,116
Well, I…

122
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,820
Is it about Eisuke Tsuji,
the former prosecutor?

123
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,424
Did you know about my father?

124
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,861
It was easy to figure out
even with the change in your surname.

125
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,331
That's fine for now.

126
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,500
You have a visitor.

127
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,536
The "attorney of justice" is here.

128
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,072
What?

129
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,081
Thank you for waiting.

130
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,526
Be careful.

131
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,129
You never know when you'll be caught
flat-footed in this business.

132
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,265
Try not to repeat
the mistakes of your father.

133
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,311
Thank you for making time
in your busy schedule.

134
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,946
Not at all.

135
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,183
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

136
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,288
At Yokohama District Court.

137
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,790
Oh, it's all right.

138
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,262
Was that day… the first time we met?

139
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,363
Uh, not exactly.

140
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,699
I didn't meet you in person,

141
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,371
but I'm familiar with your face and name
from that illegal drug case.

142
00:08:58,971 --> 00:08:59,839
Oh.

143
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,375
And…

144
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,545
once before that.

145
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,014
I was at university.

146
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>When Ms. Kaori Oikawa had that accident,</i>

147
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,486
<i>I saw you at the police station in Nagano.</i>

148
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,454
I see.

149
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,824
I know Masaki caused so much trouble.

150
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,826
It's all right.

151
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,597
The reason I came here is--

152
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,500
Is it about my father, Eisuke Tsuji?

153
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:40,947
Um…

154
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,015
Oh, excuse me.

155
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,751
I was surprised by your bluntness.

156
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,124
It's because I too

157
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,430
wanted to meet you face-to-face
and ask you some questions.

158
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,666
Ask me? About what?

159
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,038
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

160
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,508
About the case

161
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,046
which my father
was involved in 20 years ago.

162
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,850
The environmental energy corruption case.

163
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,586
I see.

164
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,002
In that case,

165
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,906
you were the attorney for the Diet member
my father indicted for bribery.

166
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,575
Yes, I was.

167
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,378
This almost feels

168
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,813
like an interrogation.

169
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:53,152
The special investigation squad was abuzz
over the arrest of a sitting Diet member.

170
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,321
Well, I can imagine.

171
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,456
But when the trial started,

172
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,994
every last bit of testimony
up until that point was retracted.

173
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,196
This was all done by a skilled attorney.

174
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,634
I don't know if I'm that skilled.

175
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,270
The Diet member was acquitted,

176
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,376
and my father was accused
of deciding to indict even though he knew

177
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,013
that the key evidence email
had been fabricated.

178
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,115
And he was dishonorably discharged.

179
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,285
Yes.

180
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,455
And right before he was arrested…

181
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,360
My father…

182
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,932
was proud of his job as a prosecutor.

183
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,967
It's just impossible

184
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,604
that he would ever try
fabricating evidence to achieve results.

185
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,874
I don't believe that,
and I don't want to believe that.

186
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,111
If by any chance

187
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,781
my father actually did
what he was suspected of doing,

188
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,319
there must have been… a reason why.

189
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,253
That's what I…

190
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,125
wanted to know.

191
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,586
If so then why do you think

192
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,855
your father didn't fight

193
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,724
to clear his name?

194
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,997
You must be concerned

195
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,933
because of what Masaki said.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,136
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

197
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,341
But what I presented in the trial
with your father was all truthful.

198
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,843
As recognized by the court.

199
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,581
I was committed to justice as an attorney.

200
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,484
And your father

201
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,019
lost.

202
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,856
It was a grievous incident.

203
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,459
But your father

204
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,195
administered justice to himself.

205
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,299
Wasn't that what happened?

206
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,671
At least that's what I--

207
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,839
Even if so…

208
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,709
Even if that's the case,

209
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,815
what does that have to do
with Ms. Kaori Oikawa's death?

210
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,583
I'm sure he said…

211
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,153
I-I'm sure of what Masaki said that day.

212
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,689
That's why that accident…

213
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,558
Kaori was…

214
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,127
I have no knowledge
beyond your father's case.

215
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,830
There's no way I can answer.

216
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,706
Are you asking me

217
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,341
as a prosecutor?

218
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,412
Or as the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji?

219
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm asking as both.

220
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,433
Then I have to say it was a bit lousy

221
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,634
as a prosecutor.

222
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,477
YOKOHAMA MUNICIPAL
MINATO GENERAL HOSPITAL

223
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,262
Come in.

224
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,364
The doctor will see you.

225
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,332
Hello.

226
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,903
Are you Mr. Masaki Nogi

227
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,805
brought here in an ambulance?

228
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,707
Yes.

229
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,543
Thank you for coming in.

230
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,112
It's okay.

231
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,916
There's something I wanted to tell you.

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,525
When you can't get a statement,
you obtain objective facts and evidence.

233
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,860
Isn't that the basic method?

234
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,296
Uh…

235
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,098
Especially if your opponent is formidable.

236
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,288
Matsumoto Higashi Police Department?

237
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,925
I'm Nishimura from the Yokohama District
Public Prosecutor's Office.

238
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,894
I appreciate your kind assistance.

239
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,164
I want to make an inquiry
about an accident from 12 years ago.

240
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,268
It occurred within the jurisdiction
of Matsumoto Higashi in July 2012.

241
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,242
I was committed to justice as an attorney.

242
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,844
And your father

243
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,878
lost.

244
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,148
Are you asking me as a prosecutor?

245
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,118
<i>Or as the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji?</i>

246
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,988
How about the 17th? Next Saturday.

247
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,857
Huh? Sorry, what?

248
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:32,791
Oh, I…

249
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,194
The day we're going to Nagano.

250
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,395
How's next Saturday?

251
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,863
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,266
We've got to inform your mother
about us getting married.

253
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,335
Yeah.

254
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,941
Another difficult case?

255
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,710
Hmm?

256
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,746
Lines on my brow?

257
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,748
No.

258
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,583
There are no lines. You're fine.

259
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,318
But…

260
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,420
I don't want wrinkles.

261
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,325
<i>"It might be Masaki."</i>

262
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,427
<i>That was my gut feeling.</i>

263
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,703
Not answering?

264
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,138
It's a number I don't know.

265
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,982
TOMO

266
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,052
Hello? What's up, Tomo?

267
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,621
Sorry to call so late. Can we talk?

268
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,690
It's all right with me.

269
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,724
Hold on a second.

270
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,830
Hello? What is it?

271
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,533
You haven't met… Masaki again, have you?

272
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,837
No, I haven't met him but…

273
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,673
But what?

274
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,844
It's hard to explain on the phone.
I-I'll tell you when I see you.

275
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,313
What's hard to explain on the phone?

276
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,417
Why are you so curious about Masaki?

277
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,719
<i>Well, you can't help it I guess.</i>

278
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>H-Hello?</i>

279
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,727
Okay. I understand.

280
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,430
Call me when you have some time.

281
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,665
-Yeah.
-<i>Let's get together and talk.</i>

282
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,235
Okay, great. Thank you.

283
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,703
Good night then.

284
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,271
Yeah, good night.

285
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,650
Ah-ha! I startled you!

286
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,720
Stop this "I startled you" nonsense!
Hey, Nozomi!

287
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,122
Nozomi!

288
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,128
Mom, we're here.

289
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,463
Welcome home.

290
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,200
-Oh, Ms. Nishimura.
-Ah, Takashi.

291
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,335
So nice of you to come at a busy time.

292
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,638
-No problem. It's been a while.
-Yes, it has been.

293
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,839
I brought you this.

294
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,042
Thank you! Please have a seat.

295
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,510
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

296
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,846
Hey, you'll have beer, won't you?

297
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,681
-Yes.
-It should be fine.

298
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,550
You didn't drive here.

299
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,920
<i>I could see clearly
how excited my mother was.</i>

300
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>She thought we were there to tell her
we were planning to get married.</i>

301
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,761
<i>Of course that was true,</i>

302
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,765
<i>but I realized my heart was heavy
for some reason.</i>

303
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,269
<i>Was it because of my father? Or Masaki?</i>

304
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,006
<i>The restlessness in my life these days.</i>

305
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,810
<i>But that wasn't all.</i>

306
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,583
Hey. Are we really going to tell her
about us getting married today?

307
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,052
We're not? Why?

308
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,522
Because I haven't given you an answer yet.

309
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,593
I thought so. You didn't notice it.

310
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,895
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

311
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,763
Oops. I forgot the chopsticks.

312
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,500
Kanade, take care of this.
As you can see, I'm on a roll these days.

313
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,902
-On a roll?
-On a roll…

314
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,372
I'm on a roll towards aging.
It's embarrassing, honestly.

315
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,977
<i>When did my mother become so cheerful?</i>

316
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,749
<i>How did she overcome my father's death?</i>

317
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,519
-I'm so glad you could come.
-Thank you.

318
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,288
There you go.

319
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,724
-I'll do it.
-Thank you.

320
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,726
-Here.
-Thank you.

321
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,762
I'll fill it up for you.

322
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,697
Sorry.

323
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,366
-I'll do it for you.
-No, it's okay.

324
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,534
-Okay.
-Now, let's eat.

325
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,571
Uh, before we start…

326
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,339
Yes.

327
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,145
-Um, well…
-Huh?

328
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,319
Kanade.

329
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,857
Will you marry me?

330
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,861
What?

331
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,830
You said you hadn't answered yet, so…

332
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,066
You didn't?

333
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,903
Please give me your answer.

334
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,951
Yes. I'd be happy to marry you.

335
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,553
My goodness…

336
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,589
I'm so glad…

337
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,159
You two…

338
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,062
Hey, let's have a toast!

339
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,196
Yes. Cheers.

340
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,698
Let's have a toast!

341
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,633
-Cheers.
-Congratulations!

342
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,501
Takashi. Take care of my daughter.

343
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,837
-Of course. Please treat me favorably.
-Of course.

344
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,273
Congratulations!

345
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,075
I've been drinking alone recently.

346
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,142
What?

347
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,512
Don't mind me if I pass out today.
You can go home whenever you want.

348
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,448
I cannot do that.

349
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,550
I'm a doctor.

350
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,425
What is it? Did I say something weird?

351
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,496
You've definitely found
a good man, Kanade.

352
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,365
Did you hear that?

353
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,532
I'm relieved.

354
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,648
I apologize for having to meet
in this way, Mr. Nogi.

355
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,549
It's all right.

356
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,819
Something worrisome came up.

357
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,921
What do you mean?

358
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,124
Did you happen to meet

359
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,861
the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji recently?

360
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,234
I'm impressed that you know.

361
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,376
EISUKE

362
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,867
Kanade. What are you doing?

363
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,170
Looking for notebooks
from my university days.

364
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,005
Oh.

365
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,441
Takashi fell asleep. What should we do?

366
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,242
I wonder if I made him drink too much.

367
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,444
Just leave him alone.

368
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,680
Recently, he's had to perform
a lot of operations so he must be tired.

369
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,183
-Are you busy these days too, Kanade?
-Yeah.

370
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,151
But it's always that way.

371
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,025
You don't have to try so hard anymore.

372
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,627
Huh?

373
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,832
You've found your own happiness now.

374
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,902
I'm not trying too hard.

375
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,673
Kanade, if you're
still thinking about your father--

376
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,475
No, it's not like that. It's okay.

377
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,379
I hope so.

378
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,594
You need to forget

379
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,662
about your father.

380
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,900
There are things better left unknown.

381
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,070
Sometimes the past needs to be sealed.

382
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,176
You becoming a prosecutor was a surprise.

383
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,715
I'm sure your father never dreamt of it.

384
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,193
THE UNKNOWN SIDE OF FORMER PROSECUTOR
AND ATTORNEY KOICHIRO NOGI

385
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,929
<i>Mr. Nogi is a former prosecutor.</i>

386
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,702
<i>In 1988,</i>

387
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,805
<i>he was posted to Kagoshima District.</i>

388
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,513
KAGOSHIMA DISTRICT
BRANCH CHIEF HARA FAREWELL PARTY

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,255
<i>He was my father's colleague?</i>

390
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,593
I was committed to justice as an attorney.

391
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,430
<i>But why didn't he mention that fact to me</i>

392
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,701
<i>when we talked the other day?</i>

393
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,247
Can I turn off the light?

394
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,683
Hmm? Yes.

395
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,086
What's the matter?

396
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:30,722
What?

397
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,660
You seem kind of down
since this afternoon.

398
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,330
I don't think so.

399
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,565
I'm not feeling down, but…

400
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,435
Are you hesitant to get married?

401
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,004
Huh?

402
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,239
Of course not. What are you saying?

403
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,140
Well,

404
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:53,078
we don't have to fixate
on the idea of marriage.

405
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,649
If you don't want to get married,
we could just stay as is.

406
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,620
Huh?

407
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,323
I never said I didn't want to get married.

408
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,062
Then why did you say we should?

409
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,697
You suddenly proposed to me.

410
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,837
I wonder why myself.

411
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,578
You should go check out the fridge.

412
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,247
What's in there?

413
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,384
Something I bought you.

414
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,596
This ring was in the fridge?

415
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,698
Why?

416
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,170
He's more mischievous than he seems.

417
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,272
Yeah. He doesn't seem the type, does he?

418
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,408
Congratulations!

419
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,576
Thank you.

420
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,780
-Huh?
-What?

421
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,449
I thought you'd be more excited.

422
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,586
I'm not that young anymore, and we've
lived together for almost two years.

423
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,521
That's how it is?

424
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,356
Yes, that's how it is.

425
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,595
It's not because of Masaki, is it?

426
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:52,964
What?

427
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,199
The reason you're not excited.

428
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,036
No, that's not it.

429
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:02,841
Well…

430
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,512
-To tell you the truth…
-Yeah.

431
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:14,252
I happened to see Masaki
argue with his father.

432
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,687
Where?

433
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,622
<i>The Yokohama District Court lobby.</i>

434
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,358
<i>I heard Masaki say</i>

435
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,495
that his father was the one

436
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,531
who killed my father.

437
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,933
And that Kaori's accident
was connected to it.

438
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,838
Masaki said that?

439
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,345
Later on, we met and talked.

440
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,881
-With Masaki?
-Um, no.

441
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,115
With Masaki's father.

442
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,017
No way.

443
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:47,852
What did he say?

444
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:56,995
He said he only faced my father
as an attorney against a prosecutor.

445
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,998
He didn't know about the accident.

446
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,367
But if you think about it,

447
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,903
on that day

448
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,973
<i>Masaki's father
came to the police station.</i>

449
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,879
Then the accident was treated
as negligence by Kaori.

450
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,716
He might have pressured them?

451
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,352
So,

452
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,488
I made a request

453
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,857
<i>to the Nagano police station.</i>

454
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,562
<i>What I found out was</i>

455
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,898
<i>Masaki's fingerprints
were on the steering wheel.</i>

456
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,036
You mean it wasn't an accident?

457
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,747
I've never told anyone this before.

458
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,953
But on that night,
Masaki said something to me.

459
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,589
-That night?
-The night of Kaori's wake.

460
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,624
<i>Maybe…</i>

461
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,326
I'm sorry!

462
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,461
I'm the one who…

463
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,197
<i>He said he killed Kaori.</i>

464
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,436
No. That can't be.

465
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,706
I know. It's unthinkable to me too.

466
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,111
There's something I've learned
as a prosecutor.

467
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,850
The difference between committing a crime
and not committing a crime

468
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,852
is a very fine line.

469
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,089
When unexpected things happen,

470
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,157
people behave unexpectedly.

471
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,494
You never know when a person

472
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,964
might step over a line.

473
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,200
You just don't know.

474
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,671
That's why…

475
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:52,644
of course I want to believe
my father and Masaki, but…

476
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,179
I believe them as a daughter

477
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,483
and as a friend.

478
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,185
But now,

479
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,321
it's impossible

480
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,090
for me to blindly believe them

481
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,759
as a prosecutor.

482
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,865
Feeling like this

483
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,768
sometimes makes me think
I shouldn't have become a prosecutor.

484
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,370
But I can't back down now.

485
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,107
Because I want to know the truth.

486
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,283
I'm sorry I had to tell you this.

487
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:33,885
It's okay.

488
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,221
But you're the only one
I could share this with.

489
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,136
So after all…

490
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,107
I…

491
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,877
I think I should go see Masaki and ask him

492
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,447
about the accident.

493
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,817
What happened between him
and Kaori on that day…

494
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,187
and why he appeared in front of me--

495
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,221
Don't do it.

496
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,957
-Why?
-Because what if…

497
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,729
What if he actually did kill Kaori?

498
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,398
I'm home.

499
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,134
Crap, he's home already.

500
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,103
He said he'd be late.

501
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,671
Who's here? Do you have company?

502
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,772
Why are you asking?

503
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,543
Hello. Long time no see.

504
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,178
Kanade.

505
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,515
Why are you shocked?

506
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,854
Didn't you say you would be late?

507
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,555
Huh?

508
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,626
Well, the truth is…

509
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,032
Hey, come on in.

510
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,788
Hi.

511
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,062
What's going on?

512
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,331
Um, so…

513
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,634
I contacted Yuki.

514
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,236
That's why…

515
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,606
That's why you came to Kaori's memorial?

516
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,074
You heard from him?

517
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,447
What are you guys secretly doing?

518
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,749
-But I couldn't--
-Masaki, you too.

519
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,086
You don't have to hide from us.

520
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,624
Well… You know.

521
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,861
But now everyone's here, so it's all good.

522
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,530
Hey. We might as well make a toast.

523
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,731
How about it?

524
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,201
We should raise a glass to Kaori.

525
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,038
Come on. I even bought some pizzas.

526
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,242
Raise a glass? Are you kidding?

527
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,646
Some nerve showing up, Masaki.

528
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,985
What? But Tomo.

529
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,055
You just said he doesn't have to hide.
That's saying the opposite.

530
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,623
I'm just saying I can't believe

531
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,026
how you can show your face
after being so secretive.

532
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,563
So tell me, why didn't you ever call me?

533
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,666
And why did you
come over here so suddenly?

534
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,835
Tomo. That's enough.

535
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,571
I just wanted…

536
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,740
to see everybody.

537
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,218
Masaki says he was

538
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,554
out of the country this whole time.

539
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,522
Right?

540
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,323
What were you doing?

541
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,359
Digging wells.

542
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,427
-Wells?
-Yeah.

543
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,897
He was working with NGOs.

544
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,466
going to developing countries
and conflict areas.

545
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,101
What?

546
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,271
As a way of atonement for Kaori?

547
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,006
Tomo.

548
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,944
Sorry.

549
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:24,849
I should leave now.

550
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,717
Huh?

551
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,785
I apologize, Yuki.

552
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,121
Tomo too.

553
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,358
Kanade too.

554
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,698
-Bye.
-Hey, hold on--

555
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,333
You'd better not get close to Kanade.

556
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,102
Kanade's getting married soon.

557
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,305
She already has a man.

558
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:58,916
I see.

559
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,388
Congratulations.

560
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,860
I see.

561
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,335
Show me.

562
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,972
I got a call from a girl.

563
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,873
I'll be right back.

564
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,782
I missed you.

565
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,984
What the hell is this?

566
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,955
<i>"It's now or never."</i>

567
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,358
<i>I heard a voice inside me say.</i>

568
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,131
Kanade, don't go!

569
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,184
Why were you so harsh on him?

570
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,353
You didn't have to say--

571
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,622
Because it's all my fault!

572
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,459
Everything was my fault.

573
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,010
Masaki! Wait!

574
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,932
I want to ask you something.

575
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,736
What?

576
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,743
Why did you say what you said?

577
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,884
What was the relationship
between my father

578
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,619
and your father?

579
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,691
Did you know about the case
my father was working on?

580
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,127
And that your father

581
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,430
was the attorney on the case?

582
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,367
And what does that

583
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,137
have to do with

584
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,272
Kaori's accident?

585
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,713
What do you actually know, Masaki?

586
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,487
I want to know too.

587
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,825
Until I find out,

588
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,831
in the meantime,

589
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,234
I'll be here.

590
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,448
What kind of guy is he?

591
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:51,916
Huh?

592
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,485
Your husband-to-be.

593
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:02,960
What a lucky guy.

594
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,795
He gets to marry you.

595
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,632
Don't be silly.

596
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,603
You're right.

597
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,109
If I find out something,

598
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,112
can I contact you?

599
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,982
Was that call you?

600
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,851
Yeah.

601
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,086
That was me.

602
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,360
Y-You can.

603
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,468
Bye then.

604
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,004
Bye.

605
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,675
Kanade!

606
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,815
Don't let go!

607
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,085
Huh?

608
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,597
<i>Do you know there's a way to hold hands
that can never be separated?</i>

609
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,207
I know.

610
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,010
I know!

611
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,159
<i>It was his usual smile.</i>

612
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,199
<i>I knew I must not go.</i>

<i>I've ruined everything.</i>

616
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,731
Why were Masaki's fingerprints there?

617
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,100
Kaori!

618
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,135
If I'd killed her…

<i>That's not fair, Tomo!</i>

620

It was me who…

621
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,139
It's impossible.
