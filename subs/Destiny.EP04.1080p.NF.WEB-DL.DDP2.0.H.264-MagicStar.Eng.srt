1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,907
Masaki!

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,509
I'm sorry!

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,277
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,912
That's why

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,214
that accident…

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,715
<i>Kaori was…</i>

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,958
<i>My father was involved as a prosecutor</i>

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,394
<i>in the environmental energy
corruption case.</i>

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,130
I have to say it was a bit lousy
as a prosecutor.

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,799
<i>Mr. Nogi is a former prosecutor.</i>

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>He was my father's colleague?</i>

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,071
Will you marry me?

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,640
Yes. I'd be happy to marry you.

14
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,376
Some nerve showing up, Masaki.

15
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,111
-I should leave now.
-Huh?

16
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,781
What do you actually know, Masaki?

17
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,982
<i>I want to know too.</i>

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>I knew I must not go.</i>

19
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,004
<i>I knew I shouldn't, but…</i>

20
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,437
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,308
Forget that.

22
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,846
It's impossible.

23
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,550
Then…

24
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,122
don't forget it.

25
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>Whenever I see Kanade,
I can't hide my feelings.</i>

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,521
<i>What was I hoping to achieve
by coming back?</i>

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,724
<i>It was the same when I was a kid.</i>

28
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,994
<i>I never felt like I belonged.</i>

29
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,399
<i>The very first memory I have</i>

30
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,802
<i>is from the end of the summer
when I was three years old.</i>

31
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,475
<i>My mother told me
to wait there for a while.</i>

32
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,082
<i>And</i>

33
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,218
<i>she never came back.</i>

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>Later, I was somehow under a tree</i>

35
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>looking at a dead cicada.</i>

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,895
<i>It might have been from that day</i>

37
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,066
<i>that I had a fear of loving anyone.</i>

38
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>Even after my mother left,
he was so busy with work,</i>

39
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,575
<i>he barely had any time to spend with me.</i>

40
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,644
<i>I came to realize</i>

41
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,180
<i>I was born into a prominent family
in Yokohama.</i>

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,616
<i>It didn't matter to me.</i>

43
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,820
<i>It didn't matter to me at all.</i>

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

45
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,591
Masaki, come here.

46
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,192
<i>He remarried,</i>

47
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,396
<i>and my new mother
tried very hard to get me to like her.</i>

48
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,499
<i>I hated it, so I was rebellious.</i>

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,535
Look at the camera, please.

50
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,736
Here we go.

51
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,272
FAMILY PORTRAIT

52
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,310
<i>They forced me to attend the school
where he had graduated.</i>

53
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,512
Why can't you come to class
like everyone else?

54
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,251
<i>But I disobeyed the teacher
and cut class all the time.</i>

55
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,723
<i>I've done my share of bad things.</i>

56
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,257
Want to go to the arcade?

57
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,159
Are you listening? Hey, let's go.

58
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,561
<i>But…</i>

59
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,230
I've heard my son Masaki
has been causing trouble.

60
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,100
-I apologize.
-It's quite all right.

61
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,239
<i>No matter what I did,
he sorted out any problems.</i>

62
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,980
<i>That made me rebel even more.</i>

63
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,349
<i>I was childish.</i>

64
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,957
SHINANO UNIVERSITY

65
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,662
<i>The reason I went to a rural university
was to get away from my family.</i>

66
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,665
<i>But I chose law as my major.</i>

67
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,403
Join our tennis club. Everyone's welcome.

68
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,906
<i>There was an unspoken pressure.</i>

69
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,275
<i>I was unable to escape</i>

70
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,977
<i>from his influence.</i>

71
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,781
We're the cinema studies club.
Come join us.

72
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,253
<i>Right after classes started,
an obnoxious guy spoke to me.</i>

73
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,257
You're Nogi, right?

74
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:25,858
Yeah.

75
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,994
I'm Yuki Umeda. Where are you from?

76
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,431
-Yokohama.
-Wow!

77
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,933
I'm from Kawasaki!

78
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,904
Doesn't this place feel so rural?

79
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,505
Not a whiff of urban-ness.

80
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,109
<i>He was so unguarded.</i>

81
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,779
<i>At first, I suspected he had
an ulterior motive.</i>

82
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,783
<i>-But…</i>
-I'm hungry but I'm broke!

83
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,520
-I can't buy lunch.
-This is all I have too.

84
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,155
-I guess we should share.
-Okay.

85
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,192
-Let's see.
-I want curry.

86
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,994
-I want fried rice.
-Let's have curry.

87
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,863
Wait, this is better.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,865
DONATION BOX FOR HUNGRY CHILDREN
AROUND THE WORLD

89
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,033
Huh?

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>He was truly generous.</i>

91
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,140
Pretty please! Let me borrow
your notes for the test.

92
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,476
-Come on.
-No. You were in the class.

93
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,644
It's not for me though.

94
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,646
-It's for Masaki.
-Heh heh.

95
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,750
Don't try to be cute.
Why don't you ask me yourself then?

96
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,719
Tomo, let's have lunch.
And while you're at it help me study.

97
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,689
Everyone comes to me before an exam.

98
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,424
-Come on, Tomo.
-Come on, Tomo.

99
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,793
Then it's settled. Let's go.

100
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,762
Are you kidding me?

101
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,864
<i>The girls were carefree friends.</i>

102
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,732
<i>Tomo and Kaori.</i>

103
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,869
<i>Then I met Kanade.</i>

104
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,705
Show me your answers, so, I, can, cheat.

105
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,910
-The windshield wipers stopped.
-If we die, we die together.

106
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,413
No way! I don't want to.
I really don't want to die.

107
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,581
Then, how did you know about this place?

108
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,582
Just by chance.

109
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,351
You even turned off the headlights--

110
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,787
Kanade.

111
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,321
I love you.

112
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,659
<i>It was the first time
I ever loved somebody from the heart.</i>

113
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,462
-I'm never letting you go.
-I feel the same.

114
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,132
<i>I don't know exactly
what attracted me to Kanade.</i>

115
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,470
When someone who you thought loved you
suddenly disappears,

116
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,306
it hurts. I know.

117
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,011
<i>But I felt that she and I were similar.</i>

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,448
<i>Those were fun days.</i>

119
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,188
<i>But…</i>

120
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,125
<i>I ruined it.</i>

121
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,393
Quit fooling around!

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,294
Because…

123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,495
Kanade's dad was--

124
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,563
Don't say it!

125
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,331
<i>I ruined everything.</i>

126
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,876
NOGI

127
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,717
Honey, can you drive Risa?

128
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,751
Yes I can.

129
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,254
Thanks. Hurry up, Risa.

130
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,624
<i>I wondered how many years it had been
since I saw my sister.</i>

131
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,392
We have time so it should be fine.

132
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,861
-Take care.
-Okay.

133
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,898
<i>They look like a happy family
when I'm not included.</i>

134
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,000
Goodbye.

135
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,537
<i>But behind that happiness,</i>

136
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,874
<i>there are those who were sacrificed.</i>

137
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>My stepmother and my sister</i>

138
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,379
<i>don't know the truth.</i>

139
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,122
<i>My relationship with Masaki
was a thing of the past.</i>

140
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,159
<i>I told myself that.</i>

141
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,572
<i>Now I have finally obtained happiness.</i>

142
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,407
<i>And yet</i>

143
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,477
<i>Kaori's accident was on my mind.</i>

144
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,712
Aren't you going to eat?

145
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,247
I'll be right there.

146
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,191
You want to buy a condo?

147
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,962
Don't you think this place is too small
for a married couple?

148
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,196
Some day it might be.

149
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:25,865
Yeah?

150
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,235
I did some checking and there are
good places available nearby.

151
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,339
Something wrong?

152
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,176
Well, what if I get transferred
to another city?

153
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,613
I think there's definitely going to be
more moving around for me.

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,847
How do you feel about it?

155
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,885
Shouldn't we think about those things
as they come up?

156
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,420
It's not that complicated.

157
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,357
I guess you're right…

158
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,761
But for me, it's an important
decision to make.

159
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,897
Oh, I have to go.

160
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,966
I'm done eating.

161
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,702
Thanks.

162
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,471
-Hey.
-Hmm?

163
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,177
Have you thought about quitting your job
and becoming a lawyer instead?

164
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,282
If you did, we wouldn't have to worry
about being apart, right?

165
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,352
Of course, it's up to you.

166
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,622
Oh, I really have to go.

167
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,790
Have a nice day.

168
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,465
<i>At that moment,
I realized for the first time</i>

169
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,467
<i>what Takashi was hoping for.</i>

170
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,972
Have I ever thought about
quitting my job as a prosecutor?

171
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,474
Yes.

172
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,976
Never. Not once.

173
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,312
I see…

174
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,913
-Never?
-Yes.

175
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,083
Everyone around me became my enemy.

176
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,486
My colleagues, my boss.

177
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,721
My husband.

178
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,061
Did your doctor-boyfriend
tell you to quit?

179
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:02,995
Um, no.

180
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,398
That's when everyone hesitates.

181
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,267
Prosecutors can't avoid transfers.

182
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,170
Marriage, childbirth, parenting…

183
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,073
Should you stay a prosecutor
and be transferred by yourself,

184
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,208
or just quit and become a lawyer?

185
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,743
Maybe quit working altogether?

186
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,448
But you know, in my opinion,

187
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,519
somebody who's not fully a prosecutor
doesn't have the right to waver.

188
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,389
If you're not sure,
you might as well quit.

189
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,358
Your level of commitment is low anyway.

190
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,361
You might be happier that way.

191
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,530
Although I think,

192
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,765
what happiness consists of

193
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,169
depends entirely on that person.

194
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,805
<i>As she said,</i>

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,241
<i>I might not have been
a full-fledged prosecutor</i>

196
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,044
<i>and didn't have a right to waver.</i>

197
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,947
<i>But still,</i>

198
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,283
<i>I didn't want to quit this job.</i>

199
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:02,488
<i>Besides, I still had
something I had to do.</i>

200
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,623
<i>This accident…</i>

201
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,226
Do you suppose it was a crime?

202
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm the one who…

203
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,945
RECENTS
TAKASHI, TOMO

204
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,249
If I find out something,
can I contact you?

205
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,307
I want to talk about something.

206
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,044
Me too.

207
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,280
I wanted to ask you something.

208
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,898
Come in.

209
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,736
Is this allowed?

210
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,772
Not really.

211
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,742
But no one can hear us in here.

212
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,447
Kanade.

213
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,751
I see you're a prosecutor for real.

214
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,687
Huh?

215
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,591
You even have your own office.

216
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,295
Yeah.

217
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,373
What did you want to talk to me about?

218
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,376
Yeah.

219
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,683
Oh, here.

220
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,122
Vanilla ice cream.

221
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,093
Since I promised

222
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,863
I'd get it for you.

223
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,233
Where are you going?

224
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,834
I got a call from a girl.

225
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,237
Just kidding. To the store.

226
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,573
Then buy some ice cream.

227
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,175
Is vanilla okay?

228
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,423
I'll tell you…

229
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,761
about that day.

230
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,135
This feels…

231
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,205
like an interrogation.

232
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,143
It should.

233
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,247
I need to hear your story.

234
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,950
Unless you tell me,

235
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,521
I can't move forward.

236
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,591
I…

237
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,729
I can't be done.

238
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,704
Why…

239
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,649
Why were your fingerprints
found on the steering wheel

240
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,751
<i>when they checked Kaori's car?</i>

241
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,671
I see.

242
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,144
On that day…

243
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,114
Yes.

244
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,615
I was awakened

245
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,852
<i>by Kaori calling me.</i>

246
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,555
Hello?

247
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,691
I knew you would come.

248
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,426
Get in.

249
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,030
Just get in.

250
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,133
<i>I got in Kaori's car.</i>

251
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:47,373
And she said that

252
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,877
I shouldn't be dating you.

253
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,980
And that your dad

254
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,949
didn't commit suicide.

255
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,551
Kanade's dad didn't commit suicide.

256
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,953
He was murdered.

257
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,022
What?

258
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,158
Kaori said that?

259
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,897
So

260
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,766
I made her stop the car

261
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,335
and I let her talk.

262
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,774
<i>She told me about the case
your dad and my father were involved in.</i>

263
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,714
"The corruption case involving the subsidy
of environmental energy."

264
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,684
Your father became famous
because of this case.

265
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,020
But Kanade's dad

266
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,022
took his own life after the case.

267
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,763
What do you mean?

268
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,099
What are you saying?

269
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,034
This case seems strange to me.

270
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,539
The politician who was arrested
was guilty for sure,

271
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,774
but in the trial,
everything was overturned.

272
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,644
Kanade's dad was forced
to take responsibility.

273
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,180
<i>Kaori seemed to be</i>

274
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,782
suspecting something.

275
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,253
At the trial,

276
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,125
who overturned all the testimony
and evidence?

277
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,764
It was your father.

278
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,671
After losing the trial, Kanade's dad

279
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,240
was accused of a crime.

280
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,709
And then

281
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,212
he died.

282
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,715
Hey.

283
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,452
Your dad used to be
a prosecutor, wasn't he?

284
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:47,159
Did you know that he was
a colleague of Kanade's dad?

285
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,927
No, I didn't.

286
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,497
I heard the two were rivals.

287
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,764
So what?

288
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,100
Are you saying he did something?

289
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,574
Kaori?

290
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,345
I know

291
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,848
because I went to see your father
and heard everything.

292
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>She went to see my dad.</i>

293
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,860
Who said she could?

294
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,330
I lost it.

295
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,900
I totally lost my cool.

296
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,669
What the hell…

297
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,843
What are you doing?!

298
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,810
Like I said!

299
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,614
You shouldn't be seeing Kanade!

300
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,882
Why?!

301
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,456
Hey.

302
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,494
Do you want to die with me?

303
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,963
Huh?

304
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,464
Let's die together.

305
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,936
<i>Kaori started the car suddenly.</i>

306
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,038
<i>She drove dangerously fast.</i>

307
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,574
Kaori!

308
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,010
Why can't I ever get what I want the most?

309
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,348
Come on, stop! This is nuts!

310
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,183
Why won't you believe me?!

311
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,258
<i>She had been acting weird
around that time.</i>

312
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,894
I thought our lives were in danger.

313
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,996
So I grabbed the wheel,

314
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,664
<i>and I tried like hell to stop her.</i>

315
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,466
Kaori!

316
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,367
<i>But…</i>

317
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,670
she had remarkable strength.

318
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,077
Kaori!

319
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,248
Stop! I'm serious!

320
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,049
Stop!

321
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>I thought she was really trying to die.</i>

322
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,587
I said stop!

323
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,888
She could be so dumb.

324
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,194
I was frantically telling her
to stop the car.

325
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,196
Stop!

326
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,499
Kaori!

327
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,936
Kaori!

328
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,609
And then?

329
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,679
Then before I knew it,

330
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,651
Kaori… turned the wheel.

331
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,760
You're saying

332
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,729
Kaori was the one

333
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,733
who turned the wheel?

334
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,142
Are you sure?

335
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,346
I…

336
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,083
I let go of the wheel.

337
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,052
Then…

338
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,289
why did you say something like that?

339
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm sorry!

340
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,759
I'm the one who…

341
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,428
killed Kaori.

342
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,066
Because it was the same

343
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,735
as if I'd done it.

344
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,840
Why wasn't I…

345
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:28,613
able to listen to her more calmly?

346
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,250
Why couldn't I…

347
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,087
make her relax?

348
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,458
I could have gotten her a soda float

349
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,560
<i>and said,</i>

350
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,830
<i>"You're cute, Kaori"
or something like that.</i>

351
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,165
<i>Like I always do.</i>

352
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,305
But the truth is

353
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,208
I was tired…

354
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,712
of being pushed around

355
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,750
by Kaori.

356
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,886
Somewhere in my mind,

357
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,555
I'd had enough of her antics.

358
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,959
I did get pissed off

359
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,662
when she talked about my dad.

360
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,865
But that wasn't all.

361
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,401
I was thinking

362
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,204
"I love Kanade."

363
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,842
"So?"

364
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,745
"What's wrong with that?"

365
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,720
And I think…

366
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,958
I was also scared of dying.

367
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,864
<i>That's why I let go of the steering wheel.</i>

368
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,737
<i>After the accident,</i>

369
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,106
<i>he came to the hospital.</i>

370
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,744
<i>The police determined the accident
was due to Kaori's negligence.</i>

371
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,348
<i>I was a suspect but as always,
he made it go away.</i>

372
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,953
But…

373
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,190
I fled.

374
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:24,029
When I was told the accident
was Kaori's fault, I didn't deny it.

375
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,265
So…

376
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,277
it's as if I killed her.

377
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,574
Why did you…

378
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,411
disappear without telling anybody?

379
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,382
I didn't know…

380
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,619
how I could face you guys.

381
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,755
I knew that

382
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,292
we wouldn't ever see Kaori again,

383
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,229
and it was my fault.

384
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,938
Are you going to be okay?
Will you be able to sleep in the tent?

385
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,472
No problem!

386
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,008
I'm going now. Bye.

387
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,909
Have fun.

388
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,393
You're saying

389
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,697
Kaori was the one who texted
and asked you to come out.

390
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,000
And it was her who was driving too fast.

391
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,537
That's what happened.

392
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,438
No.

393
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,640
I couldn't stop her.

394
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,942
It was my fault.

395
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,045
I ran away after that

396
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,481
without saying a word.

397
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,451
I just ran.

398
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,788
Tomo has every right to scold me.

399
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,158
Tomo.

400
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,562
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,768
Don't be.

402
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,270
You're wrong.

403
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,445
It's not Maski's fault.

404
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,250
It's my fault.

405
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,857
Tomo?

406
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,626
I'm the one

407
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,164
who told Kaori about the corruption case.

408
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,734
What?

409
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,473
I'm sorry, Kanade.

410
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,276
Masaki.

411
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:02,847
Around that time,

412
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,317
my graduation thesis
was on cases of false accusations.

413
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,419
THE MECHANISM
OF FALSE ACCUSATION CASES

414
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,393
<i>I found an article on the corruption case.</i>

415
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,895
ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY CORRUPTION CASE

416
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,865
EISUKE TSUJI SUSPECTED
OF FALSIFYING EVIDENCE

417
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,701
<i>He was a public prosecutor in Tokyo.</i>

418
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,604
He left my mother and me
and took his own life.

419
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,607
COMMITS SUICIDE AT HOME

420
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>The prosecutor in charge</i>

421
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,346
was… Kanade's father.

422
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:41,019
And I learned that the attorney
who uncovered it was Masaki's father.

423
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,055
I was so surprised, I just…

424
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,493
told Kaori about it without thinking.

425
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,396
What? You're kidding.

426
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:52,931
Oh my…

427
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,267
I-I was shocked
when I learned about it too.

428
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,503
Look at this.

429
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,046
ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY CORRUPTION CASE
REACHES CLIMAX AFTER FOURTH TRIAL

430
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,447
This is bad.

431
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,916
Don't you think so?

432
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,488
<i>Then Kaori's actions escalated, and…</i>

433
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,125
Don't do something like that.

434
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,293
That's going too far.

435
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,864
But you're the one who told me
how bad it would be if this were true.

436
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,901
-Yes, but--
-You knew he was going out with her.

437
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,736
That's why you thought it was no good.

438
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,971
Kaori, hold on--

439
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,672
You thought he should know too.

440
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,310
I realize I shouldn't have
told you about it.

441
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,313
But even if it were true,

442
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,150
it's their problem and not ours.

443
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,519
We don't have the right to step in.

444
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,020
What good will it do, anyway?

445
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,923
You're being argumentative again.

446
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,159
I know that you like Masaki.

447
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,794
But that doesn't mean--

448
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,563
I don't have feelings for Masaki.
Not at all.

449
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,498
I'm just saying it because he's a friend.

450
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,868
Hey, stop. I can't take all this
schoolgirl-level talk anymore.

451
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,873
Leave me out of it.
My life depends on my studies.

452
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,209
Then why did you show me this?

453
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,080
You encouraged me, Tomo.

454
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,183
That's not fair.

455
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,351
<i>Kaori said</i>

456
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,989
she went to Masaki's father's office

457
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,491
and asked him questions.

458
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,962
I couldn't believe what she was doing.

459
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,397
I couldn't take her seriously.

460
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,933
So I snapped and said…

461
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,070
I went all the way
to Tokyo to see him. But you--

462
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,172
You did? To ask him for a job?

463
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,215
How could you?

464
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,618
How can a friend say such a thing?

465
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,455
That's cruel, Tomo!

466
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,228
You…

467
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:05,563
You…

468
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,133
<i>Kaori was crying.</i>

469
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,438
<i>But I was still mad at her.</i>

470
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,774
<i>I didn't even run after her.</i>

471
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,715
Considering her personality,
I should have known.

472
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,053
But who knew she would die?

473
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,157
Who knew it'd be the last time?

474
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,204
That's why…

475
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,710
whenever I think about Kaori,

476
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,680
I always remember what I did.

477
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,821
So I tried hard not to think about it,

478
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,824
and desperately sealed off my memory, but…

479
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,293
It's not your fault, Tomo.

480
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,597
It's not.

481
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,633
No, I did it.

482
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,001
It's my fault.

483
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,503
It was me who…

484
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,671
Tomo.

485
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,240
It was me.

486
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:33,885
<i>Both Tomo</i>

487
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,520
<i>and Masaki</i>

488
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,856
<i>were still living under the weight
of Kaori's death.</i>

489
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:44,996
<i>It was a pain that hadn't healed
and still continues now.</i>

490
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:51,035
<i>The days of our youth
continued after that day.</i>

491
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,874
<i>They hadn't ended yet,
even though we'd become 35 years old.</i>

492
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,916
Hey, do you want to keep walking
a little bit more?

493
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,922
I don't feel like going home right now.

494
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,472
Are you okay being with me?

495
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,308
Sure.

496
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,012
You're my friend
from my university days, right?

497
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,819
Remember what Kaori said

498
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,122
while looking very serious?

499
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,227
Let's be friends forever.

500
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,198
Don't mock our… friendship!

501
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,003
And everyone laughed.

502
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,572
Yeah.

503
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,844
But she was not kidding.

504
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,195
I'll forget about that kiss, okay?

505
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,002
You knew?

506
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,936
Mm-hmm.

507
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,571
You did?

508
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,572
Yeah.

509
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,708
Because when you had that fight…

510
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,453
Were you listening?

511
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,021
Huh?

512
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,089
No.

513
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,828
<i>Your voices were so loud,
it was impossible not to hear.</i>

514
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,766
I knew that Kaori's death
was on your mind a lot too.

515
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,205
That's why you went out with me on a whim,

516
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,973
got pregnant with Nozomi,

517
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,608
and married me.

518
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,177
You even gave up

519
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,814
on your dream of passing the bar exam.

520
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,751
It's not that I gave up.

521
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,223
It's not like that.

522
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,724
Huh?

523
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,662
I felt like Nozomi

524
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,467
was the reincarnation of Kaori.

525
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,269
-Reincarnation?
-Yeah.

526
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,707
A precious life was given to me.

527
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,010
I wanted to cherish it.

528
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,516
You know,

529
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,988
I wouldn't be here
if you weren't there for me back then.

530
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,161
Thank you, Yuki.

531
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,433
It's nothing, because…

532
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,970
I've always liked you.

533
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,041
From the first time I met you.

534
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,045
What?

535
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,015
I didn't know that.

536
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,387
I thought you probably didn't.

537
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,028
Tomo!

538
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,199
I promise…

539
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,968
to try my best.

540
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,971
For you,

541
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,508
and for Nozomi.

542
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,413
So…

543
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,451
let's keep living
our lives together, okay?

544
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,957
Huh?

545
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,106
I can get home on my own from here.

546
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,708
Thank you.

547
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:25,876
Okay.

548
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,546
Where do you live now, Masaki?

549
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,616
Nowhere, I just stay in various places.

550
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,752
I'm going far away soon anyway.

551
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,720
Overseas again?

552
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,855
Yeah.

553
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,695
Kanade.

554
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,998
About my dad.

555
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,235
I'm thinking of going to see him again
and asking questions.

556
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,570
What?

557
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,842
If he framed your father in some way,

558
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,279
I'll never forgive him.

559
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,951
He's the type who would do such a thing.

560
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,054
To win a trial

561
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,356
he would do anything.

562
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,359
-So--
-Wait.

563
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,130
I'll do the investigation.

564
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,265
Huh?

565
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,235
Because we're not sure of anything yet.

566
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,871
But Kaori told me back then…

567
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,507
We don't know the truth yet.

568
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:35,146
What did your father say to Kaori
when she met him?

569
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,351
Why did she tell you
my father had been murdered?

570
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,990
What was hidden behind the case
they were working on?

571
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,927
Why did my father die?

572
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,462
There's no absolute proof.

573
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,434
Knowing about my father

574
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,304
is very important to me too.

575
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,545
Besides…

576
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,483
I shouldn't blindly doubt someone.

577
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,288
He's your father after all.

578
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,062
I see you have become

579
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,865
a prosecutor for real.

580
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:31,936
You're right.

581
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,238
That's what I am.

582
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,347
You can't see any stars here.

583
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,319
I see one.

584
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,856
That doesn't count.

585
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,913
<i>Just as I promised Masaki,</i>

586
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,218
<i>I found time during work
to investigate my father's case further.</i>

587
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,920
JUDICIAL POLICE OFFICER
KUNIMITSU NOZAWA

588
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,824
<i>I tried to question people
who were involved in the case, but…</i>

589
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,526
This is Nishimura.

590
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,528
May I speak with Mr. Aoki the attorney?

591
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,165
My name is Nishimura
from the Yokohama District Office.

592
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,699
Is Mr. Takezawa there?

593
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,934
Nagoya District Office?

594
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,104
My name is Nishimura
from the Yokohama District Office.

595
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,446
<i>Nobody was willing to talk to me.</i>

596
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,015
<i>Time went by without any results.</i>

597
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,419
<i>Kana Kana, come here.</i>

598
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,558
Daddy's job is to be committed
to what I believe is justice.

599
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,174
Do you feel any pain or swelling?

600
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,843
No.

601
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,479
How about here?

602
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,081
A little.

603
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,584
All right.

604
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,520
How's your overall condition? Any fatigue?

605
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,356
Not particularly.

606
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,293
You said you first felt something was off
when you were overseas.

607
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,863
Did you get the same diagnosis?

608
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,431
Yes.

609
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,003
They said I had gallbladder cancer.

610
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,077
When the name of a juvenile criminal
is made public,

611
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,248
losing the opportunity for correction
may be a human rights violation.

612
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,219
We must be careful not to obstruct
the healthy growth and correction…

613
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,032
Are you Mr. Yuki Umeda
from the Atore law firm?

614
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,735
Uh, yes.

615
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,638
Do you have a minute to talk?

616
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,711
How should we proceed with your treatment?

617
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,115
If you're staying around here for a while,

618
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,218
it's possible for you
to receive treatment at this hospital.

619
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,721
Let me think about it.

620
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,890
I see.

621
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,827
If you're starting treatment,
I think the sooner the better.

622
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,329
I understand.

623
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,469
By the way, this might sound strange but

624
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,840
did you attend Shinano University?

625
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,779
Yes, I did.

626
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,017
Actually, I went there too.

627
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:11,221
So did my fiancée.

628
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,857
Really?

629
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,292
Yes.

630
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,029
My fiancée's name is Kanade Nishimura.

631
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,411
It looks like you've decided
to stay on as a prosecutor.

632
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,148
Try meeting this person.

633
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,753
He should know the most about your father.

634
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,792
RYUICHI NIIZATO

635
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,307
-Are you Mr. Niizato?
-Yes.

636
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,242
I'm Kanade Nishimura.

637
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,846
I'm the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji.

638
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,348
My, you've become quite impressive.

639
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:19,256
You might not remember,
but we've met a few times

640
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,493
before your father's death

641
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,228
and after as well.

642
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,163
Oh, I didn't know.

643
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,966
I appreciate your help.

644
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,305
<i>Did you happen to meet</i>

645
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,207
the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji recently?

646
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,354
Subtitle translation by: Ikuko Sachs

647
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,157
He died to prevent
the truth from coming out.

648
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,291
It can't end this way!

649
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,626
What's the matter with you?

650
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,162
This was clearly done
by an out-of-control prosecution.

651
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,329
-We need to talk.
-Come in.

652
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,331
Goodbye, Kanade.

653
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,366
I…

654
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,935
<i>Our destiny.</i>
