1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,741
You're saying

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,543
<i>Kaori was the one who turned the wheel?</i>

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,212
<i>I let go of the wheel.</i>

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,183
It's as if I killed her.

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>I'm the one who told Kaori
about the corruption case.</i>

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,922
<i>It was me.</i>

7
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>Both Tomo and Masaki were still living
under the weight of Kaori's death.</i>

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,796
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

9
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,999
<i>Mr. Nogi is a former prosecutor.</i>

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,768
<i>He was my father's colleague?</i>

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,937
<i>If he framed your father in some way,</i>

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,073
I'll never forgive him.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,641
I'll do the investigation.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,610
<i>We don't know the truth yet.</i>

15
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:47,147
<i>Why did she tell you
my father had been murdered?</i>

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,249
Are you Mr. Yuki Umeda?

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,518
Do you have a minute to talk?

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,321
Try meeting this person.

19
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,824
He should know the most about your father.

20
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,626
I'm the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji.

21
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,261
You've become quite impressive.

22
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,107
Did you attend Shinano University?

23
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,776
Yes, I did.

24
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,782
Actually, I went there too.
So did my fiancée.

25
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,152
Really?

26
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,320
Yes.

27
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,690
My fiancée's name is Kanade Nishimura.

28
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,827
Do you know her?

29
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,168
I do.

30
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,240
She was one of…

31
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,243
the group of friends I had long ago.

32
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,247
She's my friend.

33
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,917
I see.

34
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,987
Wow.

35
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,058
I think she's lucky to be…

36
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,296
getting married to a doctor like you.

37
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,967
Well, thank you.

38
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,370
I hope you…

39
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,542
take good care of Kanade.

40
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,520
Thank you for waiting.

41
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,891
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule.

42
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:38,791
My pleasure.

43
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,063
I wanted to ask you about

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,434
the environmental energy corruption case
my father was involved in.

45
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,903
Shall we talk outside?

46
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,171
Yes?

47
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,705
We should leave this place.

48
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:56,876
Yes.

49
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,730
The reason why… Masaki came back?

50
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,801
Did Masaki say anything to you?

51
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,904
Um… Not in particular.

52
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,611
Uh… Well, there was one thing.

53
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,450
There was a memorial service
for a friend from the university.

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,452
He came back for that.

55
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,187
For Ms. Kaori Oikawa?

56
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,288
Yes. Uh…

57
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,926
Was there anything else he said?

58
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,094
For instance,

59
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,266
about Mr. Eisuke Tsuji,
who is Ms. Kanade Nishimura's father?

60
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,940
Pardon me for saying this, but Mr. Umeda,

61
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,410
I've heard that you are experiencing

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,813
some hardships at the moment.

63
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,151
I can help you if you would like.

64
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,157
No, thank you.

65
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,961
It wouldn't be appropriate
for me to ask anything of you, Mr. Nogi.

66
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,070
I reported directly to your father

67
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,376
on the special investigation squad
of the Tokyo District Office at the time.

68
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,310
Yes.

69
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,579
However…

70
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,451
Unfortunately,

71
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,189
there is nothing that I can tell you
about that time.

72
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,891
Does that mean

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,061
that there is nothing you know?

74
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,531
After that case,

75
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,167
I resigned from being a prosecutor.

76
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,438
I did it because I no longer knew
the meaning of the profession.

77
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,175
The meaning of…
the profession of a prosecutor?

78
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,346
What had I worked so hard for?

79
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,715
Why did Mr. Tsuji have to die?

80
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,453
If a prosecutor must pursue the truth,
and commit to justice, then why…

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,159
That's all I can say.

82
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,031
Please excuse me.

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,303
Oh. Wait a moment, please.

84
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,340
Um, can you think of anything

85
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,910
that would help me
learn more about that time?

86
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,878
Anything besides the court records?

87
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,951
You surely are the daughter of Mr. Tsuji.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,522
He was taking notes.

89
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,924
Notes?

90
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,626
He had notebooks for keeping records.

91
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,862
Where are they now?

92
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,733
When I resigned as a prosecutor,
I burned them all.

93
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,502
Which means…

94
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,271
that is it.

95
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,612
I have just one thing I want to tell you.

96
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,147
Yes.

97
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,152
I believe Mr. Tsuji did not want
to turn away from the truth.

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,856
That's why he chose death.

99
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,360
He died to prevent
the truth from coming out.

100
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,011
<i>"He died to prevent
the truth from coming out."</i>

101
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,213
<i>That's what he said.</i>

102
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,682
<i>The truth was contained.</i>

103
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,887
<i>Which means the truth must exist
contained somewhere.</i>

104
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>If it does exist…</i>

105
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,490
Ms. Nishimura.

106
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,796
It's time to interview the witness.

107
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,767
Y-Yes. Thank you.

108
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,104
Are you feeling tired recently?

109
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,505
Why?

110
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,141
You were lost in your thoughts completely.

111
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,713
Anyway, why are witness interviews
always on weekends?

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,550
I still haven't gotten that paid day off
you promised me.

113
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,321
I wonder why I have to work so hard.

114
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,690
I don't get rewarded
no matter how much I try.

115
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:41,394
All I do is listen to people
and record what they say.

116
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,329
He was taking notes.

117
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,231
He had notebooks for keeping records.

118
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,368
Hello? Are you listening?

119
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,571
In my own way, I'm trying to protest

120
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,507
to improve my working conditions.

121
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,009
Taking notes…

122
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,019
You met my dad? Where?

123
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,889
At a bar association seminar.

124
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,393
Oh yeah, he gave me this to give to you.
His business card.

125
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,229
ATTORNEY
KOICHIRO NOGI

126
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,034
And he asked me
for your contact information.

127
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,236
Did you give it to him?

128
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,137
I'm really sorry.

129
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,572
I couldn't say no.

130
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,544
So if your father calls you,
don't be surprised.

131
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,914
I don't mind.

132
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,415
Huh? You don't?

133
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,919
It's not like I'm hiding.

134
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,256
And I have a ton of questions to ask him.

135
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,395
Did he say anything else?

136
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,299
No, I don't think he did…

137
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,105
You know Yuki,
you're not cut out to be a lawyer.

138
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,373
Why?

139
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,810
You'd better not cheat on Tomo.
She'd find out so fast and beat you up.

140
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,747
I'd never do such a dangerous thing!

141
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,520
How's Tomo doing since that time?

142
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,389
Surprisingly well.

143
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,892
She's just being a normal mom like before.

144
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,327
I'm glad.

145
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,531
Take good care of them.

146
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,099
Both Tomo

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,734
and your son.

148
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,370
Of course, I know that.

149
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,875
So.

150
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,312
How are you doing with Kanade?

151
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,881
You know there can't be anything going on.

152
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,815
She's engaged.

153
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,916
I heard.

154
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,718
Even so,

155
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,990
there's something about my dad
that has to be cleared up.

156
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,560
It needs to be.

157
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,937
Hey.

158
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,642
Did you lose a little weight, Masaki?

159
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,078
Hmm? No.

160
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,748
-My weight hasn't changed.
-Yeah?

161
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,819
Sitting here like this…

162
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,989
reminds me of our university days.

163
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,757
Does it?

164
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,795
We had so much free time in those days.

165
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,498
Yeah, we did.

166
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,750
<i>Sorry to text you at work.
I'm going to Nagano today.</i>

167
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,426
<i>Nagano? From now?</i>

168
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,664
<i>Yes. I might be a little late tonight.</i>

169
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,968
<i>Got it. I'm on-call tonight anyway
so it's all right.</i>

170
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,937
<i>Hang in there.</i>

171
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,550
NISHIMURA

172
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,279
He was taking notes.

173
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,381
He had notebooks for keeping records.

174
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,119
Kanade.

175
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,289
-If you were going to come--
-Mom.

176
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,092
Did you ever see Dad write a diary?

177
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,293
Or take notes?

178
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,261
Notes? Why?

179
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,899
Kanade. I told you.

180
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,834
You should stop--

181
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,236
It can't end this way! Not like this.

182
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,438
What's the matter with you?

183
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,642
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,783
Mom.

185
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,487
There's something…

186
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,125
I've been wanting to ask you.

187
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,331
It's something I couldn't ask before

188
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,967
though I wanted to.

189
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,674
What?

190
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,047
What do you think

191
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,618
of Dad's suicide?

192
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:12,158
Do you think that Dad actually
did something to get arrested?

193
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,960
Did he tell you anything?

194
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,765
Nothing at all?

195
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,203
He didn't tell me anything.

196
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,639
But,

197
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,775
I don't believe what the public
accused him of doing either.

198
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,013
Then…

199
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,084
why did you get a divorce?

200
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,488
Because your father wanted it.

201
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,324
-To protect us--
-But…

202
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,495
he always stayed
in the study in those days.

203
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,832
He looked so troubled,
absorbed in thought.

204
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,400
Then why…

205
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,074
<i>That was…</i>

206
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,683
Kanade.

207
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,068
I found it.

208
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,344
<i>From May 22, 2003 to September 7, 2004.</i>

209
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,248
<i>The dates corresponded from the day
the corruption case was exposed</i>

210
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,451
<i>to the day my father died in the morning.</i>

211
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,513
Please come in.

212
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,359
Take a seat here.

213
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,194
Okay.

214
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,098
Sorry to make you come over.

215
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,370
But this needed to be private
so no one would hear us.

216
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,345
My father

217
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,981
left a recording.

218
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,252
Did you listen to it?

219
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,062
I wanted you to listen with me.

220
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,889
<i>This is a record of the 2003
environmental energy corruption case.</i>

221
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,259
May, 2003.

222
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,463
An allegation has surfaced
that Diet member Shotaro Azuma

223
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,632
accepted funding of 20 million yen

224
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,869
<i>from Yamagami Heavy Industries,
a heavy equipment manufacturer.</i>

225
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>It was said to be a kickback
in return for accommodating</i>

226
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:53,812
<i>the subsidy of 200 million yen
for energy businesses to Yamagami.</i>

227
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,550
<i>We at the special investigation squad
started the investigation immediately.</i>

228
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,320
<i>I was the prosecutor in charge.</i>

229
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,221
<i>Eisuke Tsuji.</i>

230
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,756
Bribery must be verified.

231
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,626
<i>The Tokyo District
Public Prosecutors Office today…</i>

232
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,528
<i>The investigation proceeded smoothly.</i>

233
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,964
<i>About a month after the allegation
was exposed,</i>

234
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>we arrested Diet member Azuma
and the vice president of Yamagami.</i>

235
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,740
<i>However, the interrogation
faced serious challenges.</i>

236
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,109
No such fact exists.

237
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,813
Then I will ask you once again.

238
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,718
<i>July 3rd.
Ten days had passed since the arrests.</i>

239
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,921
<i>We could not get a confession.
Our superiors were getting frustrated.</i>

240
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,990
<i>Since we had arrested a politician,</i>

241
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,292
<i>we couldn't allow the case
to be dismissed.</i>

242
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,095
<i>July 5th.</i>

243
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:48,333
<i>We suddenly obtained a piece
of conclusive evidence in the case.</i>

244
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,436
Take a look at this, sir.

245
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:51,870
What is it?

246
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,240
An image of an e-mail that
Azuma's secretary sent to a bureaucrat.

247
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,309
To a bureaucrat?

248
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:02,848
<i>The e-mail was from Azuma's secretary
instructing the bureaucrat on the subsidy.</i>

249
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,085
<i>This objective evidence
was the most important.</i>

250
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,954
-This is great!
<i>-The whole team was excited.</i>

251
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,490
<i>We were elated believing
the indictment was certain.</i>

252
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,161
<i>However, the source of the image
was not clear.</i>

253
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,397
<i>Why now?</i>

254
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,366
<i>Who was the leaker? How did it get here?</i>

255
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,772
<i>July 7th. Interrogation of the secretary.</i>

256
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,575
Do you recall this e-mail?

257
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,477
Yes.

258
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,379
I sent it to Mr. Mega.

259
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:39,284
<i>He quickly admitted to sending the e-mail
as directed by Diet member Azuma.</i>

260
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,719
<i>However…</i>

261
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,655
Do you think so too, Mr. Tsuji?

262
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,091
It feels like it's too good
to be true, doesn't it?

263
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,228
E-mail evidence at this point in time.

264
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,597
The secretary easily admits.

265
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,833
The channel of acquisition
is a bit of a mystery.

266
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,436
It does feel like something isn't right.

267
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,106
It's better to be careful
at a time like this, especially when

268
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,842
politicians are involved.

269
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,112
But it's difficult when the director
already gave it the green light.

270
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,882
Even so, it's dangerous
to indict so easily.

271
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,620
<i>July 10th.
I offered my opinion to my superior.</i>

272
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,687
<i>However,</i>

273
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>I was instructed to indict
since no problem existed.</i>

274
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,193
It's dangerous to indict
without further inquiry.

275
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,129
Couldn't you let us
take more time to verify the evidence?

276
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,133
We have sufficient evidence now.

277
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,701
It should be enough.

278
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,304
Extract a confession
and indict him without delay.

279
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,044
<i>July 14th.
I offered my opinion repeatedly,</i>

280
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,712
<i>but it was rejected.</i>

281
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,849
<i>July 15th.</i>

282
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:48,453
<i>Diet member Shotaro Azuma
and the vice president of Yamagami</i>

283
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,255
<i>were charged with bribery.</i>

284
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,424
<i>This was covered in the news extensively.</i>

285
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,964
From here on, it's the trial.

286
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:00,999
Are you ready?

287
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,035
My dad is going to be in it…

288
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:04,970
Isn't he?

289
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,888
<i>September 9th. The first day of the trial.</i>

290
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,357
<i>The attorney for Diet member Azuma</i>

291
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,292
<i>was Koichiro Nogi.</i>

292
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,795
<i>We met for the first time in 15 years.</i>

293
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,266
TOKYO HIGH COURT
TOKYO DISTRICT COURT

294
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,002
Mr. Tsuji.

295
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,341
It's been so long.

296
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,410
Yes, it has.
I heard you've become independent.

297
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,212
It's only a small law firm.

298
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,982
Let's both try our best for this case.

299
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,751
Don't be too hard on me, okay?

300
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,925
First of all, I have a question.

301
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,429
Regarding the charges in the indictment,

302
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,366
is there anything in it you object to?

303
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,868
I am innocent.

304
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,773
I swear to God I did not do
what I'm charged with.

305
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,676
Does counsel have a statement?

306
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,678
Yes.

307
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,650
First of all,
I'd like to appeal to the judge

308
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,154
that this case is clearly fabricated.

309
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,225
The e-mail that the prosecution
submitted as evidence

310
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,960
is completely fake.

311
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,264
It is clear that somebody
fabricated the e-mail.

312
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,338
The prosecution indicted
while intentionally knowing this fact.

313
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,042
This was obviously done
by an out-of-control prosecution,

314
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,311
and is a misuse of state power.

315
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:58,016
<i>Fabrication? By the prosecution?
Intentionally?</i>

316
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,120
<i>Nogi's method was too aggressive.</i>

317
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,589
<i>Although…</i>

318
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,693
<i>the e-mail had been
puzzling from the start.</i>

319
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,265
<i>October 7th. The second day of the trial.</i>

320
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,167
<i>Questioning the secretary.</i>

321
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,202
The counsel will ask a question.

322
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,440
You said the prosecutor, Mr. Tsuji,
coerced your statement.

323
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,710
Can you explain specifically?

324
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,378
I was shown the e-mail.

325
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,547
He said that I must have sent it.

326
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,751
When I answered I'd never seen it before,

327
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,789
he grabbed me by the collar
and said, "Don't lie."

328
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,628
The one who forced your statement
was Mr. Tsuji, the prosecutor in charge.

329
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,997
Are you sure of that?

330
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:46,898
Yes.

331
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,378
November 13th.

332
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,748
The third day of the trial.
Questioning the bureaucrat.

333
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,085
The bureaucrat also reversed
his previous statement.

334
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,624
<i>December 15th.</i>

335
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,695
<i>The fourth day of the trial.
I'm called for a witness examination.</i>

336
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,167
When did the special investigation squad
obtain the e-mail as evidence?

337
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,102
It was on July 5th.

338
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:28,206
Hadn't the cell phone
previously been submitted as evidence?

339
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,409
It was voluntarily submitted.

340
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,512
However, the e-mails had been deleted.

341
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,948
Then how did you obtain
the deleted e-mail on July 5th?

342
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,285
An informant provided it
to the special investigation squad.

343
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,587
How did you determine if the information

344
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,723
was genuine or not?

345
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,460
We checked with the secretary
who had sent the email.

346
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,438
Can you tell me the date and time
when it was sent?

347
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,579
FROM MASATAKA KATO
TO KENICHI MEGA (METI)

348
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,782
It was sent on February 10th, at 2:22 p.m.

349
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,984
On that day at that time,

350
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,455
the secretary was undergoing
a complete medical checkup

351
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,424
at the Aoba University Hospital
according to their records.

352
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,594
Since cell phones are not allowed
in the endoscopy room,

353
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,796
he couldn't have used his cell phone.

354
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,204
It is inconceivable
that the secretary sent the e-mail.

355
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,006
Mr. Tsuji.

356
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,780
Didn't the prosecution decide to indict
even while knowing that the e-mail

357
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,715
had been fabricated by a third party?

358
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,651
That's not true.

359
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,856
The secretary stated
that he sent the e-mail himself.

360
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,992
In the witness examination, he said

361
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,128
you showed him this image
and threatened him.

362
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,965
That is categorically false.

363
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,100
The assistant officer was there.

364
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,037
You intimidated him
when the assistant officer left the room.

365
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,373
That's what he says.

366
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,310
<i>Why is this witness changing his story?</i>

367
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,113
<i>Was it entirely a setup?</i>

368
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,715
Mr. Tsuji.

369
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,887
Wasn't the prosecution too overzealous
in their huge opportunity

370
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,689
of arresting a sitting Diet member?

371
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:30,195
That's why you wanted
supporting evidence by any means.

372
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,231
<i>Nogi is undoubtedly
targeting the prosecution…</i>

373
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,132
<i>No…</i>

374
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,535
<i>he is targeting me.</i>

375
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,904
And Mr. Tsuji,

376
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,840
to achieve results
as the prosecutor in charge,

377
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,242
you wanted to indict
Diet member Azuma at any cost!

378
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,045
Isn't that right?

379
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,816
<i>Koichiro Nogi was
my colleague in the past.</i>

380
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,285
<i>He's a talented individual.</i>

381
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,922
<i>Did he frame me to win the case?</i>

382
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,091
<i>But is that possible?</i>

383
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,827
This should not be forgiven.

384
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,163
The prosecution's authority
has been diminished.

385
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,198
They jumped the gun completely.

386
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,099
It is outrageous.

387
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:13,338
I expect an appropriate response
as necessary by lawyers and prosecutors.

388
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,149
<i>August 17th. The judgment.</i>

389
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,784
<i>I will render my decision now.</i>

390
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,621
Text of the judgment.
I find the defendant not guilty.

391
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,426
Next, my opinions for the judgment.

392
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,595
<i>Diet member Azuma was found not guilty.</i>

393
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,136
Kanade…

394
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,806
<i>September 1st.</i>

395
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,708
<i>Surrounded by enemies.</i>

396
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,211
<i>Arrest rumors
for the prosecutor in charge.</i>

397
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,682
<i>To take responsibility, I will probably
be given a disciplinary dismissal.</i>

398
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>The organization has forsaken me.</i>

399
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,241
<i>I don't have any supporters left now.</i>

400
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,712
<i>My colleagues became silent and distant.</i>

401
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,684
<i>Where was that organization I had trusted?</i>

402
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,620
<i>I swear I didn't fabricate the case.</i>

403
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,757
<i>But is the truth going to be buried?</i>

404
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,928
<i>Where is the justice I had believed in?</i>

405
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,805
<i>September 7th.</i>

406
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,207
<i>Despair.</i>

407
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,080
I can't escape being arrested and charged.

408
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,283
The only thing I can do now

409
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,186
is to reveal the truth in this way.

410
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,258
It doesn't matter if anyone
discovers this recording.

411
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,896
This is my commitment to justice.

412
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,735
<i>The only ones I want to know about this</i>

413
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,137
<i>are my family.</i>

414
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>Kana Kana, come here.</i>

415
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,213
Daddy's job is to be committed
to what I believe is justice.

416
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,720
<i>Someday</i>

417
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:17,989
<i>the time will come.</i>

418
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,527
I want Kanade to know…

419
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,765
the truth about her father.

420
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,607
Goodbye…

421
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,409
Kanade.

422
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,481
<i>I'm not asking you to forgive me.</i>

423
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,317
<i>It's okay if you hate me.</i>

424
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,756
But your father…

425
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,566
In order to commit

426
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,737
to his sense of justice,

427
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,140
he devoted himself

428
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,277
to recording the truth in this way.

429
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,125
So it was my dad after all.

430
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,475
I didn't know if I should have
let you listen to it or not.

431
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,746
But this…

432
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,351
is the truth I discovered.

433
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,324
Once, when I was a child,

434
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,860
I asked my father,

435
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,864
"What is your job?"

436
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,935
Then…

437
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,907
he said it's to be committed to justice.

438
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,012
But…

439
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,117
I wish he would have kept on living
no matter what happened.

440
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,788
I wish he'd lived
and we could laugh together

441
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,760
and speak with each other once more.

442
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,429
Because…

443
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,666
whatever crime he was accused of,

444
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,402
he is still my father.

445
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,273
Kanade…

446
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
You and I should…

447
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,035
stop meeting each other.

448
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,087
I understand.

449
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,025
<i>We would never see each other again.</i>

450
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,360
<i>As it should be.</i>

451
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:55,066
<i>It's our destiny.</i>

452
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,377
Masaki?

453
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,920
-What's the matter? Are you all right?
-I'll be okay.

454
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,956
Hey, really?

455
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,826
Oh no! Maybe I… should call an ambulance.

456
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,596
If I stay still, I'll get better.

457
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,833
But… Uh…

458
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,103
Well, you know.
I deserve it for being bad all the time.

459
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,038
Don't say things like that.

460
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,842
Hang on. Don't move.

461
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,918
TAKASHI

462
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,755
Hang in there.

463
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,499
Kanade.

464
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:02,967
Takashi.

465
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,235
Mr. Nogi.

466
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,237
Where does it hurt?

467
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,308
From my right side…

468
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,643
to my back.

469
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,312
-To the treatment room.
-Yes.

470
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,381
500 mL saline solution.
We need pentazocine too.

471
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,416
-Yes.
-Get them ready.

472
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,017
We're going now.

473
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,155
-When did he start feeling pain?
-Umm…

474
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,224
Right before I called.
About 40 minutes ago.

475
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,359
-Has he been in pain since then?
-Yeah.

476
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,828
Where did it start?

477
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,165
At… home.

478
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,969
Our apartment?

479
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,044
Doctor.

480
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,854
EMERGENCY RECEPTION

481
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,109
It's all right. The sedative is working.

482
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,746
Thank you.

483
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,151
Can we talk?

484
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,987
Huh?

485
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,489
Let's talk over there.

486
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,080
What's going on?

487
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,182
What?

488
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,817
I'm just asking.

489
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,554
What's going on between you two?

490
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,459
Well…

491
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,498
I don't exactly know where to start, but…

492
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,671
He's a friend from university, and…

493
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,275
I-I thought I told you about him before.

494
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,111
A classmate named Kaori
was in a car accident.

495
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,980
He's the one who was missing afterward.

496
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:32,917
And…

497
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,686
there was something

498
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,458
having to do with my father
we had to talk about.

499
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,062
About your father?

500
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,604
That's why I invited him to the apartment.

501
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,209
I didn't want anybody else
to hear our conversation.

502
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,980
Anybody else?

503
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,116
Yes.

504
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,289
Was it… something…

505
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,426
you didn't want me to hear either?

506
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,299
I'm…

507
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,271
I'm…

508
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,375
I intend to marry you.

509
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,979
I wanted to.

510
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:38,816
I…

511
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,054
I've never betrayed you even once.

512
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,760
But…

513
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,630
what you're doing is…

514
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,037
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,674
I'm truly sorry.

516
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,044
You have to remember

517
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,349
that you're the one who's important to me.

518
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,653
Back then after Kaori's accident,

519
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,289
you're the one
who helped me get back on my feet.

520
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,560
After that, we've spent
more than ten years together.

521
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,166
I used to go out with him.

522
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,268
B-But now,

523
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,104
he's just a friend.

524
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,006
I won't meet him anymore.

525
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,675
I don't want to meet him.

526
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,095
Good morning.

527
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,098
You're still up?

528
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,901
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

529
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,203
Aren't you going to work today?

530
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,606
I am, but…

531
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,051
Hey.

532
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,426
I want you to listen to this
when you have time.

533
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,063
What is it?

534
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:09,733
It's my father's.

535
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,039
He recorded his views of that case

536
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,108
until he committed suicide.

537
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,414
We were listening to this.

538
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,784
Why?

539
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,086
Because

540
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,492
Masaki's father is mentioned
in the recording.

541
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,774
There's one thing

542
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,378
I need to tell you, Kanade.

543
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,082
What?

544
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:01,886
He has cancer.

545
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,922
He's actually critically ill.

546
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,427
I think he should
begin treatment immediately.

547
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,134
How did you…

548
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,607
Because I'm his…

549
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,443
attending physician.

550
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:40,124
NOGI

551
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,741
<i>Is this Masaki?</i>

552
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,877
Yes.

553
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,079
I'm in front of the house.

554
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:04,882
We need to talk.

555
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,259
Come in.

556
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,998
Hey you. What are you doing here?

557
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,471
I…

558
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,841
set the fire.

559
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,054
TAKASHI

560
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,792
Hello.

561
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,595
<i>Kanade. It was just reported on the news</i>

562
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,799
<i>that Masaki's father's house is on fire.</i>

563
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,700
What?

564
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,736
<i>What's more, they're saying it was arson.</i>

565
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,139
<i>And that Masaki was the one who did it.</i>

566
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,175
What?

567
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:44,548

<i>Do you affirm that you
set the house on fire?</i>

569
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,152
<i>I did it.</i>

<i>Arson? What's happening?</i>

571
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,555
<i>I wonder if he did it for you.</i>

572
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,891
<i>-Just for that…
-Did you follow his instructions?</i>

573
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:54,925
<i>I'm remaining silent.</i>

574
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,427
<i>I want to know the truth.</i>

575
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,429
<i>I'll find out in my own way.</i>
