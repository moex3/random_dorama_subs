1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,208
I'll do the investigation.

2
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,109
Huh?

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,412
<i>Why did she tell you
my father had been murdered?</i>

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,715
<i>If he framed your father in some way,</i>

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,884
I'll never forgive him.

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:20,954
I found it.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,723
My father left a recording.

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,658
I wanted you to listen with me.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,263
<i>This is a record of the environmental
energy corruption case.</i>

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,867
This case is clearly fabricated.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>The e-mail that the prosecution
submitted as evidence</i>

12
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>is completely fake.</i>

13
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,908
<i>Why is this witness changing his story?</i>

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,910
<i>Was it entirely a setup?</i>

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,112
So it was my dad after all.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,948
You and I should stop meeting each other.

17
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,583
Masaki?

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,786
What's the matter?

19
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,320
Hang on.

20
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,891
Takashi.

21
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,060
What's going on between you two?

22
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,995
I won't meet him anymore.

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,496
I don't want to meet him.

24
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,465
He has cancer.

25
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,667
He's actually critically ill.

26
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,803
We need to talk.

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:10,837
Come in.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,481
Hey you.

29
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,116
I…

30
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,852
set the fire.

31
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,197
So you're saying you did it.

32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,132
Is this correct?

33
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,036
Yes.

34
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,071
I did it.

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,210
<i>Just after ten last night,
here in Mizuho Ward, Yokohama,</i>

36
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,313
<i>there was a fire at the residence
of attorney, Koichiro Nogi.</i>

37
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,616
<i>His unemployed son, Masaki,
who was near the site</i>

38
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,886
<i>admitted to setting fire to the house
and was arrested at the scene.</i>

39
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,754
I listened to the voice recorder.

40
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,756
Yeah.

41
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,161
I wonder if he did it for you.

42
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,365
For your father.

43
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:19,839
<i>Regarding the fire that occurred
in Mizuho-ku, Yokohama last night.</i>

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,077
<i>According to the police,
at the time of the fire,</i>

45
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,248
<i>only Mr. Nogi and his son
were present in the house.</i>

46
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,051
<i>The police are investigating the motive--</i>

47
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,754
Arson? What's happening?

48
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,360
If that's Kanagawa Prefecture,
then it's Yokohama District.

49
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,861
-I should call Kanade.
-You shouldn't.

50
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,762
Why?

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,932
Even if she finds out something,

52
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,268
she has a duty to be confidential.

53
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,204
She can't tell us anything.

54
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,541
What if his father dies as a consequence?

55
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,877
Would it be arson-homicide?

56
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,412
It would be arson

57
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,714
and a murder charge.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,683
Both.

59
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,086
Good morning.

60
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,722
You're up already?

61
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,526
Whoa, I didn't realize how late it was.

62
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,761
Go wash your face.

63
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,763
Get ready to go. Hurry!

64
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,698
Yeah… I'll hurry…

65
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,166
Huh? Where's your dad?

66
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,651
Stop there.

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,424
Excuse me.

68
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,659
What?

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,929
What will happen to me after this?

70
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,100
You'll be referred to the district
public prosecutors office shortly

71
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,002
to decide if you'll be detained.

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,906
If you're detained, it'll take ten days
to decide if you're indicted or not.

73
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,975
Or 20 days maximum.

74
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,145
The interrogation will be long.

75
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,815
Try to organize it in your head now.

76
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,692
-Come in.
-Pardon me, ma'am.

77
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,567
I want you to take this case.

78
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,337
Me?

79
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,006
It's my order as the branch chief.

80
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,145
CASE OF NOGI RESIDENCE ARSON

81
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,713
ARSON OF INHABITED BUILDINGS

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,148
MASAKI NOGI
BORN JUNE 12, 1989

83
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm Nishimura, the prosecutor.

84
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,167
You have the right to remain silent
if you don't wish to speak.

85
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,170
You were arrested for the crime
of arson of inhabited buildings.

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,014
Please confirm. First, your name…

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,889
Mr. Masaki Nogi, aged 35.

88
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,425
Place of birth, Yokohama.

89
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,559
Currently unemployed.

90
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,336
Do you affirm these facts
I've read as being true?

91
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,642
Is this all correct?

92
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,016
<i>I wanted to know the truth.</i>

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,086
<i>That was the sole reason
I wanted to become a prosecutor.</i>

94
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,688
<i>To achieve results
as the prosecutor in charge,</i>

95
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,257
<i>you wanted to indict
Diet member Azuma at any cost!</i>

96
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,525
<i>Kanade.</i>

97
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,761
<i>I love you.</i>

98
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,197
So it was my dad after all.

99
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,799
<i>You and I should stop meeting each other.</i>

100
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,009
<i>That's why I am now…</i>

101
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,596
I'm Nishimura, the prosecutor.

102
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,698
Nice to meet you.

103
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,080
THE FIRST INTERROGATION

104
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,515
Today you have been referred

105
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,986
on the crime of arson
of inhabited buildings.

106
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,024
Do you affirm that you set the fire?

107
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,899
I did it.

108
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,308
I'd like to verify your actions
on the day of the arson.

109
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,177
Yes.

110
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,145
The night before,

111
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,415
you were admitted to Minato
General Hospital in Yokohama

112
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,484
<i>as an emergency with stomach pain.</i>

113
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,520
You left the hospital
after 9:00 the next day.

114
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,189
Yes.

115
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,090
<i>Then you walked around Yokohama,</i>

116
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,892
<i>and at 5:40 p.m.</i>

117
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,563
<i>you called your father, Mr. Koichiro Nogi,
on your cell phone.</i>

118
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,299
-Come in.
<i>-Then you went to his house.</i>

119
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,137
I did.

120
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,139
That day, your mother…

121
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,577
She is not your birth mother, is she?

122
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,946
She's my father's second wife.

123
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,149
<i>So on that day,
your stepmother and your sister</i>

124
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,751
were in Tokyo
to see a theater performance.

125
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,355
It was only you and Mr. Koichiro Nogi
present at the house.

126
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,857
Yes.

127
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,827
<i>Mr. Nogi invited you into the living room.</i>

128
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,629
<i>The two of you talked.</i>

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,731
<i>Later, it became an argument</i>

130
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,334
<i>and you lost your temper.</i>

131
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,269
<i>There was a lighter on a shelf nearby.</i>

132
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,770
<i>You grabbed it and lit it.</i>

133
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,573
When you threw it towards Mr. Nogi,

134
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,942
the curtains caught
on fire from the flame.

135
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,712
Yes.

136
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:37,717
Then you left the house
with your father still in the room.

137
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,086
Is this all correct?

138
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,154
Yes, that is correct.

139
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,158
I want to ask you something.

140
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,063
What is it?

141
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,734
If you lit the flame
because you lost your temper,

142
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,405
then does it mean you didn't visit
the house with the intent of arson?

143
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,110
I didn't.

144
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,714
Then,

145
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,852
please tell me what you were talking about

146
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,254
and what caused the argument.

147
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,390
What was the conversation
about at the time?

148
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,459
Can I invoke my right to silence?

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,735
Right now, your father

150
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,406
is on the edge between life and death
in the hospital where he was taken.

151
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,942
<i>He's suffering from inhalation burns</i>

152
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,377
<i>and carbon monoxide poisoning
from the fire</i>

153
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,479
<i>which resulted in cerebral hypoxia.</i>

154
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,519
All because

155
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588
you set fire to the house.

156
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,792
How do you feel about this fact?

157
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,530
How… do I feel?

158
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,235
Do you have any feelings of remorse?

159
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,208
Not particularly.

160
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,387
Next, I'd like to ask you
about your actions since then.

161
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,688
According to the police…

162
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,090
<i>On this day,</i>

163
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,826
<i>Masaki didn't say
much of anything in the end.</i>

164
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,161
What about the time
between when you left the house

165
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,464
and when the police officer
asked you questions?

166
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,634
Thanks for your work.

167
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,302
Great job.

168
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,371
We need the pre-indictment
detention request.

169
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,271
Yes.

170
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,273
Are you going somewhere?

171
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,508
To the crime scene.

172
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,542
The crime scene?

173
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,177
Something is bothering me.

174
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,345
I see.

175
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,980
By the way…

176
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,249
Huh? Isn't it still during working hours?

177
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,552
Not that.
It's about Masaki Nogi, the suspect.

178
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,323
Isn't he the one who had that big fight
in the lobby of Yokohama District Court?

179
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,224
What?

180
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,826
You know, after that illegal drug
possession case.

181
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,530
What the hell is this?

182
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,866
You killed Eisuke Tsuji, didn't you?

183
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,504
Kanade, wait!

184
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,538
Let's go, Kaji.

185
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,573
Are you sure?

186
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,944
Yes, he is.

187
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,516
Well, I was wondering if he had
a long-standing feud with his father.

188
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,084
Maybe involving asking for money?

189
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,987
Could be.

190
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,089
I'll keep that in mind too.

191
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,524
-Thank you.
-Yes.

192
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,526
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

193
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,037
<i>I wonder if Kaji noticed </i>

194
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>that Masaki and I know each other?</i>

195
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,421
<i>Even if he knows,</i>

196
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,324
<i>I'll find out in my own way</i>

197
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,359
<i>the truth about this case.</i>

198
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,895
This is Kaji.

199
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,164
Do you have time to talk now?

200
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,903
<i>What was Masaki's…</i>

201
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,273
<i>What was suspect Masaki Nogi's motive?</i>

202
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>Why did he commit arson?</i>

203
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,379
<i>What was the reason
he decided to set the fire?</i>

204
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,017
<i>On the morning of the fire,</i>

205
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,187
<i>Masaki left the hospital,</i>

206
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,322
<i>and walked in the city.</i>

207
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,261
<i>The reason for him visiting his father
must have been the voice recorder. </i>

208
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,696
<i>It must be.</i>

209
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,965
This is the truth I discovered.

210
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,800
So it was my dad after all.

211
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,104
<i>What if he went to the house</i>

212
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,808
<i>with the intention of arson-homicide
from the start?</i>

213
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,877
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

214
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,515
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

215
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,484
<i>would he try to kill so suddenly?</i>

216
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,890
<i>There seems to be a big gap
between his motive and actions.</i>

217
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,198
<i>Then</i><i>just as Masaki said</i>

218
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,635
<i>the two had an argument that night, and…</i>

219
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,636
I've had enough!

220
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,704
<i>Masaki lost his temper.</i>

221
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,973
<i>He lit a lighter he found lying around.</i>

222
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,875
<i>The curtains caught fire from the flame.</i>

223
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,779
A lighter…

224
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,850
Ms. Nishimura.

225
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,419
-Oh, good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

226
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,923
Did the fire start in the living room
as the suspect stated?

227
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,158
We're still trying to determine.

228
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,560
Was the lighter found?

229
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,961
Not yet.

230
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:49,962
I see.

231
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,332
Considering the house
burned down completely,

232
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,167
something is bothering me.

233
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,580
<i>Why did he use a lighter?</i>

234
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,583
<i>What triggered him?</i>

235
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,722
Are you Ms. Nishimura, the prosecutor?

236
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,059
Yes. Thank you
for taking the time to see me.

237
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,664
Is he still in critical condition?

238
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,732
Yes.

239
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,635
He seems to have inhaled
a large amount of carbon monoxide.

240
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,803
A large amount?

241
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,439
The respiratory tract burn is also severe.

242
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,308
There's a possibility he won't wake up.

243
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,144
Is that so?

244
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,914
Of course, we'll try our best, but…

245
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,263
<i>What really happened
between Masaki and his father</i>

246
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,332
<i>on the day of the fire?</i>

247
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,747
Kanade's the prosecutor
in the case against Masaki?

248
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,983
Yeah. That's what I heard.

249
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,318
No way.

250
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,954
Is it going to be okay?

251
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,024
Well, it does sound like a tough job.

252
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,528
Her superiors don't know
about her relationship with Masaki?

253
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,232
I imagine they wouldn't
let her do the job if they knew.

254
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,272
Tomo.

255
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:41,907
I…

256
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,809
What?

257
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,581
I quit the law firm.

258
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,516
Huh?

259
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,619
-Why?
-Actually…

260
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,454
to be precise,

261
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,023
it's like I didn't have a choice
but to quit.

262
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,258
Did you do something bad?

263
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,193
It's not that.

264
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,395
I didn't…

265
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,766
do anything.

266
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,936
My goodness! Don't scare me like that!

267
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,473
It's just that the law firm
was poorly managed.

268
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,875
They started getting strict about quotas.

269
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,179
I'm looking for a job at other law firms.

270
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,715
But I'm having trouble finding one.

271
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,783
So I…

272
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,688
kind of asked--

273
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,727
Check. I don't mind.

274
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,761
Okay.

275
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,869
No way.

276
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,675
International Cultural Law Firm.

277
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,210
They want to interview me.

278
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,480
International Cultural Law Firm?

279
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,181
That's awesome! That's great!

280
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,759
I didn't like my family to start with.

281
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,560
I mean,

282
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,096
I didn't like him.

283
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,832
By "him" you mean your father, right?

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,834
But why so much hatred?

285
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,002
I wonder why myself.

286
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,209
Shoplifting…

287
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,047
Long ago I shoplifted once.

288
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,917
It was from a convenience store,
when I was in junior high.

289
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,387
I was goofing around
with childhood friends.

290
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,258
What did you steal?

291
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,193
Vanilla ice cream.

292
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,700
Trading cards.

293
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,770
I wasn't caught that time,

294
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,108
but my friend shoplifted again
right after that.

295
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,177
And I was suspected.

296
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,848
My dad said to me at the time,

297
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,617
"Whatever they ask you,

298
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,187
don't ever admit you did it."

299
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,791
"Just insist you didn't."

300
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,661
"If you keep denying it,

301
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,896
that'd be the truth."

302
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,468
I realized something at that moment.

303
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,303
<i>I thought, "Oh."</i>

304
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
<i>"I get it."</i>

305
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,307
<i>"So this is</i>

306
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,909
<i>the way he does things."</i>

307
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,682
Did you follow his instructions?

308
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,550
What do you think?

309
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,953
If you did what he told you,

310
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,490
I guess you wouldn't have
this hatred toward your father.

311
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,463
<i>The Nogi family is prominent
in Yokohama, isn't it?</i>

312
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,867
<i>Your grandfather was the founder
of Nikkai Shipbuilding Company.</i>

313
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>Your father is an attorney.</i>

314
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,440
I think ordinary people
would envy your background.

315
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,510
I don't fit in with them
because look at me.

316
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,213
After you dropped out of university,
where did you go?

317
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,301
If you're feeling ill, please tell us.

318
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,270
In that case--

319
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,738
I went to the Tohoku region.

320
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,843
I had an acquaintance there.

321
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,977
An acquaintance?

322
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,646
A tutor

323
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,048
from high school and before college.

324
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,419
They were doing volunteer work in Miyako
after the great earthquake.

325
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,054
Miyako?

326
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,556
Miyako in Iwate Prefecture.

327
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,826
I was there helping
to clear the dirt and so forth.

328
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,997
And you didn't tell anyone
at all about this?

329
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,732
I didn't.

330
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,167
Why?

331
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,969
I wanted to change my ways.

332
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,639
I felt…

333
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,442
like I was totally naive.

334
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,111
About your university days?

335
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,948
Although I got in,

336
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,618
<i>I wasn't attending classes
but just hanging around.</i>

337
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,687
<i>I didn't have any purpose at all.</i>

338
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,989
So you didn't enjoy it there?

339
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,325
I did.

340
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,128
It was the best time…

341
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,098
of my life.

342
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,769
Thinking back now…

343
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,472
that period…

344
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,475
was the happiest time.

345
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>Doing silly things all the time…</i>

346
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,618
<i>but I was happy.</i>

347
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,292
I fell in love there.

348
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,127
Show me.

349
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,463
W-What?

350
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,233
Your answers, so, I, can, cheat.

351
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,136
Law major?

352
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,405
-Yes.
-Me too.

353
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,408
Don't you know me?

354
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,315
Did you have a partner?

355
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,518
Perhaps someone more

356
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,487
than that.

357
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,162
I love you.

358
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,011
Do you know there's a way to hold hands
that can never be separated?

359
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,482
<i>When someone who you thought loved you
suddenly disappears,</i>

360
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,017
it hurts. I know.

361
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,422
Until then, I didn't have

362
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,558
a lot of people
I could open my heart up to.

363
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,294
But when I was with her,

364
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,630
I could be myself naturally.

365
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,701
A minute longer together…

366
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,003
A second longer together…

367
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,840
That's what I was wishing for.

368
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,412
I don't really know what that was.

369
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,984
I think there was
a powerful mutual attraction.

370
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,656
Have you experienced

371
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,892
anything like that?

372
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,105
I have.

373
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,278
Masaki, wait! Don't go! Masaki!

374
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,713
I'm sorry!

375
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,760
Why did you break up with that person?

376
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,264
Maybe because…

377
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,835
I thought it'd be too painful…

378
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,905
to stay together.

379
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,979
I didn't want to see her being sad.

380
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,418
Didn't you tell that person
your honest feelings?

381
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,353
No.

382
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,755
Don't you think that person

383
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,057
would have understood if you had?

384
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,160
It's too complicated.

385
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,861
I was probably…

386
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,065
completely confused about it myself.

387
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,668
So…

388
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,440
I thought I had to disappear.

389
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,953
Didn't you consider

390
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,490
those you abandoned without explanation?

391
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,026
I wasn't considerate enough.

392
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,229
I guess I'm selfish.

393
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,935
Would you say you have impulsive traits?

394
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,339
To want to throw everything away,

395
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,275
wishing everything would be gone?

396
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,744
Do you mean the fire?

397
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,514
No, not just that.

398
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,019
Hey, why are you asking me
so many unrelated questions?

399
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,623
These are not unrelated questions.

400
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,361
Your motive for committing the crime,

401
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,464
your strained relationship
with your father,

402
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,802
whether you regret
what you've done or not…

403
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,005
Our job is to find answers
to these questions.

404
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,175
Whether to indict or not

405
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,777
depends on the decision of the prosecutor.

406
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,214
Your life depends on it.

407
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,150
We can't make the wrong decision.

408
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,088
That's an intense job.

409
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,291
I respect you.

410
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,900
That's right.

411
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,168
I thought at the time

412
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,307
if I could restart with a clean slate,
I might feel so much better.

413
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,845
If I burnt it all down

414
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,648
and everything was gone…

415
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,462
Excuse me.

416
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,298
What is it?

417
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,067
Can I ask you one thing?

418
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,535
Go on.

419
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,339
How is he doing now?

420
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,475
<i>I heard he was still unconscious.</i>

421
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,611
Is he…

422
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,547
going to die?

423
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,317
Nobody knows that.

424
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,218
Including me.

425
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,694
That'll be it for today.

426
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,231
Stand up.

427
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,675
Prosecutor.

428
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,611
Yes.

429
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,113
These handcuffs…

430
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,451
They're so cold.

431
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,687
I just found out.

432
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,025
You're going out now.

433
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,773
YOKOHAMA DISTRICT PUBLIC
PROSECUTORS OFFICE CHUO BRANCH

434
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,174
Yes.

435
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,910
Ms. Nishimura.

436
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,447
I need to talk to you
about what you said the other day.

437
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:30,849
Yes.

438
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,287
New evidence?

439
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,724
Since what you mentioned stuck in my mind,

440
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,394
I searched the garage
in front of the house.

441
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,294
Yes.

442
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,364
CRIME SCENE NOGI RESIDENCE FLOOR PLAN
LIVING ROOM

443
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,467
Look at these.

444
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,238
We found a piece
of a burned-up plastic fuel can.

445
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,542
We also detected gasoline on it.

446
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,576
Gasoline…

447
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,445
Additionally,

448
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,382
there is a new report
from a witness in the neighborhood.

449
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,660
-I'm home.
-Hi.

450
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,529
-Interrogation again today?
-Yeah.

451
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,265
What's this?

452
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,400
It was in our delivery locker.

453
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,469
Tomo brought it for us apparently.

454
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,670
-Tomo did?
-Yeah.

455
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,041
<i>I know you're busy
so I'll just leave this here.</i>

456
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,278
<i>They're in an insulated bag.
Do a sniff test just in case.</i>

457
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,381
<i>You don't need to e-mail me.
Hang in there. Tomo.</i>

458
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,585
We should eat.

459
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,486
Okay.

460
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,621
-I'll go change.
-Okay.

461
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,499
This is comforting.

462
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,968
Yeah. I'm so grateful.

463
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,907
Do they feed people in detention?

464
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,477
What? Of course, they do.

465
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,978
Well…

466
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,517
How long is he…
Masaki going to be in there?

467
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,888
Well, the maximum is 20 days.

468
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,392
Whether he committed the crime or not,

469
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,361
essentially,

470
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,697
I think he should get treatment.

471
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,700
Has it progressed?

472
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,736
From the way he was in pain…

473
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,872
Takashi.

474
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,707
Where does it hurt?

475
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,209
From my right side…

476
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,678
to my back.

477
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,415
I see…

478
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,096
Can you tell me again the situation
of how you started the fire?

479
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,164
THE THIRD INTERROGATION

480
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,433
As I've said many times,
we got into an argument.

481
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,935
I found a lighter on the shelf.

482
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,571
I threw the lighter,
then the curtains caught on fire--

483
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,741
Mr. Koichiro Nogi quit smoking
five years ago.

484
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,310
Other family members
don't recall it being there.

485
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,779
<i>Then who's lighter was it?</i>

486
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,915
Why was it there?

487
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,784
I don't know.

488
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,887
But there was a lighter there.

489
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,592
The lighter was on the shelf
next to the sofa.

490
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,428
<i>When you got into an argument,</i>

491
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,097
<i>you lit the lighter and threw it
towards your father.</i>

492
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,067
<i>The lighter caused the curtains
to catch fire and flare up.</i>

493
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,204
After that, you left your father there

494
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,972
and you fled the scene.

495
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,376
Is that correct?

496
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,511
Yes.

497
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,386
Are you feeling all right?

498
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,323
Huh?

499
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:01,960
Yes.

500
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,628
Are you able to eat?

501
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,563
I'm eating somewhat.

502
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,532
Any fever or listlessness?

503
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,702
If you feel ill in any way,
please inform us.

504
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,103
Prosecutor,

505
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,539
you sound like a doctor.

506
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,712
I feel fine.

507
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,380
Please proceed.

508
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,052
All right.

509
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,625
Actually, as a result
of an inspection of the crime scene,

510
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,729
there's a possibility
the fire started outside of the house.

511
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,668
<i>Near the garage
adjacent to the living room,</i>

512
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,737
<i>we found evidence of a fire breaking out.</i>

513
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,806
<i>There were also traces of gasoline
detected from there.</i>

514
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,946
There is now an eyewitness account
of a man roaming around the area.

515
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,618
These facts don't seem to align
with your statements.

516
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,454
I wanted the fire to grow bigger.

517
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,660
After I left the house,
I spread gasoline around.

518
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,795
Where was the gasoline?

519
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,863
It was in the garage.

520
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,132
Was it something you had prepared?

521
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,199
I'd rather not say.

522
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,304
Then why didn't you tell us before
that you spread gasoline around?

523
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,508
I didn't want it to be
a more serious offense.

524
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,979
Right after setting the fire, you admitted
to a police officer that you did it.

525
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,281
Even though you admitted to the crime,

526
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,184
you wanted to avoid
a more serious offense?

527
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:41,993
Yes.

528
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,662
That's right.

529
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,177
Masaki Nogi is hiding something?

530
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,347
Yes. His statement has
some strange points.

531
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,482
Such as?

532
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,551
First of all,
he says that after an argument

533
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,153
he used a lighter he found
in the room to set the fire.

534
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,424
But his family says Mr. Koichiro Nogi
quit smoking five years ago,

535
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,360
and there was no lighter in the house.

536
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,895
Couldn't Masaki Nogi have had it with him?

537
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,163
I've considered that,

538
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,734
but he's been saying he didn't have
any intention of arson when he went there.

539
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,906
Koichiro is currently in the ICU.

540
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,475
To be injured so seriously,

541
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,910
he must have inhaled
a substantial amount of smoke.

542
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,848
I wondered if he failed to escape
due to trying to put out the fire,

543
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,983
but no fire extinguisher had been used.

544
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:44,222
Also, he had no pre-existing conditions.
No high blood pressure or heart disease.

545
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,661
If Masaki Nogi's statement about setting
the fire in front of Koichiro is true,

546
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,600
Koichiro Nogi could have escaped early on,
in the same way as Masaki did.

547
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,438
But the fact is he didn't make it out,
he's unconscious, in serious condition.

548
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,573
Moreover, the crime scene
inspection revealed

549
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,243
a piece of a burned plastic fuel can
with gasoline traces.

550
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,947
We also have a witness
who saw a suspicious man

551
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,350
roaming near the house
on the night of the fire.

552
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,386
When Masaki Nogi was asked about this,

553
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,089
he began saying things
he hadn't stated before.

554
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,123
What did he say?

555
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,426
"I wanted the fire to grow bigger."

556
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,962
"After I left the house,
I spread gasoline around."

557
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,331
I see.

558
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,934
<i>Right after allegedly committing arson,</i>

559
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,771
<i>Masaki was questioned by a police officer
and easily admitted to his crime.</i>

560
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,974
Then why didn't he mention
the gasoline before?

561
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,312
Is the man the eyewitness saw
and Masaki Nogi the same person?

562
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,315
Still unknown. The Yokohama Minami Police
are investigating now.

563
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,351
That means the arsonist
might be still at large.

564
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,189
There may be another individual
besides his son who holds a grudge

565
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,291
against Koichiro Nogi.

566
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,594
Yes.

567
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,133
Will you allow me to investigate
a little longer?

568
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,267
Understood.

569
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,736
We'll extend the detention.

570
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,637
Yes.

571
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,289
Ms. Nishimura!

572
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,492
Masaki Nogi lost consciousness
in his cell, vomiting blood!

573
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,393
What?

574
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,538
<i>Yes. The medical procedure is done.</i>

575
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,806
<i>We knew he had gallbladder cancer,</i>

576
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,110
but they said it metastasized into
his duodenum and made him vomit blood.

577
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,147
He needs to rest for the time being,
then they would consider surgery.

578
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,016
I see.

579
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,951
We'll stop his detention for a while.

580
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,252
Make the arrangements now.

581
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,454
Yes. I will. Goodbye.

582
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,492
The interrogation is canceled.

583
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:35,993
Okay.

584
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,695
What is the possibility of surgery?

585
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,297
Possibility?

586
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,166
It's just that if he doesn't get surgery,

587
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,702
he may not last long.

588
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,906
When his condition stabilizes,

589
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,509
he'll need it as soon as possible.

590
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,617
You should stay with him.

591
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:04,889
Y-You don't mind?

592
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:06,824
For now…

593
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,327
it's better if someone is with him.

594
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,335
Where am I?

595
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,737
The hospital.

596
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,009
Right.

597
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,647
How do you feel?

598
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,183
Oh, the worst.

599
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,724
The prosecutor's interrogation is a pain.

600
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,539
About my illness…

601
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,108
Did you know?

602
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,645
I heard from your doctor.

603
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,580
I see.

604
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:13,751
Hey.

605
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,288
Did you really set the fire?

606
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,091
You're still asking?

607
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,394
I might vomit blood again.

608
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,231
Okay.

609
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,367
I won't ask for now.

610
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,784
It was so hard.

611
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,323
Kanade.

612
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,593
We were face-to-face for hours.

613
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,928
You were right there…

614
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,498
so close to me.

615
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,868
But you're the prosecutor.

616
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,105
Staring at me with a scary face.

617
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,410
And I even had a rope… around my waist.

618
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,446
That can't be helped.

619
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,382
Hey.

620
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,819
Hold out your hand.

621
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,959
What are you saying?

622
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,461
Here.

623
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,878
It's Kanade's hand.

624
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,516
So soft.

625
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:02,593
Kanade.

626
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,595
Hmm?

627
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:06,797
You asked me…

628
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,902
why I came back to Japan.

629
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,972
Yeah.

630
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,811
You want to know…

631
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,149
the real reason?

632
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,620
Huh? What is it? Tell me.

633
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,090
Kanade.

634
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,062
I wanted to see you.

635
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,700
Of course,

636
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,902
my father…

637
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,540
and Kaori

638
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,343
were part of it too.

639
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,545
But…

640
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,848
you were more important.

641
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,851
When I thought…

642
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,154
I might die soon,

643
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,093
the one I wanted to be with

644
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:11,996
is you, Kanade.

645
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,904
So that's why…

646
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,710
I came back to see you.

647
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,050
But then…

648
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,988
this whole thing happened.

649
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,626
I'm such an idiot.

650
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,233
Why do things

651
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,805
always turn out the wrong way for me?

652
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,543
I guess it's my own fault, huh?

653
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,381
It is all your fault.

654
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,520
The things you do are always messed up.

655
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,125
You're selfish.

656
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,428
You do as you please.

657
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,064
And you're self-righteous.

658
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,567
You've always been that way.

659
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,405
And you just go away
without telling anybody.

660
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,408
It's the same even now.

661
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,351
Kanade.

662
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,560
Want to run away?

663
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,535
Let's run away.

664
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,439
Just the two of us.

665
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,812
I want to be with you.

666
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,350
I want to see that starry sky…

667
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,987
with you alone.

668
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,952
<i>That was the second crime…</i>

669
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,757
<i>I ever committed.</i>

670
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,227

<i>I don't mind dying
if I'm with you, Kanade.</i>

672
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,832
<i>Masaki Nogi is missing?</i>

673
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,067
I have a question.

674
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,268
You're hiding something.

675
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,169
Masaki.

676
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,904
<i>What's the truth?</i>

677
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,239
<i>-It was recorded on the dashcam.
-What?</i>

678
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,242
<i>What were you doing
in front of the house that day?</i>
