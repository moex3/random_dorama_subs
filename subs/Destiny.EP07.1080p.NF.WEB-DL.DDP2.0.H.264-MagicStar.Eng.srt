1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,342
You and I should stop meeting each other.

2
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,681
<i>I set the fire.</i>

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,216
<i>…and was arrested at the scene.</i>

4
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,051
Arson? What's happening?

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,085
<i>Right now, your father</i>

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,222
<i>is on the edge between life and death
in the hospital where he was taken.</i>

7
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:26,159
Then does it mean you didn't visit
the house with the intent of arson?

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,360
I didn't.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,029
Masaki Nogi is hiding something?

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,931
-We also detected gasoline on it.
-Gasoline…

11
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,300
A new report from a witness
in the neighborhood.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,268
Ms. Nishimura!

13
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,204
Masaki Nogi lost consciousness
in his cell, vomiting blood!

14
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,773
He may not last long.

15
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,476
I came back to see you.

16
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:46,946
Want to run away?

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,884
Let's run away.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,687
Just the two of us.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,026
I want to be with you.

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,296
I want to see that starry sky…

21
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,499
with you alone.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,018
Sorry.

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,253
I was just kidding.

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,859
Of course, you're kidding.

25
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,763
I'd be arrested if I did
something like that.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,673
The interrogation is canceled for now

27
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,778
so you have plenty of time to rest.

28
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,851
When I get better…

29
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,723
the questioning will start again, huh?

30
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,631
I understand.

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,934
I'll go to sleep.

32
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,056
<i>That was the second crime…</i>

33
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,968
Here's your ticket.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,313
PAY FARE IN ADVANCE

35
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,247
Go ahead.

36
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,617
Go ahead.

37
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,964
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts.
The bus will depart in five minutes.</i>

38
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,716
<i>…I ever committed.</i>

39
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,517
<i>We will depart shortly.</i>

40
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>For your safety,
please keep your seatbelt fastened</i>

41
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,493
<i>while the vehicle is moving.</i>

42
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,749
<i>That was my second…</i>

43
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,852
<i>crime.</i>

44
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,507
NAGANO

45
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,869
-Hello.
-I'm sorry to bother you so early.

46
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,906
We can't locate Mr. Nogi in Room 502.

47
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,743
<i>He was there
when we checked the rooms last night,</i>

48
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,412
<i>but was gone when I came to take
his temperature this morning.</i>

49
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,514
<i>We're now looking for him.</i>

50
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:49,916
I see.

51
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,785
I'll be there immediately.

52
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,886
<i>Thank you.</i>

53
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,765
I heard Masaki Nogi disappeared.

54
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,034
Yes. I've got the report.

55
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,736
Why? Where's Ms. Nishimura?

56
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,739
She sent me an e-mail to say
she can't work today due to a fever.

57
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,809
Tell her we need to keep in touch
in an emergency like this.

58
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,710
Yes.

59
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,781
Uh, branch chief?

60
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,416
What?

61
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,320
Were you aware of their relationship?

62
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,922
What relationship?

63
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,792
Between Ms. Nishimura and Masaki Nogi.

64
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,193
What do you mean?

65
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,398
They knew each other
when they were college students.

66
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,932
And they were probably

67
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,567
romantically involved.

68
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,971
Call her now.

69
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,506
Yes.

70
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,881
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at this time.…</i>

71
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,983
Her cell phone is switched off.

72
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,521
Hello.

73
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,691
<i>Is this the residence
of Ms. Nishimura, the prosecutor?</i>

74
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,993
Yes, it is.

75
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,496
I'm Ohata, from the Chuo Branch
of Yokohama District

76
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,631
Public Prosecutors Office.

77
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,667
Kanade speaks well of you.

78
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,769
I'm Okuda,

79
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,339
Kanade's fiancé.

80
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,241
It's nice to talk to you.

81
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,677
Is Ms. Nishimura home?

82
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,348
Uh, yes.

83
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,618
The assistant officer says
he received a message from her

84
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,388
saying she has a fever
and can't come to work today.

85
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,224
But we have an urgent matter
so I called this number.

86
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,660
I see.

87
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,899
She seems to have turned off her phone,
and we can't get a hold of her.

88
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,908
I'm really sorry,

89
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,443
but she just fell asleep.

90
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,313
I think she needs to rest.

91
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,016
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

92
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,351
Should I wake her?

93
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,891
No, that's not necessary.

94
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,294
<i>Then when she gets up,</i>

95
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,398
would you please tell her
to contact me as soon as possible?

96
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,599
I certainly will.

97
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,834
Goodbye.

98
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,614
She's sleeping at home.

99
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,249
You're okay with that?

100
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,052
Our top priority now is to find Nogi.

101
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,789
Apply for the cancellation
of detainment suspension.

102
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,190
Yes.

103
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,365
<i>Thank you for riding with us.</i>

104
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,800
<i>We've arrived at Kofu.</i>

105
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,137
<i>Remember to take all your belongings
when you leave the bus.</i>

106
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>The next stop is our final stop,
Matsumoto.</i>

107
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,400
Are you okay? Are you in any pain?

108
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm so happy, I want to get up and dance.

109
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,075
Hey.

110
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,445
Let me have your shoulder.

111
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,485
Does anybody know…

112
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,090
that you're here?

113
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,798
Who's the one who said we should run away?

114
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,966
Me.

115
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,080
That's the end of the interview.

116
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,184
We'll contact you later with the result.

117
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,319
Thank you very much.

118
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,755
I hope I did well.

119
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,223
Don't worry.

120
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,826
You got a recommendation from Mr. Nogi.

121
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:09,929
Um…

122
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,500
Do you know how he is doing now?

123
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,471
<i>I've heard he hasn't
regained consciousness yet.</i>

124
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>That was a very shocking incident.</i>

125
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,474
<i>Yes.</i>

126
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,709
Mr. Umeda, have you heard?

127
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,779
A-About what?

128
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,681
About his son who was arrested.

129
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,352
His detainment had been suspended
because his health deteriorated,

130
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,256
but apparently,
he has escaped from the hospital.

131
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,190
Huh?

132
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,696
The Kanagawa Prefectural Police
have an emergency deployment to find him.

133
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,339
Doctor, thank you for waiting.

134
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,707
I know you're busy.

135
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,542
It's fine.

136
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,614
So you're saying
you still don't know where Masaki is?

137
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,518
We checked the security cameras
in the hospital.

138
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:10,089
We saw him leave from the side entrance
early in the morning.

139
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,891
But we don't know where he went.

140
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,962
Nogi has gallbladder cancer, right?

141
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,864
Yes.

142
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,302
I want your opinion
as his attending physician.

143
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,238
Do you think he could run away

144
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,240
in his physical condition?

145
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,577
<i>He was just admitted as an emergency
due to vomiting blood.</i>

146
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,646
<i>Wouldn't he have trouble
even trying to walk?</i>

147
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,715
It is true

148
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,085
that he underwent endoscopic treatment.

149
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,055
He might be developing anemia.

150
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,891
I don't think it's likely he can get far.

151
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,696
What if somebody is with him?

152
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,302
I guess it would be easier with assistance
as opposed to being on his own.

153
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,772
I see.

154
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,041
Thank you very much.

155
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,209
You're welcome.

156
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,310
If you'd excuse me.

157
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:09,982
Doctor.

158
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,854
Excuse me for intruding on your privacy,

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,290
but I believe you are engaged
to Prosecutor Nishimura.

160
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,259
Yes.

161
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,529
I heard she is staying home sick today.

162
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,197
Please give my regards to her.

163
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,600
We're working together on this case.

164
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,302
I'll do that.

165
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,704
Goodbye.

166
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,999
Kanade is with Masaki now?

167
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,735
-Why?
-Listen.

168
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,871
I heard about Masaki
at the interview today.

169
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,408
So I rushed to call Kanade,
but her phone was turned off.

170
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,143
Her office told me she's off today.

171
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,544
Are you serious?

172
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,047
Hey, Mom!

173
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,449
We're out of soap!

174
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,053
You can use my body soap!

175
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,755
-Is it all right?
-Yes. It's okay.

176
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,601
If they had to suspend his detention…

177
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,972
it must mean it's pretty serious.

178
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,808
I'm sure his condition is really bad.

179
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,547
What in the world…

180
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,083
Huh?

181
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,519
I can't believe it.

182
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,756
What in the world are they doing?

183
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,762
I hope nobody dies.

184
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,965
-Why would you say that?
-Sorry.

185
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,867
I don't want to lose anybody else.

186
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,437
I couldn't bear it.

187
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,075
Tomo. It's ringing.

188
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,177
Hey.

189
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,078
Huh?

190
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,684
Hello.

191
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,955
Here you are.

192
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,591
Pardon me for visiting so late at night.

193
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,559
No worries.

194
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,901
Actually, I have something
I want to ask you about Kanade.

195
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,787
It's the opposite, isn't it?

196
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,156
Hmm?

197
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,027
You know.

198
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,097
From back then.

199
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,604
Yeah, it is.

200
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,376
The Shinshu fireworks are canceled,
as we thought.

201
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,912
Kaori and Yuki said they couldn't make it.

202
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,313
Oh yeah?

203
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,883
What are we going to do?

204
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,786
Want to stay here for a while?

205
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,288
Huh? Why?

206
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,224
Instead of fireworks…

207
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,431
I'm turning them off.

208
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,433
Yeah.

209
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,051
<i>The sky, the stars,</i>

210
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,454
<i>and the darkness were the same.</i>

211
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,024
I've never seen…

212
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,594
such a beautiful starry sky.

213
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,530
First time for me too.

214
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,536
<i>Kanade.</i>

215
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,139
<i>I love you.</i>

216
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,314
<i>What was different from before</i>

217
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,551
<i>was not only that I was sitting
in the driver's seat.</i>

218
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>We were both 35 years old already,</i>

219
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,360
<i>and he was a suspect on the run.</i>

220
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,864
<i>And I was the prosecutor in charge.</i>

221
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,234
I'm relieved.

222
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,036
Hmm?

223
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,007
I was worried the stars
wouldn't be out tonight.

224
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,012
That's what you were worried about?

225
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,083
Although we're fugitives?

226
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,456
Not about getting caught?

227
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:19,958
Were you worried?

228
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,693
No, I wasn't.

229
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,796
You know I never worry about things.

230
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:30,035
When I'm with you,
your idiocy rubs off on me.

231
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,038
That's harsh.

232
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,234
My dream came true.

233
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,009
Do you remember telling me

234
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,646
<i>those days were the happiest times</i>

235
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,448
in your life?

236
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:19,818
Mm-hmm.

237
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,325
I feel the same way.

238
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,432
That period was
the happiest time of my life.

239
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,683
Though it was so short.

240
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,488
It went by

241
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,057
in the blink of an eye.

242
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,628
But…

243
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,530
I treasure it.

244
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,071
So just for now…

245
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,542
can you stay like this?

246
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,697
I don't mind dying

247
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,167
if I'm with you, Kanade.

248
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,610
I wish I could die right now.

249
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,049
Don't be silly.

250
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,619
Is it silly?

251
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,290
Everybody dies someday.

252
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,300
When you die…

253
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,704
you turn into a star.

254
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:21,773
Didn't anyone…

255
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,110
tell you that

256
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,813
when you were a kid?

257
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,351
No.

258
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,631
I was told that.

259
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,906
By whom?

260
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,584
Who told you? Masaki?

261
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm still alive.

262
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,454
Good.

263
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,514
I haven't slept so well in a long time.

264
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,082
Really?

265
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,919
It's probably because you were with me.

266
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,891
Masaki.

267
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,761
The truth is you haven't had one day
that you could just relax

268
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,564
since Kaori passed away, right?

269
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,435
How come?

270
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,571
Because that's who you are.

271
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,911
While others might seal off their memories

272
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,847
and pretend to forget,

273
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,315
you could never forget.

274
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,784
That's not true.

275
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,454
You're not shrewd enough
to act like nothing happened.

276
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,822
I think you're wrong.

277
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,592
-I'm--
-That's why you went overseas

278
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,962
and did volunteer work,
resulting in damage to your health.

279
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,236
Masaki.

280
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,805
I want to ask you something.

281
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,383
<i>I was determined to do one thing.</i>

282
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,254
<i>Even if I was forced out
of the prosecutor's office,</i>

283
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,192
<i>I had to save Masaki.</i>

284
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,496
<i>I had to seek out the truth.</i>

285
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,537
Masaki.

286
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,607
You're hiding something, right?

287
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,283
Her cell phone is still turned off.

288
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,520
Branch chief, is this really okay?

289
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,389
If she's with him now,
wouldn't it be a major problem?

290
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,660
But her fiancé clearly said
that she's resting at home.

291
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:41,066
We can't just barge into the home
of a prosecutor absent due to illness.

292
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,234
But what if the police decide to go in?

293
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,405
The only thing that would happen
is I'd get fired.

294
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,174
Branch chief.

295
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,943
Don't worry.

296
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,713
As an assistant officer,
you wouldn't experience any issues.

297
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,482
That's not what I meant, though…

298
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,355
KANADE NISHIMURA

299
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,595
Yes.

300
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,000
I see.

301
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,535
So where are you now?

302
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,475
Understood.

303
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,212
I'll inform the Yokohama Minami Police.

304
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,654
Ms. Nishimura is in Nagano Prefecture.

305
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,890
She said she has taken
Masaki Nogi into custody.

306
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,425
What?

307
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,162
Looks like her fever has subsided.

308
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,967
I'll arrange for detention right away.

309
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,614

What a gutsy one

313
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,963
this daughter of Eisuke Tsuji is.

MAIL DELETED

315
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,446
Kanade.

316
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,314
Hmm?

317
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,819
Were you going to take me back all along?

318
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,688
Well,

319
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,093
I still haven't heard the truth from you.

320
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,696
Masaki,

321
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,999
you didn't really set the fire.

322
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,435
Isn't that right?

323
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,075
Why are you so obsessed?

324
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,514
It's my job to seek the truth.

325
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,118
Even if…

326
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,821
I said I did it?

327
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,858
Yes.

328
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,993
If it's not the truth.

329
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,871
The truth… huh?

330
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:36,908
Hmm?

331
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,577
Hey, Kanade.

332
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,948
What is "truth"?

333
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,235
Will I be getting handcuffed again?

334
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,006
Then I prefer

335
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,643
to be handcuffed by you, Kanade.

336
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,545
Stop it.

337
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,082
"Stop it."

338
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,052
"Don't be silly."

339
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:28,259
I'm always getting scolded by you,
aren't I?

340
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,298
Masaki.

341
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:36,968
Don't die.

342
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,973
Please.

343
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,742
Promise me.

344
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,512
Don't go away again.

345
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,123
That promise…

346
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,927
might be…

347
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,831
difficult to make.

348
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,534
No, you have to.

349
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,305
Promise me.

350
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,298
The way to hold hands
that can never be separated.

351
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,040
Handcuffs.

352
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,514
Do you know there's a way to hold hands
that can never be separated?

353
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,683
Use handcuffs?

354
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,442
That was quite an accomplishment,
Ms. Nishimura.

355
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,911
I apologize.

356
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,413
Oh, that was a genuine praise.

357
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,750
After all, you apprehended
a fleeing suspect all on your own.

358
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,355
Is it true that Masaki Nogi
is refusing treatment?

359
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,190
Yes.

360
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,026
<i>After his health is checked
at the hospital,</i>

361
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,695
<i>we will take him to detention.</i>

362
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,144
Are you feeling any discomfort?

363
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:02,914
No.

364
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,483
I'm feeling fine.

365
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:08,720
Come on in.

366
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,956
<i>Won't surgery be necessary?</i>

367
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,826
Yes, his doctor says as soon as possible.

368
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:16,928
I see.

369
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,529
Branch chief.

370
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,334
I still don't think
Masaki Nogi is the arsonist.

371
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,404
On what basis?

372
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,840
Did you get a confession?

373
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,477
No.

374
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,179
Then gather the evidence to prove it.

375
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,684
Reconfirm the origin of the fire.
Follow up with the witnesses.

376
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,819
Keep investigating.

377
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,055
Yes.

378
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,226
Goodbye.

379
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,104

Still using a flip phone? How rare.

390
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,481
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M WORRIED. CALL ME.

391
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,490
<i>What are you doing? Where are you?</i>

392
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,958
<i>Masaki's with you, isn't he?</i>

393
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:01,959
Huh?

394
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,928
Who told you? Why?

395
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,164
He didn't just tell me.

396
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,132
Takashi…

397
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,568
came over here.

398
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:11,969
What?

399
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,738
<i>He was worried about you,</i>

400
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,439
and came to ask if we knew anything.

401
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,576
<i>He was pretty sure</i>

402
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,511
you were with Masaki.

403
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,380
So that's why.

404
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,682
I'm sorry for the trouble.

405
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,585
But I brought back Masaki.

406
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,820
I'm home now and…

407
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,690
<i>Kanade?</i>

408
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,161
<i>Hello? Kanade? Can you hear me?</i>

409
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,564
<i>Hello?</i>

410
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,699
<i>Kanade?</i>

411
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,839
I WON'T BE HOME FOR A WHILE.
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

412
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:53,611
<i>I knew this would happen from the start.</i>

413
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,885
<i>I was prepared
for this to happen when I left. But…</i>

414
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,704
Good morning.

415
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,205
Good morning.

416
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,475
Thank you for bringing Nogi into custody.

417
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,443
Not at all.

418
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,378
How is Masaki Nogi doing?

419
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,047
No big changes so far, I heard.

420
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,050
If he suddenly deteriorates,
take him to the hospital.

421
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,685
Understood.

422
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,786
Then let's start.

423
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,188
Yes.

424
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,357
FORENSIC REPORT

425
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,592
We checked with the forensic team again.

426
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,528
As we thought in this case,
the fire originated

427
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,431
from the side of the garage
of Nogi's residence.

428
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,332
This part.

429
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,102
It's where the burned piece
of a plastic fuel can was found.

430
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,105
We detected gasoline around the area.

431
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,741
It doesn't match Masaki Nogi's statement,

432
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,443
<i>which was that the curtains
in the living room caught fire.</i>

433
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,113
Any new witnesses
for the suspicious person?

434
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,217
The security cameras at the house
were burned up in the fire

435
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,852
<i>and no data remained.</i>

436
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,022
We are now checking
security cameras in the neighborhood.

437
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,558
<i>I was already asked by the detective too,</i>

438
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,395
but someone yelled, "What are you doing?"

439
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,830
That made the person run away, it seemed.

440
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,465
In which direction?

441
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,301
From Mr. Nogi's house,

442
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:24,802
that way.

443
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,173
Which way from here?

444
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,276
-Here… we turn left.
-Left.

445
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,514
I heard a voice calling, "There's a fire,"
so I hurried outside.

446
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,815
I saw a man run away.

447
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,584
Did the man look like this?

448
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:45,456
I don't know.
I think he was wearing a suit.

449
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,358
-He was wearing a suit?
-Yes.

450
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,209
That's D50, the Kano residence.

451
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,144
The Kano residence is…

452
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,479
-Right there.
-Yes.

453
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,048
Alright.

454
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,152
Here.

455
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,356
How is it going?

456
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,692
As you've said,
I haven't been able to find anyone either.

457
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,263
The garage of the house is in a blind spot
from all the security cameras in the area.

458
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,866
That's the problem.

459
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,702
Oh, this is for you.

460
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:32,937
Thank you very much.

461
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:33,838
Here.

462
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,173
-Thank you.
-No matter how many times

463
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,043
I review the footage,
all I see is the dry cleaner's car.

464
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,813
Oh, it must be
their delivery car for this area.

465
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,814
-What?
-Huh?

466
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,885
Detective Watanabe,
wouldn't this car have a dashcam?

467
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,521
Yes, they usually have one on board.

468
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,658
We need to know the registration number,
the company, and to identify the driver!

469
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,667
These came for you.

470
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,138
They're from a lawyer named Yuki Umeda.

471
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,107
Thank you.

472
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,177
Do you really want to refuse visitations?

473
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,779
Yes.

474
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:29,927

PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

476
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,877
-Ms. Nishimura.
-Yes.

477
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,979
The dashcam turned up something.

478
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,616
It might be this man.

479
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,519
September 1st.

480
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,421
At 10:06 p.m.

481
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,926
Right after the fire broke out.

482
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,797
This matches the eyewitness accounts
regarding clothing and appearance.

483
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,734
But it's hard to make out the face
based on this image.

484
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,204
-Can we see a close-up?
-Yes.

485
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,186
<i>Hey, Kanade.</i>

486
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,356
What is "truth"?

487
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,770
What brings you here so suddenly?

488
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,272
Well…

489
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,489
Yuki.

490
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,269
I'm sorry, Tomo.

491
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,338
But there is

492
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,775
something I have to ask, so I will.

493
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,352
Yuki.

494
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,322
That night…

495
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,825
when there was a fire at Mr. Nogi's house,

496
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,361
what were you doing in front of the house?

497
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,870
You were recorded on a dashcam.

498
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,578
This is you, right?

499
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,100
Yuki?

500
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,336
What is this?

501
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,010
Masaki…

502
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,452
tried to cover it up…

503
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,520
for me.

504
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,729
Masaki.

505
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,230
Yuki, did you…

506
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,933
No, Masaki.

507
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,301
-I…
-Just go.

508
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,702
-But…
-Hurry!

509
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,920
He covered for me, and…

510
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,059
Hey, what's going on?

511
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,028
You have a guest over?

512
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,744
Uhh… Umm…

513
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:52,823

<i>That case and the arson…</i>

515
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,694
<i>Aren't they all connected in some way?</i>

516
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,696
Don't stick your nose into this matter.

517
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,631
I can let you live or die.

518
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,532
Shut up!

519
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,100
I don't have any time left.

520
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,501
<i>Doesn't it look like a human face?</i>

521
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:05,502
<i>It was a fuel can.</i>

522
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,371
Please tell me the truth.
