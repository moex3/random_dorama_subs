1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,408
Let's run away.

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,943
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:16,683
She seems to have turned off her phone,
and we can't get a hold of her.

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,820
Can you stay like this?

5
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,756
I don't mind dying

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,724
if I'm with you, Kanade.

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,093
Promise me.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,695
<i>Don't go away again.</i>

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,497
Are you feeling any discomfort?

10
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>Kanade? Can you hear me?</i>

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,102
<i>I knew this would happen from the start.</i>

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,606
I still don't think
Masaki Nogi is the arsonist.

13
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,808
Then gather the evidence to prove it.

14
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,278
Wouldn't this car have a dashcam?

15
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,881
It might be this man.

16
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,286
<i>When there was a fire at Mr. Nogi's house,</i>

17
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,422
what were you doing in front of the house?

18
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,325
You were recorded on a dashcam.

19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,261
What is this?

20
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,830
Masaki… tried to cover for me.

21
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,569
Masaki.

22
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,071
Yuki, did you…

23
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,872
Hey, what's going on?

24
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,374
You have a guest over?

25
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,648
Uhh… Umm…

26
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,563
Where do you want to go?

27
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,934
Want to go to that casual restaurant?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,502
Really? Can we go there?

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,238
But I already brushed my teeth.

30
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,473
It's okay.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,374
Yay!

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,078
-Let's go.
-Okay.

33
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,352
You asked Mr. Nogi
to refer you to a new law firm?

34
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,990
This is embarrassing to talk about.

35
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:04,891
But…

36
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,529
I was included on the list of dismissals
at my old law firm.

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,764
So…

38
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,069
I went to a bar association seminar,
thinking I should do something.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,338
Are you Mr. Yuki Umeda?

40
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,907
Do you have a minute to talk?

41
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,645
Looking back, Mr. Nogi might have known
that I would be there.

42
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,049
We had a talk,
and he asked me a lot about Masaki.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,886
<i>He was very concerned</i>

44
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,921
about your father.

45
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,924
He even knew

46
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,827
about me getting fired.

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,696
I've heard that you are experiencing

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,065
some hardships at the moment.

49
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,102
I can help you if you would like.

50
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,938
But after that,

51
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,742
Mr. Nogi completely stopped contacting me.

52
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,878
I tried to get in touch many times
but no reply.

53
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,051
I felt like he wasn't serious
about helping me get a job.

54
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,121
And then…

55
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,257
I was fired from my law firm,

56
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,960
and couldn't get hired anywhere else.

57
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,963
It made me terribly anxious.

58
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,866
Is that why…

59
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,105
I just couldn't give up on the idea.

60
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,441
So that night…

61
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,579
I went to Mr. Nogi's house.

62
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,648
<i>Yes.</i>

63
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,650
Uh, pardon me for disturbing you at night.

64
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,820
My name is Umeda, and I'm a lawyer.

65
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,423
Is Mr. Nogi home?

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,258
It's me speaking.

67
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,827
<i>M-Mr. Nogi? It's me, Umeda.</i>

68
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,029
I know this might be rude,

69
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,333
but could I please speak with you,
even for just a little bit?

70
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,802
It's about a job referral
as we discussed before.

71
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,938
<i>I'm sorry, but I have company
at the moment.</i>

72
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,340
Then, when would be better?

73
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,375
<i>I will contact you later.</i>

74
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,347
<i>I thought he didn't want to deal with me</i>

75
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,450
<i>so he made up a lie about having company.</i>

76
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,186
<i>Of course,</i>

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,023
<i>I knew that what I was doing
totally lacked common sense.</i>

78
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,562
<i>But I didn't feel like going straight home</i>

79
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,064
<i>so I wandered around that area.</i>

80
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,970
<i>I even thought to myself</i>

81
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,407
<i>I was never cut out to be a lawyer
to begin with.</i>

82
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,076
<i>My thoughts went that far back.</i>

83
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,579
You shouldn't say that.

84
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,815
You passed the bar exam, didn't you?

85
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,219
I passed because

86
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,355
I was so desperate at the time.

87
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,294
When I was in law school,
Tomo became pregnant.

88
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,895
So we decided to get married.

89
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:02,068
Then Tomo told me
she wasn't going to take the bar exam.

90
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>She was studying so hard for it.</i>

91
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,478
<i>She did so much better than me,
there was no doubt she'd pass.</i>

92
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
You know…

93
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,887
I'm not good at dealing
with other people's problems.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,491
Being a lawyer…

95
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,029
stresses me out so much,
and it's exhausting for me.

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,634
But…

97
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,639
I had to do it for Tomo and Nozomi.

98
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,643
That was my motivation.

99
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,482
I went to Mr. Nogi's house one more time.

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,251
You went back?

101
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,587
Yes.

102
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,791
NOGI

103
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,339
<i>What was I doing?
People would think I'm a burglar!</i>

104
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,609
<i>Just when I was realizing
how bad it looked…</i>

105
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,510
Fire!

106
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,087
What were you doing?

107
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,957
Huh?

108
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,430
Hey, wait!

109
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,500
It's him! He's getting away!

110
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,073
Masaki.

111
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,574
Yuki, did you…

112
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,012
No, Masaki.

113
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,247
-I…
-Just go.

114
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,348
-But…
-Hurry!

115
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,488
<i>Huh…</i>

116
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,559
<i>I even caused Masaki
to suspect me of setting it.</i>

117
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,362
<i>I felt so pathetic.</i>

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,664
<i>But I ran like hell.</i>

119
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,867
<i>I ran faster than I ever did in my life.</i>

120
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,803
<i>As if my life depended on it.</i>

121
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,974
<i>The next day,</i>

122
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,411
<i>I found out on the news
that Masaki had been arrested.</i>

123
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,713
Then…

124
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:35,555
you mean you were there by accident,
and you had nothing to do with the fire?

125
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,091
It wasn't me.

126
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,794
I swear to God, I didn't do it.

127
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,065
And Masaki

128
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,834
covered for you?

129
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,375
Why didn't you tell anybody?

130
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,544
-Not even to Tomo?
-I wanted to tell her!

131
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,046
So many times.

132
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,182
But at that moment,

133
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,618
<i>I found out that Mr. Nogi</i>

134
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,788
<i>had been looking for a law firm for me.</i>

135
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,757
<i>-Tomo was so excited.</i>
-International Cultural Law Firm?

136
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,359
That's awesome! That's great!

137
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,260
Y-Yeah…

138
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,968
So you couldn't tell her at all?

139
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,144
I felt so truly sorry for Masaki

140
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,815
this whole time, but…

141
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,286
in this situation,
even if I tell the police what happened,

142
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,189
there's nothing to back up my story.

143
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,427
I can't prove my innocence.

144
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,831
If I got arrested,

145
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,001
what would happen to Tomo and Nozomi?

146
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,506
I-I was terrified.

147
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,578
But…

148
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,884
that's the reason…

149
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,589
Masaki has been detained now.

150
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,758
<i>And in such ill health.</i>

151
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,865
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,201
Kanade.

153
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,173
I'm so sorry.

154
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,678
It's not me you need to apologize to.

155
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,181
It's all because of my weakness…

156
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,118
I feel pathetic.

157
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,397
What's the matter? Why aren't you eating?

158
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,635
Mom.

159
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,504
Is Dad in some kind of trouble?

160
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,674
What? Why?

161
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,376
No, he isn't.

162
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,384
No matter what happens,

163
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,987
I'm on Mom and Dad's side.

164
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,488
Huh?

165
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,926
I'll protect you, Mom.

166
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,164
Hey. Everything's fine.

167
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,867
There's nothing to worry about.

168
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,802
Okay?

169
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,971
Okay.

170
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,306
So go ahead and eat.

171
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
I…

172
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,183
I'll turn myself in.

173
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:53,786
Mm-hmm.

174
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,693
Kanade.

175
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,230
What?

176
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,232
If something…

177
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,269
happens to me for any reason…

178
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,774
will you watch over Tomo and Nozomi?

179
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,980
Don't worry.

180
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,148
But…

181
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,115
Yuki.

182
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,119
As your friend,

183
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,690
I believe what you just told me.

184
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,558
But you know,

185
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm a prosecutor.

186
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,831
I can't just accept your words as is.

187
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,969
All I can do

188
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,239
is seek out the truth.

189
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,976
To prove you are both innocent,

190
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,547
I promise you I'll find out the truth.

191
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,330
<i>The next morning,</i>

192
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,400
<i>Yuki turned himself in
at Yokohama Minami Police Station.</i>

193
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,190
He is not in a condition to speak then.

194
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,391
Yes, unfortunately…

195
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,460
But he is making progress.

196
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,561
I see.

197
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,165
We're lucky he's regained consciousness
from the state he was in.

198
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,800
Excuse me.

199
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,961
So it's still impossible
to interview Koichiro Nogi?

200
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,698
Yes. Even though he's the only one
aware of how the fire started.

201
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,635
How about Yuki Umeda
who turned himself in?

202
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,340
He says Masaki Nogi isn't the arsonist,
he is lying to protect him.

203
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,545
But Umeda himself
is also denying that he did it.

204
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,646
Yes.

205
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,315
Did you question Masaki Nogi yet?

206
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,583
Not yet.

207
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,485
How is his health?

208
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,055
So far, there's no change.

209
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:43,989
Although,

210
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,358
it is certain that he needs treatment.

211
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,561
I see.

212
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,246
Please enter.

213
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,528
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>seeing him since that day.</i>

214
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,843
<i>We went back</i>

215
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,447
<i>to being a prosecutor and a suspect.</i>

216
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,752
Please have a seat.

217
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,107
This morning,
lawyer Yuki Umeda turned himself in

218
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,175
at Yokohama Minami Police Station.

219
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,979
He will be asked

220
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,315
to come to the police station
as a witness,

221
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,020
but Yuki Umeda says
that he didn't commit the arson.

222
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,422
What?

223
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:30,562
Koichiro Nogi, your father,
had promised to refer Umeda for a job.

224
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:36,902
Umeda says he went to the Nogi residence
because he hadn't received any replies.

225
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,907
But your father refused to meet Umeda
due to having a visitor at the time.

226
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,578
Were you at the Nogi residence
at that time?

227
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,195
Yes.

228
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,264
<i>Uh, pardon me for disturbing you at night.</i>

229
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,900
<i>My name is Umeda, and I'm a lawyer.</i>

230
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,602
Is Mr. Nogi home?

231
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,104
<i>It's me speaking.</i>

232
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,273
M-Mr. Nogi? It's me, Umeda.

233
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,175
<i>I know this might be rude,</i>

234
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,445
<i>but could I please speak with you,
even for just a little bit?</i>

235
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,981
<i>It's about a job referral
as we discussed before.</i>

236
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,850
I'm sorry, but I have company
at the moment.

237
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,852
<i>Then, when would be better?</i>

238
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,454
I will contact you later.

239
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,427
I heard you asked him
how to get in touch with me.

240
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,299
What are you trying to get from him?

241
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,603
You didn't even give me
a chance to talk to you.

242
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,239
There's nothing I can tell you.

243
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,076
Don't pry with stupid questions.

244
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,746
What the hell is this?

245
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,347
Listen to me, Masaki.

246
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,284
Don't stick your nose
into this matter anymore.

247
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,220
What do you mean?

248
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,925
He asked me if I could give him
an introduction for a job.

249
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,827
Yuki?

250
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,563
He asked you?

251
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,400
I plan on finding him
a suitable law firm, or rather,

252
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,403
somewhere better than he deserves.

253
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,308
At any rate,

254
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,312
you seem to have a lot of odd friends.

255
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,681
Even in their thirties,

256
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,651
they're all juvenile and naive.

257
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,886
You are too.

258
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,954
Mr. Umeda is too.

259
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,191
So is that prosecutor, Kanade Nishimura.

260
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,197
And that girl Kaori Oikawa.

261
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,333
<i>She even came to my office and--</i>

262
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,768
Don't speak ill of my friends.

263
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,537
Kaori and Kanade

264
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,906
just wanted to know…

265
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,643
about that case of yours.

266
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,512
ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY CORRUPTION CASE

267
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,919
If you weren't involved in that case…

268
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:09,955
Kaori wouldn't have--

269
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,157
That's what I mean by juvenile.

270
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,294
Losing your friend

271
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,529
was extremely tragic.

272
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,000
But what does it have to do with me?

273
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,238
Calm down and think about it.

274
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,340
That accident happened

275
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,976
<i>because she was being too emotional.</i>

276
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,711
<i>It's not your fault either.</i>

277
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,581
<i>You were only seated beside her.</i>

278
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,785
Masaki, you need to grow up a little.

279
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,622
You were the one
who was supposed to take over our family.

280
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,058
But look at you.

281
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,761
When and where did you go wrong
to end up like this?

282
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,832
<i>Don't let that voice recorder concern you.</i>

283
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,735
I'll say it again.

284
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,172
Don't stick your nose
into this any further!

285
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,207
Whatever you do--

286
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,108
Shut up!

287
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,248
I don't have…

288
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,484
any time left.

289
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,223
What do you mean?

290
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,693
I…

291
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,731
didn't want to become like you.

292
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,337
That's all.

293
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,714
Mr. Nogi.

294
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,715
Are you listening?

295
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,587
Okay.

296
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,525
Yuki wasn't the arsonist.

297
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,732
Yuki…

298
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,467
didn't do it.

299
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,639
Good.

300
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,475
You didn't know this fact,

301
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,445
and yet you were trying
to protect Yuki Umeda?

302
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,015
You covered for him

303
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,953
<i>and said you did it
to an officer patrolling the area,</i>

304
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,554
<i>and were arrested at the scene.</i>

305
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,092
Yes.

306
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,230
I'll ask you one more time.

307
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,567
Did you commit arson?

308
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,939
I didn't.

309
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,444
Then why did you say you did?

310
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,015
Because I'm an idiot.

311
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,854
You should know by now, prosecutor.

312
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,891
I'm… pretty stupid.

313
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,062
I'm stupid,

314
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,966
but at that time,

315
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,371
it was the most…

316
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,275
important thing for me.

317
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,258
The interrogation is finished.

318
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,530
You will be released tomorrow.

319
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,168
You haven't been completely cleared
of the charges.

320
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,103
However,

321
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,675
you are seriously ill now.

322
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,247
Your admission to a hospital
is the condition of your release.

323
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,319
You must go to the hospital right now.

324
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,541
Masaki has been released?

325
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,077
Was his case dismissed?

326
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,346
He's out, on condition
he checks into a hospital.

327
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,250
But until the real culprit is discovered,
the disposition will be pending.

328
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,588
How is Yuki doing?

329
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,425
Being summoned by the police
so many times is bringing him down.

330
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,559
I see.

331
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,495
I still can't believe

332
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,999
Masaki was covering for Yuki.

333
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:26,104
Well, most people would lie
to cover up their own crimes.

334
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,208
Yuki brought it on himself.

335
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,177
He went to Mr. Nogi's house uninvited

336
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,679
and was mistaken for an arsonist.

337
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,683
They're pretty much the same.

338
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,685
They both did dumb things.

339
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,824
What on earth were they thinking?

340
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,427
Seriously.

341
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,462
What were they thinking?

342
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,901
<i>As I was saying that,
an idea came to mind.</i>

343
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,870
<i>Maybe Masaki thought</i>

344
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,241
<i>he should take the blame
as a way of making amends.</i>

345
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:10,015
<i>He probably felt that
he didn't have very long to live</i>

346
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,919
<i>so he should</i><i>take the blame</i>

347
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,488
<i>to save Yuki and Tomo.</i>

348
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,792
<i>In his mind,</i><i>this was atonement
for Kaori who died,</i>

349
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,362
<i>and for us who lost our friend.</i>

350
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,031
<i>As well as</i>

351
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,335
<i>for me and my father.</i>

352
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,606
Kanade, you're the same too.

353
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,241
What?

354
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,375
I mean,

355
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,512
you suddenly disappeared with Masaki.

356
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,449
I guess I did some dumb things too.

357
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:49,821
I'm barely hanging on to my job.
It's a wonder I'm still a prosecutor.

358
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,025
Huh?

359
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,628
Don't you know, Kanade?

360
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,463
Know what?

361
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,265
Uh,

362
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,902
Takashi lied for you.

363
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,072
When he got a call from the branch chief,

364
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,107
<i>he said you were sleeping.</i>

365
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,476
<i>He made an excuse for you.</i>

366
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,147
Isn't that why you didn't get in trouble?

367
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,626
The fish that got away was pretty big,
wouldn't you say?

368
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,095
I know.

369
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,631
I'll never find anybody as nice as him.

370
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,372
I bet most people don't know
that prosecutors can be idiots too.

371
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,141
I'm a young girl after all.

372
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,677
I suffer from relationship problems too.

373
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,978
-Wait.
-And…

374
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,981
Did you say "young girl"?

375
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,783
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

376
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,285
I did? Really?

377
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,487
What? No.

378
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,889
-You said "young girl."
-I said "young girl?"

379
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,358
I can't believe I said that.

380
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,893
Me neither.

381
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,568
It's been so long

382
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,704
since we were able
to talk together like this.

383
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,638
Yeah.

384
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,109
Hey. Why don't you sleep over tonight?

385
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,778
I don't want to be alone.

386
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,781
Are you really asking
for that much pampering?

387
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,748
I guess not.

388
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:30,121
Do you know I have an unemployed husband
being questioned by the police,

389
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,390
and a kid?

390
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,793
I don't think I can handle
looking after you too.

391
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,827
Absolutely not.

392
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,800
These are the times
I wish Kaori were around.

393
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,669
Three of us could talk.

394
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,908
Though we wouldn't have been able
to tell her all this.

395
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,612
If we had told her,
she would have made such a fuss.

396
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,213
You're right.

397
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,883
<i>But…</i>

398
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,389
I would have liked to meet
a more mature Kaori.

399
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,126
Me too.

400
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,133
MINATO GENERAL HOSPITAL

401
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,601
Doctor, are you saying

402
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,371
I should get surgery right away?

403
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,473
That's my opinion.

404
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,276
What would happen if I don't?

405
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,483
The hematemesis from the small intestine
was caused by cancer metastasizing.

406
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,386
Besides the small intestine,

407
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,423
we can see it spreading
to the bile duct and part of the liver.

408
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,091
Surgically removing it

409
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,361
is the best option.

410
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,230
Without surgery,

411
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,798
will I die?

412
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,200
It's not certain,

413
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,238
but if you don't do anything,
it is a high probability.

414
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,608
Doctor,

415
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,844
can I ask you something?

416
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,246
What is it?

417
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,315
Why are you trying

418
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,351
to save me?

419
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,521
I'm the guy

420
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,991
who ran away… with your fiancée.

421
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,994
Why extend help to someone like me?

422
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,664
That fact…

423
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,469
and the fact that you're my patient…

424
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,205
are not connected.

425
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,974
As a doctor,

426
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,378
I prioritize treating you.

427
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,617
I see.

428
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,421
And you operating on me…

429
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,360
means you'll have my life in your hands.

430
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,429
That's true.

431
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,599
Your life

432
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,469
would be in my hands.

433
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,806
So…

434
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,046
I can let you…

435
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,484
live or die.

436
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,630
According to the police,

437
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,633
Yuki Umeda is still denying
that he set the fire.

438
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:33,304
Didn't Umeda see anybody
who might be the actual culprit?

439
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,774
No, he's saying he didn't see
anybody suspicious.

440
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,043
<i>The Nogi residence
was already in flames when he noticed it.</i>

441
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,480
Masaki Nogi also denied setting the fire.

442
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:43,815
Yes.

443
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:48,653
Masaki Nogi once testified
that he spread gasoline around, right?

444
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,957
Yes, but that seems to be a lie he made up
to cover for Yuki Umeda.

445
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,563
That means both Masaki Nogi and Yuki Umeda
are almost certainly innocent.

446
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,064
Yes.

447
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,700
There are no clues
about the real arsonist.

448
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,570
I guess we're back to square one.

449
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,775
Come in.

450
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,743
Excuse me.

451
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,546
Branch chief, Ms. Nishimura.

452
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,748
They are allowing visitors
to see Koichiro Nogi.

453
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,517
I'll go talk to him.

454
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,090
KOICHIRO NOGI

455
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,492
Are you here to see Mr. Nogi?

456
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,927
Oh, yes.

457
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,662
Those flowers are lovely.

458
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,798
He's been receiving many bouquets
since moving to this room.

459
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,800
Who is it from?

460
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,836
We don't know. There is no name attached.

461
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,774
I'm coming in.

462
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,643
Mr. Nogi, you've got flowers again.

463
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,946
Thank you.

464
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,048
Pardon me, sir.

465
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,860
Masaki has been released?

466
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:02,760
Yes.

467
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,632
It's clear that he covered for Yuki Umeda
whom he ran into at the scene.

468
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,268
Masaki was only saying he did it
to protect him.

469
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,272
Mr. Umeda set the fire?

470
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,275
No, he probably didn't do it either.

471
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,848
Mr. Nogi.

472
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,852
I'm sorry to be questioning you
while you're just recovering,

473
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,054
but I need to ask you one thing.

474
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,291
Mr. Nogi,

475
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,428
do you have any idea who set the fire?

476
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,702
We're speculating

477
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,006
<i>that the culprit brought
a plastic fuel can to the garage area,</i>

478
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,308
<i>spread gasoline around,
and lit it on fire.</i>

479
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,744
This was a vicious crime

480
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,582
that burned your house down completely
and might have taken your life.

481
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,220
Can you think of anybody
who holds a grudge against you?

482
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,927
Someone who holds a grudge against me?

483
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,695
Yes.

484
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,768
There are so many people.

485
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,071
Only fate knows which one.

486
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,279
Although in my mind, I was prepared

487
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,150
for something like this to happen.

488
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,595
I see.

489
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,601
If you think of anything
or remember anything, please call us.

490
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,343
I'll come here again.

491
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,745
Please take care.

492
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,018
Kanade.

493
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,320
Yes.

494
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,726
Is Masaki sick?

495
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,631
Yes.

496
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,934
So, that's why

497
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,603
he came to see me?

498
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,549
I think so.

499
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,655
He probably wanted
to have a sense of closure

500
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,358
about various things in the past.

501
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,495
He tried…

502
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,966
in his own way.

503
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,533
So you were the first person
who saw the fire and reported it?

504
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,838
Yes. I made a delivery to a home
close to where the fire broke out.

505
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,573
On the way back,

506
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,977
I noticed the flames
and hurried to call 119 for an emergency.

507
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,446
What time was that?

508
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,216
I already informed the detective
the other day,

509
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,984
but about ten at night.

510
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,089
I already submitted
the photos of the sales slip

511
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,658
and the contactless delivery
on that night.

512
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,692
This must be it.

513
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,428
That night,

514
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,231
did you see anybody suspicious
near the Nogi residence?

515
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,767
How can I tell
if somebody's suspicious or not?

516
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,603
Does that mean you remember
anyone passing by?

517
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,872
I don't remember.

518
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,208
People came out to see. That's it.

519
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,642
Did you talk to them?

520
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,546
Enough! Why do I have to answer
the same questions over and over?

521
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,416
You're making me miss work!

522
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,418
Please calm down.

523
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,386
Why are you telling me to calm down?

524
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,755
I had nothing to do with the fire.

525
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,725
Could you please look at this?

526
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,496
-Photo of a contactless delivery.
-Yes.

527
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,298
The reflection in the window.

528
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,234
Here.

529
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,536
Doesn’t it look like a human face?

530
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,107
And this red portion.

531
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,642
Possibly a plastic fuel can?

532
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,582
I think it could be.

533
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,217
Please get this image analyzed.

534
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,852
Yes.

535
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,272
This is Nishimura.

536
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,674
Oh, the face is visible now?

537
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,944
<i>Yes, we got the face
to be discernable somehow.</i>

538
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,548
No results came up
in our criminal records database.

539
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:25,616
But…

540
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,219
the item visible from the bag

541
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,520
was indeed a fuel can.

542
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,324
Good news, but still,
the identity of the man is unknown.

543
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,325
<i>Unfortunately.</i>

544
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,461
Anyway, I'll send the image to you.

545
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,362
Yes.

546
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,798
FOLLOW-UP TO YOUR REQUEST

547
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:50,107
You're right. It's hard to determine
the culprit from just this.

548
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,643
His clothes aren't distinctive either.

549
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,013
We will conduct interviews again
based on this photo.

550
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,148
<i>Yes, please do so.</i>

551
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,689
<i>We must find out something.</i>

552
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:10,261
<i>That photo is the only clue
we have so far.</i>

553
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,542
I'm here to get my stuff.

554
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,679
Okay.

555
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,837
I'm sorry.

556
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,641
I caused you so much trouble.

557
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,844
Not just that…

558
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,280
but for everything.

559
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,222
I'll probably be operating on him
when the surgery is scheduled.

560
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,993
Did he agree to it?

561
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,197
He still seems to be unsure.

562
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,469
What he needs now is the will to live.

563
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,371
He needs to have hope

564
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,508
for whatever future he will have.

565
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:34,912
How are you doing?

566
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,386
I…

567
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:48,859
I can't even tell if I'm keeping
a cool head like you, Takashi.

568
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,862
I'm not really cool-headed.

569
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:57,902
I'm just trying to hold myself together
as a physician.

570
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:00,805
It's actually a struggle.

571
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,512
So Kanade,

572
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,983
you shouldn't give up your job
of being a prosecutor.

573
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,555
I know how hard you've worked

574
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,390
to become one

575
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,826
after hitting rock bottom.

576
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,562
NOTIFICATION OF REJECTION

577
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,770
What's the matter?

578
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,242
It's because you were there for me.

579
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,347
It's just hot water, but it will warm you.

580
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,982
This is good.

581
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,022
Oh, so you passed it. The bar exam.

582
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,424
Yes.

583
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,560
Your efforts paid off.

584
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,864
In the end,

585
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,000
I couldn't do anything.

586
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,219
<i>I don't remember much
of what happened after that.</i>

587
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,459
<i>It was morning before I knew it.</i>

588
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,664
<i>I heard people cheering banzai on TV.</i>

589
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,466
-<i>Banzai!</i>
-<i>Banzai!</i>

590
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,736
<i>In the recent presidential election
of the Democratic Liberal Party,</i>

591
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,573
<i>Lower House member Shotaro Azuma
was elected party president.</i>

592
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,444
<i>He is the elder son
of former prime minister Tadao Azuma.</i>

593
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,847
<i>If Mr. Azuma becomes the prime minister,</i>

594
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:54,618
<i>he would be Japan's second-ever
second-generation prime minister.</i>

595
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,656
<i>Mr. Azuma visited his constituents
for the first time since being elected…</i>

596
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,257
<i>Shotaro Azuma.</i>

597
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,793
<i>He was accused of bribery</i>

598
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,163
<i>in the environmental energy
corruption case 20 years ago.</i>

599
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,599
<i>My father was in charge of the case.</i>

600
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:14,505
<i>That same man is now
about to become prime minister.</i>

601
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,474
<i>I have been proceeding with great effort--</i>

602
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,442
<i>-Not guilty.
-In the end,</i>

603
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,945
<i>diet member Azuma was found not guilty.</i>

604
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:22,580
<i>And my father…</i>

605
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:28,586
<i>Diet member Shotaro Azuma
takes the office of party president</i>

606
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,654
<i>with overwhelming support from the party.</i>

607
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,493
<i>Mr. Azuma will be leading the country
in the future, and--</i>

608
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,660
Those flowers are lovely.

609
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,497
He's been receiving many bouquets
since moving to this room.

Mr. Nogi.

631
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,170
That case my father was involved in
and the arson.

632
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,539
Aren't they connected in some way?

633
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,042
Not only that,

634
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,810
but Kaori's accident

and Masaki's disappearance as well.

the truth.

<i>That's the real battle.</i>
