1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,308
<i>You will be released.</i>

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,410
<i>You must go to the hospital right now.</i>

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,412
Doctor, are you saying

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,214
I should get surgery right away?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,949
I can let you…

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,050
live or die.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,887
That man!

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,724
Mr. Nogi.

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,294
That case my father was involved in
and the arson.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,797
Aren't they connected in some way?

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,566
Not only that,

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>but Kaori's accident
and Masaki's disappearance as well.</i>

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,775
Please tell me

14
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,842
the truth.

15
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,524
What makes you think that?

16
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,599
This is a photo taken
by the delivery staff

17
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,603
as proof of contactless delivery
on the day of the fire.

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:12,739
Here you can see…

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,379
the plastic fuel can filled with gasoline
that was used to start the fire.

20
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,449
And this man

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,119
was seen at the inaugural press conference
of diet member Shotaro Azuma.

22
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>The man is Yoji Akiba, the secretary
of Former Prime Minister Tadao Azuma.</i>

23
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,926
SECRETARY YOJI AKIBA

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,332
Twenty years ago,

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,503
Diet member Shotaro Azuma
was arrested and indicted

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,872
<i>in the environmental energy
corruption case.</i>

27
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,210
<i>He was acquitted in the end
because all the evidence in the trial</i>

28
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,178
<i>was overturned by you.</i>

29
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,851
<i>The arsonist who set fire to your house
is actually the secretary of Tadao Azuma,</i>

30
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,987
the Former Prime Minister,
who is diet member Azuma's father.

31
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,825
Right now, the police are on the way

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,861
<i>to bring in the secretary
for voluntary questioning.</i>

33
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,997
Mr. Yoji Akiba.

34
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,099
We have some questions to ask you.

35
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,534
Come to the station, please.

36
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,337
<i>This man</i>

37
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,539
set fire to your house,

38
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,875
and tried to kill you.

39
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,881
It can't possibly be unrelated
to that corruption case 20 years ago.

40
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,485
What is the connection
between those two cases?

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,054
Mr. Nogi.

42
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,192
There must be facts that only you know.

43
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,570
You've reached that point, I see.

44
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,710
If it's all right,

45
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,248
let me tell you
a little bit about that time.

46
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,884
Yes.

47
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,622
At the time,

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,326
I was an attorney
who had just set up my own law firm.

49
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,996
<i>Environmental energy corruption case…</i>

50
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,097
Here you go, sir.

51
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>Before the trial began,
I was suddenly called</i>

52
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,271
<i>to the office
of Former Prime Minister Azuma.</i>

53
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,477
A mysterious e-mail?

54
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,381
My son says he has nothing to do with it.

55
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:42,922
<i>It was "e-mail evidence"
that Shotaro Azuma, Tadao Azuma's son,</i>

56
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,793
<i>pressured a bureaucrat to do a favor
to Yamagami Heavy Industries.</i>

57
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,164
<i>The favor was to grant a subsidy
of 200 million yen.</i>

58
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,799
FROM MASATAKA KATO
TO KENICHI MEGA (METI)

59
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,535
Who knows where they got the e-mail from?

60
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,837
Anyway,

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,140
the prosecution used it as evidence

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,744
to steamroll an indictment against my son.

63
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,346
So this

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,281
is fake evidence

65
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,684
fabricated by the prosecution.

66
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,454
It's a false accusation.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,089
False accusation?

68
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,961
You started as a prosecutor.

69
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,465
So you know their methods well.

70
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,767
I'm asking you please.

71
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,203
I need your help on this matter.

72
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,641
In order to clear my son's name,

73
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,077
I require your expertise!

74
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,514
<i>Fabricating an e-mail to prove the crime.</i>

75
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,484
<i>It sounded far-fetched to me at first.</i>

76
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,986
<i>But if it was true,</i>

77
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,023
<i>it was absolutely impermissible.</i>

78
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,626
I'd like to appeal to the judge
that this case is clearly fabricated.

79
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,730
It is clear that somebody
fabricated the e-mail.

80
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,201
The one who forced your statement
was Mr. Tsuji, the prosecutor in charge.

81
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,039
Wasn't the prosecution too overzealous
in their huge opportunity

82
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,042
of arresting a sitting Diet member?

83
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,510
Isn't that right?

84
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,982
<i>And my client was found
not guilty in the trial.</i>

85
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,017
I find the defendant not guilty.

86
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,030
<i>At the moment,</i>

87
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,867
I believed that justice had been served.

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,405
However, I learned later…

89
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,875
Everything went according to plan.

90
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,610
Rather…

91
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,247
your work was even better
than I had expected.

92
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,020
Let's keep in touch.

93
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,196
<i>It turns out, from the beginning,</i>

94
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,133
<i>everything had been concocted by him.</i>

95
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>He let the prosecution discover
that fake e-mail as evidence,</i>

96
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,177
<i>he made me question the evidence,</i>

97
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,148
<i>and win his son's acquittal.</i>

98
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,986
Did he go to such lengths
to protect his son?

99
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,356
I would say less for his son,

100
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,793
more for his own position and power.

101
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,463
That's what's so frightening about him.

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,301
He believed his son's indictment
would incriminate him too,

103
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,270
so he blocked it.

104
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,173
He went so far as to fabricate an e-mail

105
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,942
and trap the prosecution with it.

106
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,746
My guess is that Yamagami Heavy Industries

107
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,283
gave huge amounts of money to him as well.

108
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,354
I was manipulated too…

109
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,758
by Former Prime Minister Tadao Azuma.

110
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,530
This is Nogi.

111
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,066
<i>Prosecutor Eisuke Tsuji
has committed suicide in his home.</i>

112
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,468
<i>He has passed away.</i>

113
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,603
What?

114
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,743
<i>Mr. Tsuji…</i>

115
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>your father…</i>

116
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,148
was my superior whom I looked up to.

117
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,920
I knew his personality very well

118
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,988
and his work ethic.

119
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,862
I would be lying…

120
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,332
if I said I didn't regret it.

121
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,368
Mr. Nogi.

122
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,303
Water…

123
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,404
Yes.

124
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,144
Here you go.

125
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,360
Thank you.

126
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,062
You're welcome.

127
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,038
After that case,

128
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,641
I became more and more busy with work.

129
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,479
I was gaining fame as an attorney.

130
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,616
It was at that time

131
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,387
your friend came to visit me.

132
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,390
Was it Kaori?

133
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,829
Do you mean Mr. Tsuji's daughter?

134
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,600
They're classmates at the same university,

135
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,702
and I'm also their friend.

136
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,471
But

137
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,940
neither Masaki nor Kanade

138
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,642
knows about this case.

139
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,477
ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY

140
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,913
What if they found out?

141
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,483
What are you saying?

142
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,618
Who is this Kanade?

143
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,288
Like I said,
she's the daughter of Prosecutor Tsuji.

144
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,691
Are you okay with them dating?

145
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,265
It doesn't matter to me
who my son goes out with.

146
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,802
And this case is already in the past.

147
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,604
But is it really?

148
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,241
The more I look into it,
the more unusual it gets.

149
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,077
During the trial,
all the testimony was reversed.

150
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,011
Please reconsider.

151
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,682
<i>The accident happened right after that.</i>

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,986
I went to see your father
and heard everything.

153
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,354
What are you doing?!

154
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,657
Come on, stop! This is nuts!

155
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,593
Why won't you believe me?!

156
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,699
<i>Maybe you could say she's also
one of the victims of that case.</i>

157
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,001
<i>And then</i>

158
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,036
<i>Masaki appeared in front of me.</i>

159
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
Weren't you the one who killed him?

160
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,940
Did you kill Eisuke Tsuji?

161
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,909
Say something!

162
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>Even he started prying into that case.</i>

163
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,184
<i>I thought that that was the one thing
I really needed to prevent.</i>

164
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,387
<i>Around that time,</i>

165
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,889
<i>Former Prime Minister Azuma's
secretary Akiba</i>

166
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>reached out to me.</i>

167
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,094
Did you happen to meet

168
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,731
the daughter of Eisuke Tsuji recently?

169
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,400
<i>I knew right away that he was</i>

170
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,369
trying to silence me.

171
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,974
<i>My house burned down soon after.</i>

172
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,845
I nearly died.

173
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,782
And when I came to,
I was here in this room.

174
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,388
That same flower bouquet
is being delivered here

175
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,024
almost every day.

176
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,825
Congratulations.

177
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,726
Thank you.

178
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,896
<i>They were seriously trying</i>

179
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,666
to get rid of me.

180
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,469
But…

181
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,706
for better or worse…

182
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,509
I survived.

183
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,714
I'm still alive, and I'm here

184
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,350
talking to you now.

185
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
Yes.

186
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,557
Shotaro Azuma was chosen as the president
of the Democratic Liberal Party.

187
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,360
He'll be prime minister very soon.

188
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,697
Second generation prime minister.

189
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,734
<i>The scenario turned out
just as his father had wanted it.</i>

190
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,840
This…

191
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,945
You did a really good job of finding this.

192
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,219
Prosecutor Nishimura.

193
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,688
Yes.

194
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,592
You're still young.

195
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,495
You're young and honorable.

196
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,832
But

197
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,102
if you intend to fight
using that as your weapon,

198
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,972
I'm willing to put it all on the line
and cooperate.

199
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,975
Are you saying

200
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,578
you will help me?

201
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,814
If we were to do it,

202
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,117
now is the time.

203
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,523
I'm sure behind Akiba,

204
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,992
is that man.

205
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,094
Former Prime Minister,

206
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,263
Tadao Azuma.

207
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,406
This is my will

208
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,042
I'm leaving it behind.

209
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,912
You shouldn't say that…

210
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,616
I mean as an attorney.

211
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,653
Maybe I…

212
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,023
died in that fire.

213
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,993
No…

214
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,964
Perhaps I was reborn.

215
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,837
<i>Mr. Nogi,</i>

216
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,474
<i>while knowing he's risking
his life as an attorney,</i>

217
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,843
<i>told me everything.</i>

218
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,880
<i>His smile</i>

219
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,918
<i>looked a little bit like Masaki's.</i>

220
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,895
Koichiro Nogi definitely said those words?

221
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,297
Yes.

222
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,934
That means as we thought, Mr. Tsuji was…

223
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,607
It's so regrettable.

224
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,814
There's another piece of evidence

225
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,119
linking the corruption case
from 20 years ago with Akiba's arson.

226
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,392
Assistant Officer Kaji
was in contact with Akiba.

227
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,528
What?

228
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:31,036
He was given this cell phone by Akiba
and he was monitoring your movements.

229
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,139
INVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE
NM WILL BE DETAINED

230
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,275
KAJI
MESSAGE RECEIVED

231
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,380
Kaji was?

232
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,616
I'm sure he'll get disciplinary dismissal.

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,419
What a foolish thing he did
for a small amount of money.

234
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,159
Ms. Nishimura.

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,362
Yes.

236
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,763
Akiba will be arrested

237
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,867
for arson of inhabited buildings
and sent to prosecutors shortly.

238
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,969
Through interrogation,

239
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,507
how far can you get towards the truth
in the environmental corruption case?

240
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,043
That is where…

241
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,346
we truly fight.

242
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,814
Yes.

243
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,921
You talked to him?

244
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,092
Then he's well enough to talk now.

245
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,897
He's made a smooth recovery so far.

246
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,970
What did you talk about?

247
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,742
The real culprit of the arson.

248
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,680
Not just that though.

249
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,916
I asked about that case.

250
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,453
During that case
my father was in charge of,

251
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,923
Mr. Nogi was manipulated by a certain man.

252
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,526
Which man?

253
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,762
I can't disclose it now, but…

254
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,598
a certain politician.

255
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,002
Mr. Nogi

256
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,372
fought in court against my father

257
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,742
without knowing
that politician's ulterior motive.

258
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,943
Were you…

259
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,379
convinced by him, Kanade?

260
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,084
Do you believe his words?

261
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,353
He'd say anything to convince you.

262
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,189
-That's his--
-Masaki.

263
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,595
There's something…

264
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,031
Mr. Nogi told me.

265
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,301
What is it?

266
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,772
Masaki is a big fool.

267
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,142
But…

268
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,280
sometimes I envy the way he lives.

269
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,120
I don't want to let him die.

270
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,656
I want him to stay alive.

271
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,329
No matter how much he hates me,

272
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,432
Masaki is my…

273
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,336
precious son.

274
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,247
I believe Mr. Nogi.

275
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,117
Because I feel the same way as him.

276
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,589
I don't want you
to give up on staying alive.

277
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,093
Right now,

278
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,563
I'm very close

279
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,033
to getting the real perpetrator
who framed my father.

280
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,170
I'm certain I can get him.

281
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,572
So--

282
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,874
You don't need to worry so much.

283
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,076
I'll get the surgery.

284
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,646
I was just afraid
of the scalpel going into me.

285
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,185
Being cut up by your fiancé

286
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,853
is scary, you know?

287
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,924
Maybe he'll cut off the anesthesia
during the procedure.

288
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,394
Just kidding.

289
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,830
You seriously have to stop
saying things like that!

290
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,536
Kanade.

291
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,244
I'm grateful.

292
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,249
Thanks for thinking about me this much.

293
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,588
And thanks for talking with him.

294
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,392
So, Prosecutor,

295
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,628
do your best.

296
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,331
If you're almost there,

297
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,534
don't stop until the end.

Excuse me.

Tell me, weren't you using a cell phone

Yes. He handed me

<i>But Akiba was holding on to it.</i>

331
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,991
<i>Why?</i>

332
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,429
That phone is not in use,
but he was paying the bill for it.

333
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,330
What?

334
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,767
-Why?
-Beats me. Maybe he was just being lazy?

335
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,103
Or he had some emotional attachment to it?

336
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,571
We should look into it.

337
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,881
Kanade said she has
an important interrogation today.

338
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,950
So she can't be here,
but she'll come as soon as she can.

339
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,352
Even if she were here,

340
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,822
it's not like she could oversee
in the operating room, right?

341
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,525
You guys can go too.

342
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,328
You don't need to be here.
Go hang out somewhere else.

343
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,030
Don't be like that.

344
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,566
We're friends, right?

345
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,704
Huh?

346
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,172
-But you know…
-Yeah?

347
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,873
I haven't forgiven you.

348
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,774
What?

349
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,544
I thought you set that fire.

350
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,647
Sorry about that.

351
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,615
I'm really sorry.

352
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,251
Jeez.

353
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,755
Mr. Nogi, we'll take you
to the operating room momentarily.

354
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,290
Okay. Thank you.

355
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,748
Take good care of Masaki.

356
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,648
I will.

357
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,218
The surgery will require a long time.

358
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,553
I'll take the utmost care.

359
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,624
I'm literally "a carp on a cutting board."

360
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,663
He's making jokes. He should be okay.

361
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,466
I'm counting on you, doctor.

362
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,667
-Doctor.
-See you later.

363
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,203
Hang in there.

364
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,817
CENTRAL OPERATING ROOM

365
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,954
He's quite a guy.

366
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,956
Takashi.

367
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,126
I'm impressed.

368
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:50,829
I think…

369
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,999
I'll take the bar exam.

370
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,133
Yeah.

371
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,035
Huh?

372
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,805
I'm going to take the bar exam.

373
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,674
It's my turn to start working.

374
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,878
What?

375
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,813
Yeah.

376
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:08,980
-Huh?
-Uh-huh.

377
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,716
YOKOHAMA DISTRICT
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

378
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,354
Where were you
on the night of September 1st

379
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,958
when Mr. Nogi's house was set on fire?

380
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,294
As I've said…

381
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,765
I think I was on my way home
from the office.

382
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,034
Can you prove that?

383
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,636
Did you stop by anywhere?

384
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,772
I don't remember.

385
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,913
Aren't you the man

386
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,381
in this photo?

387
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,616
He just looks like me.

388
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,753
Arson of inhabited buildings
is a serious crime.

389
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,489
Furthermore,

390
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,991
-attempted murder is--
-I didn't do it.

391
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,362
Let me ask you a different question.

392
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,913
Doesn't this cell phone look familiar?

393
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,617
No.

394
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,586
This is one of the items seized

395
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,054
from your home.

396
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,225
You must remember

397
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,029
the environmental energy corruption case
from 20 years ago.

398
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,965
Well, kind of.

399
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,734
You are the secretary

400
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,803
<i>of Former Prime Minister Tadao Azuma.</i>

401
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,705
<i>His son, diet member Shotaro Azuma</i>

402
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,807
was accused of bribery in that case.

403
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,343
In that case,

404
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,848
this e-mail was the decisive evidence
to indict him.

405
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,450
FROM MASATAKA KATO
TO KENICHI MEGA (METI)

406
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:59,391
But, this e-mail turned out to be fake,
fabricated by an unknown person.

407
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:04,262
<i>It caused a social uproar as a case
of false accusation by the prosecution.</i>

408
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,134
What does that have to do with me?

409
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,469
Mr. Akiba.

410
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,607
Look at this cell phone,

411
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,344
and the cell phone used
to fabricate that e-mail.

412
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,247
Aren't they the same phone?

413
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,052
You have been paying the bill

414
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,823
for this unused cell phone for 20 years.

415
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:33,959
Why is that?

416
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,796
I don't know.

417
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,033
What you required

418
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,869
was not the cell phone itself,

419
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,405
but the data storage service.

420
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,175
It's a service from the mobile carrier

421
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,444
which stores your data
safely on their server.

422
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,046
OTHERS: DATA STORAGE SERVICE FEE

423
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,450
Wasn't that the purpose
for continuing to pay for this phone?

424
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,219
And in the server,

425
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,356
we found old data
for the actual fake e-mail.

426
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:09,961
The date matches, as well as the wording.

427
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,830
FROM YOJI AKIBA
TO KENICHI MEGA (METI)

428
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,665
FROM MASATAKA KATO
TO KENICHI MEGA (METI)

429
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,701
After that case was closed,

430
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,737
you officially became

431
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,339
the secretary of Tadao Azuma.

432
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,775
What are you getting at?

433
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,778
In other words,

434
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,049
you were instructed
by Former Prime Minister Azuma

435
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,951
to fabricate this e-mail.

436
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:36,655
Wasn't it also him

437
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,158
who instructed you to set fire
to the Nogi residence as well?

438
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,095
He told you

439
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,667
to silence Mr. Nogi
because he was afraid he would expose him.

440
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,912
If I said that's correct,

441
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,281
would you be satisfied?

442
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,919
It will settle the score
for your father, right?

443
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm not out to settle the score.

444
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,732
I am just seeking the truth

445
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,802
as a prosecutor.

446
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,372
It's my job to do so.

447
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,762
What's so funny?

448
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:53,832
Well…

449
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,972
I'm not laughing at you.

450
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,510
I'm laughing…

451
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,582
at myself.

452
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,988
I kept it for protection

453
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,259
in case I needed to blackmail him.

454
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,096
It was my only weapon.

455
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,534
A protective amulet
against getting killed.

456
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,544
Who knew it would backfire like this?

457
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,849
I should have erased everything.

458
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,352
I should have.

459
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,954
It's finished.

460
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,290
His condition is very stable.

461
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,858
He's going to be okay.

462
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,093
How was the surgery?

463
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,764
The procedure went smoothly.

464
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,635
His recovery will depend

465
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,206
on his physical strength
and his will to live.

466
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,442
I'll do my best to follow up

467
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,477
so that he can recover.

468
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,850
If you'll excuse me.

469
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,088
Wait.

470
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,597
Takashi.

471
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,733
Thank you.

472
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,474
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

473
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,949
I'm a doctor.

474
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,486
I only fulfilled my duty.

475
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,995
Take care of him.

476
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,248
Kanade.

477
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,556
Kanade.

478
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,394
I…

479
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,032
I'm alive.

480
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,002
Yes.

481
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,572
You're alive.

482
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,143
Masaki.

483
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,646
You're alive.

484
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,494
I'm relieved.

485
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,392
On the 1st of last month,

486
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,763
attorney Koichiro Nogi's residence
was willfully set on fire.

487
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,065
Mr. Nogi was home at the time

488
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,567
and suffered serious injuries.

489
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,002
This is an update on the case.

490
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:03,241
<i>Akiba was indicted
for arson of inhabited buildings</i>

491
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,643
<i>and attempted murder.</i>

492
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,247
<i>Former Prime Minister
Tadao Azuma was arrested</i>

493
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,852
<i>on a charge of instigating arson
of inhabited buildings</i>

494
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,421
<i>and attempted murder.</i>

495
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,724
As a result of careful investigation,

496
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,428
we discovered that the case
of arson and attempted murder

497
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:29,133
was closely connected to the environmental
energy corruption case of 20 years ago.

498
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,136
And that was the motive for the arson.

499
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,941
The prosecutor in charge at the time,

500
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,111
Eisuke Tsuji,
was held responsible for the outcome.

501
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,681
This resulted in an extremely
heartbreaking incident.

502
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,217
This recent investigation

503
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:53,091
made clear that Eisuke Tsuji
did not indict diet member Shotaro Azuma

504
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,360
with the knowledge that
the e-mail evidence was fake.

505
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,864
It also became evident

506
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,802
that he did not utilize violence
or force a confession

507
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,404
during the interrogation.

508
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:09,807
<i>Daddy!</i>

509
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,210
When I grow up,

510
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,212
I'm going to help you with your work.

511
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,513
Wow!

512
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,315
That's wonderful.

513
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,117
But it's pretty tough.

514
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,451
I'll work real hard!

515
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,886
Oh you will, won't you?

516
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,288
I can't wait.

517
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,462
I'll be looking forward to it.

518
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,030
-Yeah!
-Okay.

519
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,573
To restore the honor

520
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,877
of Kenji Tsuji and his family,

521
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,114
I wanted to clarify those facts.

522
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:10,268
<i>Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office
has arrested Former Prime Minister Azuma.</i>

523
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:14,972
<i>In addition, it has been proven that
Eisuke Tsuji, the prosecutor in charge of</i>

524
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,410
<i>the environmental energy corruption case
that happened 20 years ago,</i>

525
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,380
<i>did not fabricate evidence
or force a confession.</i>

526
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,749
<i>Mr. Tsuji has been exonerated
of these accusations.</i>

527
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,001
Tomo. Yuki.

528
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,638
Hey, wasn't Masaki
supposed to come with you?

529
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,607
Wasn't he leaving the hospital today?

530
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,542
Yes, but…

531
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,281
He said he was leaving without me.
That's all he said.

532
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,386
What is he thinking?

533
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,821
Can he walk all by himself?

534
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,790
I've no idea.

535
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,226
Jeez.

536
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,827
Again?

537
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,363
"Again" is right.

538
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,268
Oh, look.

539
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,674
MELON SODA FLOAT

540
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,311
Hey.

541
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:28,980
Masaki.

542
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,283
Why do you always go off on your own?

543
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,685
Don't keep making us worry about you.

544
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,987
Huh?

545
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,655
I was wondering how far I could go.

546
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,056
I wanted to challenge myself.

547
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,393
What if you collapsed on the way?
You only just got out of the hospital.

548
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,894
She's right.

549
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,530
Well, I'll deal with it when it happens.
I guess?

550
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,248
How about you?

551
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,217
Hmm? I'm done already.

552
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,020
Okay.

553
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,556
<i>I knew right away.</i>

554
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,894
<i>Masaki must have wanted
to talk to Kaori privately.</i>

555
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,030
GRAVE OF OIKAWA FAMILY

556
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,233
<i>I wondered what he had said to Kaori.</i>

557
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,470
<i>I imagined it was about that day.</i>

558
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,063
SHINANO UNIVERSITY

559
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,634
Hey, do you guys remember

560
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,970
how we all met each other?

561
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,573
In my case…

562
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,878
it was Masaki cheating on a test.

563
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,881
Oh, right.

564
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,517
But by that time,
you all knew each other, right?

565
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,152
Yeah.

566
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,458
I was in the same class as Kaori.
She started talking to me, and…

567
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,494
<i>She suddenly grabbed my arm.</i>

568
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,395
Hey.

569
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,563
Tell me your name.

570
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,265
You startled me. What? Who are you?

571
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,969
Kaori suddenly grabbed my arm too!

572
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,639
You're Umeda, right?

573
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,709
<i>I was in shock
because I thought she liked me.</i>

574
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,045
You know that's impossible.

575
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,213
What?

576
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,182
Who knows? Maybe at the time,
she was a little bit fond of me.

577
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,317
Sorry, but no way.

578
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,352
Huh? Seriously?

579
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,088
Masaki, do you have any memories?

580
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,990
I forgot.

581
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,159
-Huh?
-Really?

582
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,137
You're totally my type.

583
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,873
Who are you?

584
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,008
Hey,

585
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,344
why don't you be my friend?

586
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,287
Why are you smiling?

587
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,389
I don't think I can tell you.

588
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,025
What the hell? Tell me.

589
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,663
That thing? I won't ever tell you.

590
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,365
What's "that thing"?

591
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,699
-Hey, come on.
-No way.

592
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,569
Hey, you're still keeping secrets from me?

593
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,637
-Are you?
-Of course.

594
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:40,905
All right.

595
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,540
Now, come clean.

596
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,741
Is this an interrogation?

597
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,609
Do you want to eat <i>katsudon</i>?

598
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,311
-Yes, I would. Thank you.
-Okay.

599
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,746
Then it's Yuki's treat today.

600
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,484
<i>I'm making it now.</i>

601
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,886
<i>-Get a job.
-Huh? Uh…</i>

602
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,555
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

603
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,323
<i>That's a compliment.</i>

604
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:07,998
Are you okay?

605
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,034
Why?

606
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,702
Aren't you tired?

607
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,471
Not at all.

608
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,008
It's true.

609
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,415
Masaki, where are you staying tonight?

610
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,017
Well…

611
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,858
My dad…

612
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,227
Mm-hmm.

613
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,896
My dad says

614
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,733
I should come home.

615
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,239
He moved to his vacation home.

616
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,575
He wants me to go recover there.

617
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,810
I see.

618
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,314
That's a good idea. You should.

619
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,027
Masaki.

620
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:14,999
What?

621
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,537
You have to…

622
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,139
get healthy.

623
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,576
Yeah.

624
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,583
Goodbye.

625
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,500
I understand.

626
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:52,970
You're right.

627
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,510
I got it.

628
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:10,921
Kanade.

629
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,424
Hmm?

630
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:18,963
Thank you…

631
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,136
for giving me…

632
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,739
the will to live.

633
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,586
Bye then.

634
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,229
<i>I shouldn't turn around.</i>

635
