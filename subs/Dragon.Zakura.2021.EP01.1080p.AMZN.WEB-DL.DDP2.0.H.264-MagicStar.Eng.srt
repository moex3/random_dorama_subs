1
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,172
Hey.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,309
Are you being serious?

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,679
There is no other way
out of our financial difficulties.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,149
The way forward for Tatsumi Gakuen

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,818
is to get students into
the University of Tokyo.

6
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:22,690
If we can get several students
into Japan's top university,

7
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,426
<i>Tatsumi Gakuen will become</i>
<i>a household name nationwide.</i>

8
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:29,497
<i>Applications for admission will skyrocket.</i>

9
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:34,301
This year's admissions
are at 60% of capacity.

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,837
<i>We have seven classes of third years.</i>

11
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,439
<i>Five classes of second years.</i>

12
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:43,177
<i>And fewer than half new first years,</i>
<i>at just three classes.</i>

13
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,447
With the UTokyo halo effect,
student numbers will grow.

14
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,616
This is our only way to survive.

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,752
UTokyo? Are you serious?

16
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,423
Look at the reality. Reality!

17
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,125
Our school's deviation score is 32!

18
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:02,196
Our students can't get into
any top universities, let alone UTokyo!

19
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,066
Do your dreaming when you're asleep.

20
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,301
Alright then, let's hear your idea!

21
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,569
-Come on, ideas!
-Yeah!

22
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,804
Our livelihoods are on the line!

23
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,606
Student numbers drop every year.

24
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,542
<i>And teachers are made to leave.</i>

25
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,011
<i>Over these three years,</i>
<i>a third have been let go.</i>

26
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,047
I can't take it not knowing
when I might be next!

27
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:23,117
But UTokyo is nonsense.

28
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,020
It's nothing more than a pipe dream.

29
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,489
Only 30% of our students
intend to enter university.

30
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,791
<i>We're one of the dumbest schools</i>
<i>in the prefecture.</i>

31
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,027
<i>Sending multiple students to UTokyo?</i>

32
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,596
<i>It's an insult to UTokyo.</i>

33
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,198
Chairman, what do you think?

34
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,469
Naturally, I'm against it.

35
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,437
But to escape this crisis,

36
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,906
we must first improve
students' academic ability

37
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,477
Academic ability.

38
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:53,647
Binding children with
the selfish values of adults?

39
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,683
Not while I'm in charge.

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,754
The ones in charge of
this sloppy country now

41
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:05,126
are UTokyo graduates who
studied so much they can't think flexibly.

42
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:09,363
I want to help our students
grow their abilities and individuality,

43
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,332
and help this country be reborn.

44
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:15,836
I'll make a name for Tatsumi Gakuen as
a high school that makes future leaders.

45
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:20,274
We'll go under before
those ideals are achieved.

46
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,476
We'll be bankrupt in three years.

47
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,180
Acceptance into UTokyo
is our way out of bankruptcy.

48
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:30,651
Getting ranked here, and improving
our reputation is the only way.

49
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,555
We'll accept nationwide applicants, and
next year break our low enrollment streak.

50
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,257
We'll put an end to it.

51
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,758
Next year?

52
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,095
Nobody can get into UTokyo in one year!

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,630
It's possible.

54
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,667
Do you know about my previous high school?

55
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,802
No, where were you?

56
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,339
Ryuzan High School.

57
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,541
Ryuzan?

58
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,543
That's a famous, high-level school!

59
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,746
Yes, now it is.
But it used to be lower than here.

60
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,315
-Their deviation score was just 30.
-Thirty?

61
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:05,286
With just one lawyer, it was reborn into
a regular producer of UTokyo entrants.

62
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,755
Now it's a famous school
flooded with applicants.

63
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,190
Where is he now?

64
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,560
He put Ryuzan on track, then left.

65
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,129
After that, he had many offers.

66
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,399
He took on just one school
that was on its last legs.

67
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,735
That high school also
got back on its feet.

68
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,039
We'll get that lawyer
to come to our school.

69
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:30,211
Wait. Are you talking about
Tsurumaki High, from two years ago?

70
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,346
You're kidding!

71
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,583
That man was all over tabloid TV.

72
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,519
No! No! No! Not that man!

73
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,156
He's already here.

74
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>The lawyer who's</i>
<i>a former bike gang member, right?</i>

75
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,997
<i>But he's the only one who can</i>
<i>save our school now.</i>

76
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,367
Mr. Kenji Sakuragi.
He's the only one who--

77
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,137
Pardon me. Vice principal?

78
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,606
Thank you.

79
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,350
I'm from Mizuno Law Office.

80
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,220
My name is Naomi Mizuno, attorney-at-law.
I'm pleased to meet you.

81
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,155
-Mizuno…
-Mizuno?

82
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,225
Mr. Takahara! Long time no see.

83
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,728
Yes, yes. But where is Mr. Sakuragi?

84
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:24,098
It was so sudden, there was no room
in his schedule.

85
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,233
Sakuragi is currently on another case.

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,936
-I'm here on his behalf.
-I see.

87
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,006
Alright Mizuno, ah, Ms. Mizuno. This way.

88
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,609
Mr. Takahara.
You're vice principal now! Wow!

89
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,013
You were so unimpressive that
I had no memory of you, but now look!

90
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,248
I'm a lawyer now!
I was so stupid, but look!

91
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:45,352
Ms. Mizuno. This is Chairman Tatsuno.

92
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,390
Sakuragi couldn't come in person today.

93
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,525
-For that, I am sorry.
-Is that true?

94
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,229
Word is he hasn't been working for years.

95
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,231
It's alright.

96
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,268
He is busy as we speak,
preparing for your school's request.

97
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:05,139
Could you ask the principal
of Tsurumaki High School?

98
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,308
Right away.

99
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:19,019
FUKUI PREFECTURE

100
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,838
-Damn it.
-Alright! Caught another one!

101
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,040
It's huge! Huge!

102
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,875
Alright! Look!

103
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,377
NO FISHING ZONE

104
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,245
It's huge! Huge!

105
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,383
Black seabream!

106
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,297
You are a liar.

107
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,033
This says whereabouts unknown.

108
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,936
-Mizuno!
-Well…

109
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,973
He gets so many calls,
he has sort of gone into hiding…

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,541
Enough with the bald-faced lies.

111
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:18,212
We can't hire someone if
we don't even know if he's alive or dead.

112
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,813
You mock me.

113
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,649
I have nothing more to say to you.

114
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,988
Wait. Could you at least discuss it
at the next board meeting?

115
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,392
We teaching staff all agree,
we want to become a high-level school.

116
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,695
You all agree? Who agrees?

117
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,266
About 60% are in favor.

118
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,771
Articles of endowment say
a majority request

119
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,939
must be discussed by the board.

120
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:47,975
Chairman.

121
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:54,081
There may be a majority, but until I meet
this man, the board won't discuss it.

122
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,990
TATSUMI GAKUEN HIGH SCHOOL

123
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,492
That's so irritating.
Who does she think she is?

124
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,594
You still can't find him?

125
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,363
Give me a break, <i>senpai</i>.

126
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,900
He's been off the grid for two years.
He won't be easy to find.

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,601
<i>What?</i>

128
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,870
For anyone but me, I mean.

129
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,072
Let me say this, it'll cost you.

130
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,144
I'll pay whatever it takes.
Please help me, President Sakamoto.

131
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,279
<i>Yes.</i>

132
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,614
TOMOYUKI SAKAMOTO

133
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,889
20 HOURS LATER

134
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,305
Yeah! Got one!

135
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,711
C'mon!

136
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:10,057
I've been watching. You didn't catch
anything today or yesterday.

137
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:15,696
Fishing is all about location.
It's all one sea, but the place matters.

138
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,066
You've got to collect information.
Just like life.

139
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,767
Gotta use your noggin.

140
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,906
Hey, look at this.

141
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,376
See?

142
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:40,187
You're no fun.
Anyway, good luck with the fish.

143
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:43,724
Ouch, ow! What's this?

144
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,295
Oh, a blowfish? Gross little thing.

145
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,433
What the hell?

146
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:56,870
Hey.

147
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,607
Hang on, was that your lunch?

148
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,342
Sorry.

149
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:03,877
What?

150
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,381
I'll give you one.

151
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,284
-Two?
-Nice.

152
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,251
Go ahead.

153
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,187
Hey! What are you doing?

154
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,791
Stop that! Don't! Screw you, asshole!

155
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,327
Speak up. Say something.

156
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,530
-Say something, asshole!
-Now, now!

157
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:29,136
If you don't tell us the reason,
you'll have to be detained at the station.

158
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,671
You want that?

159
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,872
Stop!

160
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:39,313
You're saying that this man threw away
the fish that you caught, right?

161
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,280
What of it?

162
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:44,418
But your fishing spot on the embankment
is a no-fishing zone.

163
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,054
NO FISHING ZONE

164
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,423
-Isn't that right?
-Uh, yeah.

165
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,994
According to the other fishermen,
you always fish in that spot.

166
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,263
That's because… uh, you know.

167
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,033
That's a violation of the Fisheries
and Minor Offenses Act.

168
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,071
In other words, you're the one
who should be arrested.

169
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,847
You're already done eating?

170
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,618
Wow. The pork cutlet is sticking out.
Looks good.

171
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,454
It's not good.
That's just the batter coating.

172
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,057
The meat is thin, and the frying oil
is old so it smells weird.

173
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,760
I pay for your meal,
and that's what you say?

174
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,896
Here's your second helping of
pork cutlet on rice.

175
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,532
You say that,
and you're on your second helping?

176
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,003
I haven't seen you in ages.
I was expecting more reaction.

177
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,840
It's been two years.
If you see a student after two years,

178
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,075
you say "Have you been well?"
or "You got prettier!"

179
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,712
"Thanks for helping me back there!"
You could say that.

180
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,781
I can tell you've been well
by looking at you.

181
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,018
I don't think you got prettier.
And you didn't help me.

182
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,321
I knew he was fishing
in a no-fishing zone.

183
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,623
I got myself arrested so the police
would feed me lunch.

184
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,893
What you've done is
harmed your client's interests.

185
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,665
You say that to the person who
bought your lunch and clothes?

186
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,141
Sir, won't you come back to work?

187
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,644
I opened a law office.

188
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,447
-I could hire you.
-No.

189
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,518
There's a case that I think
you'd be interested in.

190
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,054
Do you know of Tatsumi Gakuen in Chiba?

191
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,588
They're famous for badminton--

192
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,323
I don't know that stupid school.

193
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,992
You do know it then!

194
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,261
You're avoiding my eyes.

195
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,863
They have a deviation score of 40, right?

196
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,232
Now it's 32.

197
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:44,705
<i>Three years ago, daughter Kumiko took over</i>
<i>as chairman from her father, Kyojiro.</i>

198
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,108
<i>Both applicant numbers and academic levels</i>
<i>are on the decline.</i>

199
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,977
In the name of increasing
student autonomy,

200
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,980
they eliminated homework,
and the academic level has plummeted.

201
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:54,981
And?

202
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,118
They've requested your services.

203
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,219
No.

204
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,957
My fate depends on
successfully revitalizing the school.

205
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:04,858
Your fate?

206
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,528
After you left the office two years ago,
I've been working my butt off.

207
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,864
I established the Mizuno Law Office,

208
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,101
taking any job I could,
and I finally got this chance!

209
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,369
Mizuno Law Office?

210
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,508
Aren't you ashamed?
Making your own student pay for you.

211
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,644
And you don't even listen
to what I need! That's low!

212
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,517
Hang on! What are you doing?
In a place like this?

213
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,853
If you want it back, you can have it.

214
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,588
Do you want the food back too?

215
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:39,092
You don't have to give it back!
Just put your clothes back on!

216
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,766
Sir! Are you finished?

217
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,507
That asshole!

218
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,293
Mister Ahmed!

219
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,439
What are you doing?
Faking a name and nationality?

220
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,242
I'll handle your back rent.

221
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,443
So you--

222
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,522
You can't pay rent.
Even your water got cut off.

223
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,059
-You can't even afford food.
-Oh, right.

224
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,995
Do you plan to stay in ruins like this?

225
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,168
The conditions of the Tatsumi Gakuen job
are not bad compared to two years ago.

226
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,536
In fact, they're exceptional.

227
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:01,007
Let's build a reputation,
and go back to the office in Toranomon.

228
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,512
I'll do all the hard work.
And if that's not enough,

229
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,782
you can just be an advisor
if you let me use your name.

230
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,886
How about it? Sir.

231
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:17,657
Do you plan to keep walking
into your bleak, dark future?

232
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:29,035
What? Sir, was your power cut off?

233
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,741
-It's 800,000 yen.
-Eight hundred?

234
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,777
-That's what I owe.
-What? No way.

235
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,813
-This run-down apartment?
-Can you pay?

236
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,816
-I'll pay.
-And get me a new suit.

237
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,586
Shoes and shirts, a necktie,
and all the rest.

238
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,422
-That's 200,000 yen.
-Two hundred?

239
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,292
Didn't I just buy you a new one?

240
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,526
Hey, hey!

241
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,197
When you're my size,

242
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,566
you gotta get them order made.

243
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,301
You damn giant!

244
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,340
I need a phone too.
Listen, my take is half of the fee.

245
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,843
I'm just an advisor. You do the work.

246
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,112
Okay, I'll do it.

247
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,681
You bet. Seven days a week.

248
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,417
Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don't forget.

249
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,119
See ya.

250
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,354
FUKUI

251
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,225
TOKYO

252
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,661
In order to bring them to the school,

253
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,363
we must first get approval
from the board of directors.

254
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,165
There are five members of the board.

255
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,902
First is the current chairman,
Kumiko Tatsuno.

256
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,405
<i>Her supporter, Principal Okuda.</i>

257
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,173
<i>Former principal Komatsugawa,</i>

258
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,012
<i>and Chairman Kumiko's father,</i>
<i>former chairman Kyojiro Tatsuno.</i>

259
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,480
Her father was the chairman?

260
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,751
Yes. He brought along an education critic
formerly of the Ministry of Education.

261
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,119
Mr. Shinpei Hibino.

262
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,621
I see how this will go.

263
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,957
Two votes from the family,
two from her cronies.

264
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,727
The critic the father brought
will also be on their side. Five, zero.

265
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,363
Actually, it's not so simple.

266
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,665
Sorry I'm late, Kumiko.

267
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,235
Call me "Chairman" here, former chairman.

268
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,371
<i>Discord within the family, is it?</i>

269
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,974
Yes, the former chairman
and Mr. Hibino are in favor.

270
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,642
Then it's two versus three.

271
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,445
We're still outnumbered.

272
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,815
Even if we can't change the empress' mind,

273
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,918
Alright, this proposal by Mr. Takahara.

274
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,189
Let's hear about
this education consultant.

275
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:33,159
If I mention the law office that
had a scandal two years ago,

276
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,327
I think you know it.

277
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,530
Setbacks make people stronger.

278
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,101
I think Mr. Sakuragi sounds promising.

279
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,736
Don't you all think so?

280
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,972
<i>As for the two principals,</i>
<i>when the former chairman was in power,</i>

281
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,509
<i>they had just been hired,</i>
<i>so he has pull with them.</i>

282
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,077
I will give my opinion

283
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:56,282
at next week's regular board meeting.

284
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,888
<i>I will convince one of them</i>
<i>before the regular board meeting.</i>

285
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,924
I'll find a way to get that precious vote.

286
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,893
-We're depending on you.
-Yes.

287
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,828
<i>This case is no good.</i>

288
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,863
What about it?

289
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,966
I don't think he can convince
those two before the meeting.

290
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,602
Lemme get my daily wages.

291
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,505
Hey.

292
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,774
Damn it…

293
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,016
After paying for your rent and suit,
it's empty.

294
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,485
Since I'm focusing on
the Tatsumi Gakuen contract,

295
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,121
I've turned down all other little jobs.

296
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,523
Okay, go sleep with them.

297
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,658
One of the principals will take you up.

298
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,960
Huh? I'll sue you for real!

299
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,664
I mean, I could get them both in one try.

300
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,038
If we get this, that contract fee
will be fat and juicy.

301
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,974
There must be a way…

302
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,645
Maybe I can seduce one of them…

303
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:08,388
Thank you for making time to decide on
my proposal today.

304
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,257
-I first offer my thanks.
-No need for speeches.

305
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,093
Hurry up and take the vote.

306
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,298
Those in favor of Sakuragi and Mizuno
making a UTokyo special course,

307
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,569
and using their success
to rebuild the school's reputation,

308
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,971
raise your hand.

309
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,882
The two who haven't raised their hands
are with me in opposition, correct?

310
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,890
Well then, this motion has failed.

311
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,291
-Please wait a moment.
-What?

312
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:52,665
I would like to try hiring Mr. Sakuragi.

313
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,670
Three in favor, and two opposed.

314
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,306
It's decided.

315
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,746
<i>This is completely unacceptable.</i>

316
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,950
No matter what, I want to make a school
of freedom, not bound by studying.

317
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,452
The board's decision is absolute.

318
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,123
To reject that is unheard of
in the history of the school.

319
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,660
You're not even in the Tatsuno family.
Don't talk like you are.

320
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,263
All you talk about is
freedom this, freedom that.

321
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:28,034
But when they enter the world,
strict discipline and competition awaits.

322
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,904
Adults who know that truth well

323
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,740
building a school based on freedom alone?

324
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,644
I wouldn't want my child to go there.

325
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,948
I was raised strictly
and forced into UTokyo.

326
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,284
Do I look like I'm living a free life?

327
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:50,557
I will stake my career as an educator
on making this a high-level school.

328
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,359
Okay, how many will you get into UTokyo?

329
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,428
In our first year, we'll start with one.

330
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,064
All this grandstanding for just one?

331
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,832
Three then, no…

332
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,335
Five people.

333
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,905
Five people? That's impossible.

334
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:11,277
Alright, five. Get five students into
UTokyo in a year,

335
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,712
or you're fired.

336
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,316
-What?
-But if five students pass?

337
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,750
Kumiko.

338
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,987
You'll have to quit as chairman.

339
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,856
You said it would be impossible, right?

340
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,859
If you have any pride as an educator,

341
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,896
you'll bet your life on it too.

342
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,966
Uh, yes.

343
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,903
A high-level school,

344
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,206
or a free school culture.

345
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:46,246
Show me which future
this school should pursue.

346
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,237
Kaede, can we go?

347
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,239
Go on ahead.

348
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,942
Hurry or you'll be late for
the opening ceremonies.

349
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:16,843
Okay.

350
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,163
What are you doing?

351
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,831
Oh, it's just you.

352
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,768
Oh, if you want it you can have it.

353
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,336
You're not the type to do that.

354
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,104
What, a lecture?

355
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,507
I'm telling you to stop shoplifting!

356
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,908
Oh, shoplifting?

357
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,778
What do you want?

358
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:56,082
Shoplifting is great. What a thrill.

359
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,084
You're mistaken about the shoplifting.

360
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,755
Mr. Sakuragi, what are you doing?!
The opening ceremonies are starting.

361
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,123
Is that my breakfast?

362
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,992
They're gifts for the staff room.

363
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,860
I told you to wait by the gate.

364
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:08,928
Where's my food?

365
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:09,962
A teacher?

366
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,831
-Go buy something!
-We're going!

367
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,433
Man.

368
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,903
I feel like the wrong guy saw that.

369
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:23,443
We welcome a new educational consultant
to Tatsumi Gakuen,

370
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,647
attorney Ms. Mizuno. Ms. Mizuno, please.

371
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,886
Um.

372
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,658
Nice to meet you, everyone.

373
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,293
I'm Naomi Mizuno.

374
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,595
Myself,

375
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:47,300
and Kenji Sakuragi, attorney-at-law
have come here for just one reason.

376
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,704
That is to get you accepted into UTokyo.

377
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,841
Starting this year, third-year students

378
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,643
will have a newly established course.

379
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,745
Its name is…

380
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,914
the UTokyo Special Course!

381
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,062
It's a lot to take in.

382
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,830
I completely understand.

383
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,732
Who, me? UTokyo?

384
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,635
I'm sure you feel this way.

385
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,604
But it's okay.

386
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,175
When I was in high school,
my deviation score was 30.

387
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,743
She's an idiot.

388
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,746
But I studied under
Mr. Sakuragi's guidance,

389
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,816
and I got into UTokyo.

390
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,120
I want everyone to shoot for UTokyo.

391
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,356
Believe in us, and come with us.

392
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,093
If you work hard, a path will open up.

393
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,830
Okay? Everyone.

394
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,967
Ugly and stupid can go to UTokyo!

395
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,979
Just kidding.

396
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,018
That's all.

397
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,655
Thank you, Ms. Mizuno.

398
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,722
What was that?

399
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,025
Funny.

400
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:24,997
Now, a word from educational supervisor,
Mr. Sakuragi.

401
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,102
Mr. Sakuragi, go ahead.

402
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,672
Mr. Sakuragi!

403
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,241
Knock one out of the park.

404
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:37,877
I'm counting on you!

405
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,568
What a bunch of sad sacks.

406
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,571
Idiots these days are
too dumb to even look dumb.

407
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:08,474
Listen, all of you.

408
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,378
No matter what, don't go to UTokyo.

409
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,680
What?

410
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,017
What's up with him?

411
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:22,889
Mr. Sakuragi has deep intentions

412
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,757
to inspire the students, right?

413
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,225
-No.
-Huh?

414
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,693
I meant what I said.

415
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,330
You don't need to go to UTokyo!

416
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,632
Why would you…

417
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,600
I'm telling you it's worthless.

418
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,369
UTokyo, that is.

419
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,539
It's easy to get in if you know how.

420
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,309
Look at Mizuno. She's stupid and ugly.

421
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,846
Well, she isn't ugly,
but she was truly stupid.

422
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,714
But she got into UTokyo!

423
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,350
There are techniques to get in!

424
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,386
If you just study using them,

425
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,289
a few of you could get into UTokyo.

426
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,393
But I don't think it's worth it for you!

427
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,828
You all seem lazy and slow.

428
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,665
Your studies and school life
are all half-assed.

429
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,301
Messing with phones and games all day.

430
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,337
Just sleepwalking through each day.

431
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,774
You're all idiots!
If only you were just idiots.

432
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,477
Indifferent, apathetic,
spoiled, and gutless.

433
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:22,114
You want to go out into the world
as you are now?

434
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,550
You'll be swallowed by the
swirling drainpipe of society.

435
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:29,155
Before you know it, you'll be exploited,
deceived, duped, and abused.

436
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,658
You'll be a slave to society all your life
and struggle until you die.

437
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,393
If you don't want that,

438
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,663
There is a quick and easy way.

439
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,367
Go to UTokyo.

440
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,206
But I can't imagine you have enough value!

441
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:52,278
Pretending to be human,
while you're not even thinking.

442
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,480
UTokyo doesn't want you!

443
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,497
What were you thinking?
Destroying my speech.

444
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,499
Destroy? Quite the opposite.

445
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:17,203
They ignored you,
but they all listened to me.

446
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,273
That may be true, but if you say that,
nobody will come.

447
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,577
If we don't get five students into
UTokyo, we're fired.

448
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,946
Finding a way to make that happen
is your job.

449
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,015
Mr. Sakuragi! Ms. Mizuno!

450
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,485
Can I see you in the staff room?

451
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,386
Mizuno will go.

452
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,288
-Huh?
-Oh, where is the Special Course room?

453
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,157
The empty room on the third floor.

454
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,191
Okay.

455
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,729
Hey, that big dude was pretty funny.

456
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,097
Stop talking about him.

457
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,367
Why not? It seems fun,
the UTokyo Special Course.

458
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,136
Are you two interested in UTokyo?

459
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,441
Kaede!

460
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:58,944
Are you alright?

461
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:00,846
Thank you.

462
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,115
Let's go.

463
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,620
Kaede! What's wrong?

464
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,388
I got a cramp.

465
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:12,091
-Can I help you stretch it?
-I'm okay.

466
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:13,359
You're okay?

467
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,065
-How is it?
-Look.

468
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,369
-Oh good!
-What!

469
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,371
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

470
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,174
Forget about UTokyo.

471
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,777
Especially you.

472
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,679
I was never interested.

473
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,583
UTokyo? I hate those stuck-up jerks.

474
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,485
Me too.

475
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,753
Huh?

476
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,689
People who think they won life
because they went to UTokyo.

477
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,892
People who act servile as soon as
they meet someone from UTokyo.

478
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,260
They're all sleazebags.

479
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,795
So why UTokyo then?

480
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:50,730
You know what?

481
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,799
You kids are too young to understand.

482
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,870
What?! Isn't that the opposite
of what you just said?

483
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,005
You just want to diss everything.

484
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,242
You come here to get a kick
out of making fun of students?

485
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,610
I should ask you.

486
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,114
What value do you have?

487
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,183
And what value do you have?

488
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,086
Don't you know?

489
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:19,358
Hang on, sir.
Kaede has a mountain of value!

490
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,360
<i>She's a national-level badminton player.</i>

491
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,630
-She's been scouted by top universities.
-Nao!

492
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:27,032
So that's why you aren't interested
in UTokyo.

493
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,004
Don't worry. UTokyo
isn't interested in you either.

494
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,774
And in a few months,
those other universities

495
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,475
won't be interested either.

496
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,744
Let's go, Kaede.

497
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,113
What gives? He's a creep.

498
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,423
What?

499
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,795
<i>What's this?</i>

500
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,431
A list of students who could
get into UTokyo.

501
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,568
A list? It's just two people.

502
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,537
Don't say that.

503
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,139
<i>Our top of science is</i>
<i>Ryo Fujii from Class 5.</i>

504
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:10,609
<i>An incident on exam day</i>
<i>forced him to come here.</i>

505
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:15,181
<i>His grades are high, and he could</i>
<i>have a shot at UTokyo.</i>

506
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,348
Yes?

507
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,250
Fujii, do you want to try for UTokyo?

508
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,718
I've heard you could do it…

509
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,854
I do plan to try for UTokyo.

510
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,189
Really? Well then…

511
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,357
But I don't plan to join your course.

512
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,627
If I study with those idiots,
I might catch it.

513
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,029
The stupidity.

514
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,701
<i>The second is the top of arts,</i>
<i>Mari Kosugi from Class 7.</i>

515
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:38,671
<i>She has excellent grades.</i>

516
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,773
<i>But she is not interested in university.</i>

517
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,641
<i>She wants to get a job after graduation.</i>

518
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,476
Um, Mari Kosugi?

519
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,413
That's me.

520
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,349
-Uh, UTokyo…
-I'm not interested in UTokyo.

521
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,051
I'm in a hurry.

522
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:53,819
Hey, Kenta.

523
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,958
Wow! So this is the famous badminton team.

524
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,026
This is the only thing we're top-level at.

525
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,062
They placed second
at the Inter-high last year.

526
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,599
Iwasaki and Kiyono, "Iwa-Kiyo"
are popular in school too.

527
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,500
Especially the ace, Kaede Iwasaki.

528
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,670
They say she has a shot at the Olympics.

529
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,239
She's super talented.

530
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,743
Stop practice. Let's greet
the vice principal and Ms. Mizuno.

531
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,644
Yes!

532
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:26,218
-Hello.
-Hello!

533
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,286
Wow, so polite.

534
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,755
Mr. Miyamura, sorry I interrupted.

535
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,626
Okay, get some water and restart.

536
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:34,560
Yes!

537
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:35,561
You can do it!

538
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,063
-Oh, Iwasaki.
-Yes?

539
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,832
How are you feeling?

540
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,401
I'm in great condition.

541
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,771
Good luck at the spring tourney.
But don't push too hard.

542
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:46,906
Thank you.

543
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,976
Ms. Mizuno, um…

544
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,245
It's about Mr. Sakuragi.

545
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,180
Yeah? What is it?

546
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,187
Oh, it's nothing. Excuse me.

547
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,459
I wonder if Iwasaki
is interested in the Special Course?

548
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,763
She already heard from
a top team, Seinan University.

549
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,798
They want her on a sports recommendation.

550
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,867
At any rate, UTokyo's not for her.

551
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:15,768
You're right.

552
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,672
There are other students with guts
who are promising.

553
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,679
What are you doing, Iwasaki?!

554
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,915
Fifty burpees.

555
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,083
Okay.

556
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,856
1, 2…

557
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,927
You're off your game today.

558
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,965
I blame him. Sakuragi.

559
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,835
He might expose my shoplifting.

560
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,303
Did he threaten you?

561
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,441
He said in a few months,
my recommendations will dry up.

562
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,219
No applicants today…

563
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,059
UTOKYO SPECIAL COURSE

564
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,764
You're not moving in here, are you?

565
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,666
You said there was a place to sleep.

566
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,634
Not here! Students come here!

567
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,037
-Will they?
-They will.

568
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,772
I'll go get five right now.

569
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,044
Oh look, here's a course hopeful now.

570
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,581
Kosugi, I knew it!

571
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,615
Come in!

572
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:41,987
Hey…

573
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,555
Are you okay?

574
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,130
Take your time…

575
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,767
We're less popular than an insect.

576
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,769
You just watch.

577
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,238
Students will rush in
asking to get into UTokyo.

578
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,545
Look. This time for sure.

579
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,614
Huh?

580
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,686
Is this…

581
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,122
the UTokyo Special Course?

582
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,992
Yes it is, but why?

583
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:24,797
Please! We want to get into UTokyo!

584
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,665
Mr. Sakuragi!

585
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:28,801
Sir!

586
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,438
We got our first two applicants!

587
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,972
S-Sir?

588
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,743
Anyway, come in.

589
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,984
A giant stag beetle.

590
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:46,885
Yeah.

591
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,491
-It's huge.
-No!

592
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,734
Mr. Sakuragi.

593
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,107
It was hard to speak up at school, so…

594
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,542
Um…

595
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,515
Is it truly easy to get into UTokyo?

596
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,017
What are the odds?

597
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,553
What are your specific study methods?

598
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,223
You said we're not worth going to UTokyo.

599
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,858
What sort of person is worthy?

600
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:33,332
Ms. Tamura says you've got problems.

601
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,869
What sort of problems?
I searched online but I couldn't…

602
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,337
Can you swim?

603
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:42,808
I'm not good at the crawl.

604
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,944
But I can breaststroke 25 meters
in 23 seconds.

605
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,020
W-What are you doing?!

606
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:56,488
Feels good, doesn't it?

607
00:35:58,624 --> 00:35:59,458
Hey!

608
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,027
Hey! Don't leave!

609
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,031
At least pull me up! Hey!

610
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,933
How's our teacher, <i>senpai</i>?

611
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,069
Stop calling me <i>senpai</i>.
We got into UTokyo together.

612
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,805
A <i>senpai</i> in high school
is always a <i>senpai</i>.

613
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:17,576
Forget that. What about Mr. Sakuragi?

614
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,245
Awful. He ruined the opening ceremonies.

615
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:23,048
When students come, he ignores them
and goes away.

616
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:26,451
Plus Mr. UTokyo himself is saying,
"Don't go to UTokyo."

617
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,287
He changed so much in two years.

618
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,657
That incident two years ago
must've really affected him.

619
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,660
-I guess.
-I don't really get it.

620
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,428
It's hardly online at all.

621
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,397
I've got all the baseless facts here.

622
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:42,267
Hey, was that student really the cause?

623
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,368
Yoneyama?

624
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,803
Yeah, that kid.

625
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,639
That day, two years ago.

626
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,975
<i>I can't forget that day.</i>

627
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,144
TWO YEARS AGO

628
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,281
Excuse me.

629
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,651
-How many?
-Of eight, seven passed.

630
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,620
Oh…

631
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:06,225
You're not happy? That school
has a deviation score of 45.

632
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,559
Seven at once is great!

633
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,729
-Who failed?
-It was Yoneyama.

634
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,710
KEITA YONEYAMA

635
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,346
<i>You'll get lots of education consulting</i>
<i>work now!</i>

636
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,015
What's wrong?

637
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,752
Kishimoto, don't make me say it.

638
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm not a teacher. I'm a lawyer.

639
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,722
It's not so simple.

640
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:40,792
Schools from around the nation will want
you to be their education consultant.

641
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,328
As manager of this office,
I can't ignore them.

642
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,231
You just produced amazing results.

643
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,332
One failed.

644
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:48,867
Just one!

645
00:37:56,842 --> 00:38:00,345
You still look down.
Eat something nice and cheer up.

646
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,882
-Where are we going?
-I found a good place.

647
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,184
It has two Michelin stars.

648
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,587
We can walk from here.

649
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,059
-There it is.
-Ah.

650
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,431
Sir?

651
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,967
YONEYAMA

652
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:23,735
Go on ahead.

653
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,809
Hello? Yoneyama?

654
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,479
-Sir…
-Hello?

655
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,550
-Hello?
-Sir!

656
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,087
Sir!

657
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,460
Yoneyama.

658
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,790
Sir!

659
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,068
Sir!

660
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,873
Where's Yoneyama?

661
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,682
My son…

662
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,219
How could this happen?

663
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,990
The University of Tokyo?

664
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,428
He could've just graduated,

665
00:39:56,495 --> 00:40:00,532
and gone to a fine university,
and had a good life.

666
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,168
Why did you tell him to go to UTokyo?

667
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,438
Why UTokyo?

668
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,674
<i>Somehow the news got out.</i>

669
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,845
<i>All the tabloid shows and magazines</i>
<i>in the country were abuzz.</i>

670
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,348
<i>Don't you think it was the mother?</i>
<i>Who leaked it.</i>

671
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:20,152
Right? That's still the biggest mystery.

672
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,219
Why?

673
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:26,091
To do that would mean to expose
her son to public opinion.

674
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,692
Would she really?

675
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,528
At any rate,

676
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,731
Mr. Sakuragi's reputation
plummeted after that.

677
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,234
But why didn't he fight back?

678
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,204
You were right with him. You should've.

679
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,806
I had planned to.

680
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,141
<i>But the day he was discharged,</i>

681
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,377
<i>I went to get him, and the room was empty.</i>

682
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,815
<i>His house as well.</i>
<i>I still don't know where he went.</i>

683
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,650
<i>I see…</i>

684
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:56,321
The lawyer he built his career with,
Kishimoto, she must've been shocked.

685
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:58,089
She's a strong person.

686
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,592
Kaori Kishimoto Law Office…

687
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,095
Toranomon, district 7,
that's just around the corner.

688
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,432
I had no choice. Mr. Sakuragi is missing.

689
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:11,369
I'm closing this place,
and taking over the clients.

690
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,605
And I'll need your help.

691
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,408
You'll stay, right?

692
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,478
<i>But you didn't stay.</i>

693
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,814
I felt responsible for Yoneyama.

694
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:26,384
And I felt bad for Mr. Sakuragi.

695
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:31,623
He changed my life.

696
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,758
<i>Even if he's… like this now.</i>

697
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,231
<i>Now you'll have to be his leader.</i>

698
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:43,001
First, make sure you don't lose
the two students who joined your course.

699
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,670
If he sees the students working hard,

700
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,739
maybe he'll get motivated too.

701
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,140
Yeah.

702
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,277
<i>This week, char siu noodles,</i>
<i>normally 900 yen,</i>

703
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,280
<i>are 800 yen, a discount of 100 yen!</i>

704
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,948
Char siu noodles are cheap this week?

705
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,483
Yes, they're very good.

706
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,118
-Okay, I'll have that.
-Yes.

707
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,953
-One char siu noodle.
-Okay!

708
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,556
Thank you for waiting, here is your order.

709
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:05,891
Sir.

710
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,561
We met in front of the store.
I'm Akira Seto from Class 1.

711
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:10,462
Oh!

712
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,431
"Setoya."

713
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,601
-Is it your parents' shop?
-It used to be.

714
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,137
They died in an accident,
and now my sister runs it.

715
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,807
Hey sis. This is Mr. Sakuragi from school.

716
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,976
Thanks for teaching my brother.

717
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,046
She's working hard.

718
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,382
When I graduate, I want to take over.

719
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,695
Hey, you're not aiming for
UTokyo, are you?

720
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,798
-What?
-That teacher who threw you in the sea.

721
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,301
He's Sakuragi, who got
all those kids into UTokyo.

722
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,837
-Why…
-My old classmate at Tatsumi told me.

723
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,740
Why did you go to talk to him?

724
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,143
-I, uh…
-Hang on.

725
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,145
Your dumb ass trying for UTokyo?

726
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,214
Of course not.

727
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,918
I wanted to get advice for your
UTokyo entrance exams.

728
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,353
Huh.

729
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,254
That's a lie.

730
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,591
I'm home!

731
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,560
-Yuta. Don't tell Mom.
-Yuta, I'll make dinner now!

732
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,729
Tell me the truth.

733
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,434
If you don't, I'm telling.

734
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:25,203
Tell me.

735
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:28,807
Tell me!

736
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,310
We'll do all of this today.

737
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:37,082
What's wrong? Are you scared?

738
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,116
Uh, no.

739
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,087
I'm so happy you're being strict.

740
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,488
Huh?

741
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,825
We know we have to work ten times
as hard to get into UTokyo.

742
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,060
So we're glad.

743
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,496
-I'll do it!
-I'll do it.

744
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,867
Kohashi… Iwai…

745
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,638
There's no point in getting motivated.

746
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,806
This is class time.

747
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,275
Isn't it mean to say there's no point?

748
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:07,912
That sort of motivation breaks easily.

749
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,714
Hey, Sir!

750
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,920
-Sorry, that teacher is always sleeping.
-Ma'am.

751
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,389
Please.

752
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,725
Shave our heads.

753
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,996
-But…
-People always judge us on our looks.

754
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:28,199
We take pride in our hair color.

755
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:31,236
But other people just see us as punks.

756
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:35,674
But you didn't abandon us
and tried to see us face-to-face.

757
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,076
That makes me pretty happy.

758
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:41,413
We're not concerned about our hair now.

759
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,681
Only UTokyo.

760
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:46,484
We want to get into UTokyo,
and show everyone.

761
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:53,024
Got it. Let's show everyone together.

762
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,292
Okay!

763
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,297
Yeah, yeah! Iwai, it's great!

764
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,866
Ma'am, get right in there.

765
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,334
-Please!
-Okay!

766
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:09,708
MIZUNO FORCES STUDENTS TO SHAVE HAIR

767
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:11,342
But…

768
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:15,513
That video was uploaded to a video site
several days ago.

769
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,981
Goodness gracious.

770
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,618
How behind the times could
the UTokyo Special Course possibly be?!

771
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,787
It was the students' own request…

772
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,156
Those two would never say such a thing.

773
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,158
They're troublemakers.

774
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,593
No…

775
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,361
-Mr. Tsuji?
-Yes.

776
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:35,033
And this is you, Mr. Sakuragi, isn't it?

777
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:41,806
Yes.

778
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:44,042
It's me, without a doubt.

779
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,710
Horrible! How could you…

780
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,547
Now, now!

781
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,851
There must have been
educational intentions, right?

782
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,752
Intentions?

783
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:56,221
Nothing of the sort.

784
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,990
Can you even call yourself a teacher?
Answer me!

785
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,325
Ms. Tamura.

786
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,331
I'll bring this up
at the next board meeting.

787
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,434
We'll also discuss whether
you should stay or leave.

788
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,270
Okay.

789
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:18,943
You've got no proof, have you?

790
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,112
But that shaving video.

791
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,815
You said you were filming
to remember the day.

792
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,184
Just like that, we're criminals?

793
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:29,587
Isn't this harassment? Wanna take a video?

794
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:30,588
Hey there!

795
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,258
You're really behind the times.

796
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,794
Your speech at the opening ceremonies
made me laugh.

797
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,264
"You can do it if you try."
That doesn't fly with us.

798
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,834
You lied about wanting to go to UTokyo?

799
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,838
-Of course I did!
-You really are naive.

800
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:50,108
Even UTokyo can't fix stupid.

801
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:54,279
You might be doing this as a joke.

802
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,949
But I truly meant to send you to UTokyo.

803
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:59,617
You're wrong in the head.

804
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:04,022
Someone changed my life by helping me
get into UTokyo.

805
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,791
And now I want to change yours.

806
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:09,360
And so you want to fix the video problem.

807
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,862
Of course I do.

808
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,431
In order to invite us here,

809
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,967
there are teachers
who risked their careers.

810
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,570
We have to produce successful
UTokyo candidates.

811
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:22,073
Oh okay, in that case…

812
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,476
"I'm very sorry! I went too far."

813
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:28,413
If you bow down your head,
I'll think about it.

814
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,982
Do it. Quickly.

815
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,251
Hurry!

816
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,386
Do it!

817
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:43,394
I'm very sorry.

818
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:45,630
I went too far.

819
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:49,100
Alright! We got it!

820
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,737
But here's my answer.

821
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:56,674
We don't know anything about the video!

822
00:47:56,741 --> 00:48:00,645
And we don't care about UTokyo!

823
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:04,148
I did what you said and now this?

824
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,752
Don't mess with me. You rotten idiots.

825
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,287
I withdraw my offer!

826
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:13,458
Scary! Let's post a video of the
abusive teacher's real feelings.

827
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:16,227
Stop! Abuse! Ow!

828
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,063
Your lives are shit.

829
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,064
Sir…

830
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,033
Wasting time.

831
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,602
Are you lecturing me?

832
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,605
Hey! What are you doing? Give it back!

833
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,574
What? Oh! Whoa!

834
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,345
What are you doing?!

835
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,016
Ow, ow, ow…

836
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,589
If you think an adult wouldn't
hurt a child, you're mistaken.

837
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,692
Go ahead, punch me! Hey, Iwai!

838
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,896
Can teachers punch students?

839
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,765
It's corporal punishment.

840
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,800
I'm not a teacher.

841
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,639
I'm a lawyer.

842
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,007
Sir!

843
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:06,477
Hey, let's go. Hurry!

844
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,616
They really will fire you.

845
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:14,585
I'd prefer to be fired.

846
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:17,255
I'd be out of here in a flash.

847
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,193
I can't get a good sleep in.

848
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,696
Let me sleep in peace.

849
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,166
You can't accept defeat.

850
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,736
You say it was a setup. Where's the proof?

851
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,138
I'm saying, if you ask those two…

852
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,675
I already asked.
They said they were forced.

853
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,744
And you believed them?

854
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,981
Okay, let's say what you say is true.

855
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:47,452
Would they sacrifice their hair,
which they valued a lot,

856
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:50,154
just to chase you out for no reason?

857
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:51,889
Pardon me!

858
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,658
I told you to never come in here again!

859
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:57,362
I'm sorry,
but I thought you should see this.

860
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:00,865
<i>I'm very sorry. I went too far.</i>

861
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:07,205
It's over for you two.

862
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,455
What a beautiful view!

863
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,223
Why'd you do that?

864
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,492
It's punishment for throwing Amano in!

865
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,528
Your face wasn't shown
clearly in the shot.

866
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,764
This time we got it.

867
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,135
-Do it.
-Okay.

868
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,173
Apologize for throwing Amano in the sea.

869
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:53,344
There's one more apology.

870
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:55,279
Yoneyama too.

871
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,182
Apologize to them and I'll help you.

872
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,551
How does my apology benefit you?

873
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,020
We'll be heroes

874
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:07,024
if we get the asshole who drove
his student to near suicide to apologize.

875
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:10,828
Hurry and apologize.
"Sorry for driving you nearly to suicide."

876
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,763
"I'm sorry for injuring my student."

877
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,466
What'll you do if I drown out here?

878
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,468
That'll just be treated as suicide.

879
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,036
You've got a checkered past.

880
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,506
Idiots, don't think
you'll get away with this.

881
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:25,476
We do think so, we do think that!
There's no proof!

882
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:29,213
This time of day, nobody's here,
and nobody's watching.

883
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,783
You've got two marks on your record.
Nobody will listen to you.

884
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,752
Idiot!

885
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,788
Let's go.

886
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,360
MIZUNO

887
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,229
Where is he? At such an important time.

888
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,799
<i>But it's just as the chairman said.</i>

889
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,235
<i>Why did those two do such a thing?</i>

890
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:54,805
<i>What's their reason for chasing us out?</i>

891
00:52:57,108 --> 00:53:01,379
"Important: Loan Repayment Demand Notice."
Oh no.

892
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:06,117
"Your repayment date has passed,
and you haven't paid."

893
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,518
"If you do not pay,

894
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:11,088
you will be charged a late fee,
and your contract will be canceled."

895
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:15,526
Whoa, oh no. I'm going out of business.

896
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,061
What'll happen to him?

897
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:20,498
Huh? He's fine, he can swim to shore.

898
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,166
I guess.

899
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:26,204
Why are you scared?
He's probably taking a bath right now.

900
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,108
Sakuragi?

901
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,379
You mock adults.

902
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,516
You think you're better than everyone?

903
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:43,854
If you do, you're true idiots.

904
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,323
What are you doing?!

905
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,292
If you can't stop teens from smoking,
you should go under.

906
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:49,760
Don't forget.

907
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:52,663
The one punished under
the Prohibition of Minors' Smoking law,

908
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,865
is the adult that didn't stop them.

909
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,068
It's unfair, ain't it?

910
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,471
Hey, you two, out of here.

911
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,240
Hurry, get out.

912
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:11,882
Let's go.

913
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:13,784
Kohashi!

914
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,057
You asshole…

915
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,794
Kohashi!

916
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:47,551
Hey, what're you gonna do about your bike?

917
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,520
I'll ask the barkeep what happened.

918
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,422
Stop at the next store.

919
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,323
Okay.

920
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,063
Hey, look!

921
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,170
Go! Go, go, go!

922
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:27,658
Weren't you in favor
of the Special Course?

923
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,060
Yes…

924
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,530
Then why did you bring me this video?

925
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:36,667
I merely want to be useful to you.

926
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,402
I don't understand.

927
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,540
Why did you betray me then?

928
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,342
Tell me the reason.

929
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:47,712
Could it be…

930
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,914
Sakuragi has dirt on you?

931
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,616
I knew it.

932
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,552
What does he know?

933
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,021
I can't say.

934
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:00,224
-Tell me.
-I can't!

935
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,859
-Hurry and tell me!
-I cant!

936
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,912
-Go in!
-Huh?

937
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,514
Go to the school!

938
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,796
What's that sound?

939
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,002
Whoa, whoa!

940
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,502
Out of the way!

941
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,206
Help us!

942
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,331
Someone! Someone!

943
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:23,260
When you try to threaten someone,
do your research.

944
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,362
I'm a former biker.

945
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:28,499
What's with that?
Trying to say you used to be tough?

946
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:29,400
Still am.

947
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,170
Stop with the bad jokes!

948
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,006
You still think an adult won't hurt a kid?

949
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,743
E-Everyone, film this.

950
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,947
What are you doing?! Get your cameras out!

951
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:47,017
Look, it's proof. Proof!

952
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:50,988
You swing that, it's going to the police.
Got it?

953
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:54,158
You feel good,
threatening an adult with that?

954
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:59,163
Your lives really are shit.

955
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,064
S-Stop.

956
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,068
The eyes of shitty slackers like you,
stay rotten even when you're an adult.

957
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:07,037
Hitting and insulting people.

958
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,673
Yet you always claim your own rights.

959
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,042
Dragging down people
trying to live seriously.

960
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,411
You'll become trash adults.

961
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:20,351
People like you could even kill someone
trying to live properly.

962
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,156
Scary times.

963
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,196
So long!

964
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,230
Sir!

965
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,379
Hey, everyone stop filming.

966
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:49,615
-Phones are against the rules.
-Out of the way now.

967
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:51,550
Mr. Sakuragi!

968
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:56,088
What's going on?
What did you do to my students?

969
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,860
Pee! Mari! Pee-pee!

970
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:03,095
Pee! Pee!

971
01:01:05,898 --> 01:01:07,867
Pee! Pee! Pee!

972
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:11,170
Stop… stop…

973
01:01:11,237 --> 01:01:12,371
Pee!

974
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:14,707
Stop! Stop!

975
01:01:14,774 --> 01:01:17,043
Don't film.

976
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:19,578
How about it?

977
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,316
Beaten down by violence.

978
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:26,585
Being laughed at and ridiculed. How is it?

979
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:32,358
Dominating with power,
and with words, it's both violence.

980
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:36,495
Tricking people and trapping them
with phones and social media is violence!

981
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:41,434
Mizuno, you said
you wanted to change them.

982
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:43,703
But that's wrong.

983
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:47,973
The only ones who can
change their shit lives is them.

984
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,776
They have to wake up on their own!

985
01:01:51,477 --> 01:01:55,181
No matter the reason,
teaching with violence is unacceptable.

986
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:58,951
They're children.
Adults have to protect them.

987
01:01:59,018 --> 01:02:01,687
Are you saying kids
can get away with anything?

988
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:04,724
Even this?

989
01:02:11,897 --> 01:02:13,966
<i>What a beautiful view!</i>

990
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:17,803
How'd you…

991
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:21,107
Smartphones sure are handy, right?

992
01:02:28,147 --> 01:02:31,584
If you don't have video and sound,
you're behind the times, right?

993
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:35,488
Respecting a child's freedom isn't
the same as spoiling him!

994
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:39,692
Not scolding their mistakes,
not giving them goals.

995
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:41,393
That's why these kids

996
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,395
have eyes like dirty ditchwater!

997
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,066
Calling it freedom,
you're not protecting students.

998
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:49,335
It's your own positions!

999
01:02:50,002 --> 01:02:52,238
You're just avoiding
responsibility and problems!

1000
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,108
You two.

1001
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:58,110
Listen carefully.

1002
01:02:58,677 --> 01:03:01,480
Don't think you'll be forgiven
just because you're kids.

1003
01:03:01,547 --> 01:03:03,616
Kids or weaklings.

1004
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:06,919
Get carried away
and you'll be crushed easily.

1005
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,622
Don't underestimate society!

1006
01:03:11,557 --> 01:03:14,426
I'll do the same thing as you, yeah.

1007
01:03:14,493 --> 01:03:16,862
Are you putting the pee video
on social media?

1008
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:19,598
-How do I…
-Stop, please!

1009
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,067
-Ms. Mizuno!
-We admit we framed you.

1010
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:23,536
Forgive us!

1011
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:28,908
If you bow down your head,
I'll think about it.

1012
01:03:31,076 --> 01:03:33,512
We're very sorry!

1013
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:36,182
Now I understand what happened.

1014
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:37,583
Principal.

1015
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:43,022
Principal! Take them to the nurse's room.

1016
01:03:43,088 --> 01:03:44,290
Huh? Okay.

1017
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:47,092
Stand up. Okay, stand up.

1018
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,228
Pardon me.

1019
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:54,133
However, your violence
has not gone unnoticed.

1020
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:58,270
Throwing a student
into the sea is violence.

1021
01:03:58,804 --> 01:04:00,506
You're misunderstanding.

1022
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:05,811
He jumped in with me.

1023
01:04:06,478 --> 01:04:08,647
Hey! Don't leave!

1024
01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:11,884
At least pull me up! Hey!

1025
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:15,988
Don't leave! Hey!

1026
01:04:23,596 --> 01:04:25,097
That's cold.

1027
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:30,502
Don't mull it over. Jump in.

1028
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,812
<i>It might have been my imagination,</i>

1029
01:04:40,479 --> 01:04:44,416
<i>but I felt like he was telling me</i>
<i>to try applying to UTokyo.</i>

1030
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:48,587
<i>I decided to make a move without thinking.</i>

1031
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,860
I want to join the UTokyo Special Course.

1032
01:04:56,495 --> 01:04:58,397
I want to learn from Mr. Sakuragi.

1033
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,602
So there's no problem, right?

1034
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:06,672
It was all a misunderstanding.

1035
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:09,508
There are students who want to join.

1036
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:15,714
You are never again to do things
that could be misunderstood.

1037
01:05:19,618 --> 01:05:23,522
Time to go, it's over.

1038
01:05:24,156 --> 01:05:27,393
Sir, thank you so much.

1039
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:30,829
Don't misunderstand.
I just want to sleep in peace.

1040
01:05:32,331 --> 01:05:33,165
Oh, right.

1041
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:37,903
This is important, here.

1042
01:05:40,072 --> 01:05:41,307
Where are you…

1043
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:44,944
Huh? I'm returning this.

1044
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:48,814
Wow, sir. That really cleared my head.

1045
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:06,598
He's trouble. If he has dirt on us,

1046
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,768
this is really bad.

1047
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:13,205
You told us to get rid of Sakuragi.

1048
01:06:13,272 --> 01:06:15,374
He really put us through it.

1049
01:06:16,642 --> 01:06:20,312
I'm too embarrassed to go to school now.

1050
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:22,381
Are you listening?

1051
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:24,750
Tossing him in the sea was too far.

1052
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:27,219
Like I said.

1053
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:30,422
You should've stopped at sharing
the videos.

1054
01:06:33,392 --> 01:06:36,128
I think a Tatsumi student forgot to pay.

1055
01:06:36,195 --> 01:06:37,029
Huh?

1056
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:39,465
This is just a token of apology.

1057
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:41,200
I can't take that.

1058
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,970
Also, could you show me that?

1059
01:06:50,242 --> 01:06:54,446
A receipt for 5,000 yen? "Survey expense"?

1060
01:06:56,715 --> 01:06:57,916
An invoice?

1061
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:02,788
A hundred thousand yen?! What is all this?

1062
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:04,723
No. No, no, no.

1063
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:09,428
TOMOYUKI SAKAMOTO

1064
01:07:09,495 --> 01:07:12,331
Is that what happened?
Well you got a new student.

1065
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:15,034
I know you can bring Mr. Sakuragi back,
<i>senpai</i>.

1066
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,802
There you go again, calling me that.

1067
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,772
<i>Anyway, I'll do what I can.</i>

1068
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:21,740
Oh, sorry, my meeting is starting.

1069
01:07:21,807 --> 01:07:24,943
Okay, I got it. Thanks for everything.

1070
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,311
Okay, bye.

1071
01:07:27,479 --> 01:07:28,547
Good work today.

1072
01:07:29,314 --> 01:07:31,050
Are these the papers you wanted?

1073
01:07:31,116 --> 01:07:32,317
Oh, thank you.

1074
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:37,990
Mr. Sakuragi might be back.

1075
01:07:39,324 --> 01:07:41,794
Huh. Is that right?

1076
01:07:44,897 --> 01:07:46,432
That's…

1077
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:52,037
a perfect chance to destroy them.

1078
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:53,939
Sir!

1079
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:02,548
You massive idiot!

1080
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:04,349
<i>I can't just quit.</i>

1081
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:05,951
<i>How will I live my life?</i>

1082
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:07,920
What you do is up to you.

1083
01:08:07,986 --> 01:08:09,388
<i>I will crush them.</i>

1084
01:08:09,455 --> 01:08:10,956
<i>The Special Course is done for.</i>

1085
01:08:11,023 --> 01:08:12,057
I can't just stand by.

1086
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:13,158
<i>Leave it.</i>

1087
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:14,927
<i>My life will be ruined.</i>

1088
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:17,563
You're a failure as a human!

1089
01:08:17,629 --> 01:08:19,398
