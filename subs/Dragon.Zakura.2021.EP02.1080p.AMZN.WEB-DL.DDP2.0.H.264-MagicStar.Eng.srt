1
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,614
Three minutes, 31, 32…

2
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,885
Hey, let's stop for today.

3
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,786
Okay.

4
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,156
But I want to do a little more.

5
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,125
See ya.

6
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:16,210
<i>You went to apologize at the store?</i>

7
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:20,181
Yeah, I found out if you
pay and apologize,

8
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,784
some places won't report you, so…

9
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,487
-How did it go?
-Well…

10
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:28,889
Sakuragi, he…

11
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:33,094
Oh, that?
A guy who looked like a teacher paid.

12
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,262
-A teacher?
-What did he say?

13
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,765
Really tall, with piercing eyes.

14
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,101
-Was it Sakuragi?
-Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,070
He said he wanted
to check the security footage.

16
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,673
Don't tell anyone, but he took it away.

17
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,142
The security footage?

18
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,578
Why?

19
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,483
-Why did he?
-He just wanted your shoplifting footage.

20
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,920
That guy…

21
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,323
What's he going to do?

22
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,693
<i>Did they come today?</i>

23
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,228
<i>Unfortunately, no.</i>

24
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,499
Yesterday, their homeroom teacher
went to talk to them, but…

25
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,736
Good grief, we were so proud of our
zero-truancy record.

26
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:20,007
All of our reforms are destroyed
because of Sakuragi.

27
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,844
But Mr. Sakuragi
did that to Kohashi and Iwai

28
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,347
because they were at fault.

29
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,849
He went too far.
And now they're staying home.

30
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,818
They've closed themselves off!

31
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,019
Yes, um…

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,656
Next time, if Mr. Sakuragi causes trouble,

33
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,725
you will also take responsibility.

34
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,560
Of course. I intend to.

35
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,562
Pardon me.

36
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,401
He's so cheeky for a vice principal.

37
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:52,006
Forget that. Is this why you betrayed me
at the board meeting?

38
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,918
-This…this is…
-Are you gay?

39
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,321
-I knew it.
-Chairman…

40
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,991
Silly. Behind the times, aren't we?

41
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,295
These days LGBT is normal.
It's the diversity era!

42
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,696
But…

43
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:19,833
We educators, we're supposed
to teach that to the children!

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,671
But you're embarrassed and try to hide it.

45
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,273
And you let yourself be threatened. Idiot!

46
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,043
Be confident!

47
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,946
But that's not what Sakuragi
threatened me with…

48
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,016
No… Did you pay for that macho man?

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,119
No, no, no. You see…

50
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,654
Nonsense!

51
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,323
Really?

52
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:49,129
He, uh, was low on cash,
so I gave him a little spending money.

53
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,998
You massive idiot!

54
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,169
Don't do it again!
That behavior leads to misunderstandings.

55
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,738
Yes ma'am! Never again.

56
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,341
-Watch Sakuragi.
-Yes!

57
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,944
I will ensure he doesn't
cause any more problems…

58
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:07,114
Oh, he can cause problems.

59
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,851
Hey, Take. Let's go early.

60
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,354
Will the Iwa-Kiyo duo get picked?

61
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,389
It depends on the match-up, I guess?

62
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,459
If Kimitsunishi High doesn't play,
they might not be.

63
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,462
I want to see them play.
Especially Iwasaki.

64
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,396
Me too!

65
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,967
They're so loud. I can't sleep.

66
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,771
The badminton club tournament members
are being announced.

67
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,843
It's amazing. The whole school's watching.

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,514
-Huh?
-Kaede.

69
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,418
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

70
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,089
-Let's nail the tournament.
-Yeah, let's.

71
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,324
-See you there.
-Okay.

72
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,765
SHOPLIFTER

73
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,537
What's going on? Something happen?

74
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,607
This was in my locker.

75
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,077
"I know what you did."

76
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,046
"Shoplifter."

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,514
Who would do this?

78
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,649
It's gotta be him.

79
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,459
Give it.

80
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,496
What are you trying to do with this?

81
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,568
You even got the security footage.
What are you going to do?

82
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,704
Oh, that video.

83
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,872
Please give it back.

84
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,843
What are you
going to do about this tournament?

85
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,146
I'm playing.

86
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,682
Don't. You can't.

87
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,886
My spot at Seinan
depends on this tournament.

88
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,357
I can't quit. It's impossible.

89
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,194
Huh. Do what you want.

90
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,431
-Hang on…
-Kaede!

91
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,503
He's going to ruin me.

92
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:14,875
My life will be ruined.

93
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,246
Team competition, first round.
Doubles first game.

94
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,648
Iwasaki and Kiyono.

95
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,552
Next, Okamoto and Abe.

96
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:30,157
First singles match,
Yoshikawa, then Kiyono.

97
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,659
Last is Iwasaki.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,797
We can win the first round.
The problem is the next one.

99
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,900
Kimitsunishi will win.

100
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,537
<i>Their doubles, Yamano and Ukita,</i>
<i>are ranked second in the prefecture.</i>

101
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:48,175
They'll play the number one pair,
Iwasaki and Kiyono.

102
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,512
Coming to see this match,
is Kashiwagi from Seinan,

103
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,714
and other top university coaches.

104
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,550
This is where your lives are decided.

105
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,786
Defeat them.

106
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,954
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,458
Kiyono, concentrate!

108
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,999
Iwasaki, run!

109
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:14,568
Run!

110
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,871
Get it, get it. Keep running!

111
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,008
Get it! Run, run!

112
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,010
Next is right!

113
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,180
Kaede's really amazing.

114
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,716
Of course, they say she's
Olympic material.

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,486
I wanna try too.

116
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,221
Huh?

117
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,489
Iwasaki, go!

118
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,627
I want to devote myself to something
like Kaede.

119
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,634
That really impacted me.

120
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,138
Mr. Sakuragi's speech.
Ugly and stupid, lazy and slow.

121
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,741
-Oh, that was…
-But I was happy.

122
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,476
Huh?

123
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,278
For the first time in my life,
I got scolded.

124
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,914
I've never even been scolded
by my parents.

125
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,785
So I was like,
"Wow, some adults really care."

126
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,756
Until now, I can't remember ever
working hard for something.

127
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,493
I never continued private lessons
or school clubs.

128
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,695
Everyone would be like, "That's okay!"

129
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,565
But I feel like here,
I could work hard or something.

130
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,703
Isn't that a weird reason
to apply to UTokyo?

131
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,239
Not at all! Any reason will do at first.

132
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,542
Yay! We got our second person.

133
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,713
I've been listening.
What a selfish reason.

134
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,580
I can't sleep.

135
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,850
Are you living there?

136
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,585
Sorry, it's distracting, right?

137
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,421
Who are you?

138
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,124
This is Nao Hayase. She wants to join us.

139
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,160
We've got some strange students.

140
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,795
You should say "eager".

141
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,931
Thank you for having me.

142
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,402
Let me say one thing.

143
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,804
-You too, Amano.
-Huh?

144
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,241
Don't tell your parents
you're in the UTokyo course.

145
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,444
-Huh?
-I can't stand fussing.

146
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,613
Sir.

147
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,583
Sheesh.

148
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,754
Alright, first we'll have a test.

149
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,423
-Already?
-You'll take this.

150
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,226
Last year's Common Test
for University Admissions.

151
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,429
That's the big January test.
No way. I can't.

152
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,331
It's too sudden…

153
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,569
It's okay. The purpose is to get data
on where your academic level is now.

154
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,503
Data?

155
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,638
What's the first step to UTokyo?

156
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,508
-Know thyself.
-Know thyself?

157
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,878
Where's your level now?
Where do you stand nationwide?

158
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,480
Which subjects are you good at?
Which need work?

159
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,183
We need subjective data

160
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,519
to make a strategy for your exam.

161
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,622
Here's today's schedule and tomorrow's.

162
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,525
Five subjects and seven exams in two days?

163
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,093
Yes, just like the real test.

164
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,729
Seriously? Sounds harsh.

165
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,098
Stop complaining. Here we go.

166
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,401
Three, two, one.

167
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,970
Start!

168
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,708
SHAME ON YOU

169
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,842
QUIT BADMINTON SHOPLIFTER

170
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,210
Again…

171
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,387
Alright, you're done. Good work.

172
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,458
I can't do this. I can't think.

173
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:28,762
You both worked hard.
We'll do the rest after lunch tomorrow.

174
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,666
-Rest well today.
-Tomorrow? That's depressing.

175
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,937
I know you can't do it now.
You can improve by next year.

176
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,438
I think I'll quit.

177
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:39,840
Huh?

178
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,608
It's not for me.

179
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,543
I'm not trying out for UTokyo.

180
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,213
-Hayase!
-Sorry. Goodbye.

181
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,581
Hey, hey Hayase!

182
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,317
Hey, Hayase.

183
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,753
<i>What was that about? Giving up so fast.</i>

184
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,755
-Leave it.
-But…

185
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,691
This is on the house. From my sister.

186
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,825
Huh?

187
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,695
Wow, thanks. Thank you very much.

188
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,464
You always help my brother so much.

189
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,600
Please enjoy it.

190
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,568
Hayase already quit?

191
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,837
Yeah. After one day!

192
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,773
Well, that's who she is.

193
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,578
AMANO
SORRY. I QUIT.

194
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,281
-Seriously? Why?
-Amano quit too?

195
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,184
I thought he was promising.

196
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,455
-It's too bad.
-This is your problem too.

197
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,991
I can't just stand by and let them quit.

198
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,793
I'll make a call.

199
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,635
Tell those guys it's about time
they showed up at school.

200
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,305
-Huh?
-Iwai and Kohashi.

201
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,876
You made their video, didn't you?

202
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,480
It used the same editing app
as this video.

203
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,084
I'm the culprit just for that?

204
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,619
I have other reasons.

205
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,356
I should ask what you're doing.

206
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,094
You got that video
from the store security camera.

207
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,696
Are you blackmailing students?

208
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,565
Maybe.

209
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,668
Akira, a delivery. To Iida's house.

210
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,002
Okay.

211
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,049
Where are they heading?

212
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,088
Mizuno speaking. Yes, I'm still here.

213
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,356
-Whoa!
-What?

214
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,892
I'll go right away.

215
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,229
-Let's go. Thanks!
-What is it?

216
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,163
Let's go.

217
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,351
Seto, you're here too.

218
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,653
I heard sirens on my way back.

219
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,421
It's awful, isn't it?

220
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,425
Mr. Sakuragi, Ms. Mizuno.

221
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,427
Over here!

222
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,196
Yes!

223
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,199
Sorry, excuse me. Let me through.

224
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,433
Sorry, pardon me.

225
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,208
It was the Special Course room?

226
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,109
Yes.

227
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,081
Hey, hey, hey!

228
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,718
It burned up!

229
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,221
-This here is okay.
-Why?!

230
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,123
All my worldly possessions!

231
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,559
It's all ashes now.

232
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,462
Really… Could you be a bit more
considerate of others?

233
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,365
One thing after another,
I can't even sleep well.

234
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,733
Come now, Ms. Tamura

235
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,571
The firemen just left.

236
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,106
They say the cause was a cigarette.

237
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,577
What do you think you're doing?

238
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,779
Smoking in a hallowed classroom!

239
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,848
He doesn't smoke in the room.

240
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,616
Who other than him?

241
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,886
Anyway, camping in the school
is disgusting.

242
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,356
I gave my permission.
It's part of his style.

243
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:20,827
Yes, he's more passionate than anyone,
staying onsite 24 hours a day.

244
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,797
Passionate?
He fell asleep with a lit cigarette.

245
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,933
Yes, that's what happened. I'm sorry.

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,168
What?

247
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,438
-So you admit it's your fault?
-Yes.

248
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,674
What are you saying?!
We were at the restaurant.

249
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,177
I put it out, but it must've had a spark.

250
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,779
After a while, I guess it ignited.

251
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,147
But…

252
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,551
You're suspended until the board
decides your punishment.

253
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,654
Get your things and leave immediately.

254
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,958
-Understood.
-Huh?

255
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,235
<i>Why did you lie like that?</i>

256
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,537
Now Mr. Takahara is put in a tough spot…

257
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,640
-Mizuno, it's fine.
-It's not fine!

258
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,341
It's just like before.

259
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,612
With Yoneyama, if you fought back,
it wouldn't have turned out like that.

260
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,450
You graduated from UTokyo
and became a lawyer,

261
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,253
but you're still very stupid.

262
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,657
Hotel money.

263
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,997
I'm sure Mr. Sakuragi has his reasons.

264
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,634
I think he's covering
for whoever did this.

265
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,403
If the culprit is a student,

266
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,806
a teacher must teach
about taking responsibility.

267
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,542
I'll look into it.

268
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,879
<i>What, you're not hungry?</i>

269
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,548
No, I just had a hard practice today.

270
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,051
This is perfectly nutritionally balanced.

271
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,852
Eat it all and don't waste any.

272
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,789
Did you drink protein after practice?

273
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,590
-Yeah.
-Hey.

274
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,460
How's Seinan going?

275
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,996
It'll come down to the next tournament.

276
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,365
That's my daughter.

277
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:10,570
If you get in with Coach Kashiwagi,
the Olympics won't be far off.

278
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,671
I know.

279
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,341
Hey, I got an e-mail from the school.

280
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,242
There was a suspicious fire?

281
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,612
What will they do
if it affects the tournament?

282
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,948
How would Kaede know?

283
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,720
Thanks for dinner.
I'm tired so I'm going to bed.

284
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,823
You better not be getting sick.

285
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,759
She's okay.
She's focusing before the tournament.

286
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,095
She needs time alone. Right?

287
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,731
When we were athletes, we did the same.

288
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,947
<i>The UTokyo Special Course</i>
<i>is down to zero students.</i>

289
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:58,351
Correct.
I can't wait for tomorrow's board meeting.

290
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,254
Mr. Sakuragi…

291
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,491
I suppose it's over for him.

292
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,665
You're not crushing on him, are you?

293
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,735
-Of course not!
-In the commotion after the fire.

294
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,570
You were making eyes at him.

295
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,406
Don't betray me again.

296
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,976
Something like that
would never ever happen!

297
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,812
Alright then.

298
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,750
At any rate,
the Special Course is done for.

299
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,093
Mizuno!

300
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,995
-A moment.
-Yes.

301
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,766
-Good morning, Kaede.
-Good morning.

302
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,701
Huh? Nao?

303
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,205
Get this. She already
quit the UTokyo Special Course.

304
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,974
-Already?
-It's so hard!

305
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,344
Plus, if I get busy,
I can't go support you at your games.

306
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,481
-That's your reason?
-Anyway they had that fire.

307
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,983
It's good you quit that
UTokyo Special Course.

308
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,619
Yeah, bad news. Smoking at school?

309
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,189
Hayase. It's not funny.

310
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,757
It's kind of funny.

311
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,062
-A security camera?
-Yes.

312
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,465
We only have them near the exits.

313
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,034
I was looking for a hint.

314
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,602
-Sorry, go ahead.
-Got it.

315
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,204
Okay, look at this.

316
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,375
No way…

317
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,888
Iwasaki! Too slow! Fifty burpees.

318
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,223
Yes, sir.

319
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,793
Extend your knees! Knees!

320
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,263
You're not jumping enough.

321
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:38,075
A little before that fire yesterday,

322
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,211
this was on the security camera footage.

323
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,949
You told me then.

324
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:48,252
You heard the noise during your delivery
and came.

325
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,954
But on the video,

326
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:54,525
<i>you were already at school</i>
<i>before the fire.</i>

327
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,627
Why?

328
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,533
I'm not accusing you.

329
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,969
I just want to know what happened.

330
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,137
Ma'am.

331
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,239
That really hurts me.

332
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,641
You are accusing me.

333
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,343
It wasn't you, then?

334
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:16,080
It wasn't.

335
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,984
Okay.

336
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,956
Is that all?

337
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,193
There was one more person
there before the fire.

338
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,062
They were also on camera.

339
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,830
I'll ask that person.

340
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,975
Are you okay? Kaede, you look pale.

341
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,545
I'm fine. I still have practice.

342
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:51,082
Really? You shouldn't push it
and just rest today.

343
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,085
It's got nothing to do with you.

344
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:58,522
What are you saying?
I'm worried about you.

345
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,758
I want you to play in the tournament.

346
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,360
That's so annoying.

347
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,463
Stop expecting things from me.

348
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,868
Why are you so irritable?

349
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:15,406
Watching a flake who never thinks
would make anyone irritable.

350
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,444
Huh?
All you ever think about is badminton!

351
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,249
It's better than having nothing.

352
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:41,299
KANTO HIGH SCHOOL BADMINTON TOURNAMENT
CHIBA PREFECTURE PLAYOFFS

353
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,136
Wow, it's Tatsumi.

354
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:50,775
-They're cool!
-Up front to the right is Kaede Iwasaki.

355
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,576
Wow, she's so cool.

356
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,779
She actually showed up? That's crazy.

357
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:58,249
She just marches in here.
Isn't she embarrassed?

358
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,151
Hey, habitual shoplifter!

359
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:03,254
Kaede Iwasaki is a shoplifter!

360
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,221
Hey!

361
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,591
What are you saying?
Stop spouting nonsense.

362
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,560
But in the girls' bathroom…

363
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:12,496
Those posters were brutal, right?

364
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:19,270
What is all this?

365
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,304
IWASAKI IS TRASH

366
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:22,340
SHOPLIFTER
NO MERCY FOR IWASAKI

367
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,442
He did this…

368
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,952
KAEDE BADMINTON TOURNAMENT

369
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,623
DELETE

370
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,736
Huh? The teachers aren't here today.

371
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:55,239
-Kaede!
-Usually the principal and chairman come.

372
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,541
Something happened with the fire.

373
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:59,777
They're all at the school.

374
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,247
I wonder if they caught the culprit.

375
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,915
-Coach Kashiwagi is here.
-Where?

376
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:07,051
Up front in the central block.

377
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:07,985
Iwasaki!

378
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:19,230
ROUND ONE
TATSUMI GAKUEN VS SEIBUDAI CHIBA

379
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,209
Cover me.

380
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,721
Nice.

381
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:49,059
Game. First game won by Tatsumi Gakuen.
21-5.

382
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:55,032
-Is that the truth?
-Yes, I set the fire.

383
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,734
Why would you do that?

384
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:00,404
Mr. Sakuragi scolded me and I got mad.

385
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,607
After my delivery,
I snuck into the school.

386
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,044
I'm really sorry.

387
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:11,348
School rules say
we have to report it to the police.

388
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,685
-Yes, we do.
-I'll come along.

389
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,255
<i>Finally, the Kimitsunishi match.</i>

390
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:21,959
Look, the first day
of a regional tournament.

391
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,529
Seinan's Kashiwagi
and many other big university coaches.

392
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:29,333
Everyone's watching this game.
No, they're watching you.

393
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,870
This game will decide your future.

394
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:36,507
Especially Iwasaki's Seinan spot.
Get it today!

395
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,275
Yes, sir.

396
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,381
Let's go.

397
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:53,989
ROUND TWO
IWASAKI-KIYONO VS YAMANO-UKITA

398
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:26,989
Get it!

399
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:40,269
Nail it!

400
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:52,781
Rie.

401
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:55,384
Thanks.

402
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:39,494
Are you okay?

403
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:44,566
-Kaede!
-Ref!

404
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,734
I'm fine.

405
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,174
Hey, Iwasaki!

406
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,942
I just got a cramp.

407
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:02,918
<i>Go back, please.</i>

408
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:10,425
Are you okay?

409
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:12,694
I'm okay.

410
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:15,530
I can play.

411
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,867
Alright, do it!

412
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:20,369
Yes, sir.

413
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:42,190
-Iwasaki, are you okay?
-I'm okay.

414
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:35,010
Kaede, I'll take care of it.
Defend from there.

415
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:36,678
Sorry.

416
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:10,746
Alright!

417
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:21,223
Ref.

418
00:29:22,157 --> 00:29:23,592
We forfeit the game.

419
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,060
What?!

420
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:26,695
Tatsumi Gakuen dropped out.

421
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:29,131
Coach. Let me play.

422
00:29:30,465 --> 00:29:34,369
Idiot. Forfeiting because of injury
looks better to Kashiwagi.

423
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:36,838
I did it for you.

424
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:41,743
Can you play your singles if you tape it?

425
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:45,580
Yeah, if I take a painkiller I'll be okay.

426
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:47,415
I think you should sit it out.

427
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,052
What, you?
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

428
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,822
Sir, Okamoto and Abe are starting.

429
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,824
-Okay, I'll go soon.
-Sir.

430
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,660
Ice it as long as you can.

431
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:00,395
Okay.

432
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:05,734
Come with me.

433
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:09,371
Hey, let me go.

434
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:10,605
No. Come with me.

435
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:14,342
I won't! This is an important match.

436
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:16,578
You can't. Forget it.

437
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,448
If it's about the shoplifting,
just say that.

438
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:22,684
There's no proof anymore.

439
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:25,187
You set the fire.

440
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:29,925
You wanted to delete the video
and set the fire.

441
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,361
Well, Seto is saying he did it.

442
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:35,163
Seto?

443
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:39,201
Two people showed up
on the security footage from that night.

444
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:41,069
<i>Seto and you.</i>

445
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:51,012
Why isn't it here?

446
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,285
Kaede!

447
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,855
Were you practicing this late?

448
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:38,159
I'm going to look for that video
in his tent.

449
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:41,129
-Don't worry.
-No!

450
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:55,410
You didn't…

451
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:07,489
<i>Seto heard from Mizuno</i>
<i>that you were caught on camera.</i>

452
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:10,158
He suddenly said he'd confess.

453
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:13,128
I guess to protect you.

454
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:16,131
Hey!

455
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:19,134
Kaede!

456
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,435
-Dad.
-Kaede!

457
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,336
Mom.

458
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:24,005
Did you do something to your right knee?

459
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,908
She didn't do something,
she's <i>been </i>doing it.

460
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:45,291
<i>The meniscus on your right knee</i>
<i>is damaged badly.</i>

461
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:47,627
<i>It's pretty severe.</i>

462
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:51,965
If you had kept up like this,
it would have gotten worse.

463
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:54,901
Why did you let it get this bad?

464
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,871
We can remove your meniscus with surgery,

465
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:01,908
but it will make your knee unstable.

466
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:06,813
In sports like badminton where you need
a lot of knee control,

467
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:09,749
you might not be able
to play like you do--

468
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:12,218
Is there… is there another way?

469
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,587
There's PRP therapy.

470
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:18,024
It's regenerative medicine,
a new technology.

471
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,059
It doesn't result in any scarring,

472
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:22,729
and prosthetics are not put in the body.

473
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:26,265
We might be able
to return it to how it was.

474
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,935
-Okay…
-However…

475
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:33,639
It's not recommended for students
who are still growing.

476
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:37,810
So we would start therapy
after you graduate high school.

477
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:41,280
You'd also need a year of physiotherapy.

478
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:45,051
So not for two years…

479
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:50,023
<i>But just be aware.</i>

480
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:54,560
<i>This therapy has varied results.</i>

481
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:57,597
<i>You may not recover well enough</i>
<i>to compete again.</i>

482
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,433
<i>There's no guarantee.</i>

483
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:04,704
Why did you hide it?

484
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:07,774
Top athletes must care for injuries
immediately.

485
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:10,977
I'm sorry.

486
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,945
Quit the badminton club.

487
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,051
That coach doesn't even notice injuries.

488
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,953
I'll find a personal trainer
who knows therapy.

489
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,122
For now, focus on strength training.

490
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:25,158
Something that doesn't strain your knee.

491
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:26,492
Understood?

492
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,393
Yes, sir.

493
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:31,097
Two years. You'd make it in time for the
next Olympics.

494
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:36,969
What? What's funny?

495
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,605
You're a joke, that's what.

496
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,643
You don't care about her feelings,
just her athletic career.

497
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,479
Her future is at stake!

498
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,748
We're doing all we can for her!

499
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:50,750
Is it really for her?

500
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:53,286
Who are you? So rude!

501
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:57,056
What does she want to do?
Isn't that most important?

502
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:00,626
She could take this injury
as a sign to leave sports.

503
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:04,430
Preposterous! I don't need an outsider
talking to me like this.

504
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:09,068
-This is my daughter's problem.
-Yes, your daughter's problem.

505
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:09,969
Not yours.

506
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:12,972
Iwasaki.

507
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:16,843
What you do is up to you.

508
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:22,215
That's awfully noisy. Turn off your phone.

509
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,618
It's Kiyono.

510
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,754
Answer it.
It could be about the recruiter.

511
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:29,956
Okay.

512
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,165
<i>Hello, Kaede?</i>

513
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:41,067
Yeah.

514
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:44,303
<i>-How was the game?</i>
-I won.

515
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,671
But how's your injury?

516
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,508
<i>I tore my meniscus.</i>

517
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,109
I knew it.

518
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:54,547
Coach, it's her meniscus.

519
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:57,350
<i>Hey, Kaede.</i>

520
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:00,219
I talked to Coach Kashiwagi.

521
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,657
He said a torn meniscus means
you won't play for a while.

522
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:08,194
I, uh, I'm sorry.

523
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:13,032
<i>They asked me to take the spot</i>
<i>in your place.</i>

524
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:16,903
Oh.

525
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:19,605
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

526
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,508
<i>At a tough time like this for you.</i>

527
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:27,079
Yeah. See ya.

528
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,522
What did she say?

529
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:43,062
Rie got into Seinan University.

530
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,933
-What!
-Pathetic.

531
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,335
Getting bested by a less-skilled rival…

532
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:52,104
-Because you hid an injury like an idiot!
-I'm sorry.

533
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

534
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,609
-Sorry doesn't cut it! Do you understand?
-Not here!

535
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:05,851
We're going home. You need to cool off.

536
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:26,939
Hey, where are you going?

537
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:31,477
The police. Seto turned himself in, right?

538
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:34,080
I'm going to tell them I did it.

539
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,349
He won't be there.

540
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,720
Right about now, he's probably helping out
at the restaurant.

541
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:45,758
School rules say
we have to report it to the police.

542
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,593
Yes, we do.

543
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:50,396
I'll come along.

544
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:51,564
Wait.

545
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,966
What is it?

546
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,137
Before we go to the police,
shouldn't we include his family

547
00:37:58,204 --> 00:37:59,505
and discuss this well?

548
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:03,276
In Japan, arson is a serious crime.

549
00:38:03,342 --> 00:38:06,779
It can result in a sentence
equal to that of a murder.

550
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:07,713
Murder!

551
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,616
Even in a case like this,
where it was small,

552
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:14,320
the punishment for arson
of an inhabited building can be death,

553
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:16,489
or life imprisonment.

554
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,591
Considering a student's future,

555
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:21,193
and guiding them is the role of a school.

556
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,561
Even so…

557
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:26,232
The school can't just cover it up.

558
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,834
It's already been taken care of.

559
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:30,202
Mr. Sakuragi!

560
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:34,607
The fire was 100% my fault,
without a doubt.

561
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:39,979
I've already spoken to the police,
and they gave me a strong warning.

562
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:41,480
That's it.

563
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:43,516
You don't have to cover for me.

564
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,819
-Huh?
-You covered for Mr. Sakuragi?

565
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:48,454
If I were gone,

566
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:51,023
he'd lose his chance
to try out for UTokyo.

567
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,592
He's always been gunning for UTokyo.

568
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:55,361
What?

569
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,696
Anyway, Chairman…

570
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,366
As long as a student is trying for UTokyo,

571
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:02,601
we respect that freedom.

572
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:05,604
And you'll keep the Special Course, right?

573
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:10,609
So he's okay. Good.

574
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:12,645
But what about badminton?

575
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,982
I can't just quit that easily.

576
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:19,819
My mom and dad didn't make it
to the Olympics.

577
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:22,154
It's their dream for me to go.

578
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:24,757
They've spent their lives supporting me.

579
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:27,760
<i>I held my first racket when I was two.</i>

580
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:31,197
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>badminton has been my whole life.</i>

581
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:36,369
<i>I've devoted everything to it.</i>

582
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:39,839
I'd get recruited to a famous university,

583
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,308
and aim for the Olympics.

584
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:47,113
I've…

585
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:51,384
I've only ever thought about that life.

586
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:54,754
I…

587
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:57,790
What should I do now?

588
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:02,128
How will I live my life without badminton?

589
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:04,997
How indeed.

590
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:08,000
It's your life. You decide.

591
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:09,368
It's not that simple.

592
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:14,507
I've always done what my parents said.
I entered a strong school.

593
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,344
-I did what my coach told me…
-That's not all true.

594
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,813
You made those choices, didn't you?

595
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,349
You gave your life to badminton.

596
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,284
You hid your injury for that spot.

597
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:28,854
You shoplifted to cope.
Did your parents tell you to do that?

598
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,591
No, right? You decided.

599
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,760
It's your responsibility.

600
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:37,029
Don't blame others.

601
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:40,466
Yes, sir.

602
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,835
But your injury, that alone,

603
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,137
wasn't all your fault.

604
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,341
-Huh?
-Let's go catch the culprit.

605
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,178
Hey!

606
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,186
-We're you waiting?
-You're late.

607
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,621
Sorry, a lot of stuff happened.

608
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:04,790
-Here.
-Iwai?

609
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,226
You put one on too. Here.

610
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:13,265
-Get on.
-Where are we going?

611
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:14,800
Just trust my driving.

612
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:17,703
C'mon.

613
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:27,012
Hey! Drive safely!

614
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,963
Hey. They're in here.

615
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,599
-Thanks.
-The cell coverage here is really bad.

616
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,101
So they haven't contacted anyone.

617
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:53,337
-Also, here.
-You've done well.

618
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,441
-I'll buy you some ramen next time.
-Nice!

619
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:00,712
I'm opening it.

620
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,551
It's open! We're saved.

621
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:11,589
You guys? And Iwasaki too?

622
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,292
You did this?

623
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:17,428
-What are you thinking?!
-I asked them to.

624
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:21,032
I had something I really needed
to ask you two.

625
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,066
What?

626
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,541
<i>Yeah, but it really went well.</i>

627
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:32,210
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

628
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:36,714
<i>I want to know,</i>
<i>did you run into her on purpose?</i>

629
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:39,817
<i>Well, I'll leave that to your imagination.</i>

630
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:43,488
<i>At any rate, that clinched it.</i>

631
00:42:43,988 --> 00:42:47,391
<i>I was really surprised.</i>
<i>I can't believe it was that bad.</i>

632
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,895
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>her knee was reaching its limit.</i>

633
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:53,865
<i>That's why I ran her ragged on purpose,</i>

634
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:57,034
<i>and gave her all that tough practice.</i>

635
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:59,370
<i>I can really depend on you.</i>

636
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:01,639
<i>I got recruited thanks to you.</i>

637
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,542
<i>Yeah, so maybe we can meet outside</i>
<i>sometimes…</i>

638
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:05,743
<i>Nope!</i>

639
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:12,917
N-No, no, you've got it all wrong…

640
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:14,852
No? What about it?

641
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,954
You want to explain?

642
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,525
Alright, then shall I explain?

643
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:23,661
You pretended not to see Iwasaki's injury.

644
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:27,098
In fact, you gave her exercises
that stressed her knee.

645
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,333
You made Iwasaki's injury worse.

646
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,104
To ensure that Kiyono got
the Seinan University spot.

647
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:35,606
You only get one place at Seinan.

648
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:38,709
Iwasaki was practically a shoo-in,
but as a spare,

649
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,112
Kiyono's name had come up.

650
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:44,582
So to you, Kiyono, Iwasaki was in the way.

651
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:48,319
Those posters put up everywhere,
that was you, right?

652
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,655
Huh?

653
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:55,927
Did you…

654
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:58,896
What's he going to do?

655
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:03,701
Hey, is someone there?

656
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:05,803
Hey!

657
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,806
Once Kiyono got recruited,

658
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:10,675
I figured you'd expose yourself.

659
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:13,244
I got Iwai and Kohashi to stand lookout.

660
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:16,514
And they managed to take this video.

661
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:19,250
This is bullshit!

662
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:23,454
You think you can do this
and get away with it?

663
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:24,355
Bullshit?

664
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,825
That's Iwasaki's line!

665
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,195
To steal the Seinan placement,

666
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:33,631
you crushed a talented athlete's future.

667
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:35,833
You ignored Iwasaki's injury.

668
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,469
Yet you're an adviser
at a strong school like this?

669
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:40,504
Not only as a teacher,

670
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:42,673
you're a failure as a human!

671
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:58,489
I-Iwasaki.

672
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,128
How stupid.

673
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:08,299
What was the point of all my hard work?

674
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,035
I was fighting alone.

675
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,604
I thought I was hiding my injury.

676
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:17,842
I wanted that spot,
staying late every night.

677
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,978
You even burned my tent.

678
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:26,250
I don't know where you got that idea.

679
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:28,786
I got that video
and erased it immediately.

680
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:33,824
These days, you don't know
how people will use videos.

681
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:37,662
I even deleted it from the store's data.

682
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,698
If it gets out, I'm in trouble too.

683
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:43,067
The problem with shoplifting,

684
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,403
you do it once and you can't escape it.

685
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,039
You thought once wasn't a big deal.

686
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:50,007
But that one thing,

687
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:52,410
it'll ruin your life.

688
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:54,412
Just like badminton,

689
00:45:54,478 --> 00:45:56,981
people who don't follow the rules

690
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:58,215
lose at life.

691
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:01,419
Yes, sir.

692
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:04,989
Well, I shoplifted a lot back in the day,
so I shouldn't talk.

693
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,426
Anyway, when did you notice my injury?

694
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:11,629
When you tripped on the stairs.

695
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:14,265
Kaede!

696
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:16,267
<i>You said it was a cramp.</i>

697
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:20,004
<i>Your torn meniscus caught on your knee,</i>
<i>and got locked up, right?</i>

698
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,373
<i>I had the same experience long ago.</i>

699
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,743
-That's why I quit basketball.
-Oh.

700
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,746
I bet my life on it,
and I suddenly lost it.

701
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:32,950
I was so frustrated, I went wild
with a biker gang for a while.

702
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:34,919
From that point,

703
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:38,222
how did you recover?

704
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:41,459
Study.

705
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,596
When you don't have any money,
it's all you can do.

706
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,332
As I frantically worked at it,

707
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:50,234
I realized it was a shortcut.

708
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:54,338
Before I knew it, my frustration
had disappeared.

709
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:58,342
That's just what worked for me.

710
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:01,445
You decide your path.

711
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:18,462
You're aiming
for the national championships.

712
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:20,097
We can't lose now.

713
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:23,000
Do it for Iwasaki,
who can't play from her injury.

714
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:25,970
Show them the results
of all your practice, okay?

715
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:28,139
-Coach.
-What is it?

716
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,582
Good morning.

717
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,584
Good morning.

718
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,388
Why are you here?

719
00:47:46,624 --> 00:47:49,994
Today I'll be here to support
behind the scenes.

720
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:51,529
Thanks for having me.

721
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:54,365
Thank you.

722
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:59,170
Okay, let's get ready. Let's go.

723
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:00,071
Yes, sir!

724
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:04,308
Kaede.

725
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,044
What are you doing?

726
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:09,380
Even if I can't play,

727
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:12,750
I just want to do what I can.

728
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:16,287
You're scheming something.

729
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:30,201
TATSUMI GAKUEN VS GOI HIGH SCHOOL

730
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,869
KIYONO-YAMADA VS HORIE-INAGAKI

731
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:36,874
What's going on?

732
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:39,443
Oh, you came! Thanks.

733
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:42,113
Why isn't Kaede scheduled to play?

734
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:43,948
She forfeited due to injury.

735
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:46,250
-Injury?
-Iwasaki's injury.

736
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:50,121
It'll take two years
to play like she did before.

737
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:54,258
Even then,
it might not go back to how it was.

738
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:56,660
-No…
-Even so.

739
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,463
She hasn't given up her dreams
as an athlete.

740
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,032
She's doing all she can right now.

741
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:04,168
Pretty amazing.

742
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:19,183
TATSUMI GAKUEN VS GOI HIGH SCHOOL

743
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,820
KIYONO VS KOTANI
FINAL DECIDING MATCH

744
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:27,791
KOTANI: 20
KIYONO: 17

745
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:55,519
Game. First game won by

746
00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:59,256
Goi High School, 21-17.

747
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:09,967
Good game.

748
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:12,636
You got the Seinan spot and look at you.

749
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:16,273
Kashiwagi is watching.
You're embarrassing me.

750
00:50:17,508 --> 00:50:20,878
You've got to win this.
Look sharp out there.

751
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:22,413
Yes, sir.

752
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,059
-Rie.
-Huh?

753
00:50:37,795 --> 00:50:39,863
I'm not mad.

754
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:46,203
I was the one who hid my injury.

755
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:49,506
I've been playing since preschool.

756
00:50:50,908 --> 00:50:53,978
You're the best partner I've ever had.

757
00:50:56,413 --> 00:50:57,581
It's true.

758
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,254
Really.

759
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:12,229
You are strong.

760
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:15,366
You're strong!

761
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,404
Believe in yourself.

762
00:51:32,116 --> 00:51:35,152
Don't cry! Win!

763
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:39,923
And anyway.

764
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:41,892
You.

765
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,962
You can't let it end like this.

766
00:51:45,796 --> 00:51:47,998
It's unacceptable for you to lose.

767
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:54,972
Go do it for the team!

768
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:32,309
Yeah!

769
00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:35,079
Game. Match won by Tatsumi Gakuen.

770
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,452
You did it!

771
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:44,254
We won! We won!

772
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:49,693
Hip hip, hooray! Hooray!

773
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,329
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

774
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:04,575
Hoist up Kiyono!

775
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,743
Kiyono!

776
00:53:09,546 --> 00:53:11,014
Ready?

777
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:13,784
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

778
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:19,089
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

779
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:35,305
Alright.

780
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,911
Oh, what's this?

781
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,580
I'm forgetting something.

782
00:53:44,782 --> 00:53:45,783
Okay…

783
00:53:48,118 --> 00:53:50,387
I decided.

784
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:51,889
Decided what?

785
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:54,358
You want to sue your coach?

786
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:56,794
We could crush him legally.

787
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,996
Oh, I won't do that.

788
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:02,299
Without that coach,
the team would fall apart.

789
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:06,370
Even if he's like that,
he's an excellent coach.

790
00:54:07,004 --> 00:54:11,141
But after I recover, I won't hold back.

791
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:14,812
You're a softie.

792
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:24,855
-Sir.
-Hm?

793
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:27,324
I…

794
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:30,494
I want to get into UTokyo.

795
00:54:32,162 --> 00:54:34,531
I want to study sports medicine at UTokyo.

796
00:54:34,598 --> 00:54:36,900
I'll recover, and go to the Olympics.

797
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:39,336
After I retire as an athlete,

798
00:54:39,403 --> 00:54:42,005
I'll support young athletes
with sports medicine.

799
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:44,208
That's…

800
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:46,276
That's my new life plan.

801
00:54:47,811 --> 00:54:49,012
Stop talking nonsense!

802
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,617
With a mixed motivation like that,
you'll never get into UTokyo.

803
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:01,658
Right…

804
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:05,996
But I'll tell you this.

805
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:09,900
Compared to becoming an Olympic athlete,

806
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:13,537
it's much easier to get into UTokyo.

807
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:31,922
I don't play to lose.

808
00:55:33,423 --> 00:55:34,858
Bring it on.

809
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,095
Even so.

810
00:55:40,163 --> 00:55:42,199
I have to do something first.

811
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,434
-Hey, Seto.
-Hey.

812
00:55:45,736 --> 00:55:47,237
You guys.

813
00:55:47,304 --> 00:55:49,339
When did you become his minions?

814
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:52,676
He might actually be a good dude, right?

815
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:54,778
Why don't you knock it off?

816
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:56,947
Kaede's thing got worked out too.

817
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,150
-I'm home.
-Oh, hey.

818
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:01,952
Did you quit the club?

819
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:03,587
Yeah.

820
00:56:03,654 --> 00:56:07,591
I got you an interview
with a private coach next week.

821
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:09,393
So you…

822
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:13,530
-What's this?
-Ah.

823
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:16,233
Study materials?

824
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,803
Well, I just thought I'd study a little.

825
00:56:22,072 --> 00:56:24,975
Do you have time
to take it easy like that?

826
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:32,583
Studying is for people with no talent.

827
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:36,019
You don't have to spend time
on a common thing like that.

828
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:40,324
Practice is more important.

829
00:56:42,459 --> 00:56:43,293
Got it?

830
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:47,798
Yes, sir.

831
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:04,114
<i>I'm impressed you found me.</i>

832
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:06,950
I asked an acquaintance
teaching at UTokyo.

833
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:09,920
I got them to see
if your name was on the rolls.

834
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:13,991
You managed to get into UTokyo after all.

835
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:18,161
Yes, it took two years after that.

836
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:19,796
I see.

837
00:57:20,597 --> 00:57:21,465
Congratulations.

838
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,403
I don't want what happened
to ever happen again.

839
00:57:27,237 --> 00:57:29,940
I said I'd never do
educational consulting again.

840
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:31,208
That's what I thought.

841
00:57:32,843 --> 00:57:33,744
However.

842
00:57:36,046 --> 00:57:37,547
I'm starting to think,

843
00:57:38,181 --> 00:57:39,783
I want to go back to Toranomon.

844
00:57:41,184 --> 00:57:44,554
I want to work for a noble cause
one more time.

845
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:50,160
I want your blessing.

846
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:53,697
What are you saying, sir?

847
00:57:54,564 --> 00:57:56,366
Don't worry about me.

848
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:57,501
Go on and do it.

849
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:02,172
I always wanted to apologize to you.

850
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,841
I was out of my mind.

851
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:08,712
<i>It's not something you can just</i>
<i>apologize for, I know.</i>

852
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,515
I'm really…

853
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:15,285
sorry.

854
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:17,621
<i>That's what I told him.</i>

855
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:20,657
It's so convenient.

856
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:24,528
Mr. Sakuragi being back in business
makes our job easier.

857
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:26,596
So he's finally gotten motivated.

858
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:29,332
I'm sure he found a student.

859
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,501
Tatsumi Gakuen.

860
00:58:32,102 --> 00:58:33,470
Things are getting interesting.

861
00:58:33,537 --> 00:58:34,471
Yes.

862
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:38,175
I will crush them.

863
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:41,712
No matter what.

864
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,725
<i>Everything has meaning.</i>

865
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,293
<i>Why is it written that way?</i>

866
00:58:56,359 --> 00:58:58,428
<i>See it from every angle</i>
<i>to get the substance.</i>

867
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,964
You really think you'll pass?
At that level?

868
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:01,765
Shut up!

869
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:02,866
Shall we have a contest?

870
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:04,000
Let's do it.

871
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:04,968
<i>Become a YouTuber.</i>

872
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:06,770
<i>You two do Twitter.</i>

873
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:08,939
-Are you studying?
-It's nothing.

874
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:10,540
<i>We might really win!</i>

875
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:12,743
There are advantages to being idiots.

876
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:14,911
<i>Sir, do you know something?</i>

877
00:59:14,978 --> 00:59:18,749
<i>When you four pass,</i>
<i>this tree will be in full bloom.</i>

878
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:19,750
A Dragon Zakura?

879
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:21,418
There's a chance we could win?

880
00:59:21,485 --> 00:59:23,253
There are ways.

881
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,221
