1
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,752
What is that old man doing?

2
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,559
-Sir, almost there!
-Get back, it's dangerous.

3
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:05,399
Okay, okay!

4
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,268
-A little this way!
-Okay!

5
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,771
-Okay!
-It's heavy!

6
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,307
Alright, okay!

7
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,644
Sir, how's this?

8
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,980
-Good. Finish it up.
-Alright!

9
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,784
What are you doing?!
Why are you planting this?

10
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,253
I did it for you too.

11
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,690
A cherry tree?

12
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,193
A Dragon Zakura.

13
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah.

14
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,463
It's a Dragon Zakura.

15
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,602
DRAGON ZAKURA

16
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,308
The "tatsu" in "Tatsumi" means dragon.

17
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,943
This Dragon Zakura

18
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,480
will see off future students
who get into UTokyo.

19
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,616
-We've gotta have this!
-It brings me back!

20
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:56,750
Ken!

21
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,086
What do you think?

22
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,489
Thanks for coming on short notice.

23
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,958
Anything for you, buddy.

24
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,760
-I marked the price down.
-Thanks a lot.

25
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,831
-Good-bye!
-Thank you!

26
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,734
-What is this?
-"Dragon… Zakura"?

27
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,003
When you four pass,

28
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,172
this tree will be in full bloom.

29
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,675
Huh? Did you just say four?

30
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,576
-Huh?
-Hm?

31
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,417
Huh!?

32
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,919
You covered for Mr. Sakuragi?

33
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,621
If I were gone,

34
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,323
he'd lose his chance
to try out for UTokyo.

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,926
He's always been gunning for UTokyo.

36
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,930
-But that was…
-Wow, Seto. Way to go.

37
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,933
Iwasaki, aren't you happy? Another friend.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,235
Yes, I'm happy.

39
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,436
It's reassuring.

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,071
It's decided.

41
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,909
Yay! We got our fourth member.

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,879
Okay everyone, class is starting.

43
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,182
-Yes, ma'am.
-C'mon!

44
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,088
-That's enough you two!
-Okay.

45
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,157
-Call on us anytime!
-Thank you.

46
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,358
See ya.

47
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,062
Its metallic luster goes
from gold-green to red-bronze.

48
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,765
Its color changes based on the angle.
It is nocturnal.

49
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,301
-It hides in dead leaves.
-This soil is good.

50
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,069
So the bugs are healthy.

51
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,306
Ah, carabus insulicola.

52
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,309
-Yeah!
-Huh.

53
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,313
You'll need an umbrella today.

54
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,981
Heavy rain is coming.

55
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:36,750
Heavy rain?

56
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,920
It'll come at around ten.

57
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,290
-Kenta.
-Mari!

58
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,694
Mari Kosugi?

59
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,031
-The top liberal arts student.
-I don't care about UTokyo.

60
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,234
-Let's go, Kenta.
-Okay.

61
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,874
<i>Why does the UTokyo Special Course</i>
<i>have four students?</i>

62
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,778
-I'm sorry!
-If five people get into UTokyo,

63
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,947
I'll have to step down as chairman.

64
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,750
You don't need to worry.

65
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,987
Those four have among
the worst grades in our school.

66
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,556
For them to get into UTokyo
is unthinkable.

67
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,028
TOP UNIVERSITY COURSE PROPOSAL

68
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,963
What's this?

69
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:29,069
I'm going to crush the
UTokyo Special Course with my bare hands.

70
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,438
We're starting. First off,

71
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,841
I'll tell you the rules for studying here.

72
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:34,808
Mizuno.

73
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,145
Rule one. Don't tell your parents.

74
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,448
Rule two. If Mr. Sakuragi or I
tell you to do something,

75
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,952
even if you don't understand,
at least try. That's it.

76
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,721
How long do I have to
keep it from my parents?

77
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,090
I'll decide the timing and let you know.

78
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,327
If your parents find out now,
they'll just get in the way.

79
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,163
We have to build your
foundation for studying first.

80
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,699
Is that some kind of hellish training?

81
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,769
You think we're living in the past?
Mizuno.

82
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,444
All this?

83
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,513
Hang on, this is for junior high.

84
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,949
Of course. None of you know
any more than a junior high student.

85
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,519
First know that.
You're starting from the basics.

86
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,387
-Really?
-I guess so.

87
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,524
Do these workbooks, for all subjects,
in three weeks.

88
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,725
Three weeks?

89
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,228
-I guess I could do that.
-Do it at least five times.

90
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,664
-Five?
-If you can't, ten laps around the school.

91
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,132
It is hellish training!

92
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,536
And starting today,
I'll have things for you to do every day.

93
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,004
There's still more?

94
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,205
Amano, Seto.

95
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,908
Become a YouTuber.

96
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:41,809
Huh?

97
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,677
-A YouTuber?
-Hayase, Iwasaki.

98
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,680
-You two do Twitter.
-Twitter?

99
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,451
Take your own ordinary life,
and tell it to the world in English.

100
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,820
Junior high level English is enough.

101
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,156
Amano, Seto, one video per day.

102
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,760
Hayase, Iwasaki,
your quota is 20 tweets per day.

103
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,596
How dumb. I quit.

104
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,530
Wait!

105
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,932
Do what you want.

106
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,836
I have no use for a loser
who quits without trying.

107
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,071
Loser?

108
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,874
I have no reason to go to UTokyo.

109
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,743
A reason to go to UTokyo?

110
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,644
-You don't need one.
-Huh?!

111
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,482
-Who could do this without a reason?
-How's this for a reason?

112
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,418
Go to UTokyo to make
a great ramen restaurant.

113
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,986
Are you dissing ramen?

114
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,756
Is there any value in a reason
given by someone else?

115
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,227
If you want a reason to go to UTokyo,
find the answer yourself.

116
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,797
But a loser who runs away without trying

117
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,532
will never do that.

118
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,136
Fine.

119
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:48,142
Now we'll measure your current skill

120
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,577
with a junior high review mini-test.

121
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,881
-Ugh.
-Clear off your desks.

122
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,224
Wow, it's pouring rain.

123
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,429
It was supposed to be sunny.

124
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,131
Ten o'clock?!

125
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,233
You'll need an umbrella today.

126
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,435
Heavy rain is coming.

127
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,870
It'll come at around ten.

128
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,640
Seriously…

129
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,345
It's as expected.

130
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,382
-Seto got a failing score in everything.
-I figured.

131
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,318
The goal is to pass five students.

132
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,021
We need one more… two if possible.

133
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,423
I wish someone would come.

134
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,758
I have a candidate.

135
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,960
A very smart one.

136
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,330
Are you thinking of Mari Kosugi?

137
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,566
But she…

138
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,107
Hmm…

139
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,889
Wow, so this is the UTokyo Special Course.

140
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,093
-Fujii…
-What's this tent? Hilarious.

141
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,265
Seriously? This is for junior high.

142
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,133
You're at this level. Isn't that bad?

143
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,201
What do you want?

144
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,737
Nothing. I just came to see.

145
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,209
And? Which one is your type?

146
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,213
-Huh?
-You joined to get a girl, right?

147
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,882
Everyone's saying that.

148
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,918
I joined to get into UTokyo.

149
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:41,955
You really think you'll pass?
At that level?

150
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,157
What's his deal? Jerk.

151
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,627
What are you going on about?

152
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,029
You must be here
for one of those girls too.

153
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,197
Me?

154
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,167
Uh, no, I'll pass.

155
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,937
I can't stand dumb girls.
I'll catch the dumb.

156
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,138
Hey.

157
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,376
I do feel sorry for Iwasaki.
Her badminton career is over.

158
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:06,079
Her coach ditched her, and now
she's snuggling up to Sakuragi.

159
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,382
It's like, how desperate can you get?

160
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,519
-Shut up!
-Let me go.

161
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,888
Seto, Seto, stop it.

162
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,590
What are you doing? Stop!

163
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,826
Get away, split up.

164
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,464
Ryo Fujii.

165
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,768
You were there?
If you're here, stop the fight!

166
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,938
You'll never get into UTokyo. Give up.

167
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,974
If you know about me, you know my grades.

168
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,444
You caught the flu and could only take
Tatsumi's entrance exam.

169
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,880
Deviation score 68, top in science.

170
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:43,917
-Aiming for UTokyo Natural Sciences 1.
-And you think I'll fail?

171
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,623
I'm calling it.

172
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,860
A year from now, it won't be you
getting into UTokyo.

173
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,163
It'll be the UTokyo
Special Course students.

174
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,399
Wow. Shall we have a contest?

175
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,636
I don't think they could score
half the points I could.

176
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,770
Sure.

177
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,906
Let's do it.

178
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,180
<i>I hear you're having a contest with Fujii.</i>

179
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,617
I'll stand witness to this contest.

180
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,485
As you like.

181
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,587
If Fujii wins,

182
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,923
the UTokyo Special Course disbands.

183
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:27,060
-What?
-If we don't go all in, it's boring, no?

184
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,063
-If it's disbanded, we would be…
-Fired, I assume.

185
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,366
But, what about the students?

186
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,067
The students aiming for UTokyo.

187
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,469
I'll take them in.

188
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:40,641
-Huh?
-Our school has established a new course.

189
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,908
"Top Uni Course"?

190
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,345
Weren't you against becoming
a high-level school?

191
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:49,383
The chairman's educational philosophy
is to respect students' freedom.

192
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,486
Not only UTokyo, if they want to aim high,

193
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,322
we will respond to those needs.

194
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,426
By the way, Fujii says he's joining
the Top Uni Course.

195
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,396
Well? Will you do it?

196
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,630
Or won't you?

197
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,631
Of course not.

198
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:05,832
-We'll do it.
-Huh?

199
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,001
The contest is in three weeks.

200
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,138
Fujii's score
and our students' average score.

201
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,406
The higher score wins.

202
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,274
Exam questions from old UTokyo exams.

203
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,244
The chairman, Mizuno,
the Top Uni Course teacher and I.

204
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,146
We will discuss and decide.

205
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,313
Alright.

206
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,016
The loser's class will be eliminated.

207
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,852
What are you saying? We won't!
We won't do it!

208
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,426
Why did you accept such a contest?

209
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,428
The science top? We'll never win.

210
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,497
We'll be fired and homeless.
What are you doing?

211
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,100
Why are you so worried? Did you forget?

212
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,569
-Huh?
-You were a loser through and through.

213
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,304
Remember how you got out of it?

214
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,508
We destroy the inferiority complexes
they've given themselves.

215
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,878
-We'll never have such a chance.
-But what if we lose?

216
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,680
What will be, will be.

217
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,050
-More like, we'll be bankrupt!
-Oh yeah.

218
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,486
Right.

219
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,587
TOYAMA LANDSCAPING

220
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,262
CHERRY BLOSSOM TREE

221
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,497
Three hundred thousand…

222
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,500
That bastard…

223
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,237
I can't! Never, never!

224
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,740
-Be for real.
-If we lose, the course is gone?

225
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,541
That's going too far.

226
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,677
What, don't you want to win?

227
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,645
You're going to let Fujii mock you?

228
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,747
Of course not.

229
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,383
There's a chance we could win?

230
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,685
That…

231
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,620
depends on you guys.

232
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,656
Why did you say yes?

233
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,391
A fun game like this?

234
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,093
How could I miss out?

235
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,162
C'mon, don't do this for fun.

236
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,363
Don't worry.

237
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:44,965
There are ways.

238
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,502
Number one…

239
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,402
That would be…

240
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:50,904
What?

241
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,073
What?

242
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,210
-This.
-Huh?

243
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,546
We already heard that.

244
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,082
Solve problems, read explanations,
and study.

245
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,850
If you still don't get it,

246
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,685
teach each other.

247
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,120
Teach each other?

248
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,023
Amano, you teach math. Hayase, literature.

249
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,958
Iwasaki, your English was highest.

250
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,227
-Seto.
-Yes!

251
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,328
You're bad at everything.

252
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,465
I know that.

253
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,602
But idiots teaching other idiots?
What's the point?

254
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,105
That's it. You said something good.

255
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,374
There are advantages to being idiots.

256
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,377
If you're with someone who
knows a little more,

257
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,880
your brain decides that you can do it too.

258
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,850
Plus, the one teaching
gets to organize their knowledge,

259
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,921
unclear parts become clear,
and their degree of understanding goes up.

260
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,056
-Huh.
-Wow.

261
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,693
Number two. Have you started
YouTube and Twitter yet?

262
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,061
Well…

263
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,797
People who move slowly miss opportunities.

264
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,132
Especially Amano.

265
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't think, just do it.

266
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,903
-Uh, okay.
-And number three.

267
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,507
Before school in the morning,
and after school,

268
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,375
you'll get a problem from Mizuno.

269
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,411
A problem? What do you mean?

270
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,712
You'll understand eventually.

271
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,681
Right?

272
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,817
I see…

273
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,319
Listen.

274
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,356
While you're here worrying,
Fujii is getting smarter.

275
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,291
We have three weeks.

276
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,461
How you spend that time is up to you guys.

277
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,363
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,065
Yes, sir.

279
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,959
That's what YouTubers do, right?

280
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,934
UTOKYO SPECIAL COURSE

281
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,371
<i>What is a three-day monk?</i>
<i>Explain in one sentence.</i>

282
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:05,839
A quiz?

283
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,643
-Thank you for waiting.
-A three-day monk…

284
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,810
That's Hayase.

285
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,848
Hey! Well, I thought so too.

286
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,617
Three-day monk…

287
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,553
"Giving up easily," I guess?

288
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,524
Why is she asking this?

289
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,298
<i>Where are most pumpkins</i>
<i>sold in Japan produced?</i>

290
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,966
Hokkaido?

291
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,538
Mexico?

292
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,542
Mine is from New Zealand.

293
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,681
MINE IS FROM NEW ZEALAND.

294
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,285
<i>Why do you think most pumpkins</i>
<i>come from those places?</i>

295
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,887
Why?

296
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,556
How would I know?

297
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,793
Um, "I have good…"

298
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,629
Do I need an "a"?

299
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,900
"I have a good day today."

300
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,469
Is "have" right?

301
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,307
Good enough. Eighteen tweets to go.

302
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,011
I have to do that too.

303
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,348
I don't have time for a quiz.

304
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:34,160
<i>Red sky in morning, sailors take warning.</i>
<i>Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Why?</i>

305
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,297
That's just a proverb.

306
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,123
Watch it.

307
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,465
Everyone, did you think
about the problems?

308
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,167
I did think about them…

309
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,037
First, the pumpkin-producing regions
problem.

310
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,341
In addition to Hokkaido,
there were Mexico and New Zealand.

311
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,177
Why are those three areas common?

312
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:28,982
Hokkaido is cold, Mexico is hot.
I couldn't find anything in common.

313
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,985
When are pumpkins in season anyway?

314
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,554
Summer? No, it's winter.

315
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,426
Hayase, what's wrong?

316
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,764
Is there any point to this?

317
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,699
What are you saying?

318
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,502
Why are we doing all these
nonsense quizzes?

319
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,505
Fujii is way ahead of us.

320
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,608
He had a huge English notebook
full of sticky notes.

321
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,610
There's no time before the contest.

322
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,246
If everyone has time
to talk about pumpkins,

323
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,482
we could be memorizing English words.

324
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,150
Okay, let me ask you.

325
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,086
How do you memorize those words?

326
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,657
Say them out loud,
or write them over and over?

327
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,392
Classic exam failing method.

328
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,060
So what should I do?

329
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,963
Smart people have good memories.

330
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,131
We can't win.

331
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,132
You're wrong.

332
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,035
Having a good memory

333
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,472
doesn't make much of a difference,
save for some unique people.

334
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,509
In UTokyo, 80% of the students
have the same memory as you.

335
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,177
Really?

336
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,046
Then why…

337
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,615
-There are tricks to remembering.
-Tricks?

338
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,183
For example…

339
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,688
What does this word mean?

340
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,325
-I think it means to get together?
-Yes.

341
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,560
Okay, here's a question.

342
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:52,198
Why does "unite" mean "get together"?

343
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,401
Why?

344
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,139
Because somebody decided
that's what the word was?

345
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,608
By some important person a long time ago?

346
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,076
You can't think like that.

347
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,113
Hayase, what kind of ability do you think
UTokyo wants the most?

348
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,114
Um…

349
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,851
Knowing lots of difficult things?

350
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,555
No. How well you can consider
the substance of things.

351
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,523
That's it.

352
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,391
Substance?

353
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,559
In this case,

354
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,396
I would first look up the origin
of the word "unite."

355
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,764
And then…

356
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:30,370
I would learn that "uni" means "one."

357
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,607
Making something one is "unite,"
which is why it means "get together."

358
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,478
It can also mean "combine," "link"
and "marry."

359
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,747
Another meaning is,
"possess in combination."

360
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,751
If you consider they all come from the
word meaning "one" it's easy to remember.

361
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,152
Yeah it is…

362
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,254
There are many other "uni" words.

363
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,123
Tell me what you think of.

364
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,658
Uni…

365
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,561
-Uniform!
-Yes.

366
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,129
So why is "uni" used there?

367
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,698
Because a team all wears
the same clothing.

368
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,099
-That's right.
-Yay!

369
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,267
Anything else?

370
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:06,072
At a university, you can learn
many things in one place?

371
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,275
Good. Keep it up. Hayase?

372
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,978
Um… uni… unicorn!

373
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,480
-Because they have one horn?
-That's right!

374
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,381
Seto?

375
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,016
Uni…

376
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,185
Uniqlo.

377
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,022
That's a brand name.

378
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,791
It's not even English.

379
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,627
Uniqlo's name comes from
"Unique Clothing Warehouse."

380
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,663
"Unique" means
"one individual, unlike others"

381
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,831
so you're barely right.

382
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, unique.

383
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,436
I think I could remember that easily.

384
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,605
-Yeah.
-Listen.

385
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:43,176
UTokyo students think "Why?"
about everything they see.

386
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,978
They try to see the substance.

387
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,881
What you must do
is copy that way of thinking.

388
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,651
By the way, those problems
you think are quizzes?

389
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,387
They're all questions
from past UTokyo entrance exams.

390
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,388
Seriously?

391
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:59,425
In UTokyo exams, you might have to
add a punchline to a comic strip.

392
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,794
Or in "Janken Glico,"
which makes you win more,

393
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,563
rock, paper, or scissors.

394
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,931
These have all been questions.

395
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:07,900
UTokyo has a lot of questions
based on daily life.

396
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,370
-Wow.
-So that pumpkin one…

397
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,239
That was a geography question from 2015.

398
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:18,111
"Many pumpkins are imported
from Mexico and New Zealand. Explain why."

399
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,247
By the way, pumpkins are in season
in summer and autumn.

400
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,548
Think about that. Well?

401
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,690
I get it. In Japan, they're only available
in summer and autumn

402
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,659
but Mexico is warm year-round.

403
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,628
When it's winter in Japan,
it's summer in New Zealand!

404
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,130
-That's it.
-Wow!

405
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,799
We solved a UTokyo question!

406
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:44,971
Do you get it, Hayase? That's why you
can't think "It's always been that way."

407
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,974
Everything has meaning. Substance.

408
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,176
Why is the question written that way?

409
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:54,347
Why are we making you do
things that seem like games?

410
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,884
See it from every angle
to get the substance.

411
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,602
I guess I'll get serious about Twitter.

412
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,640
That reminds me, Amano,
your video was funny.

413
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,575
Yeah, that was awesome.

414
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:24,910
Like this, right?

415
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,211
Uh… I guess.

416
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,314
-Seto, you're not doing YouTube?
-Why would I?

417
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,350
Do it!

418
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,187
How many students joined
the Top Uni Course?

419
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,522
At this moment…

420
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,224
Just one, Ryo Fujii.

421
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,393
Why?

422
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,295
Actually…

423
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,431
Tomorrow, the Top Uni Course classes
will begin.

424
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,200
If you want to join, talk to me.

425
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,435
I'll be in charge of it.

426
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,071
Hey, Fujii. See you tomorrow.

427
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,273
Mr. Oyama.

428
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,176
Where did you graduate from?

429
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,179
-Huh?
-Heisei School of Education.

430
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,348
A third-rate school.

431
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,452
Why do I have to be taught
by someone with a lower deviation score?

432
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,490
I signed up for the Top Uni Course
because the chairman asked me to.

433
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,993
But I have no intention of taking classes.
Good-bye.

434
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,496
-Hey…
-Third rate!

435
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,435
Third rate, third rate!

436
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,906
Good grief. That Fujii is such a jerk.

437
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,676
That's why I'm against
becoming a high-level school.

438
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,147
Studying all the time makes people
stupid and heartless.

439
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,182
You are so right.

440
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,886
Well, as long as he wins the contest,
that's fine.

441
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,822
Then we can destroy the
UTokyo Special Course.

442
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,729
Hey, Kaede. I don't get this.

443
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,600
This "party" means a political party.

444
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,536
Politics? That's not a party at all.

445
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,439
-I'll look up the origin.
-Okay.

446
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,544
Um, "part."

447
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,779
It looks like it came from "portion."

448
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,216
A party is where a number of people
get together and have fun.

449
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,886
A political party is people with
the same beliefs coming together.

450
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,322
When you put it like that, it makes sense.

451
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,990
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

452
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,293
Hang on. This one too.

453
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,194
Which one?

454
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:26,998
POLITICAL PARTY

455
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,800
Seto, are those flashcards?

456
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,870
-Great!
-I guess.

457
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,218
<i>By month, at representative points</i>
<i>on the Pacific side…</i>

458
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,919
-Another beer.
-Yes, sir!

459
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,157
Oh, shadows.

460
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,659
-"Bottle."
-What's up?

461
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,796
Are you studying? What's gotten into you?

462
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,698
No, it's nothing.

463
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,573
Give this to Mr. Sakuragi.

464
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,343
-Huh? Okay.
-Hurry.

465
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,014
-Here.
-Uh-huh.

466
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,784
This is Setoya.

467
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,523
Sorry, could you wait a little longer?

468
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,027
I'm sorry. I'm trying to collect it now.

469
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,162
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,505
ONE DAY BEFORE THE CONTEST

471
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,708
Here are the results of today's mini-test.

472
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,610
Mizuno.

473
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:54,953
Amano, from a total of 500, 400.

474
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,321
It went up.

475
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,822
Hayase, 380 points.

476
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,226
-Yay!
-Iwasaki, 420 points.

477
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,995
-Yes!
-Seto, 270 points.

478
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,400
Everyone has gotten much better
in a short period. Well done.

479
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,570
Isn't that great? We might really win!

480
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,772
-Seto, you improved a lot.
-Yeah.

481
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,373
Seto, you worked hard.

482
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,477
You can be happy.
I know you feel the difference.

483
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,779
Shut up.

484
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,917
<i>Honestly, it'll be hard.</i>

485
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,986
<i>I can't say that to them though.</i>

486
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,456
Everyone's working hard,
but they're finally at junior high level.

487
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,458
Can they win?

488
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,428
It will depend on the type of questions.

489
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,797
If it's physics, they'll be clobbered.

490
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,433
Especially Seto. Are you listening?

491
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,776
We took past UTokyo exams
from the last 20 years

492
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,879
and chose possible questions
for each subject.

493
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,517
Okay, now we just have to
select the questions.

494
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,120
I have a proposal, Chairman.

495
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,224
I'd like you to choose
the questions for the test.

496
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,093
Me?

497
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,500
Bottle.

498
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,105
Care.

499
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,149
Oh, it's climate.

500
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,123
-Hey!
-Hah, "unique"?

501
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,491
Don't you know that?

502
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,959
Give it.

503
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,329
I feel sorry for the Special Course kids.

504
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,165
They'd have better chances
without you around.

505
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,102
You don't even feel bad?

506
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,772
You're holding them back. Catch on!

507
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,106
Or are you too dumb?

508
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,750
If you lose, those teachers
will be fired, right?

509
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,889
If it were me, I'd stand down.

510
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,385
SPECIAL EXAM
UTOKYO SPECIAL COURSE VS FUJII RYO

511
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,089
Where's Seto?

512
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,623
Maybe he's running late.

513
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,892
He probably just ran away.

514
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,961
Huh? He wouldn't do that.

515
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,664
He's worked so hard.

516
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,403
Thanks for waiting. Is everyone here?

517
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,004
Ma'am, not everyone.

518
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,808
Oh, Seto called and said
he'd be away today.

519
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,044
-Huh?
-Good for you guys!

520
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,712
He'd hold you back if he was here.

521
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,580
Shut up!

522
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,316
We still have five minutes, right?

523
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:14,786
Hang on!

524
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,459
You don't have to count Seto's score.

525
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,662
I need a little handicap,
otherwise it's boring.

526
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,070
<i>The person you are trying to reach is…</i>

527
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,807
What are you doing, Seto?
I hope he didn't really run away…

528
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,408
He's not that kind of guy.

529
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,044
Look, I found this.

530
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,788
He's not showing his face, but that voice…

531
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,690
-Seto?
-Why isn't he here?

532
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,292
He worked so hard.

533
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,260
It's time.

534
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,296
But Seto's not here yet.

535
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,798
Forget about Seto.

536
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,666
How could you say that?

537
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,236
Are you confident enough
to worry about another person?

538
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,505
Or have you given up from the start?

539
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,607
-No!
-Then focus on yourself.

540
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,178
I told you.

541
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,380
I'd help you win,

542
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,816
so you believed me,
and did what you could.

543
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,417
You'd throw that away?

544
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,452
In an exam,

545
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,323
you never know what will happen.
Entrance exams are the same.

546
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,692
That day, at that time,
no matter the conditions,

547
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,993
you only have one chance.

548
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,396
All you can do now

549
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:35,266
is focus on yourself. That's it.

550
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,593
MISSED CALLS
IWASAKI, HAYASE, AMANO

551
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,797
I'll clean up. You go to school.

552
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,166
Now is not the time for that.

553
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,619
Thank you.

554
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,065
The test is worth 20 points.
You will have twenty minutes.

555
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,868
Now, begin.

556
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,262
<i>An English essay and geography question.</i>

557
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,730
<i>What is this map?</i>

558
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,432
<i>It looks hard.</i>

559
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,035
<i>How can I answer this?</i>

560
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,970
<i>Fujii is writing a lot.</i>

561
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,372
<i>What could he be writing?</i>

562
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,176
<i>Calm down. Focus on yourself.</i>

563
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,146
<i>Right. Don't forget to think.</i>

564
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,349
<i>Substance. Think about the substance.</i>

565
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,852
<i>Oh, that's what this question is asking…</i>

566
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,369
Time's up.

567
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,217
Let me through.

568
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,184
Sorry.

569
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,587
-Let me through.
-Sorry.

570
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:48,324
Pardon me.

571
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,833
I will present the results.

572
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,672
Amano, 14 points.

573
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:07,543
Hayase, 13 points.

574
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,547
Iwasaki, 15 points.

575
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:14,517
Fujii,

576
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:17,420
11 points.

577
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,658
Y-Yay!

578
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,960
Really? We won?

579
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:26,862
We won!

580
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:29,331
No way!

581
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:30,733
Yay!

582
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,769
Mr. Sakuragi really is amazing.

583
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:37,239
How lame, Fujii.
You lost to the Special Course.

584
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:42,878
You're kidding! How could I lose? Give it!

585
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:49,452
There must be a mistake with the marking.

586
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,220
Re-do it, third-rate school!

587
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:54,123
Nope, there's nothing wrong
with the marking.

588
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,959
What's wrong is your answers.

589
00:34:57,026 --> 00:34:59,361
Show this idiot, Mizuno.

590
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:00,896
Idiot?

591
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:02,665
First, the English question.

592
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,534
What would happen
if you could read other's thoughts?

593
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:06,769
That was the question.

594
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,205
Read your answer.

595
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:30,359
It's long.

596
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:32,862
I don't know what you're saying.

597
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:36,899
You do know. If people could read minds,
they can't lie, so peace would come.

598
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:40,069
-That's obvious.
-I see. Now I understand.

599
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:44,340
You didn't write that people couldn't lie.
You didn't explain that.

600
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:48,577
It wasn't logical and on top of that,
you used too many hard words and phrases.

601
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:50,412
So you had a lot of spelling mistakes.

602
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,515
What did you guys write?

603
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:53,916
Amano.

604
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:55,784
Yes, sir.

605
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:13,035
That's good. Hayase?

606
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:14,537
Yes, sir.

607
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:30,553
-Good. Iwasaki?
-Yes, sir.

608
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,804
-Good.
-Simple and easy to understand.

609
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:51,106
It's easy English,
with no spelling errors.

610
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:52,608
No way.

611
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:54,476
Compared to a complicated answer,

612
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:57,079
answering simply
is actually more difficult.

613
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:01,083
But in the real world,
it's a skill you'll need your whole life.

614
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,453
Discussing things every day,
and teaching one another.

615
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,022
Always valuing communication.

616
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,292
That was to build this skill.
YouTube and Twitter, too.

617
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:11,927
So that's why.

618
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:14,163
Next is the geography question.

619
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,133
What it is really asking is
if you can imagine how people feel.

620
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,368
How people feel?

621
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:20,369
Fujii,

622
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,339
you only answered
from the administrative perspective.

623
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:25,774
There was nothing
about the citizens' perspective

624
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:28,277
so you only got half the points.

625
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:34,850
You clearly chose these questions
to give the Special Course the advantage!

626
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:35,851
That's not true.

627
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:39,054
The questions were chosen by the chairman.

628
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:42,658
But that's…

629
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:45,394
I have a proposal, Chairman.

630
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:48,664
I'd like you to choose
the questions for the test.

631
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:49,798
Me?

632
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:53,969
You, more than anyone,
have noble principles towards education.

633
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:57,740
I'm sure the questions you choose
will follow those principles.

634
00:37:57,806 --> 00:38:01,143
Something to bring awareness
to the students.

635
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,680
-Am I wrong?
-You're very right.

636
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:08,550
For example, Mr. Oyama's questions.

637
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,353
They're mostly asking
about esoteric knowledge.

638
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,790
But cramming in knowledge
isn't what matters in life.

639
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:17,026
Having a rich life matters.

640
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,394
Ah, I see.

641
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:22,131
This geography question Mizuno chose.

642
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:25,067
This will encourage a broad perspective
and critical thinking.

643
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:28,570
This English question is very practical.

644
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,507
<i>You tricked me.</i>

645
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:33,909
You led me to choose them
with your clever words.

646
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:38,514
So what?
They're all real UTokyo questions.

647
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,582
Fujii should have solved them with ease.

648
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:42,885
That's why you chose them, no?

649
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,589
Fujii, you didn't lose
because of the questions.

650
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,325
It was your nasty personality.

651
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,559
My personality?

652
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,661
That's unrelated to the exam.

653
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:56,131
You look down on people
and reject help even from teachers.

654
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:57,866
You've studied all on your own.

655
00:38:58,534 --> 00:38:59,735
But you have a weakness.

656
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:02,471
If you had taken advice,
you could've avoided this.

657
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:06,442
UTokyo often has questions
that require multiple perspectives.

658
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:10,879
You need to be able to imagine
how different people feel.

659
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:13,515
It's a message from UTokyo
about who they want.

660
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,118
People who kick down others

661
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:19,588
and try to climb up alone
are not what UTokyo wants.

662
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:23,425
That's why I said
you'll never get into UTokyo, Fujii.

663
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:25,728
People like you?

664
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:28,464
UTokyo doesn't need you, nor does society.

665
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:30,666
Know that.

666
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:33,335
That's bullshit.

667
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:35,337
Serves you right.

668
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:38,140
Fujii, why not give up on UTokyo?

669
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:41,143
Cut it out, you guys. Go back to class.

670
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,713
All of you are idiots.

671
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,549
-Keep laughing.
-Huh? What did you say?

672
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:49,251
Don't get high and mighty.

673
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:53,555
You're idiots who only feel superior
when beating someone down.

674
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:56,558
-What gives?
-You're just saying "idiot" over and over.

675
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,093
I call them as I see them.

676
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,264
Compared to you, Fujii's twisted spirit
is a hundred times better.

677
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:05,000
He chose UTokyo,
and he's working in his own way.

678
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:06,902
Hey, old man.

679
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,036
Come outside.

680
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,138
Stop!

681
00:40:09,204 --> 00:40:11,273
What do you think you are doing?!

682
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,278
Uh, no, I, uh…

683
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,747
Enough of this nonsense!

684
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:21,383
I can't allow you to insult students
in front of me.

685
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,420
They're not insults. This is kindness.

686
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:26,588
You…

687
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,461
Shall I tell you why you're idiots?

688
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:33,996
This is why.

689
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,032
You don't know anything.

690
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,535
I'm not talking about textbook knowledge.

691
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:43,539
You don't know the reality
and structure of the world.

692
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,340
-Give it up.
-Hey.

693
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:48,043
-Gimme a break.
-Don't mock the students!

694
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:54,683
Do you know what's happening
in the world now?

695
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:57,219
Unprecedented crises.

696
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,588
Epidemics. Natural disasters.

697
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:01,523
Leading to economic paralysis.

698
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,326
Unimaginable things are happening,
one after another.

699
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:07,296
A war could even break out.

700
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:08,730
What are you saying?

701
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:10,632
What was common sense doesn't fly anymore.

702
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:13,268
Absolutely anything could happen.

703
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:16,638
When that happens,
this country where you all live…

704
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:20,509
What does it need the most? Do you know?

705
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,544
How would I know?

706
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:24,746
Money.

707
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:26,682
Taxes.

708
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:32,254
This country wants you all to stay idiots.
That's the truth.

709
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,356
Without any doubts.

710
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:37,025
Without knowing anything,
without looking up anything.

711
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:39,428
Just following the system,
continuing to work,

712
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:41,597
and paying money.
That's the citizens they want.

713
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:44,500
How would you reword that?

714
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:46,468
You there.

715
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:53,408
Kohashi. Iwai.

716
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:54,643
Huh?

717
00:41:56,144 --> 00:41:57,513
Huh?

718
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,115
Diligence?

719
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,149
Close.

720
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,685
A workhorse.

721
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:07,456
This country wants you to shut up
and pull the carriage.

722
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:11,460
They want workhorses.
That's easier for them.

723
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:16,398
<i>"The world is fair. The citizens are free.</i>
<i>There is no discrimination."</i>

724
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:17,633
<i>We're told this.</i>

725
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,335
<i>But reality is different.</i>

726
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:24,973
<i>No matter how hard you work,</i>
<i>no matter how you muster your strength.</i>

727
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:28,010
If you can't see the substance,

728
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:30,546
you can't even stand in the ring
with authority.

729
00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:32,147
So what?

730
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,250
That's the government's fault.

731
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,919
We've got nothing to do with it.

732
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:39,054
That's why you're idiots.

733
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:43,392
It's someone's fault, the nation's fault,
the era's fault. Criticizing others.

734
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,127
What changes by complaining?

735
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:50,399
It suits the ones who make the rules.
That's why they made this system.

736
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:52,834
If you say
you've got nothing to do with it,

737
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:55,837
you'll spend your life being tricked
and paying money.

738
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:58,273
Why is society like this?

739
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:01,310
Who made it this way, for what reason?

740
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:05,514
Learn how to see the substance,
and find your own answer.

741
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:07,616
Then finally

742
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,686
a workhorse can become a human.

743
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:15,257
To get there, studying is the only way.

744
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:16,658
Studying

745
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:20,796
is the only equality this country allows.

746
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:22,464
Right now, you're lucky.

747
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:25,300
Now you've got me.

748
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,503
No matter how stupid and lazy you are,

749
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:31,273
if you want it, I can get you into UTokyo.

750
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:36,445
You get it? If you want to be
more than just exploited.

751
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:38,480
If you don't want a life of discontent.

752
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,116
You've got to study!

753
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:45,020
Ugly and stupid can go to UTokyo!

754
00:43:48,824 --> 00:43:49,992
There he goes.

755
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,261
Please don't plant biased ideas
in my students.

756
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:57,265
Everyone, back to class.

757
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,403
-Break it up.
-Back to class.

758
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,038
Break it up.

759
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:07,109
Hey, Fujii.

760
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,145
You're welcome to join us anytime.

761
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,881
I'll fix your spirit.

762
00:44:14,816 --> 00:44:16,318
Why would I?

763
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:24,893
<i>We've managed to save our jobs.</i>

764
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,031
But we have to get five students to pass.

765
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:33,669
Didn't you say you had a smart candidate?

766
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:35,504
They'll come eventually.

767
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:42,577
This is a stag beetle.
A giant stag beetle.

768
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:45,113
It's a rare variety. It has a huge jaw.

769
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,349
Time to go home, Kenta.

770
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:48,950
Mari.

771
00:44:55,123 --> 00:44:56,291
Here.

772
00:44:58,794 --> 00:44:59,961
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

773
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,433
I'm going to Setoya now. Do you…

774
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:07,836
No. Don't go to Setoya for a while.

775
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:10,272
But I'm worried about Seto.

776
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:11,239
Leave him.

777
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:13,575
Hang on, sir.

778
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,744
Do you know something?

779
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:39,334
He who masters IT, masters the exam!

780
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:41,570
<i>Use Study Sapuri</i>
<i>to root out your weaknesses.</i>

781
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:43,505
<i>Study with these "idiot" headbands.</i>

782
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:44,973
Idiots!

783
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,142
Are you toying with our children?

784
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:49,177
<i>Ten Family Rules for UTokyo.</i>

785
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:51,947
Your children can definitely
get into UTokyo.

786
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:53,749
-Is that you, Mizuno?
-Yes, sir.

787
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,218
Cramming is true education.

788
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,919
<i>This is the Spartan you wanted.</i>

789
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,755
I'll accept no less than 100%.

790
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:01,189
I have a bad feeling about this…

791
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:04,326
If you're good at elementary math,
you'll be able to study.

792
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:06,561
I'll deal with our debt somehow.

793
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:07,829
<i>I'll drop out and work.</i>

794
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,097
<i>I'm an idiot anyway.</i>

795
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,398
So you're giving up on UTokyo?

796
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:11,967
This is my problem.

797
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:14,803
If you want to change,
don't accept the status quo!

798
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,338
