00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,075
DIRTY AND DISGUSTING

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,243
SHUT DOWN ALREADY!

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,344
THEY SERVE BUG RAMEN

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,247
UNSANITARY
DON'T GO HERE

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,315
DIRTY, GROSS, RIP-OFF

6
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,316
RAMEN SETOYA

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,696
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,066
Sis.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,101
I'll drop out and work.

10
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:35,936
What?

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,806
I know we don't have any money.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,509
I decided long ago.

13
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,544
Don't you want to study?

14
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,379
I don't care about studying!

15
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,082
I'm an idiot anyway.

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,219
Here.

17
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:01,429
<i>Everyone has gotten much better</i>
<i>in a short period. Well done.</i>

18
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,264
<i>Seto, you improved a lot.</i>

19
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,501
I'll deal with our debt somehow.

20
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,477
BALANCE SHEET

21
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,545
SAKURAGI

22
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,281
I'm broke…

23
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,516
Why the stupid face?

24
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,419
Whose fault do you think that is?

25
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,420
Who?

26
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,624
All of these
are your receipts and invoices.

27
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,661
I really might have to take out a loan.

28
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,696
Don't borrow from a sketchy place.

29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,866
This is your problem too.

30
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,067
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,369
This one too.

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,774
Give me a break!

33
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,577
Ramen Eiraku?

34
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,345
You didn't go to Setoya.

35
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,947
Setoya was closed.

36
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,416
You went?

37
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,252
Sir?

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,258
What happened to Seto?

39
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,528
He's been away for three days.
Isn't that strange?

40
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:12,166
He leaves all my messages on read.

41
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,835
He hasn't updated
his YouTube since that day.

42
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,644
What's this?

43
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,880
They borrowed from loan sharks.

44
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,282
Oh, no. Sir, we have to help them.

45
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,085
No, loan sharks these days
know how to stay hidden.

46
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,686
They use clever tactics.

47
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,356
-But we can't leave him…
-Leave him.

48
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,590
How coldhearted!

49
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,994
Your job is to get
our students into UTokyo.

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,830
This isn't about that. Seto is…

51
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,665
You asked me to come here.

52
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:48,202
Do you remember? How did you
convince me to come?

53
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,970
Answer in five words.

54
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,976
Revitalize the school,
make bank, Toranomon.

55
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,511
That's six.

56
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,380
Good grief.

57
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,620
Don't worry about Seto.
Focus on your studies.

58
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,956
-Huh?
-Isn't that coldhearted?

59
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,226
Hayase, what are the rules of the
UTokyo Special Course?

60
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,762
Don't tell your parents.

61
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,796
And?

62
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,834
Even if you can't understand the reason,
do what the teacher says.

63
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,336
Then focus on your studies.

64
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,271
Yes sir…

65
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,411
Listen, everyone.
We're trying something new from today.

66
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,181
What is the most important thing
to win a battle?

67
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:35,849
Amano.

68
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,118
Ambition.

69
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,423
Um, yeah, that too.

70
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,725
Iwasaki.

71
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,560
If it were me,

72
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,463
I'd research my opponent's weak points,

73
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,765
and attack them relentlessly, I guess?

74
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,800
You're right!

75
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,435
To win a battle,

76
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,670
you must understand the weak points.

77
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,672
Your own weak points.

78
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,174
Our own weak points?

79
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:03,877
Overcome your weak points
through repetition.

80
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,747
That's the shortcut to passing the exam.

81
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,982
Oh is that it?

82
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,852
Just studying hard is a waste of time.

83
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,588
All of you, your starting line

84
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,290
is several hundred meters back.

85
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:21,262
But I don't know
what I don't know… I mean…

86
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,430
Yeah, there's so much I don't know!

87
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,898
That's where this comes in.

88
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,735
-Mizuno?
-This.

89
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,203
A smartphone?

90
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,771
Study Sapuri.

91
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,707
Study Sapuri looks at your study history,

92
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,543
<i>and what you understand</i>
<i>and don't understand</i>

93
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,978
<i>is made into data.</i>

94
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,447
<i>You can visualize your strong</i>
<i>and weak areas.</i>

95
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,717
<i>You can see it at a glance,</i>
<i>so you can study efficiently.</i>

96
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,254
Isn't that just for taking online classes?

97
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,658
Using an app to study seems lazy.

98
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,792
That's nonsense!

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,263
He who masters IT, masters the exam!
That's common sense.

100
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,702
Use Study Sapuri
to root out your weaknesses.

101
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,406
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

102
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,375
Today,

103
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,477
Mizuno has a special present for you all.

104
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,479
-Huh?
-Bring them out.

105
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,548
Ma'am, you're so kind!

106
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,250
Okay.

107
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,361
So, what's happening?

108
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,029
With the Elite University Course.

109
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,431
Well…

110
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,167
<i>Fujii has really taken the loss hard.</i>

111
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,935
<i>He seems to be studying very hard.</i>

112
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,839
This honorific, "mogana" is
an ending particle indicating desire.

113
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,176
It indicates a wish for something.
This also…

114
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,312
Fujii is a jerk but he can study.

115
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,548
But Chairman!

116
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,418
The idea to stop the Top Uni Course
and make the Elite University Course

117
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,653
was brilliant!

118
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,857
As long as no more students join
the UTokyo Course, it doesn't matter.

119
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,827
Make sure Sakuragi doesn't
do anything weird.

120
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:00,928
Keep an eye on him.

121
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,433
Ugly and stupid can go to UTokyo!

122
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,036
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,376
IDIOT

124
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,277
I-Idiot?

125
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,979
This is our present?

126
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,180
Yes.

127
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:24,017
Whenever there are
problems you can't solve,

128
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,653
we'll have you study
with these "idiot" headbands.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,956
-Huh?
-We'll wear this?!

130
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,791
It is a headband after all.

131
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,093
If you solve the problem,
you can take it off.

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,195
And if you find another you can't solve,

133
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,764
you put on the headband.

134
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,967
Once you learn it, take it off.
And if you keep repeating that,

135
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,136
you will have no problems you can't solve.

136
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,772
It's not that simple.

137
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,674
I did this very thing and got into UTokyo.

138
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,042
Really?

139
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,311
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

140
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,313
Of course it is.

141
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,082
I also think this is too…

142
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,585
That's why it works.
When it comes to motivation for effort,

143
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,256
negative emotions have more power
than positive emotions.

144
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,324
You don't want to look silly,

145
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,059
so you work hard at the problems.

146
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,695
When you solve them,
you can remove the headband.

147
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,265
That eventually becomes pleasurable,
and before you know it,

148
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,168
you have a positive attitude
towards studying.

149
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,670
That may be theoretically true, but…

150
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,075
Kaede?

151
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,510
Fine.

152
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,648
Huh? Then, me too.

153
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,451
Okay! I'll put it on you.

154
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,322
Wow! It looks good.

155
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,458
Ready?

156
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,861
Idiots!

157
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,430
They're acting weird
at the UTokyo Special Course.

158
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,798
Really? What's that?

159
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,767
No way, that's crazy!

160
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,102
Hey, look! They're really doing it!

161
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,940
Are they that serious about
getting into UTokyo? So cringe!

162
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,679
<i>"Hinemosu."</i>

163
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,113
<i>I'm embarrassed!</i>

164
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,116
<i>"Hinemosu" is a strange word.</i>

165
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,619
<i>"So as to" means "in order to."</i>

166
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,120
<i>"So as to," "in order to."</i>

167
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,424
<i>They're looking at us…</i>

168
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,193
<i>In reflection transformations,</i>
<i>plus and minus are reversed.</i>

169
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,472
You're welcome anytime.

170
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,075
Go to UTokyo and your life
will change dramatically!

171
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,610
Hey, Fujii.

172
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,747
-Did you come to see?
-Shut up.

173
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,716
Watch as much as you like.

174
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,923
A job?

175
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,926
I'll do anything. Could you hire me?

176
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,495
-No way.
-Why?

177
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,364
You're a Tatsumi student.

178
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:55,369
They're banned from working.
If I hired you, it'd be my neck.

179
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,340
These "idiot" headbands
really are embarrassing.

180
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,475
That's for sure.

181
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,844
How about you? Aren't you embarrassed?

182
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,113
If it means my grades go up, I don't mind.

183
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,848
Nobody's looking anyway.

184
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:11,685
Everyone was looking!
You were really concentrating…

185
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,187
Hey, you wanna go?

186
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,856
-Huh?
-Go? Go where?

187
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,492
Don't think about it, just do it!

188
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,562
Everyone's really gotten into the groove.

189
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,597
You're still so naive.

190
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,966
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,335
I'm hungry.

192
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,271
I want some gyoza.

193
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,876
This is a bad idea.

194
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,978
Huh? What's wrong with it?

195
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,380
Our teacher told us to forget about Seto.

196
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,017
You really are heartless.
I bet you don't have any friends.

197
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,220
I don't! I don't, but…

198
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,256
What're you doing in front of my house?

199
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,091
Seto!

200
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,526
Long time no see.

201
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,362
-Yeah.
-We came to have some ramen.

202
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,238
Thanks! That was delicious!

203
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,042
What are you doing?

204
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,479
I'm posting it on my
hip schoolgirl Twitter account.

205
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,616
You're keeping it up!

206
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,419
Of course I am! Thanks to this,
we beat Fujii after all.

207
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,222
Yeah. It could be thanks to
my YouTube too.

208
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,323
Yeah it was!

209
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,526
You had your ramen, now get out of here.

210
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,462
How rude!

211
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,864
We came because we're worried about you!

212
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,000
Look, I even promoted your restaurant.

213
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,302
Nobody asked you to worry about me.

214
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,271
You only have 13 followers,
so how does that help anyway?

215
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,673
Go on, go home.

216
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,142
Worrying was a waste of time! Let's go!

217
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:45,812
Thanks for the food!

218
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,484
You're coming back to class, right?

219
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,554
Once things settle down.

220
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,757
Welcome!

221
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,891
Welcome!

222
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,895
We've got customers, so go.

223
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,665
Thanks for the food.

224
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,739
Kaede, what is it?

225
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,441
-Nothing.
-Ah.

226
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,911
Ah!

227
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,048
-Oh no! Let's go!
-Yeah.

228
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,552
-Kaede! Hurry!
-It's bad!

229
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,654
What? Hey, what is it?

230
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,324
-It's Mr. Sakuragi!
-What? Oh no!

231
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,664
-Pardon me.
-Yes?

232
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,367
-This was in my food.
-Mine had this.

233
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,937
I almost ate it!

234
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,406
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,941
But that's not ours.

236
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:51,078
-Even so, it was in there.
-You talk to customers like that?

237
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,180
This place has a bad attitude!

238
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,981
There's no way that was in there!

239
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,516
I'm very sorry!

240
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,985
-You don't have to apologize to them!
-Akira!

241
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,155
Hey, hey!
That's terrible customer service.

242
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,491
Everyone!

243
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,159
Watch out!

244
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,695
This place puts stuff in the food!

245
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,565
There!

246
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,136
Forcible obstruction of business.

247
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,607
Shouting false information
in a restaurant.

248
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:21,708
Causing a fuss.

249
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,677
-Right?
-Huh?

250
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,779
Ah, yes, article 234 of the penal code.

251
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,047
Who are you two?

252
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,284
Hey. Let's go.

253
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,887
One more thing.
Those papers that were put up.

254
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,089
That was you guys, right?

255
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,459
That's fraudulent obstruction of business.

256
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,495
Article 233 of the penal code.

257
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,431
So you admit it.

258
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,034
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

259
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,205
-Hey!
-Leave it.

260
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,141
It doesn't matter what you say.

261
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,210
They're just hired by the loan sharks.

262
00:12:58,712 --> 00:12:59,546
Yes, sir.

263
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,615
This is terrible.

264
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,984
Why are you here?

265
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,987
I came to eat ramen at a ramen restaurant!

266
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,257
Sis?!

267
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,291
Sis?!

268
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,192
Are you okay?

269
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,227
I'm just a little tired.

270
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,062
Go rest in the back.

271
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,106
This is so good.

272
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,575
You've got good skills.

273
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,477
At a time like this?

274
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,413
Seto, are you okay?

275
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,351
I've worked at my family's restaurant
so I know what it's like.

276
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,387
You can talk to us.

277
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,298
When our parents died three years ago,
they had debt.

278
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,001
My sister worked hard to pay it off,

279
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,437
<i>but she couldn't meet the deadlines.</i>

280
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,541
<i>Half a year ago, she found a finance</i>
<i>company that would lend us money.</i>

281
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,476
<i>She was going to pay it right back.</i>

282
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,847
But that million yen debt
just kept growing,

283
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,216
and now we can't keep up at all.

284
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,651
-So what will you do?
-That's why…

285
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,521
I'm looking for a job.
All I can do is work.

286
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,489
Our school bans students from working.

287
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,491
If I don't work, my family is finished!

288
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:22,295
Idiot. You could never earn enough
to make a dent in that debt.

289
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,966
This is my problem.
I don't want to bother anyone else.

290
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,567
You're up against a loan shark!

291
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,502
We're lawyers.

292
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,704
We can help you.

293
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,407
I told you. I don't want to bother anyone!

294
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,044
So you're giving up on UTokyo?

295
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,481
I could never get into UTokyo anyway.

296
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,353
Okay, I got it.

297
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,354
Sir!

298
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,724
Don't tell the others.

299
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,493
Don't interrupt their studies.

300
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,397
Please.

301
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,802
Thanks for the food.

302
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,012
Wait, sir!

303
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,814
Sir! Wait!

304
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,316
What is it?

305
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,385
Why won't you help Seto?

306
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,487
I can't if he feels that way.

307
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,789
But we're lawyers.

308
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,392
Loan sharks are professional criminals.

309
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,726
Play on their field,

310
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,995
and Tatsumi Gakuen will be affected next.

311
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,065
This badge means at any time,
under any circumstances,

312
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,834
we aim for freedom and justice,
fairness and equality.

313
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,437
Ignoring this goes against
what a lawyer should do.

314
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:41,174
Harassing people at work
is their modus operandi.

315
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,744
The chairman would be chased out.
The Special Course, too.

316
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,979
And your ambitions!

317
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,149
That's not what Seto wants.

318
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,952
But we can't just do nothing…

319
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,422
Stop worrying about Seto
and think about them!

320
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,625
I've got an early day tomorrow.

321
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,227
I'm going home to sleep. Don't call me.

322
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,662
Hang on, wait!

323
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,909
Math is so hard!

324
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,546
NAO
I SEARCHED SETO'S…

325
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,551
<i>I searched Seto's ramen place online.</i>

326
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,020
<i>There are some really bad reviews.</i>

327
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,088
Huh?

328
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,858
RAMEN SETOYA

329
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,895
<i>This place serves ramen with bugs in it.</i>

330
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,864
<i>Setoya is the worst in Japan.</i>

331
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,599
<i>This place is terrible!</i>

332
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,003
<i>Their service is so bad, even if you go…</i>

333
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,537
NAO
MAYBE SOMEONE HAS…

334
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,542
<i>Maybe someone has a grudge?</i>

335
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,891
Nao, I'm coming in.

336
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,427
Don't just barge in like that.

337
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,562
Lately, whenever you're home,

338
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,765
you always just hide in your room.

339
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm just studying.

340
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,172
"Idiot"?

341
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,207
It's nothing!

342
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,044
Forget about it, just go!

343
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,211
-Nao…
-Okay, okay.

344
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,118
Hey bro, how's the UTokyo
Special Course going?

345
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,356
You could knock.

346
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,092
Hang on, how do you know about that?

347
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,027
My old buddy goes to Tatsumi,
and he told me.

348
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,365
Promise you won't tell mom.

349
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,299
Why?

350
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,902
It's a UTokyo Special Course rule.

351
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,420
So heavy.

352
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,105
Iwasaki, what is it?

353
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,674
Oh, nothing.

354
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,343
Kaede is worried about Seto.

355
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,912
What? You guys should forget about Seto.

356
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,781
And focus on studying. As I told you.

357
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,649
I know that.

358
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,386
But I have a bad feeling.

359
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,023
Is he really okay?

360
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,626
Well…

361
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,762
Pardon me. Mr. Sakuragi!

362
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,030
We have trouble!

363
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,465
What?

364
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,000
-You going to class?
-Nope.

365
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,336
-This is good!
-Yeah, it's good!

366
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,812
They came to the school? But why?

367
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,249
They want to talk to the
UTokyo Special Course teachers.

368
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,585
Anyway, they seemed very angry. Hurry!

369
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,523
Pardon me.

370
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:17,891
Pardon me.

371
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,902
<i>"These guys are trying for UTokyo,"</i>
<i>it says.</i>

372
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,471
How much of a jerk can Fujii be?

373
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,440
Whoa, it's got so many retweets.

374
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,842
It really does…

375
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,112
If she sees this, my mom will freak out.

376
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,881
My mom would be against it too, I know it.

377
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,616
What should we do?

378
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,819
Why is my child trying out for UTokyo?

379
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,820
Is there a problem?

380
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,990
My Nao could never get into UTokyo!

381
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:51,991
Could never get in?

382
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,028
Well, what do you think, Mrs. Amano?

383
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,364
He did poorly on his junior high exam
and got into Tatsumi Gakuen.

384
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,867
I don't want it to happen
again in high school!

385
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:04,070
Are you saying Koichiro will do poorly?

386
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,773
Yes, he will! It's UTokyo!

387
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,876
Are you toying with our children?

388
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,412
-That's not our intention…
-Then what's this?

389
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,514
You made them wear this!

390
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,516
If you're not toying with them, then what?

391
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,784
I demand an explanation!

392
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,220
I see.

393
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:24,257
Then shall we include the students
in this discussion?

394
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,860
I'm not sure the children should hear…

395
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,963
It's their lives we're talking about.

396
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,731
They have a right to hear.

397
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,580
Hayase and Amano's mothers
have come to the Special Course.

398
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,751
The excitement never stops, does it?

399
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,855
They might demand they leave
the Special Course.

400
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,459
I would appreciate it if they did.

401
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,895
Pardon me.

402
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,702
That was dangerous!

403
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,938
Don't run in the halls! Don't run!

404
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,620
Is that…?

405
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:33,892
You said I was toying
with Nao and Koichiro.

406
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,560
But I have no intention of that.

407
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,729
I'm serious.

408
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
-But…
-Here's why.

409
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,967
When we started the Special Course,

410
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,503
I mocked all of the students.

411
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,572
But out of all of them,
only Nao and Koichiro

412
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,275
came and said "We want to go to UTokyo."

413
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,879
Just two out of 645 students.

414
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,581
Don't you think that's amazing?

415
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,350
My Nao?

416
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,354
People who accomplish
great things are all like this.

417
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,723
No matter how steep the road,

418
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,359
they have the strong will to push forward.

419
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,760
Those two have that.

420
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,998
They already have what they need most
to pass the UTokyo entrance exam.

421
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,002
But why did they keep it from us?

422
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,737
I told them to.

423
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,871
Huh?

424
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,975
And the thing you just said
is the reason why.

425
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,244
"She could never get in."

426
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,013
"He'll do poorly again."

427
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,482
I'm saying,
parents don't trust their children.

428
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,385
How rude! I trust Koichiro very much.

429
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,188
So why do you think
failing is a foregone conclusion?

430
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,257
Are you trying to stop him from trying?

431
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,158
That's…

432
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,661
The way to crush a child's strong will

433
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,897
is a parent's rejection.

434
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,266
I'm not rejecting anything.

435
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,535
When a teen consults with their parents,

436
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,738
the result is nearly always a rejection.

437
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,473
You two just said,

438
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,609
"My child could never get into UTokyo."

439
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,677
Didn't you?

440
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,013
But it's UTokyo after all.

441
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,415
Okay, one question.

442
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,419
Many people come to Japan
from Taiwan for sightseeing.

443
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:12,124
What areas of Japan
would be popular tourist destinations?

444
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,826
Other than Kyoto and Nara,
answer with some locations.

445
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,797
-What is this, suddenly?
-A quiz at a time like this?

446
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,268
I would say Chiba.

447
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,536
What's the reason?

448
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,538
That's where Disneyland is.

449
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,441
We have USJ too,
so Osaka is also probably good.

450
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,409
You're right.

451
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,411
Amano?

452
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,446
I think it's Hokkaido.

453
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,414
Your reason?

454
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,550
Snow doesn't fall in Taiwan,
so leisure spots with snow

455
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,118
are popular, I heard.

456
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,520
That's correct too.

457
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,123
Like I said, a quiz?
We're here to talk to you.

458
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,993
-This isn't a quiz.
-Huh?

459
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:54,199
That was a geography question
on the 2010 UTokyo entrance exam.

460
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,802
-A UTokyo question?
-That?

461
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,937
-I knew it.
-I thought so.

462
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,307
And both of them got it right.
The reasoning just needs to be clear.

463
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,575
Yay!

464
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,478
It was like the question
on our test the other day.

465
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,913
Your test the other day?

466
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,049
These two studied for just three weeks,

467
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,718
<i>battled the top student</i>
<i>in their year, and won.</i>

468
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,520
Is that true?

469
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,888
My Koichiro?

470
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,693
The biggest enemy of an entrance exam
is the preconceived idea that you'll fail.

471
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,129
That rigid way of thinking.

472
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,065
And who are the ones worst
at instilling that mindset?

473
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,433
Parents.

474
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,004
Can you trust your own children?

475
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:38,577
How rude. I always trust Nao.

476
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,515
My second son, a first-year high schooler,
is aiming for UTokyo.

477
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,785
Plus I think Koichiro has
higher abilities than those other kids.

478
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,054
"Those other kids"?

479
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,558
For the two of you,
I have something I want you to follow.

480
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,459
Mizuno.

481
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,370
"Ten Family Rules
for Getting into UTokyo."

482
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,105
That sounds impressive.

483
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,040
You three read it for us.

484
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:15,911
1. Eat breakfast together.

485
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:19,281
2. Have them do some housework.

486
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:22,117
3. Make them get some exercise.

487
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:25,754
4. Have them take a bath
at the same time every day.

488
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:30,292
5. Let them rest when they're not well.

489
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,362
6. Keep the living room tidy.

490
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,864
7. Don't hassle them about studying.

491
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:38,867
8. Get along as husband and wife.

492
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:42,571
9. Eat out once a month as a family.

493
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:46,308
10. Share these rules with the father.

494
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,110
It's nothing special.

495
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,178
The normal lifestyle of a normal family.

496
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:51,647
Just do that.

497
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:55,384
By obeying these ten rules for a year,

498
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:59,788
your children can definitely
get into UTokyo.

499
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:03,025
Rule two, about housework.

500
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:05,027
My child is a boy.

501
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:06,828
Housework isn't for boys or girls.

502
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,097
Have him do what he can.

503
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:12,067
Clean the foyer every morning,
or the tub every evening.

504
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:14,169
Anyhow, there's a lot he can do.

505
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:18,473
The important thing about entrance exams
is preserving your daily life.

506
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,075
Daily life?

507
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:22,978
Entrance exams make people
want to study all the time.

508
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:25,747
The family gets disrupted.

509
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,149
Children are sensitive.

510
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:29,918
They feel bad for burdening their family.

511
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:31,820
And that becomes pressure.

512
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,089
They could even abandon the exam.

513
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:38,060
In order to avoid that sort of mistake,
the family's daily life

514
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:39,728
should not be changed.

515
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:41,597
It seems difficult.

516
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:45,133
For example,
if you go on holiday every summer,

517
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,269
you should still go,
even for a short time.

518
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:50,939
-Really? It's okay?
-It's fine! Go on!

519
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:52,841
We don't really take holidays.

520
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:55,243
You can eat breakfast together.

521
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,181
Take a bath at the same time every day.
That's plenty.

522
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:01,917
A regular lifestyle develops good habits.

523
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:03,652
And the study cycle is created.

524
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,188
Studying will become natural.

525
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:07,856
Victory is certain.

526
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:11,526
Students who value daily life,

527
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:13,228
will beat the exam.

528
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:17,232
By the way, rule eight.

529
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,102
Get along as husband and wife.

530
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:24,906
The foundation of a peaceful daily life
is harmony between husband and wife.

531
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:28,910
That's one thing we can't control.

532
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,012
So I leave it to you.

533
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:34,816
If you have questions about anything else,
come anytime.

534
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,551
Okay.

535
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:40,589
Is that acceptable?
Then if you don't mind, class is starting,

536
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,290
so please be on your way.

537
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:13,488
-Hey, new hire!
-Yes, sir.

538
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:15,524
There's a customer. Stop spacing out.

539
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,325
-Do it right!
-I'm sorry.

540
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,696
Welcome! Fill up the tank?

541
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:36,478
A special math instructor,
Tetsunosuke Yanagi.

542
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:39,648
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We had a sudden interruption.

543
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:42,551
Always working the elderly so hard.

544
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:45,520
Mr. Yanagi, long time no see.

545
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:49,524
-Is that you, Mizuno?
-Yes, sir.

546
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,560
He's like a wizard.

547
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:53,628
He looks frail…

548
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:55,664
What?

549
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,704
He's scary.

550
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,539
So intimidating.

551
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:06,141
I have a bad feeling about this…

552
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,148
Let's begin.

553
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,884
You did your Study Sapuri,

554
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:20,487
and you were all very weak in math.

555
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:22,989
The basics are very important in math.

556
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:26,126
You've got to solidify your basics early.

557
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:30,030
-Amano, what do you think we should do?
-Huh?

558
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,966
Go back to what we don't know and review?

559
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:34,534
Go back to when?

560
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,770
High school first year?

561
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,271
No. Hayase.

562
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,373
Junior high third year?

563
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,876
-Iwasaki.
-It's not that?

564
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,579
Not… junior high first year?

565
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,314
No. Mizuno.

566
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,717
Elementary fifth grade.

567
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:53,620
You're going back

568
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,155
to elementary second grade.

569
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,526
-Second grade?
-Yes.

570
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,963
You're re-learning math from second grade.

571
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,031
That's taking the idiot thing too far.

572
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:06,733
We're not <i>that </i>stupid.

573
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:23,516
The reason why you can't do math

574
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,052
is because your calculation abilities
are lacking.

575
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,390
And the turning point for that
is in the second grade.

576
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:32,759
If you're good at
elementary second grade math,

577
00:30:32,826 --> 00:30:34,928
you'll be able to study.

578
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:37,063
What should we do?

579
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,301
This is why I invited the legendary
math instructor Mr. Yanagi here.

580
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:43,269
This old grandpa?

581
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,309
Nice to meet you.

582
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,647
My teaching methods are Spartan.

583
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:57,250
I don't care about the changing times
or different study methods.

584
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:00,053
I'm going to cram it into you!

585
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,089
Cramming is true education.

586
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:09,162
This is the Spartan you wanted.
Be grateful.

587
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:13,800
Didn't you say this was behind the times,
Mr. Sakuragi?

588
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:17,237
To get your math up to speed,
you need a period of Spartan study.

589
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,673
Training thoroughly
is the most effective way.

590
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:23,209
Mr. Yanagi drilled it into me too.

591
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,644
I got it.

592
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:30,917
Let's do it.

593
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:33,987
Kaede…

594
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,623
No fair.

595
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,865
Let's begin. Mizuno, hand those out.

596
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:52,405
I made these myself.
A hundred practice questions.

597
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:54,407
I'll accept no less than 100%.

598
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:55,775
What?!

599
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:58,611
But this is easy.

600
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:00,080
Oh, it is.

601
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:02,215
Let's begin.

602
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,484
You have three minutes.

603
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,952
Three minutes?!

604
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:09,189
Ready, start!

605
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:13,893
<i>The questions are second-grade level,</i>
<i>but 100 in three minutes is tough.</i>

606
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,895
<i>And to get them all right…</i>

607
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:20,667
<i>98-14=84, 62-29=33…</i>

608
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:23,403
<i>Ugh, I still have over half left.</i>

609
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,641
<i>81-9=72, 1008-14=984…</i>

610
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,376
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

611
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:33,379
<i>3x7=21, 2x6=12…</i>

612
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,849
<i>Man, I have so many left!</i>

613
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:38,885
Stop!

614
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,355
I didn't finish in time.

615
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:43,790
It's no good…

616
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:49,896
I don't even need to say this,

617
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,898
but you're far from 100%.

618
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:55,502
But you're not especially inferior.

619
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:56,970
-Huh?
-However.

620
00:32:57,537 --> 00:33:01,307
You must focus or you won't acquire
a tacit knowledge of numbers.

621
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:04,778
Tacit knowledge? What's that?

622
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:07,747
The power to do it by feeling,
without thinking.

623
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:09,916
I don't really get it.

624
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,852
Do you think about riding a bike
every time you do it?

625
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,387
You don't.

626
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:18,892
You need to be able to do math
without thinking about it.

627
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,361
That's tacit knowledge of numbers.

628
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:26,399
If you work on these
elementary level problems,

629
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,937
by summer you'll reach high school level.

630
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:34,641
Okay, let's push through!

631
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,744
No, you'll power through!

632
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,680
Here, dum-dum.

633
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:43,783
Ready, start!

634
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:53,059
Stop!

635
00:33:58,097 --> 00:33:58,932
Start!

636
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:06,973
Start!

637
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:15,415
Take care.

638
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,688
I can't… I'm dying.

639
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:23,022
I'm tired.

640
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:24,524
I'm done…

641
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,492
That's what I like to see.

642
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,061
That makes me so mad.

643
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:30,129
It's good. Studying is anger.

644
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:32,198
Get mad at yourself.

645
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:35,168
I'm starving.

646
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:37,804
Yeah, I want to eat ramen at Setoya.

647
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:42,442
<i>Sir, is Seto going to be okay?</i>

648
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,811
Seto is fine.

649
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,680
-You all focus on studying.
-But I can't help…

650
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,682
Why can't you believe in Seto?

651
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,585
He's stubborn.

652
00:34:52,652 --> 00:34:54,721
He just takes a little longer than you.

653
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,389
But right now,

654
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:58,992
he's doing what he can,
using his own abilities.

655
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:03,396
-He's taking responsibility.
-But sir…

656
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:05,798
I got it.

657
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:07,333
Kaede?

658
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,735
I'll focus on studying.

659
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:11,237
It's our lives after all.

660
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,573
I don't want to give up again.

661
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,243
Alright, I'll do it one more time.

662
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,412
Okay, let's do it.

663
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,980
Let's power through.

664
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,182
-Ma'am
-Okay.

665
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:31,491
Ready, start.

666
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:33,927
Sir?

667
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,163
I'm going out for some cigarettes.

668
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:41,868
-Hey new hire.
-Yes, sir?

669
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:44,570
-The manager wants you.
-Right away, sir.

670
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:57,750
Hey, Akira!

671
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:00,853
-Long time no see.
-Hey.

672
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:08,127
What are you guys doing?

673
00:36:08,194 --> 00:36:11,097
You joined the UTokyo Special Course.
Right?

674
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:13,499
We figured we should try studying.

675
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:16,069
We probably can't get into UTokyo.

676
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:19,205
But Keio or Waseda should be a cinch!

677
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:21,474
Mr. Sakuragi said it.

678
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:26,112
If you don't want adults to take advantage
and exploit you, study!

679
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:30,083
Yeah, we're a little too shy
to join the Special Course though.

680
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:39,993
Hello?

681
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:42,195
Huh?

682
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:45,498
Why?!

683
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:00,847
Why are you here?

684
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:03,116
Don't make me say it again.

685
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,318
I came to eat ramen at a ramen restaurant.

686
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,389
Why so glum?

687
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:11,624
You get fired from your job?

688
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:14,394
How did you know?

689
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,964
I happened to see you working
at the gas station.

690
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,204
It was you! You ratted.

691
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:28,541
I <i>am </i>employed by Tatsumi Gakuen.

692
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:32,011
I can't accept work
that is banned by the school.

693
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:35,181
-That's bullshit!
-I've got something better.

694
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,316
I've got a good offer for you.

695
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,987
I'll tell you about a job
that pays 4000 yen per hour.

696
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:44,357
Four thousand per hour?
There's no such thing.

697
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:49,295
There is. You go back to
the Special Course and study.

698
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:50,763
What are you saying?

699
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:54,367
UTokyo graduates earn about
500,000,000 yen in their lifetimes.

700
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,403
If you calculate that
into one year of study,

701
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,605
it's like a job that pays
4000 yen per hour.

702
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:01,374
I don't want to hear what-ifs.

703
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:03,576
Then, you're not coming back
to the Special Course?

704
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,380
You don't want to study?

705
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:09,549
You don't make me say it again!

706
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:12,251
If I don't work, we can't repay our debt!

707
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,355
Seto, you lost both your parents,
and you grew up poor.

708
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:18,891
Everyone will sympathize with you.

709
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:21,360
But Seto.

710
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,763
If you want to change,

711
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,799
you have to use your head,
and don't accept the status quo!

712
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:32,538
Listen, Seto.
If you pass the entrance exam,

713
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:35,842
even if you're poor,
even if you have no parents,

714
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,710
you can go to a top university.

715
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,880
You don't want to bother others?

716
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:43,583
That shitty pride isn't worth one yen.

717
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:46,686
Even a dumb kid
nearly swallowed up by society's darkness,

718
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:50,490
if they pass the exam,
can go to a top university.

719
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:53,192
You can fix your life!

720
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,363
But the debt!

721
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:03,569
I can't bother anyone!

722
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:08,975
If we can't pay them, they'll go
to the school! If that happens--

723
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,844
-It's okay!
-Huh?

724
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:16,949
Look…

725
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:19,385
PAID IN FULL

726
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:20,887
ONE MILLION YEN

727
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:23,723
What's this…

728
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:26,058
How?

729
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,629
Mr. Sakuragi…

730
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:33,132
He got it all back.

731
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,167
Huh?

732
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:40,773
The loan shark you borrowed from
was a little too forceful.

733
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,909
I looked into it, and I was right.

734
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:45,711
There were piles of evidence
of their illegal activity.

735
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:49,081
I used that to threaten
to stop their business.

736
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:51,384
And it was an easy negotiation.

737
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,953
Negotiation?

738
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,324
Loan sharks these days
use clever tricks to avoid being caught.

739
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,128
But you can't get away with crime
if you're stupid.

740
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:08,034
You're scarier than a loan shark.

741
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,837
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a kind lawyer.

742
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:15,641
Your sister's loan from the loan sharks,

743
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,077
your debt of one million yen is paid.

744
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,479
The loan shark your sister used

745
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:23,216
was collecting interest at illegal rates.

746
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:25,284
Using tricks so you'd never pay it off.

747
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:27,920
So legally,

748
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:30,590
they can't ask for more money
than you borrowed.

749
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:35,061
So your sister had already paid more
than she owed.

750
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:38,864
She didn't need to pay any more.

751
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:40,566
That means…

752
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:43,836
You have no reason to work.

753
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:49,976
Sir… Thank you so much.

754
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,579
Really… Truly…

755
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:55,715
Thank you so much.

756
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:56,983
Your ramen is good.

757
00:40:57,617 --> 00:41:01,254
Ah, my noodles are soggy now
thanks to you.

758
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,189
This one's on you.

759
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:06,158
Pardon me.

760
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:09,595
Oh, right.

761
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,201
This is the extra money.

762
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:17,303
I got it back.

763
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:24,710
Seto.

764
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,547
Depend on people more.

765
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:49,869
Huh?

766
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:53,139
I can give it back tomorrow.

767
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:02,014
Stand.

768
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:07,086
Bow.

769
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:09,722
Sit.

770
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:13,893
Let's get started.

771
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:16,495
Yes, sir.

772
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:41,354
What's this? A newcomer?

773
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,641
I ironed it for you.

774
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:06,912
IDIOT

775
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:21,460
I'm Akira Seto.

776
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:23,929
I'm joining
the UTokyo Special Course today.

777
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:25,297
Nice to meet you!

778
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,840
Mizuno.

779
00:43:35,474 --> 00:43:36,308
Yes, sir.

780
00:43:44,316 --> 00:43:46,652
Okay, let's begin.

781
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,853
Ready,

782
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:50,423
start!

783
00:43:56,729 --> 00:43:58,631
<i>Everything turned out well!</i>

784
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:02,968
Not everything.
We still only have four students.

785
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:04,637
We need one more for our goal.

786
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:06,672
Oh right…

787
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:09,141
If we can't get five students into UTokyo,

788
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,876
we won't be able to pay this.

789
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,179
It was for a student.

790
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:17,049
INVOICE
KAORI KISHIMOTO LAW OFFICE

791
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,551
Yes, but…

792
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,823
Sakuragi!

793
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:26,992
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

794
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:30,196
What are you saying?
I just helped with some research.

795
00:44:30,262 --> 00:44:31,897
Thank you so much.

796
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:35,367
He seems well, Mr. Sakuragi. He's back!

797
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:38,237
He's a little too enthusiastic,
even for me.

798
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:40,606
Do your best to back him up.

799
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:43,175
I will. Let me complain to you some time.

800
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:44,176
Sure.

801
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,514
Pardon me. You have a visitor.

802
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:51,250
I have a visitor. I'll call again.

803
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:52,518
Okay, goodbye.

804
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:01,927
Long time no see.

805
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,532
Yes.

806
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,567
It's been a long time.

807
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:15,541
Mari, Mari! A butterfly!

808
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:18,777
Mari, a butterfly.

809
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:25,117
-Hello.
-Hi.

810
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,461
Let's go, Kenta.

811
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:48,707
<i>Another contest?</i>

812
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:50,543
<i>It would be hard for you to win</i>
<i>as you are now.</i>

813
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:52,645
<i>The Special Course</i>
<i>would really be eliminated!</i>

814
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:53,879
<i>Our secret weapon.</i>

815
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:55,581
-You've got to pass.
-I'll try.

816
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:57,950
That one person still hasn't changed.

817
00:45:58,017 --> 00:46:00,152
<i>What's 145 times three?</i>

818
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,254
