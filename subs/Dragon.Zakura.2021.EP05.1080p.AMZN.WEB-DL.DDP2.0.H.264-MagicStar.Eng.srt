1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:10,111
<i>Fujii! Don't be sad you lost</i>
<i>to the dummies in the Special Course.</i>

2
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,480
I know how humiliation feels.

3
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,317
I pissed my pants in front of everyone!

4
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,488
Compared to him, it's nothing!

5
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,023
Smoke one and feel better.

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,593
I'm not the same as you.

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,029
-What?
-Meanie!

8
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:37,138
<i>Hey! Why are you looking away?</i>

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,274
It's embarrassing having a lesson
and walking at the same time.

10
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,476
Plus, Mr. Smarty-pants is watching.

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:47,181
<i>Ah, the kid you beat, Ryo Fujii.</i>

12
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,617
<i>Just ignore a guy like him!</i>

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,553
<i>He'll never get into UTokyo anyway.</i>

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,657
<i>Next! What's 145 times three?</i>

15
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,065
Damn it!

16
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,601
But you do need to get
a minimum of five people in, right?

17
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,236
Yeah.

18
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,639
So you need at least one more student.

19
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,074
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,544
You said you have someone,
but when are they coming?

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,345
That super genius student.

22
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,181
No need to rush. They'll come.

23
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,951
You have to hurry
and begin intensive study!

24
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,419
That's it, tell him!

25
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,721
We really need you, Ms. Kishimoto!

26
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,324
Ms. Kishimoto, this is for you.

27
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,693
This looks delicious!

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,729
Our restaurant survived thanks to you.

29
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,898
Thank you so much.

30
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:42,703
That's an exaggeration.
This guy begged me to help.

31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,171
I don't remember begging.

32
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,606
Don't be embarrassed.

33
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:49,977
But I'm really happy.
You came to our rural town.

34
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:54,748
It's nothing, this is a nice place.
Cape Taibusa is wonderful.

35
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,751
You are so knowledgeable.
Have you come here before?

36
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,454
Yes, once, for work.

37
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,857
Is that so?

38
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,825
Thank you for the meal.

39
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,128
-Please come again.
-Thank you very much.

40
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,739
-Thank you!
-I'll eat the leftovers.

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,608
All clear.

42
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,147
Sorry, I just meant to say hello,
and they insisted I eat.

43
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,483
It's alright. Much better than
me eating with that asshole.

44
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,985
Watch your language.

45
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,154
He's really sorry for what happened.

46
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,189
Don't hold a grudge.

47
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,424
That's a waste of a life.

48
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,126
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,663
So, how are things progressing?

50
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,832
Most are in agreement,

51
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,801
but that one person still hasn't changed.

52
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,570
Ah.

53
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,040
Divisors of 24! Amano!

54
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:59,113
24? 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,483
Correct! Now divisors of 36, Seto!

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,921
36? Um, 1, 2, 3… what else?

57
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,622
4, um…

58
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,791
6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

59
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,394
Too slow!
The grade schoolers will laugh at you.

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,931
What is this punishment game?
Why do we have to run?

61
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,201
Mr. Yanagi says math is Sparta.

62
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,570
Ten more laps for complainers!

63
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,339
I'll do it, I'll do anything.

64
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,941
What is that?

65
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,678
At my sacred school,
Spartan training in these modern times?

66
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,114
Gives me the creeps. Do something!

67
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,151
I just told them to stop.

68
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,188
But Mr. Sakuragi said,
"Don't meddle with the Special Course!"

69
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,293
How's Fujii?
I'm sure he's working as hard as ever.

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,697
Well… Ever since he lost the contest,

71
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,200
I guess you'd call it a slump.

72
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,537
There's no way I can lose to those idiots.

73
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,807
That was a once-in-a-decade
type of accident.

74
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,043
Fujii, don't work too hard, okay?

75
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,415
Don't tell me what to do, Third-Rate!

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,619
-That's bad.
-Yes.

77
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,887
Chairman.

78
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,729
-Another contest?
-Yes, Fujii wants to.

79
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,032
At this rate, I'm worried
about his mental health.

80
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,202
Settling the score with a fair test

81
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,737
is the role of the instructor.

82
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,076
Use the Common Test
for University Admissions.

83
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,911
-Then nobody can complain.
-Huh?

84
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,081
-Very good.
-Sir! The level is too high!

85
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,850
It will be a good experience.

86
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,353
English, Math, and Literature.
The test is two weeks.

87
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,024
The Special Course student
with the highest score will be counted.

88
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,825
Those scores will go against Fujii's.

89
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:57,164
Fine. In that case,
don't make the losing class disband.

90
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,533
-That's…
-No, the loser immediately disbands.

91
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,268
-Sir!
-But, Chairman.

92
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:06,807
If you lose, you can't make a new course
with a slightly different name.

93
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,843
Swear you will never again
do such petty things.

94
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,679
-If you can, I'll do it.
-Sure

95
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,581
No. There's too much
difference in ability.

96
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,583
-Give us a handicap.
-Handicap?

97
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,620
How about if they get over half
of Fujii's score,

98
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,088
the Special Course wins?

99
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,189
Not necessary.

100
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,824
Hang on now.

101
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,028
We won't have the advantage
with the types of questions.

102
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,097
It's the Common Test!

103
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,633
Fujii will definitely score over 700.

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,436
We could get 200 if we're lucky.

105
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,538
Our kids couldn't possibly win.

106
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,940
We can't ask them to protect
the Special Course.

107
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,176
Have you ever thought about how they feel?

108
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,346
They want to go to UTokyo,
they trust us, they're fighting.

109
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,314
Are you going to abandon them?

110
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,049
Blah-blah-blah! Enough from you.

111
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,250
Hey!

112
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,252
You can fight somewhere else.

113
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,390
Hold the competition in two weeks.

114
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,425
No handicap.

115
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,327
It's agreed.

116
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,833
I told you,
there's a super genius student.

117
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,469
Our secret weapon.

118
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,505
Could it be Kosugi?

119
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,578
<i>What? We're doing it again?</i>

120
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,981
-Are you serious?
-Why did you accept that contest?

121
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,786
You'll have to take the Common Test
on the road to UTokyo eventually.

122
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,921
It's good to start early.

123
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,491
That may be true,
but the contest is in two weeks.

124
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,727
-That's one week shorter than last time.
-Yeah.

125
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,096
If we lose, the course is gone.
No way. No, no!

126
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,699
We have zero chance. What can we do?

127
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:42,169
-Everyone calm down.
-The teacher got us all here.

128
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,538
-What'll he do if we disband?
-What will happen?

129
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,842
Yeah, yeah, enough.
Fine, I won't expect anything from you.

130
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,846
This time, it's a competition
of the highest scores.

131
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,682
So one person is enough.

132
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,252
The Special Course captain will be…

133
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:01,922
…him.

134
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,264
Huh?

135
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,899
What?!

136
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,704
But Kenta's not even
a Special Course student.

137
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,007
I scouted him.
He wants to get into UTokyo.

138
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,509
-Huh?
-Sir, do you know his grades?

139
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,946
-He's the lowest ranking in our year!
-I don't think he even ranks!

140
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,481
You're not much better…

141
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,783
No, I'm better than Kenta.

142
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,187
Sir, are you serious? It's Kenta!

143
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,963
Ms. Tamura. Show me Kenta Hara's grades.

144
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,899
-Huh? Alright.
-Thank you.

145
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,968
Here you are.

146
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,506
Why? Why Kenta of all people?

147
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,342
I don't know what he's thinking.

148
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,744
Hey, what is this?
What do you want with Kenta?

149
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,882
-One, one, one, all ones.
-Speak to me.

150
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,083
Why Kenta…

151
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,852
Ms. Mizuno!

152
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,890
Hey Kenta, starting today,
these are your new classmates.

153
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,860
-I'll study?
-Yeah.

154
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,161
Watch this.

155
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:15,829
Kenta.

156
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:17,965
What's 800 plus 200?

157
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,199
Hm?

158
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:24,705
See?

159
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,573
-I told you.
-You're pretty bad too.

160
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,076
Sir, this has got to be a mistake.

161
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:29,977
What will you do?

162
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,880
Nothing.
The Special Course captain is Kenta.

163
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,350
I'm not teaching anyone
who doesn't want to learn.

164
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,252
-Let's go, Kenta.
-Yeah.

165
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,888
Hey, what is going on?

166
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,857
-Oh, it's you.
-The Special Course captain is Kenta?

167
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,393
Him, in UTokyo? Give me a break.

168
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,896
When will you get bored of
making a fool of me?

169
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,633
-You're mighty testy today.
-Don't change the subject!

170
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,235
Explain yourself! What is this?

171
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,205
This worm could never aim for UTokyo.

172
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,474
-Oh yeah?
-You can tell by looking at him.

173
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,043
He's missing a few screws up here.

174
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,913
He's always crawling on the ground,
going after bugs.

175
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,748
It's like, which one is the worm?

176
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,750
-Fujii.
-You all.

177
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,186
None of you think he can get into UTokyo,
so don't pretend!

178
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,454
I told you before.

179
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,058
Before you criticize others,
fix your own personality.

180
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,826
UTokyo's impossible for you now.

181
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,663
-Bye. Let's go, Kenta.
-Hang on.

182
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,333
-What's this crap?
-No!

183
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,938
Is it really so important?

184
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:35,275
Put it away.
This is a school, not your yard.

185
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,177
-Understand?
-Stop!

186
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,815
-Hey!
-Kenta, go get it.

187
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,785
-Did you need to do that?
-Fujii, smarten up.

188
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,260
Ow.

189
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,529
No, Kenta!

190
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:59,266
-No, stop, Kenta!
-Let go, Kenta!

191
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,301
-Calm down.
-Amano!

192
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,470
Ouch. He's the worst.

193
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,707
Fujii, apologize to Kenta.

194
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,142
Huh? He's the one who got violent.

195
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,044
Why do I have to apologize to him?

196
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,213
He's not worth living.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,049
Hey that's enough from you.

198
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,053
Hey, Kenta. Violence is never the answer.

199
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,989
Whoever starts it gets the blame.

200
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,558
Idiot! He doesn't understand.

201
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,496
Anyway you don't have to twist Fujii's arm
to beat him.

202
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:30,964
Huh?

203
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,600
Kenta, beat me?

204
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,403
What, in arm wrestling? Give me a break!

205
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,306
You'll compete in two weeks.
There's no rush.

206
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,610
If you lose, all of you. You too.

207
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,214
Put your head on the ground
and apologize to me.

208
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,348
Wanna make a bet?

209
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,917
If I lose, I'll bow down to you.

210
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,721
If you lose,
join the Special Course study camp.

211
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,724
It'll never happen. Sure.

212
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,264
Go on, crawl on the ground.

213
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,399
Worm.

214
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,805
He's really the worst. Rotten to the core.

215
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,540
Are you okay, Kenta?

216
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,782
Mr. Sakuragi.
Ms. Tamura wants to talk to you.

217
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,651
Okay!

218
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,054
I can see what you're doing.

219
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,522
What's this about?

220
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,825
You can't beat Fujii,
so you're getting Kenta to join

221
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,194
so he will pull his childhood friend
Kosugi in.

222
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,365
She's the only one who can beat Fujii.

223
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,167
You're really a mean man.

224
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,838
Listen. If you use Kenta for your own gain

225
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,840
and he's harmed even a bit,

226
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,276
I will never forgive you.

227
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,280
No matter what happens,
I'm never joining the Special Course.

228
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:02,823
Your secret weapon was Kosugi after all.

229
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,758
You strategist, you.

230
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,928
I've never been targeting Kosugi.

231
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,630
Huh? Then why Kenta?

232
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,232
You want to know?

233
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,102
Come.

234
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,539
You know, I didn't come to catch bugs.

235
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,808
What are you going to tell me?

236
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,010
Just wait! Oh! There's one!

237
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,847
Oof! Alright! Got it.

238
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,116
I caught it! Kenta.

239
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,250
Look.

240
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,259
Japanese Tiger Beetle.
It sometimes looks backward,

241
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,528
so it's sometimes called "the pathfinder."

242
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,296
It digs a hole and lives in it.

243
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,499
It's a vulnerable species
in Gunma and Saga.

244
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,869
In Aomori, Tochigi, and Tokyo
it's a near-threatened species.

245
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,071
Whoa, amazing.

246
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,019
Why? After you went to the trouble
of catching it…

247
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,621
You're curious about the wing motion?

248
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,122
Yeah.

249
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,591
I have something you'll like. Come.

250
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,396
This is for you.

251
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,099
And this.

252
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,098
These are English, Math,
and Literature questions.

253
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,302
There's 60 to 90 minutes for each subject.

254
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,505
There are no essay questions.
It's all multiple-choice.

255
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,509
Huh? With multiple-choice, I have a chance
even if I just pick randomly!

256
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,511
If we could win that way,
we wouldn't study.

257
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,812
Oh, yeah.

258
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,980
You're right, Seto.

259
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,851
As he said, even if you don't know,
it's important to answer every question.

260
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,421
A lot of students run out of time
before the end.

261
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,724
For that reason, it's a good idea
to get used to the exam format.

262
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,192
I see.

263
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,927
But I don't understand this at all.

264
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,796
The scope of the questions is so broad.

265
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,398
We really do have zero chance.

266
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,367
Well, don't despair.

267
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,336
To help your score rise even a little,

268
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,105
you're doing these.

269
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,140
There it is. Drills again?

270
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,677
But we've reached high school level.

271
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,913
Do them five times
before the contest with Fujii.

272
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,748
-Five times?
-Again?

273
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,818
Most questions on the Common Test
are about basic knowledge.

274
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,420
If you don't know,
look at the answers and choose one.

275
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,755
Just keep doing that.

276
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,692
And I'll tell you
what you need to strengthen.

277
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,094
That is…

278
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,696
Vocabulary.

279
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,667
Vocabulary? What's that?

280
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,036
Seriously, you guys.

281
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,204
Mizuno.

282
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,542
Vocabulary.
That's how many words you know.

283
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,144
Or that you know how to use.

284
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,913
Oh, you mean words.

285
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,180
I'm already doing that.

286
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,950
-Huh?
-My third set.

287
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,586
Wow, Seto! Then he's fine!

288
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,288
Typical failure.

289
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,924
Huh? What's wrong with these?

290
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,260
If you made a test, what answers
would you choose for multiple-choice?

291
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,964
Words that are similar
but slightly different?

292
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,666
-That's right.
-Oh.

293
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,268
Answer choices are usually
words with similar meanings.

294
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,438
People are easily fooled
by questions like that.

295
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,407
It's easy to mix up what you memorize.

296
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,842
If you're just
blindly memorizing like that,

297
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,445
you increase vague knowledge
and feel like you've studied.

298
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,646
That's dangerous.

299
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,914
Seriously?

300
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,717
The vocabulary you need
is <i>certain </i>vocabulary.

301
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,586
I'm not just talking about English.

302
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,090
First you need Japanese.

303
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,427
Japanese? Isn't it too late for that?

304
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,064
Okay, can you tell me
what "surmise" means?

305
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,233
Um, that's, uh, you know.

306
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,236
Um… um… I've almost got it.

307
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,906
Many test takers have a poor vocabulary.

308
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,309
They read their textbooks
while only vaguely understanding.

309
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,045
But that vagueness will have your neck
during the exam.

310
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,016
If your vocabulary is poor,
it'll drag every subject down.

311
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,718
What should we do?

312
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,885
Good question.

313
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,788
I have a method for increasing vocabulary.

314
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,324
Of these four, choose the answer.
Multiple-choice.

315
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,027
1. Go to karaoke.

316
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,131
2. Watch movies.

317
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,935
3. Play games.

318
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,171
4. Read illustrated reference books.

319
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,007
-Seto.
-Illustrated reference books.

320
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:48,941
Wrong!

321
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,309
-Huh?
-It's games.

322
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,544
-Games?
-Yes, games! Mizuno.

323
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,446
Okay everyone.

324
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,181
Let's play Magical Banana.

325
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,816
Magical Banana? That one?

326
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,551
"You say banana, I say yellow."

327
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,788
Let's try it. The rules are simple.

328
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,859
I give a word, and you think of related
synonyms, opposites, and similar words.

329
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,062
You reply with the word
without breaking the rhythm.

330
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,097
That's simple.

331
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,600
Reply with a two-kanji compound word.

332
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,403
Two kanji? It's restricted?

333
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,506
-That seems way harder.
-I'll start.

334
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,775
Magical weather.

335
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,010
You say weather, I say clear sky.

336
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,845
You say clear sky…

337
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,581
-I say sunny. You..
-No!

338
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,118
It has to be two kanji. Seto out.
Three laps!

339
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,054
-Seriously?
-Next!

340
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,058
Magical weather.
I say weather, you say clear sky.

341
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,026
You say clear sky, I say rainy sky.

342
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,629
You say rainy sky, I say heavy rain.

343
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,231
You say heavy rain…

344
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,201
-I say cloudy sky.
-You say cloudy sky…

345
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,136
-I don't know!
-Yes!

346
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,671
-Hayase out!
-Huh?

347
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,773
Hang on, this is too hard!

348
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,344
Other weather words include bad weather,
stormy weather, and hot weather.

349
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,213
I recommend making a list.

350
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,450
This game works for anything.
English, math, literature, science.

351
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,819
Following the rhythm activates your brain.

352
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,454
It improves memory retention.

353
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,690
Refresh during a study break,
or even play alone.

354
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,893
Do it every day and your vocabulary will
definitely improve.

355
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,230
There are tons more games
that aid in studying.

356
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,966
You don't need to suffer
to improve your grades.

357
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,069
You need fun effort. Remember that.

358
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,038
Yes, sir.

359
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,941
But sir, what about Kenta?

360
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,844
Let him be.
He doesn't need games like this.

361
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,512
-Huh?
-Doesn't need them?

362
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,215
Huh? I think he has
the worst vocabulary of all.

363
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,018
He has zero vocabulary. He'd be worse
than me at Magical Banana.

364
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,225
Kenta, it's time to go home.

365
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,096
Kenta.

366
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,569
Kenta, aren't you hungry? Eat up.

367
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,305
We bought it for you. Don't be shy.

368
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,912
Kenta, let's go to class.

369
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,682
Hey, Kenta!

370
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,252
It's no use.
He's been at it since yesterday.

371
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,655
-But still…
-Let him walk until he's satisfied.

372
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,658
Kenta.

373
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,859
Kenta…

374
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,364
TWO DAYS LATER

375
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,436
Which kanji goes in the center?

376
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,206
BLUE, SUMMER, BLANK, EAR

377
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,208
-I know! Sky.
-Correct!

378
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,409
Yay!

379
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,312
The kanji for "sky" has three meanings.

380
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:45,250
The first is "sky" in "blue sky"
and "summer sky."

381
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,286
Next, is "space" used in "blank space."

382
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,855
It means "empty."

383
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,092
Lastly, "mishear" where it means "lie."

384
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,897
This way, you can improve your vocabulary
by linking it to kanji meanings.

385
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,798
Um, sir?

386
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,534
How long are you going
to leave Kenta alone?

387
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,735
Don't worry about him.

388
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,337
Why?

389
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm going to get him.

390
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,942
No! Leave him alone!

391
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,744
I can't! He's a member of our team.

392
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,848
-Hang on, Kaede!
-Hey, hey!

393
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,521
I swear, those guys…

394
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,492
Whoa, what a mess.

395
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,995
Oh man, what are you doing?

396
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,431
Kenta, you can draw in the classroom.

397
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,167
-Kenta!
-What are you drawing?

398
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,541
No way.

399
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,243
What is all this?

400
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:58,021
-Give back Kenta?
-Yes.

401
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,557
He'd be happier in my class,
don't you think?

402
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:03,193
Kenta is being left out, isn't he?

403
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,594
You misunderstand.

404
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,163
Kenta is in a separate room
so he can concentrate.

405
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:08,765
All lies!

406
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,701
You're torturing him with forced study!

407
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:14,170
I'm not done talking with you!

408
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,639
You should see for yourself.

409
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:17,774
Come with me.

410
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,644
If you're hurting Kenta,

411
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,113
I'll do whatever it takes
to chase you out.

412
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,080
Sheesh.

413
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:26,483
-Are you listening?
-Ah!

414
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,151
Hey, Kenta.

415
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:34,991
Poor thing.

416
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,763
I told you. You can't force him to study.
It'll only make him suffer.

417
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,999
C'mon, let's go Kenta. Okay.

418
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:45,969
Kenta.

419
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:50,440
He has a habit of making that sound
when he's concentrating.

420
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:54,711
Concentrating? He doesn't understand
all this English and mathematics!

421
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:59,949
Kenta wrote all of this.

422
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:04,688
Kenta did?

423
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:08,024
I've been his teacher for two years.

424
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,960
He can't even do simple English.

425
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,229
He could never write this!

426
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,343
Hey Kenta, let's play a game.

427
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,545
-Oh?
-Yeah, yeah.

428
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,380
-Let's start with English.
-Yeah.

429
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:34,050
Wait, these are questions from the
Common Test for University Admissions.

430
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:37,554
-Yeah.
-No, Mari. It's a game! A game.

431
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,657
-Yeah, a game, Kenta.
-Yeah.

432
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,226
-Like always, the first to finish wins.
-Okay.

433
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,629
Okay, ready? Start!

434
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:58,108
-I'm done!
-Fast!

435
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,542
You're so fast, Kenta!

436
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:02,245
Ms. Tamura, mark it.

437
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,701
Ma'am, how is it? Was I right?

438
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,670
Tell him. How did he do?

439
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:31,775
A-All correct.

440
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,046
Alright! Next is math.

441
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,616
-Go against Amano.
-Yeah.

442
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:42,218
Whoa, there are lots of questions.

443
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,687
What's going on?

444
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:47,123
Hey, what is this?

445
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,860
Let's go.

446
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,800
Hey, what happened? Tell me.

447
00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,636
It's simple.

448
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,540
I just respected Kenta's love for insects.

449
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:07,677
I did that too. I spent two years
trying different methods.

450
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:11,247
<i>I filled the classroom with</i>
<i>insect specimens</i>

451
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:14,250
<i>and cages filled with insects.</i>

452
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,419
<i>But he wasn't interested.</i>

453
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:19,255
<i>He couldn't even be in the room.</i>

454
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:22,659
Of course. Everything you did
was off the mark.

455
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,427
Nothing but arrogant imposition.

456
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:26,930
He could never kill an insect.

457
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,299
<i>He hates specimen boxes.</i>

458
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:32,001
<i>He feels sorry for insects in cages.</i>

459
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:36,206
<i>He wants them to be comfortable,</i>
<i>living freely.</i>

460
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:40,910
Kenta had been observing wing movement.

461
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,745
So Mr. Sakuragi…

462
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:51,221
He gave him this book.

463
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:54,691
"A Study of Insect Flapping Wing"?

464
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:58,228
The leading entomology researcher
at Harvard.

465
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:01,030
Professor Colin Nelson's latest thesis.

466
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:04,334
<i>"Everything you want to know is in here."</i>

467
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,704
<i>I told him that, and he began reading it</i>
<i>at an amazing speed.</i>

468
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,339
<i>That wasn't enough.</i>

469
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:12,542
<i>He wanted to test his own theory</i>
<i>with Professor Nelson.</i>

470
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,178
So he's writing this English letter.

471
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,547
He's not done yet.

472
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:20,216
This only took a few days.

473
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:23,086
All that… how?

474
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,621
But he's…

475
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:26,322
I'm not surprised you didn't see it.

476
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,860
Kenta has a low auditory
short-term memory.

477
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:34,330
<i>He can't even do simple calculations</i>
<i>if he hears them.</i>

478
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:36,866
<i>He soon forgets what the teacher says.</i>

479
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:40,603
<i>Because of that, it's easy for him</i>
<i>to fall behind.</i>

480
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:44,941
But he never forgets anything he sees.

481
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:48,111
<i>He has a whole English dictionary</i>
<i>in his head.</i>

482
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,379
A whole dictionary?

483
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:53,716
That's not all. Look at this.

484
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,988
The students made this game for him.

485
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:02,058
Kenta was absorbed by the book,

486
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:05,161
<i>but he wasn't interested in tests.</i>

487
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,697
But the kids figured, if it was a game,

488
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:10,733
<i>Kenta could enjoy it,</i>
<i>so they came up with several.</i>

489
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,437
We didn't make them do it.
They all did it on their own.

490
00:26:14,504 --> 00:26:17,507
They are the kind of people UTokyo wants.

491
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:21,010
Through trial and error
and playing many games,

492
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:22,645
they all improved their grades.

493
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:27,050
If one can't get through,
they all cooperate to solve it together.

494
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,254
<i>The UTokyo Special Course</i>
<i>has become that sort of class.</i>

495
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,122
Thanks to Kenta.

496
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:36,993
But even if he gets into UTokyo,
will he be able to follow the lectures?

497
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,063
It's okay, UTokyo has a culture
of transcribing lectures.

498
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,998
<i>A culture of transcribing?</i>

499
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:44,767
<i>They take turns transcribing the</i>
<i>professor's lecture.</i>

500
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:49,372
There are a lot of people with
developmental disabilities at UTokyo.

501
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,343
When did you first realize his talents?

502
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,245
Several weeks ago, on a sunny day
with a cloudless sky.

503
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:59,148
<i>He suddenly said heavy rain would fall.</i>

504
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,584
<i>No weather report predicted it.</i>

505
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,553
"How did you know?" I asked him.

506
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,421
How did you know it would rain?

507
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:06,923
The ants were closing the doors.

508
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:08,558
Ants?

509
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,293
March 23, 2019.

510
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,328
Saturday, 12:42,
the ants blocked their nest.

511
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,997
At 2:32 p.m., rain fell.

512
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,367
Thursday, April 2, 2020.
6:08 p.m., the ants blocked their nest.

513
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,002
8:23 p.m., rain fell.

514
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:23,406
Ant's body hair and antennae are sensitive
to flavor, sound and temperature.

515
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,377
They can feel the air pressure change
when the humidity changes.

516
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:29,779
They cover their nest
before it gets flooded.

517
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,882
<i>Date, time, weather.</i>
<i>He remembered it all exactly.</i>

518
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,118
<i>Then he derived a rule from the data.</i>

519
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:38,588
Observation, insight, memory,
all impeccable.

520
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,491
He has what it takes for UTokyo.

521
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,293
I couldn't see it.

522
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:46,629
I've failed as a homeroom teacher.

523
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:50,466
I'm not saying that.

524
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:54,937
Working with a kid
with a developmental disability

525
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,539
is no small feat.

526
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:59,142
You did well.

527
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,011
You tell just by looking at him.

528
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,150
-I did it! I did it!
-Oh, Kenta!

529
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:08,751
-I did it.
-Show her.

530
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,353
Ms. Tamura, mark it.

531
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:13,322
Mari, I did it.

532
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,291
Yeah.

533
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,332
Since joining the Special Course,

534
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,602
he's talked about you two a lot.

535
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,272
Even if you missed the mark,

536
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:32,775
he knows that you did a lot for him.

537
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:35,478
Your feelings reached him.

538
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:38,915
You were there for him

539
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:41,718
and made school a place

540
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:43,686
where he could feel safe.

541
00:28:43,753 --> 00:28:47,990
That's the most important part
of developing talent.

542
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:54,831
Yes…

543
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,868
Ms. Tamura! Ms. Tamura!

544
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:00,670
Mark Amano's too!

545
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:03,673
Yes, okay.

546
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,941
Yeah, yeah.

547
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:22,024
I think you can beat Fujii.

548
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,329
It won't be so simple.

549
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,240
Look at Kenta's marks.

550
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,677
He only got half marks in English.

551
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:44,680
His reading is 100
but his listening is zero.

552
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:46,783
That's not all. Look at Literature.

553
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,418
Classics and memorization are fine,

554
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:52,922
but reading comprehension and questions
about the intention of the author

555
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,624
are difficult for Kenta.

556
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:57,326
What can we do?

557
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:58,294
Nothing.

558
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:00,496
That's just how he is.

559
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:03,733
The rest of them have to do their best.

560
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,970
If they don't, I'll have to put my head
to the ground for the first time.

561
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:11,440
I never did it in my biker gang days.

562
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,354
You eat a lot more than you look.

563
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,957
It was good. Thanks.

564
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:31,127
Kosugi, you really won't go to university?

565
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,461
Yeah.

566
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:34,397
That's a waste.

567
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,933
Kenta would be so happy if you joined.

568
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,335
What are you saying?

569
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,970
Ah.

570
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:44,841
You heard, from Mr. Sakuragi.

571
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,943
Kenta is working really hard.

572
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:49,245
But he can't do listening and literature…

573
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:52,849
What's this?

574
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,483
You're the fourth person.

575
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:00,122
"Free gyoza coupon, Setoya"?

576
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,729
You know, Fujii said
these horrible things to Kenta.

577
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:10,233
This contest is so Kenta can beat Fujii.

578
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,735
We want to help him win. Please!

579
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,537
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

580
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,505
-Welcome.
-Hayase, Hayase!

581
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:18,441
Oh, it's Hayase and Kosugi.

582
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,877
Oh, uh, this is…

583
00:31:20,943 --> 00:31:22,245
Uh…

584
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:24,447
Bribing Kosugi instead of studying?

585
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:26,382
You don't have to say it like that.

586
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,585
I had to. We'll just hold him back.

587
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,355
Kenta's working so hard.

588
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:35,725
It's embarrassing, but it's reality.

589
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,694
You've finally realized
your own abilities.

590
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,795
Like you said,

591
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:42,865
it would be hard for you to win
against Fujii as you are now.

592
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:46,502
But losing is a good experience too.

593
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,237
-Hey.
-Sir.

594
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:50,306
The Special Course
would really be eliminated!

595
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,474
You'll have to kneel.

596
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,442
We'll deal with that when it comes.

597
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,077
-Ramen, please.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,717
RYO FUJII VS UTOKYO SPECIAL COURSE
CONTEST DAY

599
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:05,321
If we lose, will the Special Course
really get disbanded?

600
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:06,722
Don't be scared.

601
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:08,658
We've done what we can.

602
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:10,526
Yeah.

603
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:14,196
<i>More importantly, has anyone seen Kenta?</i>

604
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:21,070
Sir!

605
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,339
It's Kenta!

606
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:31,612
Any word from Kenta?

607
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,049
He's probably looking at bugs.

608
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:37,618
Actually, Mr. Sakuragi is gone too.

609
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:39,186
He was here this morning.

610
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,357
The test will begin soon.

611
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:45,826
Chairman. Kenta isn't here yet.

612
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,628
And Mr. Sakuragi, too.

613
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:53,567
Time waits for no one.

614
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:57,271
Or do you think the real exam
will wait for you?

615
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,447
Kenta!

616
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,250
-I'm not going.
-But…

617
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:10,951
The test is starting.

618
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:14,221
You played games and
studied hard with everyone.

619
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:17,358
I'm not going. I'm not going to UTokyo.

620
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,162
<i>You have 70 minutes.</i>

621
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:23,497
The first subject is math.

622
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:28,903
Now, begin.

623
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,541
<i>Fujii told me.</i>

624
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:37,244
Researchers at UTokyo kill insects.

625
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:38,279
ONE HOUR BEFORE

626
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:41,215
Kenta, before the test,
I'll show you something good.

627
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,752
Look, an insect dissection.

628
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:46,053
Hey, look at it.

629
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,223
You'll do it at UTokyo. Dissection.

630
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,358
No, no. I won't.

631
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:53,794
Don't you know?

632
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:57,064
Why are bugs so easy to stomp?

633
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,668
Their lives

634
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,469
are not necessary.

635
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:04,939
They're useless. They're in the way.

636
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,341
They're annoying. Get it?

637
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:10,044
Just like you. Unwelcome!

638
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,383
It's like Fujii said.

639
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:20,988
I can't be like everyone.

640
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,457
I can't even do simple things.

641
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,160
I'm in everyone's way.

642
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:27,761
I'm causing trouble.

643
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:30,431
I'm unwanted.

644
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,040
An unwanted life, huh?

645
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:45,246
There's no such thing!

646
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,781
So what, you can't do things?

647
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:50,517
That's why you have friends!

648
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:54,421
<i>They're all taking that test</i>
<i>as well as they can.</i>

649
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,658
<i>They want you to win.</i>

650
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:00,794
Everyone came to ask me.

651
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:04,064
To join the Special Course
so they could defeat Fujii for you.

652
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,469
Do you still think your life is unwanted?

653
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:11,772
If you can't do things,
are you in the way?

654
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:15,142
Are insects that are easily killed
at man's convenience

655
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,645
in the way just by living?

656
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:19,413
Are they harmful?

657
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:23,550
No.

658
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,386
No, no, no!

659
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:29,156
Creatures that harm just by living

660
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:30,791
don't exist on Earth.

661
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:34,061
Insects

662
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,664
are part of the ecosystem.

663
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,336
For the natural world,

664
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:43,904
humans cause more harm.

665
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:46,373
They destroy the ecosystem.

666
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,410
They kill more than they can eat.

667
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:52,012
That's not okay.

668
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,015
All life is equal.

669
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,952
We mustn't kill.

670
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,020
If you think so,

671
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:02,222
you have to make that world.

672
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:05,926
Change society.

673
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,261
Break the mold.

674
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:10,597
Make a future
that's in harmony with insects.

675
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,400
How?

676
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:17,338
If you become a researcher, maybe you can.

677
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,975
I'll get you into UTokyo.

678
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,912
The rest is up to you.

679
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,848
Kenta.

680
00:36:30,617 --> 00:36:32,786
You don't have to do it
the same as others.

681
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,390
There's a way that will work for you.

682
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:57,311
I'll go!

683
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:03,650
I'll go to UTokyo.

684
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,120
I'll go to UTokyo!

685
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:10,724
Alright.

686
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,161
Causing trouble just by living?

687
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,864
I'll never let you say that again!

688
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,401
Okay!

689
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:25,906
Sir.

690
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,243
I…

691
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,646
It's your life.

692
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:35,749
You decide.

693
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,232
Kenta! Kosugi?

694
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,669
-I'll take the test.
-Huh?

695
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:58,172
But there's only 20 minutes left for math.

696
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,007
Yeah. It's okay.

697
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:02,109
Me too.

698
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,311
I'll join the Special Course.

699
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:09,583
Hang on. What is this?

700
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,752
I can't? I just got motivated now.

701
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,020
I'm not saying you can't.

702
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,489
Alright, I'll take the test.

703
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,760
That's ridiculous.
How can this be allowed?

704
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,095
I can't do this.

705
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,296
You.

706
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:25,199
Turning tail and running?

707
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:26,834
Huh?

708
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:33,107
Yes!

709
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,375
Sit.

710
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,647
What happened with Kenta?

711
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:15,816
How could he…

712
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:17,151
I have a question for you.

713
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,419
Why did you accept Kenta Hara
into this school?

714
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:23,991
Do you think we accepted anyone
because we were below capacity?

715
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:25,325
You didn't?

716
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:27,027
Are you mocking me?

717
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:32,699
Listen. Out in the world,
there are lots of different people.

718
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:34,968
The students will join society.

719
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:38,105
They have to join hands with everyone
and live together.

720
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:41,975
Respecting diversity
and cooperating with one another.

721
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,677
I wanted them to learn that.

722
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,880
So even if a child with
a learning disability wanted to join,

723
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:48,782
I put them in the regular class.

724
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:54,288
I thought you only had mean thoughts,

725
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:57,291
but you have good ideas too.

726
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:00,360
I could develop Kenta's talent

727
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:03,997
because of your school's free attitude
that didn't force him to study.

728
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:07,868
Resistance and aversion to studying?

729
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:09,736
He had almost none.

730
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,706
So when he did begin studying,

731
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:15,209
he absorbed knowledge at an amazing rate.

732
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,379
Students should be free
to express their individuality.

733
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:22,950
People don't learn
by being forced to study.

734
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:25,886
But it's not okay to
just let people go unchecked.

735
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:29,389
People have a natural urge
to try to improve.

736
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,094
When they're ready, students will
break out of their shells and bloom.

737
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:37,664
The role of the teacher is to
take that sleeping curiosity

738
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:39,600
and stimulate it.

739
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:41,768
Am I wrong?

740
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:48,642
<i>The grading of all subjects has finished.</i>

741
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,644
Here are the results.

742
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:52,646
Mr. Oyama.

743
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:56,083
Each subject is worth 200 points.

744
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:58,352
From Fujii.

745
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:02,055
Literature.

746
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:05,092
169 points.

747
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:06,760
-Whoa.
-Really?

748
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:08,929
English.

749
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:11,231
170 points.

750
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:12,599
Seriously?

751
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,968
Math.

752
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:17,237
162 points.

753
00:41:20,907 --> 00:41:23,110
Next, the UTokyo Special Course marks.

754
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:26,079
Literature, Kosugi.

755
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:29,516
175 points.

756
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,952
Yeah! Yeah!

757
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,020
You're amazing.

758
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:36,556
English.

759
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:38,692
Kosugi.

760
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,362
179 points.

761
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,031
-We won two!
-Huh?

762
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:46,933
-Yeah, we won!
-Yay!

763
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,235
Yeah! Yeah!

764
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:51,038
We won! We won!

765
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,573
-Yay!
-Woo!

766
00:41:54,174 --> 00:41:55,475
Quiet!

767
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,344
Lastly.

768
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,079
Math.

769
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,050
Kenta Hara.

770
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,287
Amazingly,

771
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:11,358
198 points.

772
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:13,660
Huh?

773
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:18,231
Kenta…

774
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,234
Yay!

775
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:22,836
Kenta!

776
00:42:22,903 --> 00:42:24,705
You're amazing!

777
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,873
Wow, Kenta!

778
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,744
Kosugi, your scores are amazing!

779
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:32,612
Bullshit…

780
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,114
This is bullshit!

781
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:35,716
This is totally unacceptable.

782
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:37,250
Fujii.

783
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,352
This is bullshit…

784
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:40,620
I've…

785
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:42,823
Do you know how hard I…

786
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:44,891
Fujii.

787
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:47,394
You did well.

788
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:50,764
This is your highest score yet, right?

789
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,601
As promised,

790
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:57,537
we will disband the
Elite University Course today.

791
00:42:57,604 --> 00:43:00,040
But this isn't your fault.

792
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:02,743
Exactly.
The reason for the defeat is elsewhere.

793
00:43:03,543 --> 00:43:04,945
Do you know? Chairman.

794
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:09,416
It's because you let
a student battle alone.

795
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,687
Fujii worked hard, but he didn't have
any teammates. That's the reason.

796
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:16,123
Teammates? Is this kindergarten?

797
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:18,425
It's clearly proven by data.

798
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:22,829
People who aim for UTokyo as a group
pass the exam much more often.

799
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:25,832
Say, a rural public school.

800
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:29,202
Maybe one student per year
gets accepted into UTokyo.

801
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,205
That student carries the expectations
of the whole town.

802
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,908
They go to the exam
as a member of the away team.

803
00:43:34,975 --> 00:43:37,911
And how about famous prep schools?

804
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:40,580
Every year, a number of students
go to take the exam.

805
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:42,182
"If they can do it, so can I."

806
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:44,918
In this way, they help each other improve.

807
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:48,422
On the day of the exam,
the room is full of familiar faces.

808
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:51,758
Who has the upper hand?
You know the answer.

809
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:56,363
The UTokyo Special Course
aims for it as a group.

810
00:43:56,963 --> 00:44:00,600
If you want to get into UTokyo,
you can join us.

811
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:04,704
Who would study with these idiots?

812
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:06,907
We are taking this seriously here.

813
00:44:06,973 --> 00:44:08,341
I could never.

814
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,445
First, you need to apologize to Kenta.

815
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,113
Yeah! Apologize!

816
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:16,183
I'd rather die than apologize.

817
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:25,292
<i>Are you really going to quit, Kosugi?</i>

818
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,328
Yes. I'm not interested in university.

819
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:32,132
Please take care of Kenta.

820
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,671
With your grades, not going to university
is a waste.

821
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:39,206
Why not?

822
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:42,409
You could get into UTokyo.

823
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:44,311
It's a huge opportunity.

824
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,882
If your parents are opposed,

825
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,183
I could talk to them.

826
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:52,252
Don't get involved!

827
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:56,756
Pardon me.

828
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:12,606
Mari.

829
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:16,409
Mari, Mari, Mari.

830
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:18,979
See you tomorrow.

831
00:45:19,946 --> 00:45:21,047
Yeah.

832
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:33,894
Don't give me that shit!

833
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,529
Say that again!

834
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:38,331
How could a woman

835
00:45:38,398 --> 00:45:40,567
go to university! How insolent!

836
00:45:40,634 --> 00:45:42,002
Mari… Mari…

837
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:44,271
You are not going to university!

838
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:46,439
You're not going!

839
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,074
<i>A study camp from hell?</i>

840
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:49,876
<i>You have poor reading comprehension.</i>

841
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:51,344
<i>I invited a special instructor.</i>

842
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:52,345
The Spartan instructor?

843
00:45:52,412 --> 00:45:53,980
This one is even scarier.

844
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,316
-Why are you here?
-Fair's fair.

845
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:59,319
A trick we can use for all subjects?
What a deal!

846
00:45:59,386 --> 00:46:00,320
100 words in 10 minutes?

847
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:01,588
-You too.
-Uh, me?

848
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:03,256
Ready, start!

849
00:46:03,323 --> 00:46:04,491
<i>Why a banana?</i>

850
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,159
Eat with energy efficiency in mind.

851
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:09,296
Tomorrow at 6 a.m., in uniforms
in front of the Dragon Zakura.

852
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:10,964
-Yay!
-You're amazing.

853
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:12,098
Okay, get up!

854
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:13,934
<i>I was having a good dream!</i>

855
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,002
If you're not expected to pass,

856
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,470
you'll be made to quit the course.

857
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:18,471
