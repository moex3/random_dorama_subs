1
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,783
It's hot!

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,353
Huh? Huh? Why?

3
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,289
What! A flat tire.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,759
Not when it's so hot out.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,661
Whoa, it's heavier than I thought.

6
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,698
-Let's go!
-Magical universe!

7
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,867
You say universe, I say Milky Way.

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,869
You say Milky Way, I say celestial.

9
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,504
You say celestial, I say Earth.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,240
-Good morning, Kosugi.
-Good morning.

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,376
Wow, look at that textbook.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,079
Won't you join the Special--

13
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,247
I have to go.

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,086
-Good morning.
-Morning!

15
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:55,856
Ma'am, we didn't understand something,
so we were discussing it.

16
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,626
I don't get this part about "mean"
from yesterday.

17
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,195
-Oh this.
-Is it "mean" like "meaning"…

18
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,396
You want to join!

19
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,364
That's ridiculous.

20
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:06,000
-Of course I don't.
-You seem very interested.

21
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,702
I just came to see what the dummies
were up to.

22
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,671
That's called being interested.

23
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,241
Hey, Fujii, that bet we had.

24
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,545
Joining the camp if you lost.
You remember you promised to come.

25
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,980
You are welcome anytime
to join the course.

26
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,651
But carry your chair and desk
here yourself.

27
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:29,857
<i>Study camp?</i>

28
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,426
The Special Course will have
a three-day study camp.

29
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,595
I came to get your permission for them.

30
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,030
They can do what they want.

31
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,499
Also, it seems that the
UTokyo Special Course

32
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,768
may be close to welcoming
Fujii and Kosugi.

33
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,803
We can't allow that!

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,006
If that's what they want to do,
we can watch quietly.

35
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,611
But if they join, they'll definitely
get into UTokyo.

36
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,881
The chances of you having to quit
will get higher.

37
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,985
About that. The former chairman
said he wants me to be chairman.

38
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,888
All I can think about now
is rebuilding the school.

39
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,724
And honestly, becoming the chairman is…

40
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,193
I know you're happy, don't try to hide it.

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,528
Huh?

42
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,097
Pardon me.

43
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:16,871
He's such a nasty man!
Despite being vice principal.

44
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,241
Okuda, did you find out who
the former chairman was talking to?

45
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,245
He seems to be
in the real estate business.

46
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,615
-Perhaps home renovations?
-You know it's about selling the school.

47
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,152
What?! Was he still looking into that?

48
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,920
So that's it.

49
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,790
He was using the vice principal
to get me to step down.

50
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,727
So he could sell the school.

51
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,963
-"Run, Melos"?
-We read this in junior high.

52
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,733
It's about a guy
who runs for his friend, right?

53
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,101
What are we supposed to do?

54
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,737
You have 10 minutes
to sum it up in 100 words.

55
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,173
-100 words in 10 minutes?
-Sum it up? How?

56
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,642
Oh yeah, Mizuno. You too.

57
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,576
Uh, me?

58
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,678
Okay, we're starting.

59
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,648
Ready, start!

60
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,251
<i>"Melos was enraged." What a first line.</i>

61
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,321
<i>Was Melos angry because the king</i>
<i>kept killing people?</i>

62
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,257
<i>Melos had a little sister</i>
<i>who was about to be married.</i>

63
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,293
<i>He wanted to go to the wedding</i>

64
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,196
<i>so his friend Selinuntius</i>
<i>became a hostage.</i>

65
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:18,199
<i>He ran until he was exhausted.</i>
<i>That's cool.</i>

66
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,267
<i>Melos made it on time! Good.</i>

67
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,703
Okay, stop! Hey.

68
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,340
Give it. Sheesh.

69
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,811
Huh?

70
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,749
Stop!

71
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,485
Hey, c'mon!

72
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,854
-Stop!
-Ugh, damn it.

73
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,692
These are terrible.

74
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,095
Kenta, you wrote "Melon"
instead of "Melos."

75
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,396
Oh, huh?

76
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,334
-Kenta…
-Keep laughing, Amano.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,302
Yours is completely off-target.

78
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,370
Huh?

79
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,139
Hayase, I'm not asking for your opinion.

80
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,308
Summarize the story in 100 words.

81
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,776
And Seto.

82
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,812
Your handwriting is so bad,
I can't read it.

83
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,747
Mizuno.

84
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,651
Excellent as always.

85
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,521
Of the students, Iwazaki did the best.

86
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,924
Nice! But to summarize,

87
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,126
I didn't know what to write or leave out.

88
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,594
Do you know why?

89
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,695
Why?

90
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,732
It's because you have
poor reading comprehension.

91
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,369
You keep using words that I don't know!

92
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,705
Reading comprehension is about
what the writer wants to say.

93
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,209
That is to say,
the ability to summarize concisely.

94
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,879
Your reading comprehension
is definitely lacking.

95
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,616
I can tell you've never
touched a book in your life.

96
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,185
I've read a lot of
illustrated reference books.

97
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,222
Sorry, your writing was so bad
I didn't feel like reading it.

98
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,190
Oh, is that all? Hey!

99
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,661
Reading comprehension is linked
to how much you read as a child.

100
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,930
Reading with a parent or on your own.
Looking up information.

101
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:00,067
Those with those habits as children
have reading comprehension.

102
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,436
As children? Isn't it too late now?

103
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,605
Yeah, there's less than a year
until the exam.

104
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:08,008
It's not too late.
There's a training method you can use.

105
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,010
Oh! Tell us sooner!

106
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,178
What sort of training?

107
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:15,382
Tomorrow at 6 a.m., be in uniform
at the Dragon Zakura with overnight gear.

108
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,284
Tomorrow?!

109
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,319
Tell us sooner!

110
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,421
Not a study camp from hell?

111
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,456
-Exactly right.
-Whoa.

112
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,159
-Hey, hey!
-Huh?

113
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,495
-No, uh…
-I invited a special instructor.

114
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,831
-Again?
-The Spartan instructor?

115
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,566
This one is even scarier.

116
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,600
Seriously?

117
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,568
You're kidding.

118
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,339
<i>We're finally starting the study camp.</i>

119
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,376
I've already made a three-day curriculum
so we can start anytime.

120
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,544
-Oh, have you?
-Yes.

121
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,981
Kosugi, our study camp starts tomorrow.
You come too.

122
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,150
Sir, Kosugi won't be able to.

123
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,019
-I'll think about it.
-Okay.

124
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,554
Huh?

125
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,958
That means there's a possibility, right?

126
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,527
Yeah.

127
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,599
STUDY CAMP DAY 1

128
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,801
Whew! I'm sleepy!

129
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,237
This is too early.

130
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,940
Huh? Amano.

131
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,476
-I'm no good at early mornings.
-Hey.

132
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,746
Whoa! Hey!

133
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,647
-I like mornings.
-Are you a rooster?

134
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,251
A study camp! This is real test prep now,
how exciting!

135
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,321
-Don't quit like always.
-That's definitely not happening.

136
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,222
Kosugi.

137
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,791
I'm here to help Kenta.

138
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,192
Looking forward to it!

139
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,427
Yeah…

140
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,530
Hey guys, welcome.

141
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:40,534
Racewalk 20 times around
the Dragon Zakura.

142
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,237
Get your brain in gear, then come up.

143
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,806
Iwazaki, you can walk.

144
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,409
-Huh?
-I'm sleepy…

145
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,476
Kenta, too fast.

146
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:54,681
Yeah!

147
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,785
No slacking!

148
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,120
I said racewalking!

149
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,755
-Oh man.
-Walk properly!

150
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,425
<i>Twenty laps first thing in the morning</i>
<i>is too much.</i>

151
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,127
-Seto, you cheated.
-Did not!

152
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,496
-You did.
-Did not!

153
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,231
But Amano was slow too.

154
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm just naturally slow!

155
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,703
-Why are you here?
-Fair's fair.

156
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,173
-I promised, so I came.
-Huh?

157
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,909
-I can't believe you came.
-Did you hit your head?

158
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,677
-Huh?
-Do you want to join the course?

159
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:24,845
Of course I don't.

160
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,413
I can't believe this.

161
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,416
What a racket. So what if Fujii came?
Good for him.

162
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,118
-You were there?
-Stop staring.

163
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,020
Put away your bags and sit down.

164
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,522
No matter the time you have,
it's not enough.

165
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,690
Learn from them.

166
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,561
Sheesh.

167
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,363
Good morning.

168
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,266
Finally the study camp.
Mizuno, I'm counting on you.

169
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,935
Mr. Takahara. Thank you.

170
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,903
You got permission from the chairman.

171
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,406
It's all I could do to help everyone.

172
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,941
-Do your best!
-Yes, sir.

173
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,478
Mr. Sakuragi. Thanks in advance.

174
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,247
-Bye.
-Alright, we're starting.

175
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,317
Your schedule for today is…

176
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,086
This.

177
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,522
FREEDOM

178
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,958
Today, you are free.

179
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,560
-Free?
-Huh?

180
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,563
What are you saying? Follow the schedule!

181
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,566
Use your time freely.
Do whatever you want.

182
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,568
If it's free study, what's the point?

183
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,770
I came all the way here. That's not cool.

184
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,771
Are you leaving?

185
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,574
I'm pretty sure you lost the bet…

186
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,279
There! Okay, get to it.

187
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,448
-Hey, wait!
-Hang on, sir!

188
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,850
Huh?

189
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,254
For now, study!

190
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,857
-Isn't that irresponsible?
-Seriously!

191
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,626
Independent study?

192
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,227
Alright!

193
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,906
Sir, what do you mean
they're free to do whatever all day?

194
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,108
I assembled a tight three-day menu!

195
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,678
-Menu?
-A 16-hour study schedule, like we did.

196
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,613
To give them the endurance to study.

197
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,482
-What era are you living in?
-Huh?!

198
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,417
Your success story makes this harder.

199
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,320
Old-fashioned education methods
become garbage over time.

200
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,923
-Garbage?
-Coercion and obedience are over.

201
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,393
-Huh?
-Those guys have modern values.

202
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,696
First, we have to recognize that.
Then trust them.

203
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,799
The role of the adult is those two things.

204
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,368
But what about
the special literature instructor?

205
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,970
Didn't you say you invited him?

206
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,374
Sheesh.

207
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,213
It's no good. I can't focus!

208
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:47,521
Hey, Kosugi. How can I
focus for hours on end and study like you?

209
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,690
I wanna know too!

210
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,492
I want to know why you guys can't do it.

211
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,930
Right…

212
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,035
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

213
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,437
Hang on!

214
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,138
I'm going to learn words outside.

215
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,640
Me too!

216
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,675
Huh? Hang on!

217
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:12,879
Seriously!

218
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:18,251
Recognize their values and trust them?
But I am worried.

219
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,458
Huh? Where is everyone else?

220
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,692
They left.

221
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,829
-I guess they ran away.
-No!

222
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:32,966
Vocabulary.

223
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,236
What's that?

224
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,038
Ah, damn it!

225
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,272
Seto.

226
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,677
I wanted to stretch a bit.

227
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,715
I can't do this. Studying and stuff.

228
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,418
I thought I'd catch up, but I can't.

229
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,589
Hey, about studying.

230
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,226
Those who can, and those who can't.

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,361
What's different?

232
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,174
"I am a good fisherman."

233
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,745
Amano! Amano!

234
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,882
Were you sleeping?

235
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,554
No, I was watching Study Sapuri,
and I just, uh…

236
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,490
It was just a second. I swear.

237
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,627
I just did a lap around the school.

238
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,232
Do you want to go back?

239
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,370
Yeah.

240
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,886
Kosugi's textbooks are so worn out.

241
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,022
How many times could she have read them?

242
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,790
Those guys are amazing.

243
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,495
I don't want to lose to them.

244
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,064
Me neither.

245
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,333
Me neither.

246
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,704
Where did they all go?

247
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,143
-You guys get ready.
-Okay!

248
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,912
Mr. Sakuragi, what are you doing?!

249
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,981
-Oof!
-Okay!

250
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,217
-Sir, do we carry all this?
-Yeah, thanks.

251
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,153
-Okay! Got it!
-Hey! Hello!

252
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,222
Hey, Mizuno. What are you doing?

253
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,492
Oh yeah. It's terrible! Everyone left.

254
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,893
They're in the classroom.

255
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,194
Huh?

256
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,669
Why?

257
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,407
That means they're
not as dumb as you think.

258
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,509
Huh?

259
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,044
The UTokyo exam isn't easy.

260
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,081
They have to win out over
thousands of brilliant students.

261
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,985
If your competitive spirit
doesn't burn bright, you won't win.

262
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,455
They may have realized this.

263
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:13,960
Is that why you invited Fujii
and Kosugi to the study camp?

264
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,495
What do you think?

265
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,168
Let's eat!

266
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,569
Alright!

267
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,739
Yum! Pork curry.

268
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,708
-Delicious!
-Pork is highly nutritious.

269
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,244
It's full of vitamin B1 which
helps relieve fatigue.

270
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,513
Perfect for a body tired from studying.

271
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,517
This omelet has spinach in it.

272
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:42,022
Eggs and spinach are full of the essential
acids needed for brain transmitters.

273
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,659
This egg dish is like
a superfood for students.

274
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:47,694
Yummy!

275
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:52,399
Fujii, you're eating bread?
Eat with everyone!

276
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,235
-Eat up!
-Our curry is good!

277
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,104
Here, little Fujii. Eat up.

278
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,607
Food is important to build
your brain and body.

279
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,377
People who get into UTokyo
value every meal.

280
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,646
-Yes, sir!
-You guys can stop now. Thank you.

281
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,149
Oh yeah, sir. Here.

282
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,585
-Here.
-What's this?

283
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,022
"Iwai Shop"? This is an invoice!

284
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,158
Ms. Mizuno. Thanks for the dinner.

285
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,660
Can I have seconds?

286
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,630
-Of course! Eat up and get strong.
-Yes ma'am.

287
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,907
Huh? Kosugi! Wow!

288
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,743
Me too.

289
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,248
I'm full, and now I'm sleepy.

290
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,484
I planned on studying,
but I don't think I can.

291
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,721
Because you eat fast until
you're full, like idiots.

292
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,689
-Huh?
-Trying to maximize your study time.

293
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,391
It's a typical exam prep mistake.

294
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:55,762
Kosugi, what happens
when people eat too fast?

295
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,164
Their blood sugar rises quickly?

296
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,001
That's right.
When blood sugar rises quickly,

297
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,104
insulin is secreted to transform
the sugar into energy.

298
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,407
That's why you feel sleepy
or fatigued after a meal.

299
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,576
Who said to eat a lot and get strong?

300
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,379
-Oh, sorry.
-Don't eat fast.

301
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,780
Don't eat until you're full.

302
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,116
To prevent spikes in blood sugar,

303
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,019
eat with brain energy efficiency in mind.

304
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,689
Then you can focus
and secure longer study hours.

305
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,724
Tell us sooner!

306
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,893
Making the mistake helps you remember.

307
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,095
Alright, that's all for today.

308
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,831
Tomorrow at 6 a.m.,
meet in front of the Dragon Zakura

309
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,600
in uniform.

310
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,535
Six a.m. again? Isn't that too early?

311
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,504
-Yay!
-You're amazing.

312
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,145
The school is scary at night.

313
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,621
Ah, feels good!

314
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,228
Kosugi, you're studying at this hour?

315
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,331
I wouldn't call this studying.

316
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,199
I'm just reading it because I like it.

317
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,702
Wow…

318
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,976
I wonder what it's like at UTokyo?

319
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,446
Well, I don't really know.

320
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,549
But if we all go together,
doesn't it seem fun?

321
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,354
Hey, you actually want to go to UTokyo,
don't you?

322
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,621
Good night.

323
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,858
Oh, sure…

324
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,898
STUDY CAMP DAY 2

325
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,400
Get up!

326
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,169
Okay, get up!

327
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,572
Get up! Hey!

328
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,275
So loud! I was having a good dream!

329
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,845
Girls too, get up!

330
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:53,880
Hey! Hey!

331
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,094
-I'm so sleepy.
-Morning calisthenics at 6 a.m.?

332
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:13,198
With morning calisthenics, you can
limber up every part of your body.

333
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,666
It's an excellent exercise.

334
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,736
And the benefits double
if you do it in the morning.

335
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,838
-Learn from Mizuno!
-Yes, sir!

336
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,540
Why me…

337
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,810
<i>…three times, hands on hips,</i>
<i>bend backwards…</i>

338
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,078
Ow, ow!

339
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,947
Ma'am, you're so stiff!

340
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,216
People get stiff as they age, I heard.

341
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,918
Enough from you.

342
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,255
If we're going to exercise first thing,
why wear our uniforms?

343
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,624
Yeah, gym clothes are easier to move in.

344
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,993
Are you wearing gym clothes
to your UTokyo exams?

345
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,594
Of course not.

346
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,597
This is all to make you aware
of the actual exam.

347
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,967
-Huh?
-Waking up at six, the same as exam day.

348
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,403
Eat the same food and
study during exam hours.

349
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,505
Go to bed at the same time
as before exam day.

350
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,475
If you always live
as you would on exam day,

351
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,510
exam day stops being a special day.

352
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,145
Ah, I see.

353
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,149
Clothing is another important way
to calm yourself.

354
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,818
To give 100 percent on your exam,

355
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,954
you want the same clothes,
the same routine, the same energy.

356
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,690
This is an important way to produce
results on the day.

357
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,325
-Whoa.
-Right, Fujii?

358
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,095
Exam day…

359
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,730
-When I think about it, it's scary.
-Right?

360
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,799
Then move your body!

361
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,002
If you don't, you'll have lost
before you enter the exam building!

362
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,671
-Okay!
-Yeah!

363
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,874
<i>Shoulders! Up! Shoulders! Down!</i>

364
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,044
<i>Strongly and swiftly,</i>
<i>bend and stretch your arms.</i>

365
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,046
Today I invited a special instructor.

366
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,248
A literature specialist.

367
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,650
Mr. Osamu Dazaifu.

368
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,918
Osamu Dazaifu?

369
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,353
Sir, please enter.

370
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:44,823
Huh?

371
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,992
Mizuno.

372
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,500
Mr. Dazaifu?

373
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,171
Teaching literature to prepare
for the UTokyo exam?

374
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,540
That's heavy on my heart.

375
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,976
It's too much to bear…

376
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
Huh?

377
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,212
I want to go home.

378
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,222
Is this guy alright?

379
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,927
But if Mr. Sakuragi invited him…

380
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,030
Nobody knows sentence structure.

381
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,065
This is trouble.

382
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,669
Ah, this is trouble.

383
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,378
Literature is a science!

384
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,647
All of a sudden?

385
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,515
And creation is architecture!

386
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,152
A creative piece made by
ignoring architecture is shit!

387
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,120
He suddenly changed.

388
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,721
And a superior sentence

389
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,758
is one made with architectural principles!

390
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,231
What just happened?

391
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,634
Dazaifu gets passionate
when he sees poor students.

392
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,835
But he cools off fast.

393
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,804
I'm very sorry. I've calmed down.

394
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,406
Go ahead, sir.

395
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,876
Listen, everyone. Sentences.

396
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,779
They all have one thing to say.

397
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,814
In order to convey that one thing,

398
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,984
the author tries many methods, many tools.

399
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,621
Paraphrasing according to
architectural principles.

400
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,756
Many methods, many tools?

401
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:28,860
Yes. Reading comprehension,
or summarizing,

402
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,230
is not just reading sentences.

403
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,733
It's about structuring it in your head.

404
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,304
Equivalence, contrast, cause and effect.

405
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,140
You can structure an editorial
with these three patterns.

406
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,977
Equivalence is the various ways

407
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,079
a sentence can be reworded.

408
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,648
-"Equivalence"?
-It sounds complicated.

409
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,516
-How could I know what that is?
-Right.

410
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,053
Okay, please read these two sentences.

411
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,556
You can read A.

412
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,092
"I thought it would rain,
but it was sunny."

413
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,027
"I thought I'd get scolded,

414
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,328
but I wasn't."

415
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,564
You can read the B sentence.

416
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:10,102
"That is to say, several unexpected
lucky things happened."

417
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,639
These two sentences are paraphrasing
the same idea

418
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,675
in a new sentence. Do you understand that?

419
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,677
You.

420
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,847
The expressions are different,
but they're both about

421
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,815
how something unexpected happened.

422
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,784
That's right. Taking it further,

423
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,120
A is concrete,

424
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,356
and B is an abstract expression.

425
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,125
Augh. I don't get it!

426
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,260
We can draw A.

427
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,862
Huh?

428
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:39,998
Oh, I see!

429
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,701
Oh, so in A, it says "rain" and "sunny."

430
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,736
I could draw it, so it's concrete.

431
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,539
-True, you couldn't draw B.
-Wow!

432
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,375
It looks like you are starting to get it.

433
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,612
A equals B. A and B

434
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,114
are connected with "that is to say."

435
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,583
That's the basic structure of equivalence.

436
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,919
I see.

437
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,589
Next is contrast.
To make your point clear,

438
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,660
indicate the opposite and compare them.

439
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,962
Sentences with "however" or "but."

440
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,930
That's right.

441
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,399
Last is cause and effect.

442
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,370
Could you read this for me?

443
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,239
"I forgot my homework,
that's why I was scolded."

444
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,041
This is

445
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,645
a sentence with the cause, then effect.

446
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,115
"I was scolded
because I forgot my homework."

447
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,350
This is

448
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,653
a sentence with the effect, then cause.

449
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,455
I see! Cause and effect.

450
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,989
I feel like I get it!

451
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,692
Good.

452
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,529
UTokyo exam questions use equivalence,
comparison, and cause and effect.

453
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,265
They are made with
these structures in mind.

454
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,602
And of the three, which do you think
is most important?

455
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,536
Kosugi.

456
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,305
Equivalence?

457
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,674
That's right. Equivalence.

458
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,409
That is to say, paraphrasing.

459
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,412
This is not limited to literature.

460
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,548
English, math, literature, science,
and social studies.

461
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,484
You need the ability to paraphrase.

462
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,819
-All subjects?
-Mizuno.

463
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,423
For example, math is a subject
where we expand a given formula

464
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,025
and change given phrases into numbers

465
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,794
with equivalence relations.

466
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,929
If you only remember formulas

467
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:21,166
and you can't paraphrase the values,
you can't find the answers.

468
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,536
In science and social studies,
the information is paraphrased

469
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,039
from your textbook
to match the form of the question.

470
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,542
Of course, in literature and English,

471
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,712
with the power of paraphrasing,
you can understand the other.

472
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,480
Like when you translate to English.

473
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,616
Got it, everyone?

474
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,852
All subjects require
the ability to paraphrase.

475
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,088
That is to say, for example, in short,

476
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,990
so to speak, namely, in other words.

477
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,493
What is it saying? If you keep asking,
you'll find the answer.

478
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,694
-That is to say.
-For example.

479
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,096
-In short.
-So to speak.

480
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,764
-Namely.
-In other words.

481
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,200
Alright? Problems posed by UTokyo

482
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,569
are mostly "Paraphrase this sentence."

483
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,306
That is to say,
if you have reading comprehension,

484
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,776
you can improve your level
significantly in all subjects.

485
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,279
The key to passing the UTokyo exam

486
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,314
is reading comprehension.

487
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,215
Yes, sir!

488
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,355
A trick we can use for all subjects?
What a deal!

489
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,724
Literature has never made so much sense.

490
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,494
-Even Fujii was taking notes.
-Huh?

491
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,196
Shut up.

492
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,364
-Fujii, you were taking notes?
-Don't look!

493
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,899
-Show me!
-I'll catch the dumb.

494
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,602
I wish you would try for UTokyo with us.

495
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,204
Not just the study camp.

496
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,909
MOM
NEW MESSAGE

497
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,645
What?

498
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,726
- Huh? Does "track" end in "c" or "k"?
-It's "k." Nao, you lose.

499
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,862
-What!
-Yay! I can take this off.

500
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,764
-Ready?
-Idiot!

501
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,266
Idiot!

502
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,336
The UTokyo Special Course
is acting weird again.

503
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,072
Aren't you embarrassed?

504
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,875
Do we need to walk while we do this?

505
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,644
Moving your body helps to remember things.

506
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,546
Ready?

507
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,916
Kosugi is next. What's wrong?

508
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,952
Nothing. Uh, was it "k"?

509
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,321
Um…

510
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,928
Dad?

511
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,837
I'm head of the UTokyo Study Course.
Kenji Sakuragi.

512
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:43,706
What is this about?

513
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:45,642
Forcing her to go to university.

514
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:46,876
Is there a problem?

515
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:48,945
My daughter's future is family business.

516
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:50,547
You don't get to decide.

517
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:54,083
Of course. Mari herself gets to decide.

518
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,319
Mari doesn't want to go to university.

519
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,554
Right? Mari.

520
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:03,126
How about it? Mari.

521
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:06,195
Well? Speak!

522
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:07,764
Please calm down.

523
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,132
What are you quiet for?

524
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:11,834
You don't want
to go to university, do you?

525
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:14,003
Well? Mari.

526
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:19,208
I won't… go to university.

527
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,778
There you have it.

528
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:23,813
You forced her to say that.

529
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,483
I'm her father. I know Mari best.

530
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:31,721
Who do you think you are?
Acting high and mighty.

531
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,623
I don't care if you're lawyers,

532
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,093
you're just using my daughter
for your reputation.

533
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,094
That's not true.

534
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:42,098
Mari has the skills to get into UTokyo.

535
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,600
-That's why…
-Skills?

536
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,768
She's a girl. What skills?

537
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,171
Gender doesn't have
anything to do with it.

538
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:50,773
Women always get so hysterical like that.

539
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,046
Anyway, no daughter of mine
is going to university.

540
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,549
-I'll withdraw her from school.
-Withdraw?

541
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,317
I'll withdraw her tomorrow.

542
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:02,885
Good day.

543
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:04,387
We're going.

544
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:07,523
Hey, Mari!

545
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,125
Stand up!

546
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,027
-Hey!
-Stop!

547
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:19,369
Mari!

548
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,039
Kenta…

549
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:27,944
We're going.

550
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,750
<i>Sir! How can you let Mari go?</i>

551
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:37,086
Who does he think he is?
Not even asking her opinion.

552
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:39,188
Even though she's so smart…

553
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:40,857
But I think I understand.

554
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:43,226
Not being able to go against her dad.

555
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,730
Entering UTokyo doesn't
need parental permission!

556
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,365
Yeah, like Fujii said.

557
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,601
If she just takes the test,
she can get in.

558
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:54,470
She just needs to make up her mind.

559
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:57,774
Mari will go to UTokyo.

560
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,477
Yeah. She really does want to go.

561
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:02,912
Or she wouldn't have come.

562
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,447
But her dad…

563
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,049
Can't we do something?

564
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:07,183
Everyone…

565
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,352
I'll see you tomorrow at 6 a.m.

566
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,788
Gather by the Dragon Zakura.

567
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,058
Wait!

568
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:17,460
Study.

569
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,135
I go away on business
and this is what you do?

570
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,303
Shoko.

571
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:29,672
What were you doing?

572
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,741
Poor excuse for a mother.

573
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:35,545
Dad, it's my fault. Just let me graduate.

574
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,681
I said no.

575
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,616
You're withdrawing.

576
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:44,053
I'm doing this for your own good.

577
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:47,557
As if…

578
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,526
What did you just say?

579
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,161
Mari.

580
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,231
Hey, Mari. Stop!

581
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,299
Mari!

582
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,269
Mari!

583
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:04,807
Mari!

584
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:24,026
What could possibly bring you here?

585
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:27,096
I come on bended knee.

586
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,265
To ask you a favor.

587
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,175
STUDY CAMP LAST DAY

588
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:42,512
Today you're doing this.

589
00:29:43,112 --> 00:29:45,381
"Run, Melos." We already did this.

590
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,984
But this time there are keywords.

591
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,186
There are two ways to order the words.

592
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:53,489
Method one, in chronological order.

593
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,725
Arrange them in the order things happened.

594
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,760
Hayase, come up here and try it.

595
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:58,761
Yes sir.

596
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:15,178
MELOS, EVIL KING, BELIEVE, FRIEND,
HOSTAGE, GIVE UP, PROMISE, COMRADE

597
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:17,213
-Like this?
-Looks good.

598
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,649
Now, the second method.

599
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,751
The subject predicate method.

600
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:24,153
Make sentences saying
concretely who did what.

601
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:27,056
-Fujii.
-Who, me?

602
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:37,567
"Melos" made his "friend" a "hostage"

603
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,070
He didn't "give up" on the "promise"
and came back.

604
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,906
The "evil king" couldn't "believe" it.

605
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,342
He changed his mind
and became a "comrade."

606
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,177
Correct.

607
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:51,747
Make a sample answer using those examples.

608
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:54,817
Model answer:
Melos is about to be executed

609
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:58,287
and appeals to the evil king.
He gains a three-day grace period

610
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:01,090
by taking his friend Selinuntius hostage.
Despite the hardships,

611
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:04,260
he does not give up and returns as
promised. The king sees their bond

612
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:07,730
and is moved by their steadfast belief
and becomes their comrade.

613
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,132
I summarized it more clearly.

614
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,701
So this is a summary.

615
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,769
A summary is what the author wants to say.

616
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:18,140
Reading comprehension is the ability
to read what the author wants to say.

617
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:20,810
It makes sense when you put it that way.

618
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,612
"Believe in your friend and wait."

619
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:25,281
That's what the author of "Run, Melos"
wanted to say.

620
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,949
-It's so real!
-Yeah!

621
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:28,951
I don't know why, but it's so real!

622
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:29,719
Mari!

623
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,696
Okay, today I have something

624
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:42,899
special I want you to do for me.

625
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,839
Pardon me!

626
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:53,240
Mr. Sakuragi.

627
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,174
Yes?

628
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:58,112
Hurry up with the withdrawal procedures.

629
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,147
Um, about that…

630
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,551
Pardon me.

631
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:09,290
Mr. Kosugi. Before the procedures,
could we sit down and talk--

632
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,159
There's no need. I've already decided.

633
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:15,796
Kosugi, is that…

634
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:24,772
You'll withdraw her, then what?

635
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:27,741
Of course I'll find her a job immediately.

636
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,176
And as soon as possible,

637
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,078
have her marry a good man.

638
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,882
That's true happiness for a woman.

639
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:37,017
Happiness for a woman?

640
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:41,355
-Mizuno, what do you think?
-Uh…

641
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,457
I don't really understand.

642
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,993
-What?
-Here's what Mizuno's saying.

643
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,162
You don't understand a woman's happiness.

644
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:50,531
What? So conceited!

645
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:53,367
Stop treating people like they're idiots!

646
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:56,337
I don't care if you graduated from UTokyo!

647
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:58,105
Do you think you're a god?

648
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:01,508
I didn't go to UTokyo. The UTokyo grad is

649
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,010
Mizuno alone.

650
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:04,278
Huh?

651
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:06,880
Well then. See? Mari.

652
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:09,516
Highly educated women

653
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,453
are cocky and conceited like her.

654
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,489
They turn into scum
that looks down on you like that!

655
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:17,858
That's why women don't need
higher education.

656
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:22,062
Something funny?

657
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,231
You say they don't need higher education.

658
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:27,601
But the one who's obsessed
with education is you.

659
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:28,502
Huh?

660
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:33,474
Are you obsessed with higher education
because you went through a bad experience?

661
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,043
Then why don't you give your daughter
that same chance?

662
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,312
I told you. Mari doesn't need it.

663
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:40,147
-Because she's a woman.
-Is that why?

664
00:33:40,214 --> 00:33:41,148
You're wrong.

665
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:44,852
You just don't want your daughter
to be in a dominant position over you!

666
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:47,721
No! Don't talk like you know!

667
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:50,024
I <i>will </i>talk like I know.

668
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,059
Women don't need higher education?

669
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:54,194
Anachronistic guys like you

670
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,598
cling to old ways to protect
your own pride

671
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,166
and don't look at the world!

672
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:02,803
You're free to have a complex.
Do what you like.

673
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,073
But just to protect your pathetic pride,

674
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,643
you're robbing your daughter of freedom,
and trying to force her down!

675
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,547
That sort of parent is really trash!

676
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,383
Shut up! Enough of all this.

677
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:21,121
I can't believe
you'd speak to a parent that way!

678
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:26,660
And I can't believe you're
standing silently by.

679
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,929
My precious daughter going to this school

680
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:31,098
makes me sick just thinking about it!

681
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:34,334
Hey! We're going! C'mon.

682
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,803
You harm your daughter.

683
00:34:36,837 --> 00:34:39,306
Can you really say she's
your "precious daughter"?

684
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,341
It doesn't matter the reason.

685
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:44,378
There is no reason
to commit violence against your family.

686
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:50,617
Please, just don't sue us!

687
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:54,721
As a school, we have a responsibility
to protect our students.

688
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,590
We can't overlook violence.

689
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:59,293
We must take appropriate action!

690
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,462
No…

691
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:07,101
Or so I thought, and intended to act, but…

692
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:08,936
Huh?

693
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:22,349
MS. MIZUNO

694
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,787
<i>Please, don't do that!</i>

695
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:27,888
But…

696
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:29,923
<i>My father got to be this way</i>

697
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,426
ten years ago when my grandpa died.

698
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:34,628
The company folded. He went through a lot.

699
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:38,499
<i>He never used to be the violent type.</i>

700
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:44,271
One day, I saw him crying alone.

701
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:46,807
<i>He seemed so pained.</i>

702
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:52,012
So I don't mind waiting.

703
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,949
Even though he's like this,

704
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:00,854
he's the only dad I've got.

705
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,958
So please don't call the police on him.

706
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,728
<i>Please.</i>

707
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,464
Please!

708
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:16,370
No matter how stupid or trashy the parent,
children trust them

709
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:18,772
and they have to live with them.

710
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,608
No matter how weak and naive you are,

711
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:24,611
she remembers when you were
her kind father.

712
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,347
No matter how you hurt her,

713
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:30,484
she keeps believing you'll go back
to your old self.

714
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:32,186
That's your daughter.

715
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,422
How long will you keep betraying her?!

716
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:36,723
Sir, stop!

717
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:40,227
A father is the pillar of the family.

718
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:42,329
He wants his family to be happy.

719
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:44,831
He is a big, strong support pillar!

720
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,602
With that worm-eaten, moldy pillar,

721
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:51,071
how can you support your family?

722
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:54,474
Is that what you really want?

723
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,211
Shut up! Shut up!

724
00:36:58,212 --> 00:37:00,080
She understands perfectly.

725
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:03,784
You want to be a good father.
You want her to be happy.

726
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,719
But you couldn't do that.

727
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:09,423
Your irritation! Your suffering!

728
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:13,327
Let her be free.

729
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:16,763
She, Kosugi, has…

730
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,467
She has always trusted you.

731
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:33,347
Mari…

732
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:53,333
Sir, sir! We did it!

733
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,035
Kenta! No, not now!

734
00:37:55,102 --> 00:37:57,304
Sorry to disrupt…

735
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,172
-Let's go, let's go.
-Did you finish?

736
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:01,942
Okay, read them here.

737
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,844
Now? I don't think so.

738
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,245
In this atmosphere?

739
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,980
You're not confident enough?

740
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,915
That's not it. This is my best work!

741
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,084
Listen! Mari.

742
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,056
It's not my problem if things go south.

743
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:17,958
Bring it on.

744
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,535
"Mari Kosugi should go to UTokyo."

745
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,440
"Because she has an amazing
ability to focus."

746
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:35,976
"For example, people who can focus

747
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:39,146
can improve the quality of their studying
and of their work."

748
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:43,083
"That is to say, people who can focus
on study and work

749
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,486
are more likely to absorb
a lot of knowledge."

750
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:50,290
"Also, UTokyo is a nexus of knowledge
that is useful for society

751
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:53,927
where people can absorb
this knowledge intensively."

752
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:57,664
"UTokyo is a place
where people who can focus

753
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,399
learn to be active in society."

754
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:01,401
"That is to say, Mari Kosugi

755
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:04,671
should enter UTokyo,
and expand her activities."

756
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:12,979
Kosugi, how were their summaries?

757
00:39:14,548 --> 00:39:16,216
Say it in front of your father.

758
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:29,229
I don't know if their sentences
were good or not,

759
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,034
but their feelings properly reached me.

760
00:39:37,504 --> 00:39:39,873
Mari, will you go to UTokyo?

761
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:43,410
I…

762
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:46,580
I want to try with all of you!

763
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,291
I want to go to UTokyo with everyone.

764
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:01,928
Dad…

765
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,734
I'm sorry…

766
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:12,305
I'm sorry.

767
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:18,378
Please take care of our daughter.

768
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:33,994
-Yes!
-No way, yay!

769
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,430
-You can go to UTokyo with us?
-Yeah!

770
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:40,901
-Alright! Kenta!
-Hooray! Hooray!

771
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,670
-That's great, Kosugi!
-Kosugi, hooray!

772
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:45,338
-Let's go for it!
-Yeah, do it!

773
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:46,473
Hooray!

774
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:49,009
Whew. Great!

775
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,079
<i>It seems her parents are</i>
<i>moving toward divorce as expected.</i>

776
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,116
I found a place
for the two of them to live.

777
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,885
Thank you for everything.

778
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,322
Don't misunderstand. This isn't for you.

779
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:04,891
I lent you my help to protect my student.

780
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:06,693
Yes, ma'am.

781
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:11,765
Living under the pressure of a father…

782
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,733
I can understand that.

783
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:30,383
Where is everyone?

784
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,552
They're cleaning up the cafeteria kitchen.

785
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:33,487
Oh.

786
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:37,591
You have a tough home life too, hey.

787
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:38,992
Huh?

788
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:42,629
It's like… complicated?

789
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:47,400
My two older brothers
are super successful.

790
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:51,905
Only I messed up my high school
entrance exam and was humiliated.

791
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,641
I didn't know that.

792
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:57,811
I guess everyone has something going on.

793
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:00,347
Nobody has an easy life, do they?

794
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:04,317
Ah, yeah.

795
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,822
Man, I'm so tired.

796
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:10,123
We're done.

797
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,994
-What were those compositions?
-Huh?

798
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,795
We've got to re-do the study camp.

799
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:17,964
Bring it on!

800
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:20,467
But I think I got stronger
over these three days.

801
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:22,369
That's a misunderstanding.

802
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,639
-Sure, sure.
-However.

803
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:29,442
You've got to have more and more
misunderstandings.

804
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:31,845
Yes, sir.

805
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:33,847
Idiots get overconfident too easily.

806
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,652
-Hm?
-What?

807
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,090
Fujii. I'm really glad
you came to the study camp.

808
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:47,427
You stirred up everyone's desire to study.

809
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:49,763
-I didn't do…
-Thanks for everything.

810
00:42:50,597 --> 00:42:53,366
Sorry to take up all your valuable time.

811
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,569
-You can go now.
-Huh?

812
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:57,504
Fujii. Thanks a lot.

813
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:01,641
Bye, Fujii. If I think about
you working hard, I'll work hard too.

814
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,843
-Bye-bye.
-No, hang on!

815
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:05,412
Do you need something?

816
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:09,616
You sure are a pain!

817
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:12,018
Can't you be honest with yourself?

818
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:13,587
What the hell?

819
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:15,655
I bet you could get into UTokyo.

820
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,825
You're already smart.

821
00:43:19,426 --> 00:43:21,428
<i>You stayed behind, studying until late.</i>

822
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:24,097
And that made me want to stay.

823
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:26,633
What'll you do, Fujii?

824
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,002
You haven't failed the real exam yet.

825
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:30,604
The real battle starts now.

826
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:33,573
You want to show your brothers
and father, right?

827
00:43:34,074 --> 00:43:37,444
If you join the Special Course,
I'll get you into UTokyo.

828
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:41,581
We start with your personality.

829
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,758
I want to get in.

830
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:54,394
Huh? I can't hear you.

831
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:58,164
I want to join the UTokyo Special Course!

832
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,739
What should we do, Kenta?

833
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:22,656
What?

834
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:29,062
Fujii, let's study together.

835
00:44:41,007 --> 00:44:43,977
I'm sorry about before.

836
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,201
Sakuragi.

837
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,604
Do you think you can get five kids
into UTokyo?

838
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,107
We'll have to see.

839
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:17,077
I'm counting on you.

840
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:19,879
To rebuild the school.

841
00:45:31,357 --> 00:45:33,259
You'll take the next UTokyo practice exam.

842
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:34,694
Wow, that sounds big.

843
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:36,830
Isn't it still too much for you guys?

844
00:45:36,896 --> 00:45:39,232
You need to keep working
on your personality.

845
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:40,867
-It's true.
-Listen, everyone.

846
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:44,971
If you're not expected to pass
this UTokyo practice exam,

847
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:47,173
you'll be made to quit the course.

848
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,742
-Huh?
-What?

849
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,478
No!

850
00:45:54,013 --> 00:45:55,882
At this rate, we'll get kicked out!

851
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:57,617
This is bad! I know it!

852
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,452
There will only be three of us left.

853
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,988
<i>To pass, you need a strong heart.</i>

854
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:04,157
-It's time for you-know-who.
-Who?

855
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:06,292
<i>You don't plan on telling Mr. Sakuragi?</i>

856
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,595
I have to quit the Special Course, right?

857
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:10,897
<i>Wasn't making them quit</i>
<i>based on results too strict?</i>

858
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:13,199
<i>That's exactly when Hayase will give up.</i>

859
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:14,534
They must respect themselves.

860
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:17,470
If they can do that,
they can regain their innate strength.

861
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:18,438
