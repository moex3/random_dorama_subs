1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,639
Listen, everyone.

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:09,043
If you're not expected to pass
this UTokyo practice exam,

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,678
you'll be made to quit the course.

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,013
-Huh?
-What?

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,281
Hang on, sir!

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,118
-Does that mean we'd be kicked out?
-What else would it mean?

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,887
Sir, that's too harsh!

8
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,456
I know I'd get an E if I did it now.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,858
Yeah, there's no way!

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,694
-What's an E?
-Sir, I think that's harsh too.

11
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,764
Fujii, you're making sense for once.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,665
There will only be three of us left.

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,568
What?! You lost to us twice
and you say that?

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,338
-I never lost to you.
-You piss me off, moody prick!

15
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,006
Stop, you two!

16
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,108
Yeah, yeah. Shut up.

17
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,176
Want to quit now?

18
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,348
I don't really get it, but I'll do it.

19
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,883
Seto. What are you saying?

20
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,017
Alright, it's decided.

21
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,622
Sir, can you start class already?

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,159
<i>Aren't you being too strict?</i>

23
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,928
At this point, only Kosugi and Fujii

24
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,897
and maybe Kenta could do it.

25
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,732
Everyone else will get an E.

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,267
They'll see where they stand.

27
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,070
But you can't kick them out.

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,239
-Mr. Takahara! Tell him!
-What?

29
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,509
It's not fair to kick out a student
for a bad practice exam score.

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,878
Huh? Is that what's happening?

31
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:18,813
Is that a problem?

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,683
With conditions like that,
you could destroy their motivation.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,086
You should remove the condition.

34
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,420
See?

35
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,222
Pardon me.

36
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,028
Mr. Takahara seems more passionate
than usual.

37
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,697
He cares for the students,
unlike someone I know.

38
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,568
Because if five students don't pass,
he can't become the chairman.

39
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,338
He's so small-minded.
Looking all smug and greedy like that.

40
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,107
Yes, despite being vice principal.

41
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,808
I see. So that's why.

42
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:53,581
But if less than five pass,
you'll stay on as chairman.

43
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,049
Stay on?

44
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,117
What do you mean?

45
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,085
A silly bet with the former chairman.

46
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:03,190
If you produce five successful students,
Mr. Takahara becomes chairman.

47
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,592
<i>And I am fired.</i>

48
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,827
What? We didn't know that.

49
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,098
Do you think you can get five kids
into UTokyo?

50
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,067
I'm counting on you.

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,002
That man…

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,307
I see. The former chairman wants you out
at any cost.

53
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,377
-But why?
-Why indeed!

54
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,045
That's not our problem.

55
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,549
Sorry, but all seven of my students
will get into UTokyo.

56
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,017
I can't change that goal.

57
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,152
Of course.

58
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,320
Alright, we're done here.

59
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,830
About the former chairman's
plan to sell the school…

60
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,767
You don't plan on telling Mr. Sakuragi?

61
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:52,606
If all seven pass,
it'll be my office's first big contract!

62
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,142
Toranomon is not far off, right sir?

63
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,978
It's time for you-know-who.

64
00:02:58,646 --> 00:02:59,980
Who?

65
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,218
Hayase, what's your problem?

66
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,754
-Huh? Do you understand?
-What?

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,390
At this rate,
you and I will get kicked out!

68
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,293
-Yeah.
-I'm going to complain!

69
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,863
-Stop that!
-But I think we're really in trouble.

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,599
-Why?
-A practice exam at this stage?

71
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,268
Even top-class prep schools get mostly Es.

72
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,571
-Yikes.
-I told you!

73
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,208
The only option is to listen
to the teacher and work our butts off.

74
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,943
Huh? You can't be serious…

75
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,646
Following the teacher is the only way
I know how to get into UTokyo.

76
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,882
Yeah, but…

77
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:40,020
Maybe it's just a strategy to motivate us.

78
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,189
Huh? Really?

79
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,157
Yeah.

80
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,163
Right. I get it. That could be it.

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,498
-Sheesh.
-Dream on.

82
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,833
Fujii, shut up.

83
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,103
Goodbye.

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,906
-Kenta, let's go.
-Okay.

85
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,944
Kosugi's scary.

86
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,647
What should I do?

87
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,649
Don't worry, just do it.

88
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,417
I know…

89
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,886
But I hate this sort of pressure.

90
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,556
Kaede, don't you get nervous?

91
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,326
Not compared to the national finals.

92
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,564
I shouldn't have asked you.
Yikes, yikes, yikes…

93
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,533
What am I gonna do?

94
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,402
You too?

95
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,054
<i>Yikes! Yikes! Yikes!</i>

96
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,526
Yikes.

97
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,696
Yikes, yikes… Yikes.

98
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,300
I've always wondered, is that learning?

99
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,501
"Always"?

100
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,603
You can do what you want.

101
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,705
But if you're half-assing the UTokyo exam,

102
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,274
you'll just embarrass yourself,
so quit now.

103
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,546
PRACTICE EXAM RESULTS
YUTA AMANO

104
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,181
A…

105
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,655
UTOKYO PRACTICE EXAM
8 DAYS TO GO

106
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,820
What's this? It's hilarious!

107
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,058
So this was you-know-who, right?

108
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,562
What a colorful character.

109
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,434
It's not a character,
she's the real thing.

110
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,674
Like this!

111
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,542
Huh? Like that?

112
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,510
Yeah!

113
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,480
Everyone try what I did!

114
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,910
Starting today until the practice exam,

115
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:53,280
you're going to train your ears well.

116
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,315
I might be pretty good at listening.

117
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,451
Your ears alone seem alright.

118
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,952
Give me a break.

119
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,288
The English UTokyo entrance exam

120
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,425
is one-quarter listening.

121
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,894
-One quarter?
-Isn't that crazy?

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,330
It's not crazy.
If you can master listening,

123
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,900
your English marks will shoot up.

124
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:17,037
So today I've invited a special
instructor, Ms. Anna Yuri to come.

125
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:22,009
People can't hear what they can't say.

126
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,412
Even if you can't speak,
listen to the audio and repeat it.

127
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,581
This training is called "shadowing."

128
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,818
This is the best way to improve listening.

129
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,954
Seriously? Okay, I get that, but…

130
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:34,888
What?

131
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:40,561
Well, Ms. Anna Yuri was singing
in such a quiet voice, I couldn't hear it.

132
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,297
Does that really help in learning English?

133
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:47,534
It's okay! It's called "mumble shadowing."

134
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,305
-Mumble shadowing?
-Does mumbling do any good?

135
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,775
If you start out trying to speak
loud and clear, you'll fail.

136
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,879
-Huh?
-The first step to listening is mumbling.

137
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,013
What does that mean?

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,951
Someone who can't swim
doesn't start with a perfect crawl.

139
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,954
They first kick and adjust to the water.

140
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,423
-Oh.
-It's just like that.

141
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,426
But the key is don't try to be perfect.

142
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,627
Don't try?

143
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,664
A lot of Japanese people have
a perfectionist attitude toward language.

144
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,967
What does "perfectionist" mean?

145
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,937
For example, if someone asks you
if you can speak English,

146
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,873
Seto, how would you answer?

147
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,812
Um… um…

148
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,047
-Sorry, I picked the wrong student.
-Hey!

149
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,415
-Amano.
-Huh?

150
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,418
"I can not speak English well"
or something?

151
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,320
Yes! Most people say that.

152
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,956
Most Japanese people
who are bad at English

153
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,391
answer just like Amano did.

154
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,861
"I can not speak English well."

155
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,497
But if you ask an American
sightseeing in Japan,

156
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:54,034
"Can you speak Japanese?"
How do you think they answer?

157
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,214
"I can speak Japanese very well."

158
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,583
"I like sushi and sumo! Ha ha ha!"

159
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,652
They answer with confidence.

160
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,988
You don't have to try to be perfect.

161
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,590
Speak with confidence.

162
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,259
That's the key
to improving with languages.

163
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,965
Amano, do it with confidence
like you do on YouTube.

164
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:34,908
Wow.

165
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,545
Okay, first

166
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,481
don't worry about mistakes,
just mumble in a low voice.

167
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,419
Then, don't be shy,
use your facial muscles

168
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,755
and say "I'm good at English."
Speak with confidence.

169
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:53,493
The key to doing well
is don't try to be perfect and mimic.

170
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,428
Mimic?

171
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,532
Yes, mimic. Act it out!

172
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,734
That sounds fun!

173
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,404
This feels like a scam to me.

174
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,940
Ma'am, maybe you just can't speak English.

175
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,324
-What did she say?
-"Don't worry."

176
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,260
"I can speak better than you.
Stop complaining and study."

177
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,730
"Cute little kid." That's what.

178
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,599
I'm sorry!

179
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,268
Idiot!

180
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,473
Okay, get mumble shadowing!

181
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,642
Okay!

182
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,566
There's no other way to learn listening
but to take time and get used to it!

183
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,170
Many test takers leave it
to the last minute.

184
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,473
The earlier you start,
the bigger the benefit.

185
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,710
-Shall we go again?
-Um.

186
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,478
What is it, Hayase?

187
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,817
Taking time to get used to it?
I don't have that time right now.

188
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,054
There's no time before the practice exam.

189
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,190
If I don't make it,
I'll have to quit the Special Course.

190
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,291
Hayase…

191
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,728
It is fun, but there's no point to this!

192
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:39,466
What, Hayase? You've already decided
you'll be kicked out?

193
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,903
That's not it exactly.

194
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,171
Red card.

195
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,674
Go take a hundred deep breaths outside.
Get out!

196
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,710
Hey, Mr. Sakuragi.

197
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,819
I hope Hayase is okay.

198
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,090
Wasn't making them quit
based on results too strict?

199
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,591
-This is fine.
-Huh?

200
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:08,061
When people face high hurdles,
their weaknesses are exposed.

201
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,698
Know your weaknesses,
overcome them, and become stronger.

202
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,935
To pass, you need a strong heart.

203
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,837
That is true.

204
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,673
As long as they don't quit
before they overcome it.

205
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,143
That's exactly when Hayase will give up.

206
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:24,978
What?

207
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,204
-Here.
-Mm.

208
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,580
Must be nice, Kenta.

209
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,983
You have a reason to go to UTokyo.

210
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,385
I'm kind of jealous.

211
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,956
I want to be like you.

212
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,393
Always bright and smiling.

213
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,661
So cute.

214
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,665
But you're not cute when you're down.

215
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,806
Yeah! It's a waste of my cuteness.

216
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah.

217
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,243
Thanks, Kenta.

218
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,746
I get it, too.

219
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,416
I know I have to work harder.

220
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,919
-What are you doing, Kenta?
-Mari!

221
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,923
If you've got time to worry,
you might as well study.

222
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,593
-Let's go back.
-Okay.

223
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,966
I get it! I know!

224
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,774
Have confidence.

225
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,743
Have confidence.

226
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,046
Hey.

227
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,150
-Fujii.
-How about that practice exam.

228
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,054
I guess you don't want an E.
You'd have to quit.

229
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,658
I don't know if I can get an A,
but I want at least a B.

230
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,294
Oof.

231
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,367
I heard your little brother
goes to Reimeikan High School

232
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,702
and is aiming for UTokyo.

233
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,538
Yeah, so what?

234
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,408
I get it. Having a smart brother,
but being, you know.

235
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,312
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Chill out!

236
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,883
Anyway, you sure caught
that teacher's English well.

237
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,555
<i>One week until the practice exam.</i>

238
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,026
I'll tell you something useful.
Six Rules for the UTokyo Practice Exam.

239
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,596
Number one.

240
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,299
Take the practice exam six times.

241
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,767
-Six times?
-Yes.

242
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,168
The UTokyo practice exam

243
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,072
is held over ten times per year.
Take at least six of those.

244
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,909
Listen. The UTokyo practice exam
is really long.

245
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,646
It's common for some subjects to take
more than two hours.

246
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,482
It requires mental and physical strength.

247
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,685
Taking it six times will
help your body adjust.

248
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm tired just thinking about it.

249
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,457
Number two. Start the literature exam
from the classical section.

250
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,595
Never start the literature exam
from the beginning.

251
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,729
Why?

252
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,033
What do you have to watch out for most
during an exam? Fujii.

253
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,135
Managing your health.

254
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,170
That's important too. Kosugi?

255
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,205
-Time allocation.
-Right.

256
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,509
The key to success is how efficiently
you can answer questions.

257
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,011
Solve the problems you can do
and get points.

258
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,980
That's classical literature.

259
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,384
Listen. The modern literature
in the UTokyo exam is very tough.

260
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,054
Compared to that,
classics and kanji texts include

261
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,157
simple translation problems
and it's easy to get points.

262
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,794
If you start with modern lit,
you'll get bogged down.

263
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,797
You'll run out of time for
the easy classics and panic.

264
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,399
Start the literature exam
with the classical section.

265
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,801
Lit from the classics!

266
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,603
Number three.

267
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,341
For math, write out your plan.

268
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,775
What does that mean?

269
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,779
Like modern literature,
UTokyo math is wildly difficult.

270
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,381
Some of you here

271
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,250
will find it impossible
to write the formulas and answers.

272
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,753
But what if you write nothing?

273
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,254
What? You get zero.

274
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,457
Yes. So you write your strategy.

275
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,093
Show how you would solve the problem.

276
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,162
Write your thinking.
Then you can get some points.

277
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,497
But is that okay?

278
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,099
The thing about UTokyo math

279
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,568
is they mark partial answers.

280
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,138
If they can see you could solve it,
they recognize that.

281
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,408
Even if you can't write a single formula,

282
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,276
you could still get some points.

283
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,979
-Seriously?
-Just write something.

284
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,382
That's the rule for UTokyo math.

285
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,350
Number four, Mizuno.

286
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,286
Number four. Always bring snacks.

287
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,788
ALWAYS BRING SNACKS

288
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,722
What's with that?

289
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,659
Seto, if you mock snacks, you'll fail.

290
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,961
Seriously?

291
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,599
The UTokyo exam lasts
from 9:00 a.m. to 7:20 p.m.

292
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,502
The liberal arts literature exam
is two and a half hours.

293
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,038
-Two and a half hours?!
-It's an endurance test.

294
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,240
So you need snacks.

295
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,543
You will need an energy supply
on your breaks.

296
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,078
By bringing things you like,

297
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,746
you can also refresh yourself.

298
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,448
-Makes sense.
-Ma'am!

299
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,950
-Kosugi.
-How much can we bring?

300
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,219
-It's not a field trip.
-It's up to you.

301
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,189
-Bring however much you want.
-Okay.

302
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,757
Number five.

303
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,627
Social studies will
only have what you've learned.

304
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,895
What we've learned?

305
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,230
They only include what you've studied.

306
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,167
The June practice exam
doesn't include the modern era.

307
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,568
Don't study extra.

308
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,638
Finally, English.

309
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,780
Number six.
Don't take notes during listening.

310
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,184
Everyone, look at the English test paper
I've handed out.

311
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,288
"You may take notes while listening."

312
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,556
So you can take notes.

313
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,327
Look carefully.
It says you <i>may</i> take notes.

314
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,762
I don't get it.

315
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,497
It's better to write what you hear.

316
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,066
No, that's a trap.

317
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,836
-Huh?
-Do you all like conveyor belt sushi?

318
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,637
-Huh?
-I love sushi.

319
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,073
-It's the same.
-No, no.

320
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,909
-I still don't get it.
-You're dumb as usual.

321
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,982
English is like sushi flowing by
on a conveyor belt.

322
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,384
If you try to take notes,

323
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,186
you'll get distracted by the notes

324
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,123
and you could miss
hearing something important.

325
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,325
Then they shouldn't say
"You may take notes."

326
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,293
A trap set by UTokyo!

327
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,429
You fell right into it.

328
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,665
Enough from you. I won't get trapped now.

329
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,934
One more important thing.

330
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,572
Check the questions and explanations
before the listening begins.

331
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,276
You can predict what sort of
things you'll hear.

332
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,645
It'll be much easier to remember.

333
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,847
Alright! That was good advice.

334
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,718
That's right, Seto. It makes
a big difference if you know this stuff.

335
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,887
Use this information
when you take the exam.

336
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,656
-You're all very lucky.
-Really?

337
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,391
-Wow.
-Lucky! Lucky!

338
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,927
-Okay.
-Keep this all in mind.

339
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,963
And use all you've got
to put your energy into the test!

340
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:31,435
UTOKYO PRACTICE EXAM
THE DAY BEFORE

341
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,939
-Goodbye, take care!
-Goodbye!

342
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:36,707
Fujii.

343
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,344
Tomorrow's the UTokyo practice exam.
Good luck!

344
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,280
Thanks.

345
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:44,815
Huh?

346
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,787
Amano, Hayase.

347
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,089
Good luck on the test tomorrow!

348
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,026
Yes, sir!

349
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,628
I'll try my best.

350
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:01,766
<i>Hey, do you think everything's okay?</i>

351
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:05,136
The test is tomorrow. I'm nervous.

352
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,572
Not you. Nao.

353
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:08,639
Huh?

354
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,943
She's been acting weird lately.

355
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,811
Yeah, Amano is too.

356
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:18,482
But we're in no position
to worry about them.

357
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,052
I can't get kicked out.

358
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,054
Me too.

359
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,890
…until discovery,
was the largest insect in Japan.

360
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:29,227
Hey, the UTokyo practice exam is tomorrow!
You're relaxed.

361
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,596
-Seto, it's a rhinoceros beetle! Look.
-Huh?

362
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,332
That's a cool one.

363
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:37,068
Iwasaki, what snacks are you bringing?

364
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,202
Snacks?

365
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,239
Can you teach me some conditioning methods
for game day?

366
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:42,306
"Game day"?

367
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,175
Oh, I see.

368
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:45,977
A practice exam is a game.

369
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:49,046
The real one is next year.
Tomorrow is just a practice match.

370
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:52,350
We can only output what we've learned.

371
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,318
-Yeah.
-Right.

372
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,687
Let's work on vocabulary
until the last minute.

373
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,123
-Okay.
-Hey, Kenta, watch this.

374
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,791
-Yeah.
-Here we go.

375
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,227
Magical exam.

376
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,029
You say exam, I say literature.

377
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,697
You say literature, I say classics.

378
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,499
You say classics, I say <i>The Pillow Book</i>.

379
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,501
You say <i>The Pillow Book</i>,
I say Sei Shonagon.

380
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,703
-Huh? Hang on…
-Kaede, you lose!

381
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,107
Seto, I never thought
you'd say Sei Shonagon.

382
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:17,675
Seto, that's great!

383
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,652
UTOKYO PRACTICE EXAM DAY

384
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:32,923
Hey, Amano.

385
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,259
Fujii.

386
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,262
You look pale. Are you scared?

387
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,401
You can't get a good score
with that attitude!

388
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:46,170
Even if you get kicked out,
I'll teach you.

389
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,039
How can you be so insensitive?

390
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,008
I don't have your confidence.

391
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,946
I want to concentrate. Don't talk to me.

392
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:03,387
The cosθ question on the old exam

393
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:06,590
was super easy to solve
with an αβ inequal formula.

394
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:09,460
<i>Oh no, I'm super nervous.</i>

395
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,163
Morning, Nao!

396
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:14,832
-Good morning!
-You're so nervous!

397
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,367
Relax, relax!

398
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,836
Even if you're kicked out, you won't die.

399
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,271
Nao, let's go.

400
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,047
CLASSROOM A

401
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,662
<i>Everyone looks so smart.</i>

402
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,998
<i>I'm the dumbest one here, I know it.</i>

403
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:51,736
<i>Ah, it's Kosugi.</i>

404
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:55,339
Mari! Seto! Iwasaki!

405
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:57,975
Who's he? He's kind of weird.

406
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,511
-Noisy.
-Excuse me?

407
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,548
Kenta, sit down.

408
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:06,217
Okay.

409
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,401
FIRST SUBJECT - LITERATURE

410
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,835
CLASSROOM B

411
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,810
<i>Will everyone here get into UTokyo?</i>

412
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,321
Alright, please begin.

413
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,163
<i>Ugh. It's all essay questions.</i>

414
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,098
<i>There's no way I can do this!</i>

415
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,603
<i>Whoa. Kosugi's writing something already.</i>

416
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,138
<i>What should I do?</i>

417
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,708
<i>UTokyo Practice Exam Rule Two.</i>

418
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,311
<i>Start the lit exam</i>
<i>with the classical section.</i>

419
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:10,681
<i>What should I do? I don't know anything.</i>

420
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:13,017
<i>I thought the classics</i>
<i>had the easy questions…</i>

421
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,786
<i>Wow, everyone's writing answers.</i>

422
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:17,888
<i>Yikes, yikes, yikes.</i>

423
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,863
SECOND SUBJECT - MATH

424
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,531
<i>Whoa, what is this?</i>

425
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,834
<i>I don't know how to solve these!</i>

426
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,336
<i>What is this? It's impossible!</i>

427
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,473
<i>Whatever. I'll just write some strategies.</i>

428
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:54,158
LUNCH BREAK

429
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,093
Nao, how was it?

430
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,362
Terrible. I'm kicked out for sure.

431
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:59,964
I did awful too.

432
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,733
Hayase, do you want to eat lunch with us?

433
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,103
Sorry, I'm not hungry at all.

434
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,305
-Okay.
-Well, good luck this afternoon.

435
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah.

436
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,578
Yikes, yikes, yikes.

437
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,183
<i>Huh?</i>

438
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,887
<i>How can they eat so much</i>
<i>at a time like this?</i>

439
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,956
<i>This isn't an eating contest!</i>

440
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,994
<i>Everyone's powerful.</i>

441
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:32,596
<i>UTokyo might be impossible for me.</i>

442
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,366
<i>It's totally impossible.</i>

443
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,840
Sir, how long do you plan to sleep?

444
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:44,742
Everyone's at their practice test.

445
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:45,876
Get up, sir!

446
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:48,612
Shut up.

447
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:53,584
No. Get up!

448
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,321
Hey! Hang on!

449
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,791
I can't do this…

450
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,159
Who is that YouTuber?

451
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,462
He raps in English
with an afro and sunglasses.

452
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,998
That's hilarious. A wildman.

453
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,968
Yeah, I got hooked on him.
He's super funny.

454
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,403
Really? I'll check him out.

455
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:14,104
He's taking the practice exam.

456
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:17,841
-I guess he's here somewhere?
-I'd freak if I saw him.

457
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,143
-For sure.
-Yeah.

458
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:21,011
That's me!

459
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:23,447
-Hang on!
-Seriously.

460
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,749
How can you sleep at a time like this?

461
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:29,353
Why all the fuss?
They're the ones taking the test.

462
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,055
I mean, yes, but…

463
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:34,725
I'm worried. I just hope
they don't get overwhelmed.

464
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,195
They'll face the real exam alone.
They have to work it out themselves.

465
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:39,530
You're right.

466
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,800
They must believe in what they've done.
They must respect themselves.

467
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:46,437
If they can do that,
they can regain their innate strength.

468
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,505
But if they can't…

469
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,517
100,000 VIEWS!

470
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,620
100,000 VIEWS

471
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,055
My viewers are skyrocketing.

472
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,959
I'M ALSO SHOOTING FOR UTOKYO.

473
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:11,261
YEAH! LET'S DO IT!

474
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,464
Other exam takers are watching.

475
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,466
Alright!

476
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,169
THIRD SUBJECT - ENGLISH
(READING)

477
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:20,504
<i>The English essay.</i>

478
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,807
<i>Write down what you think about</i>
<i>these illustrations.</i>

479
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:26,210
<i>It's what I always do.</i>

480
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:41,892
THIRD SUBJECT - ENGLISH
(LISTENING)

481
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,868
<i>What is everyone writing?</i>

482
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,540
<i>Hang on.</i>

483
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,276
<i>Conveyor belt sushi. Don't take notes.</i>

484
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:03,113
English is like sushi flowing by
on a conveyor belt.

485
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,749
If you try to take notes,

486
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,317
<i>you'll get distracted</i>

487
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:10,587
<i>and you could miss something important.</i>

488
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,556
<i>Focus on listening.</i>

489
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,324
<i>Focus…</i>

490
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:18,095
<i>I understand. I can catch most of</i>
<i>what's being said.</i>

491
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:31,475
Pencils down.

492
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,054
It's over.

493
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,595
Fujii.

494
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:54,832
I'm sorry about this morning.
I just couldn't…

495
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,471
Hayase.

496
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:03,140
How was it?

497
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,976
Oh, um, okay I guess.

498
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,411
How about you?

499
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,913
It was harder than I expected.

500
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:12,683
But it was a good experience.

501
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,419
Okay, see you tomorrow.

502
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:16,787
Bye.

503
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,289
Yeah, bye.

504
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:28,632
Sakamoto, we'll also be present
at the next meeting.

505
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,735
And here's that document you wanted.

506
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:33,403
Oh. Thank you.

507
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,739
Finally Mr. Sakuragi is involved.

508
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,910
Do you think
he'll really get five students in?

509
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,545
It'll be a problem if he doesn't.

510
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:43,147
Yes, it will.

511
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:47,317
TATSUMI GAKUEN SURVEY DOCUMENTS
CONCERNING SALE

512
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,356
UTOKYO PRACTICE EXAM
THE NEXT DAY

513
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,758
How was it? The UTokyo practice exam.

514
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:58,796
Honestly, it was so hard
I don't know how I did.

515
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,864
I was no match for it.

516
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,332
Yeah, but…

517
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,500
What?

518
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,702
I did all I could.

519
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:08,705
Yeah, I used everything I know.

520
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:11,975
Amano?

521
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,312
At first, I did terribly.

522
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,714
But I started to feel better after lunch.

523
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:21,518
So I think I tried my best.

524
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:24,388
Kenta?

525
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:25,722
It was fun.

526
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,591
A very Kenta answer.

527
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,560
Kosugi, how was it?

528
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,595
How did it go…?

529
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,565
I guess it was fun for me too.

530
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,634
Fun? You two are amazing.
Kenta and Kosugi.

531
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,103
Before, I wasn't even allowed to study.

532
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,539
But now I can put all my effort
into studying for UTokyo.

533
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,510
Fujii?

534
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:48,512
Piece of cake.

535
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,347
I see.

536
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,919
Hayase, how about you?

537
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,387
Me?

538
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,024
It was terrible.

539
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:03,760
It felt so long.

540
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:06,697
I don't even like thinking about it.

541
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:08,198
Surrounded by pressure.

542
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,668
Like, "So these are the people
who will take the UTokyo exam."

543
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,570
I started to think it was impossible.

544
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:15,606
So…

545
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,141
So you'll drop out of the exam?

546
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,815
You're saying
you want to quit trying for UTokyo?

547
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:32,189
If my practice exam results are bad,

548
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,724
I have to quit, don't I?

549
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:38,528
Then I have no way to get into UTokyo.

550
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:41,131
I know without seeing the results.

551
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,835
I'm quitting. Thanks for everything.

552
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,737
-Hey, Nao.
-Iwasaki.

553
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,972
-But…
-Leave her.

554
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,008
Sir, are you sure?

555
00:31:57,514 --> 00:31:59,149
What am I doing?

556
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:03,353
Hey, Hayase.

557
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,688
Huh? What?

558
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:07,190
We heard you were feeling down.

559
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,126
-From who?
-Well…

560
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,595
It's great to work towards a goal.

561
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:14,364
Isn't that what youth is all about?

562
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,700
Studying like mad.

563
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:19,336
You can only do that now. Right?

564
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,505
Yeah, when I graduate,

565
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:23,674
I'm supposed to take over
the family business.

566
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,776
I'd rather go to Keio University.

567
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:28,545
Compared to that,
your situation is better.

568
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:33,450
What are you trying to say?
Leave me alone.

569
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:36,153
Hey, hey, c'mon.

570
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:39,089
Trust Mr. Sakuragi and give it a try.

571
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:40,958
He's a pretty good guy.

572
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,094
-If you need anything, say so.
-See you!

573
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:52,536
Sir!

574
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,605
What is it?

575
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,774
Hayase still hasn't gotten home.

576
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,410
It's only 8 p.m.

577
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:04,147
Don't go to sleep! Let's go find her!

578
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:06,717
-Aren't you worried?
-She'll be getting hungry soon.

579
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:08,885
If you offer to buy her dinner,
she'll come.

580
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:10,620
Surely she wouldn't fall for that.

581
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:15,092
Idiot. Most worries are solved by a meal
and a night's sleep.

582
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:19,596
-Yeah, but…
-Hey!

583
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:28,405
<i>Come back! You're smarter than me,</i>
<i>so be confident!</i>

584
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,974
<i>You've worked so hard up to now.</i>

585
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,809
<i>Keep fighting a little longer.</i>

586
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:36,013
<i>Anyway, I want to study with you!</i>

587
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:41,051
<i>It's always sunny above the clouds.</i>

588
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:46,690
I know I have to work hard.

589
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:54,197
<i>Are you hungry? Let's meet at Setoya!</i>

590
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:57,000
I won't fall for that.

591
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:06,209
Sir, you just wanted to eat.

592
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,578
I'm hungry. I can't help it.

593
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:09,846
Right, Seto?

594
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,117
Welcome.

595
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,754
-Hayase.
-Hey, Hayase.

596
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:18,822
Want some ramen?

597
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:21,224
Sis, one ramen.

598
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,027
-Okay!
-Your mom was worried.

599
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:28,565
C'mon, sir.

600
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,905
You've got a good family.

601
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,141
If their daughter isn't home by eight,

602
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,643
most don't worry that much.

603
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,977
You think?

604
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:43,480
I don't know about other families.

605
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,650
Seems like they let you take
a lot of lessons.

606
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,319
Piano, dance, swimming, calligraphy.

607
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,788
You tried them all and then quit.

608
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,624
That's got nothing to do with this.

609
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:57,461
Is trying for UTokyo like those lessons?

610
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:58,862
Are you giving up that easily?

611
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:02,265
Hayase.

612
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,102
You were born lucky.

613
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:08,905
Lucky? I'm just normal.

614
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:13,310
I have a normal home and normal parents.
I just go to school.

615
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,112
I'm saying that normal is lucky.

616
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:16,680
Look at everyone.

617
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:18,949
They all have a burden.

618
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:25,122
Can you still say you're not happy?

619
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:28,158
What are you trying to say?

620
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,894
Hayase. If you keep this up,

621
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:33,630
you'll lose that luck.

622
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:35,398
Lose my luck?

623
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:38,135
I'm lucky, aren't I?
You're saying something else.

624
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:41,037
You don't realize you're lucky.
People like that

625
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:43,773
they lead an unlucky life.
That's what I'm saying.

626
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,510
What? I don't understand.

627
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:50,180
You do.
People who don't know they're lucky

628
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,583
can't be satisfied with what they have
and keep chasing something.

629
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,685
But without conviction.

630
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,088
So they quit when it gets tough.

631
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,824
On to the next, and the next.
Without lasting.

632
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,894
One after another, provided with things
thanks to luck.

633
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,762
It weakens your conviction.

634
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,431
People like that,

635
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,200
do you think they can be happy?

636
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:15,105
You're getting intimidated by Kosugi, no?

637
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:18,975
-Why?
-I can tell by looking at you.

638
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:22,245
Kosugi is Kosugi. You are you.

639
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:26,116
If you have the conviction
to get into UTokyo,

640
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,784
you won't be bothered by others.

641
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:32,389
If you want to be happy,
get some conviction.

642
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,126
But..

643
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:41,531
I have to quit the Special Course, right?

644
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:47,370
The practice exam results aren't out yet.

645
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,107
I know that.

646
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,043
But I know I got an E.

647
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:55,412
You know what an E means?

648
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,148
You have a 20% chance of passing.

649
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:01,151
If you take the exam 100 times,

650
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,386
you'll be able to pass 20 times.

651
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:08,258
You were born lucky. Luck is on your side.

652
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:10,694
You could get one of those twenty times.

653
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,197
That's just relying on luck.

654
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:18,001
Luck is important with entrance exams.
But if you don't try,

655
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,605
you can't use your luck.
Use it or throw it away.

656
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,740
It's your choice.

657
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,277
Listen, Hayase.

658
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,980
If you don't want to waste your life,

659
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:33,416
use your luck.

660
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,792
Thanks for waiting. Extra pork.

661
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,530
Eat up.

662
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,267
Thanks.

663
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,486
Okay, we're starting.

664
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,587
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

665
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:13,323
Finally, the UTokyo practice exam results.

666
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:15,659
Mizuno.

667
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,271
You all remember our promise.

668
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:32,409
Depending on the exam results,
you'll have to quit the Special Course.

669
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:34,411
I'll announce it.

670
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,913
Kosugi.

671
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,415
You got an A.

672
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,950
-You nailed it.
-Truly.

673
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,686
At this stage, an A is amazing.

674
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:46,022
Kenta.

675
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:47,724
You got a C.

676
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,293
-Is a C good?
-Very good.

677
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,663
But the differences between subjects
are too wide.

678
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,166
-Work on your weak points.
-Okay.

679
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:58,735
You got a better math score than me.

680
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:00,236
A better score than Mari!

681
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:01,738
Fujii.

682
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,240
You got a D.

683
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:07,811
Overcoming your weak subjects
is your new goal.

684
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,882
And Seto,

685
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,151
Iwasaki, Amano,

686
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,686
and Hayase.

687
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:20,757
You all got Es.

688
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,592
An E…

689
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,194
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

690
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,729
Well yeah, of course.

691
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,697
What'll happen to us?

692
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,066
We have to quit the Special Course, right?

693
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:37,507
Huh?

694
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:41,778
Why are you laughing?

695
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:44,214
-You should laugh too.
-Huh?

696
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,784
Go on, laugh! When you fail, you laugh!

697
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:54,391
Look.

698
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,395
Go on, laugh.

699
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:01,364
Go on.

700
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:06,236
Yeah, that's it.

701
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,407
Yes, when you fail, you should laugh.

702
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:14,277
What matters is what you do next.

703
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:15,812
Next? What do you mean?

704
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,447
Work hard at something else?

705
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,482
I'll ask you this.

706
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:21,251
With these practice exam results,

707
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:23,420
did you want to quit trying for UTokyo?

708
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:25,021
Of course not.

709
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,890
We can't give up now.

710
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,625
Even if it takes years, I'll try.

711
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:30,260
Hayase.

712
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:31,461
How about you?

713
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,300
I have good luck.
Even if I get kicked out,

714
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,636
I'll never, never give up!

715
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:43,807
The results of this exam

716
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:46,576
are just your current abilities.

717
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,446
If you can face these results

718
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,714
and you still want to go to UTokyo,

719
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,950
you have a chance of passing.

720
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:56,085
What do you mean? I don't get it.

721
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,254
Even if we got an E,
we don't have to quit?

722
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:01,491
I never said I'd kick you out
if you got an E.

723
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,195
I said people
who are not expected to pass.

724
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,864
Hayase just misunderstood.

725
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,766
-Hey.
-Huh?

726
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,301
-Nao!
-What!

727
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,604
-Heh.
-Don't give us "heh."

728
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,907
Anyway, let me tell you something.

729
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:22,011
If you get an E, it doesn't mean you're
in the bottom 20%.

730
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:23,179
It doesn't?

731
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:27,984
It depends on the exam,
but grades A through D are about 50%.

732
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:30,887
In this case, about half of test takers

733
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,555
got Es.

734
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,157
Really?

735
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:37,594
That means if we get a D,
we're in the top half?

736
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,028
-That's right.
-Whoa!

737
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:42,832
Especially Hayase, your grades
were closest to the D line.

738
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,068
You do have good luck.

739
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:47,203
-Really?
-Yes, really.

740
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,240
When I took my first UTokyo practice exam,
I also got an E.

741
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:51,875
-You did?
-Yes.

742
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:54,911
But at this stage, don't worry about Es.

743
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,448
This is the best time for that.
Think of yourself as lucky.

744
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,484
-Oh, we're lucky!
-Lucky!

745
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:05,622
Listen, studying is like an airplane.

746
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,156
An airplane?

747
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:09,959
In order for it to fly,
it has to go down a runway.

748
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:13,496
It runs and builds up buoyancy
until it floats.

749
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:15,098
Then it ascends rapidly.

750
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:20,403
You all will build up your power
and your time to fly will come.

751
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,139
The real battle starts now.

752
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,575
Alright, let's do this!

753
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:27,977
-Let's power through!
-Yeah!

754
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,813
-Power through!
-Yeah Kenta, power through!

755
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,981
-Power through!
-You idiot!

756
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:34,183
-I'm sorry!
-Sheesh!

757
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,019
-That's great.
-Isn't it? Lucky!

758
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,087
Lucky!

759
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,094
Shit. Why?

760
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,837
Are you disappointed with your D?

761
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:57,273
Shut up.

762
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:00,009
You thought it couldn't happen?

763
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:03,580
Don't forget this feeling.

764
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:10,486
This is bullshit.

765
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:14,857
You're so mad you're crying?

766
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,561
Never forget that.

767
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,597
Shut up.

768
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,934
I'll leave the rest to you.

769
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,705
Thank you.

770
00:43:41,317 --> 00:43:43,119
Sorry about before.

771
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,423
I was at my limit.

772
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,926
Shut up. Don't look at me.

773
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:51,894
Don't say that.

774
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:54,297
I got an E!

775
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,769
-You laughed.
-I did.

776
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:03,306
-Hey.
-I've never seen an E before.

777
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:06,009
You never planned on kicking anyone out.

778
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:08,745
Of course not. Our goal is to

779
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:11,214
get more than five students into UTokyo.

780
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:14,584
If even one quits, we're upping the risk.

781
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:18,588
Exactly. All seven could pass!

782
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,891
-Another order of gyoza please!
-Yes ma'am.

783
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:25,895
-Here.
-Thanks!

784
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:30,900
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>the UTokyo Special Course is on track.</i>

785
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,003
The two top students joined
and there are seven now.

786
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,272
Anyway, five people
need to get into UTokyo.

787
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,608
As long as they achieve that,

788
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:42,011
I'll have no other use
for Sakuragi and the rest.

789
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:44,147
If five pass, we can remove the chairman.

790
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:47,917
My daughter's the only one
opposed to the sale.

791
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:50,820
Will the vice principal
in line to be chairman be okay?

792
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,689
That man won't be hard to deal with.

793
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:56,392
-I see.
-And? How's the situation?

794
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:57,894
Mr. Matsubara?

795
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,431
The commercial land around Tatsumi

796
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,533
is already in our hands.

797
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,201
All that's left is Tatsumi.

798
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:07,837
Can you really make such bold moves?

799
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:09,839
Of course, to avoid detection,

800
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,375
we've concealed the land information.

801
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:15,411
There's no chance of a leak.

802
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:19,716
You've got great employees.

803
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:21,551
You're all from UTokyo,

804
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:23,219
but you're not like my daughter.

805
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:26,355
-Very talented.
-No.

806
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,858
Once you're in society,

807
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,461
academic background means nothing.

808
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:38,101
ABOUT THE PLAN TO SELL TATSUMI GAKUEN

809
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,569
Sir?

810
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:55,017
I never want an ugly score
like that again.

811
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:56,185
Aim higher than E.

812
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:57,687
We have another special instructor.

813
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:58,688
<i>Huh?</i>

814
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,090
We're not at a level to teach!

815
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:02,191
<i>Will you train with us?</i>

816
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,360
<i>Please allow her to join.</i>

817
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:06,162
<i>It's a month of solid practice.</i>

818
00:46:06,229 --> 00:46:07,296
<i>A month?</i>

819
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:08,598
Focus, focus!

820
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:12,034
Devise the fastest
and most certain strategy.

821
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,837
In other words,
know your distance from UTokyo.

822
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:16,405
