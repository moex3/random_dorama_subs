1
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,640
RIE KIYONO AT NATIONALS

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,542
I can't stand this!

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,878
Kiyono gets all the attention.

4
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:13,848
And you don't even have
any good university offers.

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,384
It's all because of your injury!

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,586
There's no use bringing that up now.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,532
Mr. Sakuragi, where did you get this?

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,168
I got an anonymous e-mail.

9
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,070
SELLING TATSUMI GAKUEN

10
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:39,173
The land around the school

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,976
has been nearly all bought up!

12
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,312
They're serious!
What should we do, Chairman?

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,982
They've bought up so much.

14
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,817
Ours is the only plot left.

15
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,752
That horrible man!

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,089
The former chairman's involved?

17
00:00:55,723 --> 00:01:00,061
Chairman. I think
it's about time to explain.

18
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,964
My trickster father.

19
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,133
He's trying to sell this school.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,804
Sell the school? But why?

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,774
There's a plan to build
a resort complex here.

22
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,776
The local residents are opposed.

23
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,746
Of course, I have taken
a hard opposition stance.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,883
But my father values money
over the school and students.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,419
He can get three times
the usual price now.

26
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,589
Didn't he want to save the school
from financial ruin

27
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,424
and make it a high-level school?

28
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,761
That's just a facade. His true aim

29
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,329
is to have me resign.

30
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,934
He can't sell the land without
the chairman's consent.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,838
So I was standing in his way.

32
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,773
I thought something was up.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,576
Saying "Quit if five students
get into UTokyo."

34
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,478
He even made a contract.

35
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,918
So he did. If five students get in…

36
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,722
It's over for me and for this school.

37
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,090
No…

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,428
How could he play so dirty…

39
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,197
We mustn't allow such tyranny!

40
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,266
He said it was for the students

41
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,002
while selling the school for money!

42
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,303
Vice Principal Takahara…

43
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,106
Overturning this contract would be…

44
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,274
Nearly impossible.

45
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,777
Hang on, wait.

46
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:27,248
This means Mizuno Law Office
is also in trouble.

47
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,616
Sounds about right.

48
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,653
My original contract said
if we get five in, you'll contract me,

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,489
Mizuno Law Office,
for the next five years, right?

50
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,525
-Right?
-Ah, yes.

51
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,260
But if five students get in,

52
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,929
the chairman and the whole school will go.

53
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,398
And if five don't get in, no contract.

54
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,900
No matter the outcome,

55
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,568
your contract is over.

56
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,671
It's not funny.

57
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,108
My dream of making bank.

58
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,177
-My debt…
-Hm?

59
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,645
Hang on.

60
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,447
There's a simple solution.

61
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,951
Just get four students in.

62
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,453
The chairman and the school can remain.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,391
Takahara will get fired,
but we can hire him back.

64
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,293
And Mizuno Law Office.

65
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,429
We can make a new contract with you too.

66
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,264
Everything works out.

67
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,867
Victory to everyone!

68
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,670
You do talk sense sometimes.

69
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:24,205
No!

70
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,408
If we limit it to four students,

71
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,844
think of how the hardworking
children would feel.

72
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,915
We mustn't get the students involved
in our adult problems.

73
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,251
That the thought even entered your mind,

74
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,386
you're a failure as an educator!

75
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,455
I was mistaken.

76
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,389
Disqualified!

77
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,992
Surely there's another way.

78
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,428
Chairman! I'll help you.

79
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,532
I'll support you in any way I can
to help the school and students.

80
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,234
Thanks.

81
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,204
Leave the issue of the school sale to us.

82
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:01,375
Mr. Sakuragi and Ms. Mizuno,
focus on teaching the students.

83
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,377
Of course we will.

84
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,079
Even so,

85
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,415
who sent that e-mail to Mr. Sakuragi?

86
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,618
I'll look into it.

87
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,519
I know a specialist.

88
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,654
Okay, thanks.

89
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,925
Look what you've done.

90
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,861
We're stuck with this job
that won't even pay.

91
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,231
Take responsibility!
Accepting it without due diligence!

92
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,799
Shush.

93
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,968
How could I predict this?

94
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,037
You were gone for two years.

95
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,639
I built the Mizuno Law Office,

96
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,774
working desperately to get this far.

97
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,277
To fail no matter the result,

98
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,178
it's not even funny.

99
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,214
If we face failure either way,

100
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,984
we might as well get them in
and build up our own reputation.

101
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,820
Listen. We have seven students now,

102
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,556
but only Kosugi is
at the passing line now.

103
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,294
Seto is working hard,
but far from passing.

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,830
Fujii plays tough,
but psychologically he's the weakest.

105
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,501
And there's Iwasaki…

106
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,535
Iwasaki?

107
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,471
Summer's almost here.

108
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,440
You've got to step up!

109
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,975
I'm the one who could cry.

110
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,112
I know. I understand.

111
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,188
-You're starting the morning strong.
-Of course we are.

112
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,756
I never want an E again.

113
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,559
I never want an ugly score
like that again.

114
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,729
Good attitude. But listen.

115
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,898
Studying like mad is not the answer.

116
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,533
Huh? What do you mean?

117
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,002
The practice exam
has shown where you stand.

118
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,871
You've got to make the most of that.

119
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,673
In other words…

120
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,611
Know your distance from UTokyo.

121
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,046
Distance from UTokyo?

122
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:50,150
Studying for entrance exams means
closing that distance.

123
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,820
How can you shorten that distance?

124
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,255
Calculate it from your current position.

125
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,459
Devise the fastest
and most certain strategy.

126
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,897
Your distance from UTokyo is
your goal minus your current score.

127
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,500
Think about how
you can close the distance.

128
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,336
How? Isn't studying the only way?

129
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,072
You'll never succeed
with such a rough strategy.

130
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,374
Mizuno, the handouts.

131
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,544
What's this?

132
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,615
Those are uniquely tailored strategies
I made for each of you.

133
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,816
Uniquely tailored?

134
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,552
Hang on, I'm applying for
Natural Sciences 1.

135
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,287
Are you serious about UTokyo?

136
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,489
Then let go of that idea.

137
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,924
-Huh?
-It's not just you.

138
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,361
Science applicants,
Amano, Iwasaki, and Kenta.

139
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,164
You're all applying to Natural Sciences 2.

140
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,267
I don't understand.
Why are you putting me with them?

141
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:45,939
Listen. Natural Sciences 1
is easier so it gets more applicants.

142
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,342
That drives up the minimum passing score.

143
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,811
So it's harder to get in.

144
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,680
Natural Sciences 3 is out of the question.

145
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,783
The only ones getting in are aliens.

146
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,087
Natural Sciences 2 has had a relatively
low minimum score lately.

147
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:03,624
Depending on the year, it's possible
to get in with less than 50%.

148
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,060
-It's a shortcut to UTokyo.
-Shortcut! Yay!

149
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,397
Natural Sciences 2 is easier
so you want me to switch?

150
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,965
That's for losers! No way!

151
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,103
You want to get in, don't you?
If you want to fail, be my guest.

152
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,605
My job is simply to get you into UTokyo.

153
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,541
How you feel is not my problem.

154
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,609
Next, arts.

155
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,345
Kosugi, Hayase, Seto.

156
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,282
You'll do Humanities
and Social Sciences 3.

157
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,717
-Okay.
-What's that?

158
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,119
What's wrong with 1 or 2?

159
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,088
Humanities and Social Sciences 1
is full of geniuses.

160
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,356
It's ridiculously hard.

161
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:41,161
And 2 is packed with logical-thinking,
clear-headed people.

162
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,698
You've only been studying for a year.
It's impossible.

163
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,733
In comparison, for Humanities 3,

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,836
if you can get 80% on the Common Test,

165
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,938
you'll pass with 60%
on the secondary exam.

166
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,575
This is the only way you can
get into UTokyo.

167
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,642
Alright!

168
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,244
The only way, even for Kosugi?

169
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,047
Kosugi could get into 2.

170
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,217
I want to study literature, so 3 is fine.

171
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,953
-Yay! Let's do this!
-Yeah!

172
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,087
That's it.

173
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,656
If you understand the strategy,

174
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,358
let's get class started.

175
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,526
Yes, sir.

176
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,828
I have another special instructor.

177
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,296
-Again?
-Yes!

178
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,699
Today's special instructor is…

179
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,468
you guys.

180
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,204
-Huh?
-What?

181
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,940
Why a video camera?

182
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,142
You're going to film each other.

183
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,445
Film the lessons you teach.

184
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,914
We're not at a level to teach!

185
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,716
Exactly. What are you thinking?

186
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,052
You've completely filled your brains
with basic knowledge.

187
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,688
But knowing things doesn't mean
you can use them.

188
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,590
You've got to use it!

189
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:48,262
Listen. To teach, you must understand
that information, digest it,

190
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,598
organize it, and be able to use it.

191
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,268
Once you can do that,
you'll have true understanding.

192
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,804
By recording it, you can observe
your thought processes.

193
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,239
It will have great results.

194
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,574
That's true.

195
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,476
But it's all so sudden.

196
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,244
I'll do it.

197
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,548
Aim higher than E.

198
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,284
It's nearly summer.
There's no use complaining.

199
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,252
Good, Seto. Try it right now.

200
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,888
-Yeah.
-Here's the theme for your lesson.

201
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,323
How to use the word "must."

202
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,425
This'll be easy.

203
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,728
Alright! Class is in session.

204
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,032
Um… I'll explain how to use "must."

205
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,301
"Must" is an auxiliary verb,

206
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,403
which means "be obliged to."

207
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,672
It has the same meaning as "have to."

208
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,174
"Must" is an auxiliary verb,

209
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,810
so the verb following it
must be in the present tense.

210
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,714
The third person singular present "s"…
Yes, it doesn't get used.

211
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,082
An example sentence is…

212
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,820
And suchlike.

213
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,790
This has been my explanation of
how to use "must."

214
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,894
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

215
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,929
-I'm not satisfied with that.
-Huh?

216
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,631
How was it, Kosugi?

217
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,667
-There were a few mistakes.
-Huh?!

218
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,074
You said after an auxiliary verb
the verb must be present tense.

219
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,842
That should be the base form.

220
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,179
And you said "have to" and "must"
mean the same thing.

221
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,615
But "have to" has an objective meaning.

222
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,284
"Must" is used in cases
like a subjective command.

223
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,485
That's the difference.

224
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,355
Oh yeah, that.

225
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,693
-Very good, Seto. Sit.
-Okay.

226
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,331
You gave it a good shot.
But why did you make mistakes?

227
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,667
I guess I just slipped up?

228
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,736
-Why'd you slip up?
-Why?

229
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,339
Why? I wasn't expecting to have to teach.

230
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,775
-Inside my head, I just kinda freaked.
-Uh-huh.

231
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,444
-And then?
-And then… that happens to anyone.

232
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,881
I get it in my head, but I make mistakes
when I say it out loud.

233
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,383
And then?

234
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,550
And then…

235
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,955
I mean, whatever, right?
I won't make mistakes next time.

236
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,191
-No. And then?
-I'm saying I'll be more careful.

237
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,928
What's the point of
making excuses like this?

238
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,933
Excuses are key. If you make mistakes
and don't make excuses, you won't grow.

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,103
-What do you mean?
-There are two kinds of excuses.

240
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,339
The excuses of winners
and those of losers.

241
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,207
Losers don't think much.

242
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,510
They call it an oversight
and forget about it.

243
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,080
They blame others
and try not to take responsibility.

244
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,084
Meanwhile, when winners make mistakes,
they analyze the situation deeply.

245
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,721
They think hard about how to improve
and use that next time.

246
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,856
Right? Iwasaki.

247
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,892
I think you're right.

248
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,775
LAST DAY OF THE FIRST SEMESTER

249
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,610
Summer break begins tomorrow.

250
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,980
Your summer will dictate
how you do on the exam.

251
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,785
A year from now, whether you're enjoying
your summer as a UTokyo student

252
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,886
depends on right now.

253
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,222
Spend each day wisely.

254
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,690
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,659
Alright! I'm getting pumped!

256
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,494
What's the summer special training?

257
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,929
Bring on the training!

258
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,331
Special training? Don't be spoiled.

259
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,365
Huh?

260
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,669
-This summer, you'll study on your own.
-Huh?

261
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,138
Hang on.
You said this summer is important!

262
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,439
You're abandoning us?

263
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,408
I can't do it. I'd be too lonely.

264
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,743
What about practice exams?

265
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,311
Are you all babies?

266
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,813
The coddling ends here.

267
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,682
It's time to stand on your own feet.

268
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,650
Overcoming this will make you confident.

269
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,587
It'll give you the strength
to overcome hardship.

270
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,824
This summer,
you'll find your true strength.

271
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,226
True strength…

272
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,660
But I'm scared.

273
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,563
So today, just for you,

274
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,667
Mizuno will teach you a strategy
for summer break.

275
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,568
Mizuno.

276
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,739
Okay, we're going to do
a personality analysis.

277
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,241
Personality analysis?

278
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,611
Say you're going to read some books.
You've got your eye on several.

279
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,280
So do you read them at the same time?

280
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,116
Or do you finish reading one
before you start the next?

281
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,117
Which one are you?

282
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,053
I'd read them at the same time.
I get bored easily.

283
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,356
I only read illustrated reference books.

284
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,558
But I'd read comics at the same time.

285
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,593
-I'd read a bunch at once.
-Me too!

286
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,230
Not me. I have to read one to the end
or I feel weird.

287
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,735
-I read books from start to finish.
-I guess I skim to the end.

288
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,537
I skip the boring parts though.

289
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,907
-Okay, I've got it.
-Huh? What?

290
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,177
Do we pass or fail
based on what we choose?

291
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,949
Hayase, Seto, Iwasaki,
and Kenta are diffusive types.

292
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,350
Diffusive type?

293
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,555
Amano, Kosugi, and Fujii
are preservation types.

294
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,023
Preservation type?

295
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,126
Hey, we're not in the same group
as Kosugi. This is bad.

296
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,828
I want to be preservation type!

297
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:49,862
Oh, come on.

298
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,931
If that's all it took,
no one would suffer.

299
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,800
What worries me is how much
this is freaking you out.

300
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,036
Huh? Who said I was freaking out?

301
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,138
How are those two different?

302
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,642
Diffusion types take action quickly
whenever they find something interesting.

303
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,445
The keyword for this type is "excitement."

304
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,379
Excitement!

305
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,149
The place you study is up to how you feel.

306
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,652
Study materials should be
one book that excites you.

307
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,555
Try challenging high-level questions.

308
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,257
That sounds like fun.

309
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,862
The preservation type wants to do well
and doesn't want to make mistakes.

310
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,899
The keywords for this type are,
"accumulate confidence and security."

311
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,767
Accumulate confidence and security…

312
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,404
The place to study should always be
the same. Where you're comfortable.

313
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,876
Study materials should be focused on
completing basic-level exercise books.

314
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,778
Don't touch the high-level questions.

315
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,049
-Okay.
-This is the study method for each type.

316
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,987
This summer, completely firm up your base.

317
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,625
People who firm up their bases now
will make leaps in the fall.

318
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,160
You'll see yourself speeding
towards UTokyo.

319
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,062
Also, you've already

320
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,132
spoken to your families about
the UTokyo entrance exam, right?

321
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,769
From now on,
you'll need your family's support.

322
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,338
Make sure they follow
the Ten Family Rules.

323
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,142
Remind your family
before summer break begins.

324
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,478
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,119
I'll be lonely if we can't
meet during the break.

326
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,921
We've been together every day.

327
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,723
I wish we could
get together somewhere to study.

328
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,658
Oh!

329
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,494
I know a good place.

330
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,197
Wow, this is great! So big.

331
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,433
Can we study here?

332
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,770
Sure. I'll tell the owner.
Keep it up, you guys.

333
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,006
-Yeah! Thanks!
-Thank you!

334
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,876
I don't get it!
Hey, Amano, do you get this?

335
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,646
Oh yeah, that's hard. Hang on a sec.

336
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,714
They're here!

337
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,550
Oh, it's you guys!

338
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,085
Akira!

339
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,354
What are you guys doing?

340
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,455
Why are you two here?

341
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,224
What do you mean? This is our territory.

342
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,661
-Everyone's here!
-Kenta, Kosugi. Welcome!

343
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,363
-Let's study together.
-Yeah.

344
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,698
Great timing, Kosugi.

345
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,100
-I wanted you to help me with this.
-Which part?

346
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,002
DAY 2

347
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,471
-We're here!
-What gives?!

348
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,940
I'm busy. Why did you call me here?

349
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,642
Fujii! Show me your notes!

350
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,077
Huh? Why?

351
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,312
Wow, they're really amazing.

352
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,014
So easy to understand!

353
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,084
-They're so different from mine.
-Yikes.

354
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,987
Of course they are.
You can copy them if you want.

355
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,323
Can I? A good student's notes
are a great way to study.

356
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,427
-Wow, Fujii baby.
-Giving me chills.

357
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,998
DAY 3

358
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,872
<i>Kaede's late again.</i>

359
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,541
It's summer break. What's she up to?

360
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,111
She said she'd be training
in the school gym.

361
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,581
I'm sure she wants to support the team
before the nationals.

362
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,084
How can she be so thoughtful
towards others?

363
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,086
I know, right?

364
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,989
I wish she'd think about herself
more than about others.

365
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,862
DAY 7

366
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,134
Good work everyone!

367
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,303
Everyone's working hard,
so I brought ice cream!

368
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,040
-Thank you very much!
-Okay!

369
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,742
-Yeah!
-Let's open it!

370
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,846
-Yummy!
-Yum! Sweet!

371
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,882
You two are really part of the gang.

372
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,452
-Getting in on the ice cream.
-Seriously!

373
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,221
You did a horrible thing
to Ms. Mizuno and Mr. Sakuragi.

374
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,323
That was for Kaede's sake!

375
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,892
What? For me?

376
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,859
Yeah!

377
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,329
We heard you were in trouble
from Akira, right?

378
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,665
So we said we'd help out.

379
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,434
-What? That's so nice!
-Right?

380
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,703
In the end, I peed my pants though.

381
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,806
Hey, laugh!

382
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,374
Why doesn't anyone laugh?

383
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,043
You too, laugh!

384
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,780
-Hello?
-<i>Kaede. Where are you?</i>

385
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,816
Uh, now?

386
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,918
I need you to come here right away.

387
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,186
Now?

388
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,521
Right away.

389
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:22,332
Kaede!

390
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:25,569
-Mom! What's going on?
-Don't worry about it, just come.

391
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,040
It's Coach Sugai from
the Nihon Unisys corporate team.

392
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,076
There's no practice today,
so he agreed to meet with us!

393
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,678
-Nihon Unisys?
-Look!

394
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:38,782
Your dad pulled a lot of strings for you!

395
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,256
We have athletes who are
off the front line due to injury.

396
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,392
They keep training in ways
that don't harm their knees.

397
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,828
Will you train with us?

398
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:56,833
It's not normally allowed,
but there's special summer training.

399
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,736
If it's okay with you, you can join us.

400
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,506
You're an Olympic hopeful.

401
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,441
Our athletes would welcome you.

402
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:06,977
Isn't that great?

403
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,945
Is that really alright?

404
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,948
Yes. But it's very rigorous.

405
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:14,284
It's a month of solid practice.

406
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:17,420
-A month?
-You can see top athletes close up.

407
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,256
It's an amazing chance to learn.

408
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,125
Please allow her to join.

409
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,827
Thank you very much.

410
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,062
You too!

411
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,836
NIHON UNISYS CORPORATE TEAM

412
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,749
Stop! Iwasaki, don't flinch.
Don't look down.

413
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,851
-Yes, sir!
-Alright.

414
00:19:57,861 --> 00:19:59,996
-What are you guys up to?
-Hey, sir!

415
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,732
Can't you see what we're doing?

416
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,001
We do study a little, don't you know.

417
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,703
Waseda or Keio

418
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,138
should be a piece of cake.

419
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,607
Waseda or Keio?

420
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,310
Huh, what?

421
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,678
You're in for hell.

422
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,979
What do you mean?

423
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,416
Private schools only test
three subjects so it seems easy.

424
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:23,119
Most faculties at Keio with
high hurdles from essay questions.

425
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:25,455
Stuff you'd never see on a UTokyo exam,

426
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,023
like difficult English words.

427
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,659
Things that barely appear
in huge prep books.

428
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:31,561
There are extremely niche questions.

429
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,662
What?

430
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,664
For schools like Waseda and Keio,

431
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:37,701
there are infinite possibilities
for the range of exam questions.

432
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,537
Without major knowledge and adaptability,

433
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,806
you'll never break through that barrier.

434
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:45,475
-Change your strategy.
-Sheesh.

435
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:50,547
-Are my guys studying here?
-Yeah, every day.

436
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:52,182
I don't see Kaede lately though.

437
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,518
Pass on a message for me.

438
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,887
Tomorrow's a school day. Don't forget.

439
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,356
-Okay.
-Got it.

440
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:15,939
Long time no see, sir.

441
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,709
-Whoa. Long time no see, Sakamoto.
-Yes.

442
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,946
It's your fault
I'm roped into this lost cause.

443
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,116
You figured out it was me who found you.

444
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,118
Only you could.

445
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:31,154
Mizuno-<i>senpai</i> asked me
to find out who sent that e-mail.

446
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,223
Relating to the sale of Tatsumi Gakuen.

447
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,460
Sending it anonymously.
That's in bad taste.

448
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:41,564
Seriously. Even so,
buying up all this land?

449
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:43,566
-What are they going to do?
-What indeed.

450
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,769
If you find out, let me know.

451
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,237
President Sakamoto.

452
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,707
-See ya.
-Bye.

453
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:08,024
MID-BREAK SCHOOL DAY

454
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:10,093
After the next practice exam ends,

455
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,762
write down everything from your
answer papers.

456
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:15,398
Everything? I can't remember all that.

457
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:18,034
They're essay questions
and there are a ton of them.

458
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:21,538
You write a draft
before answering the question, right?

459
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:23,540
Use that to remember.

460
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,942
And bring them here.

461
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,844
-What for?
-To mark yourself.

462
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:28,845
What?

463
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:32,182
It takes weeks for
the results to come back.

464
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,818
You want to find your mistakes quickly,

465
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,821
analyze how to improve,
and build a strategy.

466
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:39,989
Overcome your shortfalls quickly.

467
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:41,424
That's what's needed now.

468
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:42,459
Huh.

469
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:46,429
One more thing. There's a great benefit
to marking your own test.

470
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,365
Amano, do you know why?

471
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,867
You get to know question trends?

472
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,202
You're half right.

473
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:55,705
Listen. By marking yourself,

474
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:58,441
you can see where you get points
and lose points.

475
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:02,545
Through repetition, you'll see the intent
of the ones making and scoring the exam.

476
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:05,548
You'll get to know what sort of
answers they're looking for.

477
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:07,751
If it were that easy, we wouldn't suffer.

478
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:09,285
Correct, you'll suffer less.

479
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:11,454
If you can do this,

480
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:13,957
you'll figure out what answers
UTokyo wants.

481
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:16,092
-Wow.
-I see.

482
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,397
But knowing the results right after
it's over makes me nervous.

483
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:21,698
Maybe I'll get a higher score.

484
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:25,201
Yeah, we've been working hard every day.
Of course it'll go up.

485
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:26,636
I bet I could get a D.

486
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:27,937
Don't get your hopes up.

487
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,172
Huh?

488
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:32,342
The athletes who finished their summer
events will be at these exams.

489
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,745
They have energy, strength,
perseverance, and focus.

490
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:37,614
They're strong, they have it all.

491
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,050
The number of test takers will go up
and so will the average score.

492
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:44,220
Even if you score higher,
you might not get a higher grade.

493
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,791
Strong opponents will come at you
from all sides.

494
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:49,826
Whoa. Scary!

495
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:53,062
So you approach it with even more
energy than ever. Got it?

496
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:54,497
Yes, sir.

497
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:30,600
<i>I have to do this.</i>

498
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:32,902
<i>I have to do this.</i>

499
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,938
<i>I have to do this.</i>

500
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:42,411
AFTER THE SUMMER UTOKYO PRACTICE EXAM

501
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:44,847
Good morning!

502
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:48,517
-Good morning.
-Morning!

503
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,723
Okay, I'll collect the answer sheets.

504
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,426
Collect? Don't we mark our own?

505
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:59,428
Shuffle them, and mark each other.

506
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:00,729
What?

507
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:03,031
N-No! I don't want anyone to see.

508
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:05,901
Yeah, can't we just correct it ourselves
and review?

509
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,836
-Are any of yours correct?
-Hush.

510
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:10,172
If you mark another person's answers,

511
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,306
it's beneficial.

512
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:12,608
What kind of benefit?

513
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:15,611
People have trouble noticing
their own mistakes.

514
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,379
But they instantly notice
others' mistakes.

515
00:25:17,946 --> 00:25:19,414
By marking another person's test,

516
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,884
you'll notice the parts
that are easily mistaken.

517
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,020
You'll make new discoveries and level up.

518
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,523
-We can level up?
-Level up!

519
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:30,158
If you get it, then hurry up and
give them to me.

520
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:32,094
-Okay.
-Got it.

521
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,830
-What? I'm embarrassed!
-Come on.

522
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:37,699
Everyone has an answer booklet, right?

523
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:40,903
Read the explanations, note how
points are added and taken off.

524
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,105
-Then mark those tests.
-Yes, ma'am.

525
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,239
Ready, start.

526
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,778
<i>Kosugi really is super amazing.</i>

527
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:52,047
<i>Whoa, but she made one mistake here.</i>

528
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:55,717
<i>If even Kosugi can miss that,</i>
<i>anyone could.</i>

529
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:59,054
<i>Hayase is getting a solid score</i>
<i>on the humanities subjects.</i>

530
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,990
<i>Her reading comprehension is much better.</i>

531
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:05,627
<i>Huh. Even Amano is doing well</i>
<i>on his English essays.</i>

532
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:08,330
<i>I missed that one. Damn.</i>

533
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:12,434
<i>Kenta did great.</i>
<i>All the science subjects have high marks.</i>

534
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,504
<i>Compared to him, I got these wrong.</i>

535
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:18,807
<i>Fujii. Right, right, wrong, right, right.</i>

536
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,376
<i>Right, right, wrong, right, right…</i>

537
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:23,779
<i>Kaede missed this one too.</i>

538
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:25,180
<i>This too.</i>

539
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,221
Announcing the practice exam results.

540
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:35,390
Kenta.

541
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:37,025
201 points.

542
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,695
-Mari, I did it!
-Yeah!

543
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:41,430
Kosugi.

544
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,066
-225 points.
-Yes ma'am.

545
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,568
Fujii.

546
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,437
171 points.

547
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:49,404
Oh!

548
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:51,306
Amano.

549
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:52,975
129 points.

550
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,343
Yeah!

551
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,179
Hayase.

552
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,480
138 points.

553
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,015
Yikes! Really?

554
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:01,984
Seto.

555
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:03,952
111 points.

556
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,487
Yes! Yes!

557
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:07,422
Iwasaki.

558
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:09,891
122 points.

559
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:16,131
Is this really mine? It went up a lot.

560
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,233
Yes, yes!

561
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,435
If you improved a lot or not,

562
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,537
these results aren't everything.

563
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:26,341
Yes. You started with basic
junior high school knowledge.

564
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:29,745
You've got the base,
now if you can add to that,

565
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:30,946
you'll leap forward.

566
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,550
Don't panic. Just do what you can
as hard as you can. That's all.

567
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:36,618
Yes, sir.

568
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,829
Hey, are you feeling sick?

569
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:50,065
Your score barely changed from last time.

570
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:52,067
Hayase and Amano passed you.

571
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:55,570
It's just summer fatigue. I'm fine.

572
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,440
Are you really okay, Kaede?

573
00:27:58,507 --> 00:28:00,075
I said I'm fine!

574
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:04,546
Iwasaki.

575
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:06,982
Come with me.

576
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:21,930
I'm really just a little tired lately.

577
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,566
I'll recover.

578
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,134
Iwasaki.

579
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:30,138
Do you remember what I told you before?

580
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:31,039
Huh?

581
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:35,143
You've decided your life up to now.

582
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,412
And you will from here on, too.

583
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,849
Make a choice you can stand behind.

584
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:04,573
Iwasaki-<i>senpai</i>, hello!

585
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,808
-Hello!
-Iwasaki, why…

586
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,010
-Long time no see, everyone.
-Long time no see!

587
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,846
Hey! Get back to practice!

588
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:13,215
Yes, sir! Pardon me.

589
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:24,192
Looks like the nationals are going well.

590
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:26,661
Of course.

591
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:30,165
Anyway, I heard from my parents.

592
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:32,768
You're practicing with Nihon Unisys?

593
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,337
Weren't you going to UTokyo?

594
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:39,374
Do you think you can win
without committing to either?

595
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:42,811
-It's none of your business.
-Yeah, it's not.

596
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:47,282
But I just think it's uncool behavior
for a former ace.

597
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:51,553
I know I'm only doing a half-hearted job.

598
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,258
But I've got a lot going on.

599
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:58,760
A lot?

600
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:03,799
I disappointed my parents with my injury.

601
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:07,102
If I tell them I'm going to UTokyo
instead of practicing,

602
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:10,005
I'll disappoint them again.

603
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:15,076
Don't disappoint me!

604
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,079
You're not like that, are you?

605
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,982
Are you in a position to worry about that?

606
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:35,497
28…

607
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,834
Lift it! Lift it!

608
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,101
Go! 29!

609
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:45,941
Lift your racket!

610
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:53,048
Hey!

611
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:57,552
Sorry.

612
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,522
Kaede, focus! Focus!

613
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,859
-Yes, sir.
-Hold it well. Your racket is your life!

614
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,794
Yes, sir.

615
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,400
You followed her all the way there
instead of studying?

616
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,336
I'm worried!

617
00:31:15,203 --> 00:31:18,406
It was Kaede who inspired me
to try for UTokyo.

618
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,375
I can't just ignore this.

619
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:24,679
Nihon Unisys.
A top-ranking badminton team.

620
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:27,148
Kaede's parents are really strict.

621
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:32,287
I saw them at her match before.
They've given their lives to badminton.

622
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:36,391
I think Kaede's scared to tell them
she's taking the UTokyo entrance exam.

623
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,027
Sir, do something for her.

624
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,429
Yeah. Talk to Kaede's parents.

625
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:43,999
I just know Kaede wants to focus
on studying.

626
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:49,070
Say something!

627
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:51,339
You convinced Amano and my parents.

628
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:54,009
And Kosugi too.
Why are you ignoring Kaede?

629
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:55,677
Everything depends on this summer.

630
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:59,547
It's Iwasaki's problem.
You guys shouldn't get involved.

631
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:02,017
-Yeah, but…
-Everything depends on this summer.

632
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,752
Where will you be a year from now?

633
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:26,374
Long time no see!

634
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:29,811
Kaede! Hey, are you feeling okay?

635
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,046
Yeah. I'm fine.

636
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,215
You didn't have
Nihon Unisys practice today?

637
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:36,117
How do you know that?

638
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:40,188
Sorry, I followed you
and saw you practicing.

639
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,295
Why didn't you tell us?
We're friends, right?

640
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:49,764
-We'll convince your parents.
-Stop.

641
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,468
I can do both.

642
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:55,270
Kaede…

643
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:58,340
You can't do both, idiot.
Are you mocking UTokyo?

644
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,610
Hey Kaede, at this rate
you're really in trouble.

645
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:04,579
Summer is crunch time. The teacher said.

646
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:05,814
I know!

647
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:09,184
I know that the most.

648
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,785
That I'm being half-hearted.

649
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:14,990
I know that.

650
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:20,729
Can't we help somehow? We're friends.

651
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,065
I'll do whatever I can to help.

652
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,968
You helped me before.

653
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:29,537
We can all think of a way together.

654
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,072
That's a good idea.

655
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,743
But you know you've got to work this out
fast and focus on studying.

656
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,611
Iwasaki, let's think together.

657
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:37,846
Sorry, but…

658
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:40,548
this is my problem.

659
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,118
Kaede?

660
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:50,692
-Kaede?
-Kaede!

661
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:52,961
-Kaede!
-Kaede?

662
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,896
Are you okay? Kaede!

663
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,175
I…

664
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:11,179
Lack of sleep and fatigue was the cause.
You're working too hard.

665
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,081
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:16,951
Your parents are coming to get you.
Rest here until then.

667
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:17,886
Huh?

668
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:22,190
Hey!

669
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:24,692
-Iwasaki!
-Kaede!

670
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,495
Settle down, Iwasaki.
Just talk, your parents will--

671
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:29,431
Kaede.

672
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:31,499
Kaede!

673
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,070
Stop! Kaede, stop!

674
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,839
Let go! I'm really fine!

675
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,446
People who insist they're fine
usually aren't.

676
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,715
You'll never get into UTokyo
as you are now. Give up.

677
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:49,250
You're kicked out.

678
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:50,952
Why? That's horrible!

679
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:54,522
I already said this. People who aren't
expected to pass are kicked out.

680
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,091
Give up on Iwasaki.

681
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:57,792
What are you saying?

682
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,828
You'd abandon a student?

683
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:03,364
People who can't face themselves
are doomed to be losers.

684
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,200
She's running from her weakness.

685
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,635
Trying to avert her eyes.

686
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:11,339
That sort of person
could never get into UTokyo.

687
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:13,208
But sir…

688
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:14,709
Wait.

689
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:16,244
I want to go to UTokyo.

690
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,981
I really want to go!

691
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:33,895
Why can't you say that to your parents?

692
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:35,730
I just…

693
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,001
I'm at fault.

694
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:42,604
I'm asking why you can't say that
to your parents.

695
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:45,974
Because…

696
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,676
I could never say that.

697
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:51,246
Why could you never say it?

698
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,915
They'd never accept it.

699
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,684
Why?

700
00:35:57,952 --> 00:35:59,554
They'd make me quit the course.

701
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:07,295
It's all because

702
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:11,065
I don't have courage.

703
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,334
Why don't you have courage?

704
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:15,837
I'm scared.

705
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,674
I'm scared of disappointing them again.

706
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,845
I disappointed them when I got injured.
I can't do it again.

707
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,516
It scares me.

708
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,756
My parents are supporting my dream.

709
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:40,295
They're working so hard to make it happen.

710
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,464
You're a kind person.

711
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,069
But you're not a truly kind person.

712
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:53,541
You don't tell your parents
that they're hurting you.

713
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:56,511
Is that kindness?

714
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:00,882
Iwasaki, they may be family,

715
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:04,986
but you don't have to
take on your parents' expectations.

716
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,958
Your parents have their lives.
And you have your life.

717
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:14,762
You have to take on your own life.

718
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,468
Listen.

719
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,838
Parents are monsters.

720
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,542
They care for you longer
and stronger than anyone.

721
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:31,145
If you want to make them understand,

722
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:34,616
you have to be ready to cut ties.

723
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:38,286
That conviction is necessary, isn't it?

724
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:58,706
Kaede!

725
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:01,476
Are you alright?

726
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,879
I'm okay. Sorry I made you worry.

727
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:07,148
Idiot! I told you
to take care of your health.

728
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:08,816
I'm always saying that, aren't I?

729
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:10,285
I'm sorry.

730
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,620
Anyway, I'm glad it's not serious.

731
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,989
You can go back tomorrow, can't you?

732
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:16,157
About that…

733
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:18,326
What is it?

734
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:20,695
I…

735
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,499
I'm not going
to Nihon Unisys practice anymore.

736
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:29,704
What do you mean? Did something happen?

737
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,507
-No.
-Then why?

738
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:37,045
I pulled so many strings
to get you into that practice.

739
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm taking the UTokyo exam.

740
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:41,549
UTokyo? That UTokyo?

741
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:44,786
-You're joking…
-I'm not joking.

742
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:49,624
What about the Olympics? You've given up?

743
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,428
A little injury like that and you give up?

744
00:38:53,494 --> 00:38:56,597
Something we've built up
over more than ten years?

745
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:57,965
You'd throw it away?

746
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:00,735
I never said I was giving up.
Listen to the end…

747
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,303
Dear!

748
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:14,148
I'm serious about this.

749
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:18,786
About UTokyo and the Olympics too.

750
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,890
I'll do both. I swear I'll do both.

751
00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:26,260
That's ridiculous.
You could never do that.

752
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:30,098
I can.
If I never give up, I'll find a way.

753
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:32,200
I learned that in the UTokyo course.

754
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,234
Don't be ridiculous!

755
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,038
I never said you could join that course.

756
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:38,539
How selfish of you!

757
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:40,942
I'm willing to cut ties
to make this happen!

758
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:44,445
You said something before.

759
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:50,284
Studying is for people with no talent.
Something common people do.

760
00:39:52,086 --> 00:39:53,521
But you were wrong.

761
00:39:55,423 --> 00:40:00,228
I learned a lot at the UTokyo course.

762
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:04,732
Not just knowledge.
Things I'll need in life.

763
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,367
I've learned a lot.

764
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,102
Plus,

765
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,243
I've made valuable friends.

766
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:25,520
So I can say for sure
that studying isn't a waste of time.

767
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:30,758
I want to study sports medicine at UTokyo.

768
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:33,628
And keep studying
after I go to the Olympics.

769
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:35,997
For a long time.

770
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,700
I always want to be involved
with badminton.

771
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:44,739
I want to study so I can help athletes
who are struggling with injuries.

772
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:47,842
I want to study at UTokyo!

773
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:50,978
That's why

774
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,514
I'm asking you.

775
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:58,786
Dad, Mom.

776
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:03,491
Please support me.

777
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:24,846
Please.

778
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,574
SECOND SEMESTER

779
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,575
Here we go!

780
00:41:55,543 --> 00:41:57,545
Say cheese!

781
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:00,748
So gloomy! Be a little more…

782
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:02,984
-Smile!
-Best four!

783
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,919
Hooray!

784
00:42:05,553 --> 00:42:06,754
That's great.

785
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:11,692
Iwasaki.

786
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,195
Hello.

787
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:18,366
Thanks for the other day.

788
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,671
Thanks to you, I faced my weakness.

789
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,942
Best four at the nationals.

790
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,844
Congratulations.

791
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:32,046
See ya.

792
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:36,350
You'd better get in!

793
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:42,790
When we're playing doubles
at the Olympics,

794
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:45,593
you've gotta be a UTokyo student

795
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,495
or we won't be a good pair.

796
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:52,133
Same goes for you. Live up to my title.

797
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,001
Show Seinan what you've got.

798
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:58,372
Of course I will.

799
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:11,519
DAYS UNTIL THE COMMON TEST

800
00:43:11,586 --> 00:43:14,522
We're less than halfway to the
first Common Test in January.

801
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:16,791
The countdown to the entrance exam
starts now.

802
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:18,626
Listen.

803
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,929
Laugh or cry, there are 137 days left.

804
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,466
And you might as well laugh.

805
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:26,601
Yes, sir!

806
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,813
What's up guys? Aren't you going to study?

807
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,817
But we'll never get in.

808
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:47,188
You said it, we could never do it.

809
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:51,525
I did say Waseda or Keio were impossible.

810
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,830
But I don't remember saying UTokyo
was impossible.

811
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:56,964
Huh?

812
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,434
With UTokyo, it all depends on
how you approach it.

813
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:04,772
We have the space.
Why not observe from the back?

814
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,275
But there's not enough time.

815
00:44:08,342 --> 00:44:10,845
Why not join as trainees?

816
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:13,914
Only thing, you have to
bring your own desk and chair.

817
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,485
Yes, sir!

818
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:26,994
Did you figure it out?
Who sent that e-mail?

819
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:30,331
No, I couldn't.
They went through a foreign server.

820
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:32,333
I couldn't figure it out.

821
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,569
Okay, got it. Thanks.

822
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:59,093
It's a nice place. Tatsumi Gakuen.

823
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,595
Yes. It's finally time.

824
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:04,832
I can hardly wait.

825
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,626
UTOKYO EXAM &amp; BUYOUT DRAMA!

826
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:35,730
A year ago, could any of you
have imagined this day?

827
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:36,864
I want to try.

828
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:37,998
I'll stake my life.

829
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:40,501
Five Rules to Prep for the Common Test.

830
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:42,036
-Magic?
-That's right!

831
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:45,039
-That does make sense.
-Do not fear it.

832
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:47,041
You'll take it as if it's the real thing.

833
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:47,975
Yes, sir!

834
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:52,480
You might feel bad now, but working
towards your UTokyo goal is happiness.

835
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:54,482
-You're trying to get into UTokyo?
-Poor thing!

836
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:56,383
<i>Trust the students, right?</i>

837
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,152
<i>They can fight alone.</i>

838
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,921
It's alright.
They'll get the points to pass.

839
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:02,423
