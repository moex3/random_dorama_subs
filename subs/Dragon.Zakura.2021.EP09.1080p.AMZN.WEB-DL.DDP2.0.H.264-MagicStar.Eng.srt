1
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,308
115 DAYS UNTIL
THE COMMON TEST FOR UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,845
<i>Mamemameshi</i> from ancient literature.

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,480
What do you think it means?

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,648
-You.
-Huh?

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,385
<i>Mamemameshi</i>, right? Uh, um…

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,653
Totally clueless as usual.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,190
-Alright, you.
-Serious or sincere.

8
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,926
That's right. Listen, everyone.

9
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,067
Write ancient literature in kanji!

10
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,368
Huh?

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,871
Is that how you write <i>mamemameshi</i>?

12
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,206
It is easier to understand in kanji.

13
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,977
Yes. Ancient words are hard
to understand in hiragana.

14
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:47,081
But if you write them in kanji,
they're remarkably easy.

15
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,683
They're not lost in the past.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,288
They're still used today.
Think of it that way and it's easier.

17
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,090
<i>Toshi</i> means "fast."

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,028
<i>Shirushi</i> means "to be clear."

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,132
<i>Yoshinashi </i>means "no reason."

20
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,835
Wow, that does make sense.

21
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,904
Ancient literature is still Japanese.

22
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,240
Do not fear it.

23
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,878
The difference between understanding
and not understanding math

24
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,047
is whether you can prove it or not.

25
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:24,051
In the UTokyo entrance exam,
you may be asked to prove the formula.

26
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,755
But your math is like
a bucket full of holes.

27
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,457
What? You mean useless?

28
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,426
What happens if you put water
in a bucket full of holes?

29
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,396
-It all leaks out, of course.
-Yeah!

30
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,765
Math is a cumulative subject.

31
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,668
Basic arithmetic. Pythagorean theorem.
Quadratic function.

32
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,471
Learn to prove junior high level formulas.

33
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:47,141
Then you'll be able to prove
high school level formulas.

34
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,710
You've no time to sit and stare.

35
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,146
-Get it together!
-Yes, sir!

36
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,084
-Rote memorization?
-Yes!

37
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,986
For example,

38
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,624
Memorize phrases like this.

39
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,227
You know what it means, right? Amano.

40
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,429
"This will expand my perspective."

41
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,901
This can be used in
any free English essay.

42
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,403
-It's a magic phrase.
-Magic?

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,207
For example, if you're asked,
"What do you think of studying abroad?"

44
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:24,712
You can say, "Going overseas will
develop my point of view," right?

45
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,515
If you're asked about
the pros and cons of pets.

46
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,583
"Interacting with animals

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,253
will develop my point of view."
You can use this.

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,189
-Ah, I see.
-Here's more.

49
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,562
"If this situation continues…"

50
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,868
"This makes it possible
for A to do something."

51
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,971
Yes, memorize these phrases in full.

52
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,041
-Yes, ma'am.
-Entrance exams don't need individuality.

53
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,610
If there is a formula, you should use it.

54
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,414
If you use the reading comprehension
skills you've built, it'll be simple.

55
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,883
Okay, now everyone.

56
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,786
Use "This enables A to…"

57
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,856
and write a sentence meaning,
"Time will solve their problems."

58
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,291
Write a sentence like that.

59
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,893
<i>There are 115 days until the Common Test.</i>

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,295
How's the Special Course?

61
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,564
Everything is going fine. Don't worry.

62
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,866
Everyone has acquired
basic academic skills.

63
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,435
It will get even better from here.

64
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,837
Yeah? That's good.

65
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,707
I know it means I'm out of a job.

66
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,578
Why did I enter such a contract?

67
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,046
Chairman…

68
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,548
I feel sorry for your office too.

69
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,352
If everyone gets into UTokyo,
the school will be gone.

70
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,456
The Mizuno Law Office
contract will fall through.

71
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:46,026
My practice was just starting
to get going.

72
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,662
But I've thought about it.

73
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,833
A high school is a place where,
when the students grow up,

74
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,135
they can come back to that place.

75
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,172
For me, it's Ryuzan High School.

76
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,977
When I'm facing challenges,

77
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,680
my memories of
my hard work there support me.

78
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,517
If that place ceased to exist…

79
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,922
Yes, I'm sure not having a place
to go back to is sad.

80
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,094
I feel bad for the students who joined
because of my philosophy on education.

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,563
All those first and second-year students.

82
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,866
I don't want to put them in this position
because of adult issues.

83
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,402
Can't we do something?

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,305
Now that you mention it.

85
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,241
Actually, I noticed something.

86
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,843
-What?
-May I?

87
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,347
If five or more students get into UTokyo,
you've got to step down.

88
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,117
And Mr. Takahara will join the board.
That's the contract?

89
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,251
Yes, that's it.

90
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,122
I think the selection of the chairman
will come up at the next meeting.

91
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:52,126
There, Principal Okuda or Mr. Takahara
could volunteer for the position.

92
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,895
-Me?
-Um…

93
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,465
In order to sell the school,
the chairman must approve.

94
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,901
So if one of you becomes chairman,

95
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,570
we can protect the land and the school.

96
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,772
I see.

97
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,007
According to the school's
articles of endowment,

98
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:10,177
the chairman is selected
by the board's majority vote.

99
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,912
There are five board members.

100
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,183
So if Mr. Okuda and Mr. Takahara oppose,
we just need one more vote.

101
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,752
And one of them can become the chairman.

102
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,921
A pro-sale person
can't become the chairman.

103
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,525
Someone other than myself
and the principal.

104
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,027
Who can we pull over to our side?

105
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,597
I see. The former chairman
and his external advisor

106
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,168
are in favor of selling.
We must target the former principal.

107
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,704
Then it's okay.

108
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,706
Unlike Okuda, he never betrayed me.

109
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,075
Is it that simple?

110
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,778
We need to very carefully
involve the former principal.

111
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,715
Leave that to me.

112
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,851
I will convince the former principal.

113
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,087
-You're so dependable!
-Yes, sir.

114
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,522
-Principal, I'm counting on you.
-Yes!

115
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,258
I'm sorry!

116
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,961
Who was here yesterday talking big?

117
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,096
I was too late.

118
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,332
Mr. Komatsugawa was already
on the former chairman's side.

119
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,936
He must've paid him off. He's so dirty.

120
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,039
Of the five members,
three will side with the former chairman.

121
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:15,676
They are sure to choose someone
in favor of the sale for chairman.

122
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,112
You seem disappointed for another reason.

123
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,316
Huh? No.. but I'm sure
there must be another way.

124
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,119
I'll see if I can find another solution.

125
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:31,258
Don't get it twisted.
Your job is to get those kids into UTokyo.

126
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,427
Of course it is.

127
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,797
But if they work hard and pass,

128
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,633
their alma mater will close.
That's so sad.

129
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,537
My memories of Ryuzan
will stay with me forever.

130
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,374
That time I tore up my answer sheet

131
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,610
and you retrieved it.
That's why I'm here now.

132
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,679
It's not a simple thing
to abandon your school.

133
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,417
It's unacceptable for it to disappear
just so adults can make money.

134
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,855
Our trainees Kohashi and Iwai
will be here next year, working hard.

135
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,791
We can't interfere with their learning.

136
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,626
I want to try my very best.

137
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,394
I'll stake my life.

138
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,541
Ms. Tamura, where are the documents
relating to the articles of endowment?

139
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,910
-Articles of endowment?
-Can I see them?

140
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,979
Over here.

141
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,484
Everything in these shelves.

142
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,885
Thank you very much.

143
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,071
Huh? What's this?

144
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,241
The Common Test for University
Admissions. In other words,

145
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,844
the first UTokyo entrance exam form.

146
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,946
-Oh.
-This is it.

147
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,615
-I can feel my back straighten.
-My hands are shaking.

148
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,217
Everyone has theirs?

149
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,654
Okay, check that the university and
department names are correct.

150
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,893
A year ago, could any of you
have imagined this day?

151
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,097
I know for a fact that you've all
exceeded your own expectations.

152
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,699
That's who you are now.

153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,803
This application form
will decide your future.

154
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,404
It will be your passport.

155
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,474
Write with all your heart,
with sincerity and care.

156
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,711
-Especially Seto.
-I know!

157
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,812
Carefully, right?

158
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,083
After you've filled it out,
check for mistakes.

159
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,317
Check it three times.

160
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,585
Three times?

161
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,988
Kenta. I'll check with you.

162
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,055
Okay.

163
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,524
Next, have your parents…

164
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,059
Oh, Seto, you can ask your sister.

165
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,096
-Okay.
-Have someone else check it.

166
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,599
Then make a copy and keep it with you.

167
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,302
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

168
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,506
Fujii, got it?

169
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,308
Of course I do.

170
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,886
Ms. Mizuno, I'm going home.

171
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,187
Good night.

172
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,499
<i>Sho and Kyo were</i>
<i>awarded for a thesis again?</i>

173
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,702
<i>-Yes, they were.</i>
<i>-I'm so proud of my sons.</i>

174
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,738
<i>Compared to them, Ryo is…</i>

175
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,041
<i>It seems he's trying for UTokyo,</i>

176
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,276
<i>I know he'll never make it.</i>

177
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,879
<i>We had such high hopes for high school,</i>

178
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,147
<i>and he caught a cold.</i>

179
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,483
<i>He cracks under pressure. It's pathetic.</i>

180
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,763
Listen, everyone. Until test day,

181
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,766
ignore all extra opinions and information.

182
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,468
Shut out the noise of the world.

183
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,171
In two weeks, there's a practice exam.

184
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,606
The last one.

185
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,241
You'll take it as if it's the real thing.

186
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,812
-The last one.
-I'm getting nervous.

187
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,547
How do we act like it's the real thing?

188
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,550
Right. I'm going to tell you.

189
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,587
Five Rules to Prep for the Common Test.

190
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:21,521
Yeah! Here we go.

191
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,956
Finally, the Five Rules!

192
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,157
Number one.

193
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:28,562
Until the end of the second day, don't
think about subjects you've finished.

194
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,998
But I'll wonder if I've gotten
the questions right.

195
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,668
What will you do if you realize
a mistake during a different test?

196
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,436
I think I might freak out.

197
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,839
Right? You're not the only one.

198
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,174
Listen. If even a single mistake

199
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,411
starts to bother you,
it will make you feel uneasy.

200
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,847
If it's your last chance,
the effect is worse.

201
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,748
I see.

202
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,182
During breaks,

203
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,151
listen to music with earphones.

204
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,654
Shut out the voices around you.

205
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,557
After the first day is over,
all the subjects of that day

206
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,925
should be wiped from your mind.

207
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,560
Wipe them from my mind.

208
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,730
Number two. Don't get bogged down
by difficult questions.

209
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,968
The Common Test always
has one really difficult question.

210
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,137
-Is that true?
-But don't worry.

211
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,207
A question that's difficult for you
is going to be difficult for everyone.

212
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,643
The average mark for that subject
will be lower.

213
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,013
The faster you can change gears,
the better your chances.

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,716
But if you can solve it,
you could get ahead of others.

215
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:27,087
That is true. But the Common Test
has a lot of questions.

216
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,290
If you spend time thinking,
you might find the answer

217
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,025
but you don't have time for that.

218
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,195
Prioritize questions where
you are sure to get the points.

219
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,563
Do what you know first.

220
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,802
Number three. Go home alone after day one.

221
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,704
You mean we can't meet anyone?

222
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,639
Aw, that's lonely!

223
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,507
You guys really are close.

224
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,376
Listen.

225
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,345
Just seeing a friend,
even if they don't ask how it went,

226
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,648
you'll be able to tell how the other did.

227
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,451
Little things like that
will make you feel uneasy.

228
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,954
-Nao is like an open book after all.
-Hey.

229
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,457
Don't contact each other.

230
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,959
No messaging, no phone calls.

231
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,829
-Yes, sir.
-And number four.

232
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,765
Always write the answer
on your question sheet.

233
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,902
It's a multiple-choice test,
so just circle the numbers.

234
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,239
After the day is done,
you can check your answers.

235
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,842
We've already been doing that
for the practice exams.

236
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,178
Right? But for the real thing,
you have the secondary exam.

237
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,148
The UTokyo entrance exam
application form depends on this.

238
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,116
What do you mean?

239
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,717
Based on your Common Test results,

240
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,886
you submit your UTokyo
secondary exam application.

241
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,122
Based on your score, to avoid the cutoff,

242
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,190
you might need to change your stream.

243
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,726
But the Common Test results arrive

244
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,995
after the secondary exam application
is due.

245
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,631
So you'll use your self-graded score

246
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,435
and look at the cutoff points
to decide how to submit your application.

247
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,504
That's why you mark down your answers.

248
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,606
How do you know the cutoff point?

249
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,208
You can check the UTokyo website.

250
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,176
Website?

251
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,213
Every year, UTokyo uploads the number
of applicants to their website.

252
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,215
And it gets updated every day.

253
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,118
Examinees wait
until the last minute to submit,

254
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,622
looking at the numbers
and deciding what the cutoff might be.

255
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,524
Consider ratio versus capacity

256
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,493
and you can determine where the
cutoff point will be.

257
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,497
Examinees can look at which stream
has more and submit their forms.

258
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,432
Wow, I didn't know that.

259
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,802
You can find out how many rivals you have?

260
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:22,936
On the other hand,

261
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,006
you can shoot for
the place with the fewest rivals.

262
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,774
And number five.

263
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,876
I've saved the most important for last.

264
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,179
Entrance exams are about facing yourself.

265
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,446
Others don't matter.

266
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,317
Go into it with only
your own success in mind.

267
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,220
-That's all.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,039
FINAL PRACTICE EXAM

269
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,208
<i>Now, please begin.</i>

270
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,481
Have you found what you needed?

271
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,850
No, it's tough going.

272
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,752
Do you need some help?

273
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,687
This is my job as a lawyer, so…

274
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,536
Is that you, Fujii?

275
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,005
Whoa, that bag.

276
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,341
You're at Tatsumi Gakuen?
Isn't it full of idiots?

277
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,644
A Tatsumi student
trying to get into UTokyo?

278
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,413
Your brothers are
super smart, aren't they?

279
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,749
Poor thing!

280
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,823
If I study with those idiots,
I might catch it. The stupidity.

281
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,326
I can't stand dumb girls.
I'll catch the dumb.

282
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,396
This worm could never aim for UTokyo.

283
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,702
No comeback? How boring.

284
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh no, it's almost time.

285
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,190
The kids should be coming back soon.

286
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,825
We'll do that. You go on.

287
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,995
Sorry. Thank you very much.

288
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,923
What are you doing here?

289
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,127
We all promised to go back together
and you went alone.

290
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,163
-You followed me?
-Yeah.

291
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,634
I don't need that.

292
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,472
Fujii. Your face is different.
You look stressed.

293
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,439
Huh?

294
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,145
You're always pleasant. I'm jealous.

295
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,348
I wish I could be like you.

296
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,817
Huh? Me?

297
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,620
Yeah. You say what you're thinking.

298
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,990
I don't know what to say.

299
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,227
People at UTokyo share their opinions.

300
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,095
Fujii, it'll suit you.

301
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,099
I think so too.

302
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,300
Yeah.

303
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,870
Thanks.

304
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,510
Let's go back to class.

305
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,079
Yeah.

306
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,550
Ugh. I thought I did better than that.

307
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,520
Me too. My score has barely changed.

308
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,622
I thought I worked pretty hard.

309
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,625
Damn. I thought that was my best one yet.

310
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,263
What do you think is the time
when people feel the worst?

311
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,565
Huh? Must be times like this?

312
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,501
Yes. When you're working hard
and you don't get results.

313
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,238
Especially studying for entrance exams,
it takes time to see results.

314
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,773
So don't feel down.

315
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:00,179
Sir, do you think we feel down?

316
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,115
-Huh?
-We don't have time to feel down.

317
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,817
I'm going to crush my mistakes.

318
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,020
I found out what I don't know
so I feel lucky!

319
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,825
If you get that, you'll be okay.

320
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,159
Listen.

321
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:19,598
You might feel bad now, but working
towards your UTokyo goal is happiness.

322
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,102
-Yeah.
-Having a goal is happiness…

323
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,403
Happy!

324
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,972
Just keep believing
your breakthrough will come.

325
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,375
It's tough now, but keep fighting.

326
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,910
Yes, sir!

327
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,746
Kohashi and Iwai, you too.

328
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,416
We still have a month, right?
We won't give up.

329
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,219
Of course not!
If we fail, we'll do it next year.

330
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,520
That's the spirit.

331
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,774
I guess there's nothing.

332
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,660
C'mon…

333
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,595

You're late!
Why did you suddenly call us here?

340
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,333
I don't just call myself
a lawyer for show.

341

I, Naomi Mizuno,

342

have found the clue
to preventing the school sale!

-We can use this, Mizuno!
-Yeah!

349

Leave it to me to explain it
to the faculty members.

350
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,993
Yes, please do.
I'm sure they're against it.

Finally, tomorrow is the real Common Test.

392
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,657
Now, I want each of you
to tell me what you want to do at UTokyo.

393
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,492
Huh? That's a bit sudden.

394
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,794
Put it into words and clarify your goals.

395
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,363
By sharing it with others,

396
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,565
you create some good pressure.

397
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,468
-Let's start with you, Seto.
-Me?

398
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm gonna go to UTokyo,

399
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,473
and figure out how
to make money selling ramen.

400
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,608
I want to help my sister.

401
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,279
I want to enjoy being a UTokyo student.

402
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,281
You said it, didn't you?

403
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,617
"Find what you want to do at UTokyo."

404
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,120
I want to meet lots of people

405
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,888
and find what I want to do.

406
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:15,427
I've decided. I'm going to get into
UTokyo and the Olympics too.

407
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,195
I'm going to make it happen.

408
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,965
I want

409
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,335
to prove that even a guy like me
can get into UTokyo.

410
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,105
And then I think
I'll be able to be confident.

411
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,009
That's where I'll start.

412
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,912
I want to be a researcher.

413
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,515
To make a world where
insects and people live together.

414
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,853
I'm going to keep studying.

415
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,322
I love reading books.

416
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,292
I want to read all
the valuable literature at UTokyo.

417
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,295
And then I'll find a job
where I can use that.

418
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,266
I… want to help someone.

419
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,202
I want to be needed by someone.

420
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,337
I'm going to take over
the family business.

421
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,407
But I like studying now.

422
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,909
I want to study more!

423
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,183
I…

424
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,218
What, you can't say it?

425
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,355
You want to show
your parents and brothers.

426
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,990
Is that why?

427
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,293
Yeah.

428
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,428
I'll get into UTokyo no matter what.

429
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,731
I'll be so important that
you guys will be speechless!

430
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,169
What?

431
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,240
Listen. By going to UTokyo,

432
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,044
your futures will be full
of endless possibilities.

433
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,280
Others don't decide your future.

434
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,516
You don't have to follow the status quo.

435
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,919
You make your life yourself.

436
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,427
It's not what happens to you in life,
it's what you do!

437
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,929
Big and strong, take that step!

438
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,499
Take that step with all your might!

439
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,568
It's finally time for battle.

440
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,204
Seize victory.

441
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,953
So it starts tomorrow.

442
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,723
It takes me back.

443
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,593
Back then, my mom collapsed.

444
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,296
I felt like giving up so many times.

445
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,299
But Yajima and everyone supported me.

446
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,637
These kids too,

447
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,307
I hope they will support each other.

448
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,345
Comrades with the same goals.

449
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,048
I'm sure their feelings are connected.

450
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,151
Yes.

451
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,028
I always think this,
but at times like this,

452
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,098
all we can do is pray.

453
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,937
-That's fine, isn't it?
-Huh?

454
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,573
I'm sure they'll be just fine.

455
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,809
Believe in your students.

456
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,445
Yes, sir!

457
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,283
Sir.

458
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,321
Do you remember what you told me
when I thought I'd give up?

459
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:30,889
Hm?

460
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,925
You told me "Do your best."

461
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,197
Those words support me even now.

462
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,036
Thank you very much.

463
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,277
And thanks for now on as well.

464
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,693
DAY 1 OF THE COMMON TEST

465
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,130
This is it, the final battle.

466
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,498
-Yeah!
-Uh-huh.

467
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,467
Let's do our best.

468
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,036
Okay!

469
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,274
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

470

472
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,650
Yes. I'm getting nervous.

473
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,787
Do you think five or more will pass?

474
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,755
If they don't, there'll be trouble.

475
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,590
We've solved our problem.

476
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,995
Now we have to work
at rebuilding the school.

477
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,098
It's finally the day!

479
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,046
<i>But I took six practice exams.</i>

480
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,815
<i>I'm used to this feeling.</i>

481
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>It's just like a badminton game.</i>

482
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,360
<i>This nervousness helps me focus.</i>

483
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,596
<i>The first day is</i>
<i>English, lit, and history.</i>

484
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,265
<i>It's okay. Those are my best subjects.</i>

485
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,201
<i>Calm down. Just do the work.</i>

486
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,204
<i>After all, I've got good luck!</i>

487
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,540
<i>Just do as I always do.</i>

488
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,376
<i>I'm with everyone. It's okay.</i>

489
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,780
<i>I can do it. I can do it.</i>

490
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,782
<i>I can absolutely do it!</i>

491
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,450
DAYS UNTIL THE COMMON TEST

492
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,726
Maybe I should've gone to cheer them on?

493
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:26,030
You'd just be in the way.
They can fight alone.

494
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,599
We've already done what we can.

495
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,400
Yes, I know.

496
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:35,206
The only thing we can do now is
trust the students, right?

497
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:39,544
It's alright.
They'll get the points to pass.

498
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,089
Alright, please begin.

499
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,096
<i>Oh! I just reviewed this last week.</i>

500
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,198
<i>I sure am lucky.</i>

501
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,602
<i>Ptolemy's world map is a conic projection,</i>
<i>so it's number three or four.</i>

502
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,473
<i>Start the lit exam with the classics.</i>

503
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,909
<i>After "in other words"</i>

504
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,977
<i>comes a paraphrasing sentence.</i>

505
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,714
LUNCH BREAK

506
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,650
<i>Snacks, snacks!</i>

507
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:28,326
<i>"Don't think about subjects</i>
<i>you've finished" is what he said.</i>

508
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,061
How was the Jokyu War question?

509
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,497
I said Emperor Go-Toba was exiled to Sado.

510
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,833
-Right? Ah, it's wrong.
-What?

511
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,468
He was exiled to Oki.

512
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,571
<i>Oh no! I put Sado!</i>

513
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,974
<i>I couldn't get the Kansei Reforms</i>
<i>question either.</i>

514
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,777
<i>The answer… Ah, forget it!</i>

515
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,080
<i>He told us "Don't think</i>
<i>about subjects you've finished!"</i>

516
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,685
<i>Don't take notes during listening.</i>

517
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,287
<i>What did this word mean?</i>

518
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:01,392
<i>No, if I think it's difficult,</i>
<i>it'll be difficult for everyone else too.</i>

519
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,494
<i>If I have time later, I'll work on it.</i>

520
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,375
<i>Don't think about other things.</i>
<i>Focus on the exam!</i>

521
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,086
<i>After day one, go home alone.</i>

522
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,189
<i>Don't contact each other.</i>

523
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,358
<i>I wish I could see everyone,</i>

524
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,361
<i>but I know that everyone's working hard,</i>
<i>so I'm not lonely.</i>

525
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,463
I did alright in English…

526
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,071
<i>It's important for me to face myself now.</i>

527
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,641
<i>Mari!</i>

528
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,610
<i>No… Go home alone.</i>

529
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,120
<i>The English questions were hard.</i>

530
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,455
<i>The ancient literature tripped me up…</i>

531
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,558
<i>But I did what I could…</i>

532
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,367
Hey, are you telling us
to play basketball?

533
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,938
I am. We going to have
a free-throw shoot-off.

534
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,573
Who will go against me?
The rules are simple.

535
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,809
Ten shots, the higher score wins.

536
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,210
Sounds fun. I'll do it.

537
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,980
Rock, paper, scissors.

538
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,051
Alright.

539
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,891
-Miss! Miss!
-What? You're terrible.

540
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,826
You're the one who wanted to play.

541
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,595
-You look bad!
-This is fine.

542
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,399
-Alright!
-Go Akira!

543
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,371
-Hey!
-Oh!

544
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,872
-Wow, Seto!
-Yay!

545
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,441
-Nice!
-Hey! Hey!

546
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,478
-Sir, do your best!
-Sir, get a point!

547
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,415
Are you even trying?

548
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,656
-Alright!
-Oh! Good one.

549
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,624
-Wow, wow!
-Nice shot!

550
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,235
-Great!
-You got three in a row!

551
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,903
Wow!

552
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,872
Akira, don't lose now!

553
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,013
You can still win!

554
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,721
So close!

555
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,724
-Akira, last one.
-Uh-huh.

556
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,659
-Get that last one!
-Do it!

557
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,168
Mr. Sakuragi, six points.
Seto, five points.

558
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,937
-Mr. Sakuragi wins!
-Damn it!

559
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,373
That was a close one, Seto.

560
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,642
You could've won if you kept it up.

561
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,079
Nah, it was just bad luck.

562
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,414
It's not just luck.

563
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,616
You messed up when it mattered

564
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,518
because you tried to score every time.

565
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,186
Huh? It's a contest though.

566
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,355
You're supposed to try
to score every time.

567
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:22,293
The reason I won is because
I only tried to get about 60% in.

568
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,463
Huh? You thought you'd be okay
if you missed four shots?

569
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,766
Yeah. So when I missed the first two,
I didn't panic.

570
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,635
But not you.

571
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,038
You got the first two in
and started to feel like you might win.

572
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,973
And then you missed the fifth.

573
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,943
I know what you were thinking.

574
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,212
"I can't miss another shot!"

575
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,281
"I'll get them all in!"

576
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,617
Ah, at that point Seto was panicking.

577
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,487
If you get nervous, you'll never win.

578
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,256
So if he built a strategy
ahead of time like you,

579
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,858
he wouldn't have been nervous?

580
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,661
Yes. That's how you separate
the winners and losers.

581
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,730
But before an important day,

582
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,032
everyone gets nervous.

583
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,968
Especially people who
have made a lot of effort.

584
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,804
But those nerves are what
made Seto lose, aren't they?

585
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:07,972
What can we do?

586
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,074
Control your nerves.

587
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,609
People who're good under pressure

588
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,644
are aware that they feel nervous.

589
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,080
They expect mistakes
and emotionally prepare.

590
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,516
Listen. Don't try to be perfect.

591
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,986
Make sure you stay calm during the test.

592
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,460
Alright you guys!

593
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,030
From now until exam day,
imagine yourself passing!

594
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,766
The strong can imagine their own success!

595
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,703
And believe in yourself!

596
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,206
<i>Why am I panicking?</i>

597
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,542
<i>A couple of mistakes are no big deal.</i>

598
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,078
<i>I'm going to get into UTokyo.</i>

599
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,080
<i>I just need to calm down</i>
<i>and keep it steady.</i>

600
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,084
<i>Imagine myself passing! Believe in myself!</i>

601
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,426
Alright!

602
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:20,343
DAY 2 OF THE COMMON TEST

603
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,187
<i>Just solve the questions you know.</i>

604
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:35,458
<i>This is a basic question,</i>
<i>so I have to get the points.</i>

605
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:40,296
<i>A=3x²-xy</i>

606
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,332
<i>-9xy+3y²</i>

607
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:45,134
<i>To solve this,</i>

608
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:48,170
<i>I use cosine and sine.</i>

609
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:52,375
<i>Differentiate 9x²-2x+2.</i>

610
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:56,245
<i>The slope of the tangential line</i>
<i>when x equals 1…</i>

611
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:58,714
<i>C is a gingkgoaceae, so it's a gymnosperm.</i>

612
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,150
<i>Only angiosperms do double fertilization.</i>

613
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:03,486
<i>So it's B. Number two is the right answer!</i>

614
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:06,522
<i>Ah, no, no, no, I'm running out of time.</i>

615
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:08,791
<i>I'll do chemistry first.</i>

616
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,063
Pencils down.

617
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:25,241
THE NEXT DAY

618
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:27,109
DAYS UNTIL THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

619
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:40,623
Hand in your question sheets.

620
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,128
We'll check the answers.

621
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:48,431
Wow, I'm so nervous.

622
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:58,674
Okay, now study for the secondary exam.

623
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,076
Yes, sir.

624
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:19,662
Okay, here are the results.

625
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:22,665
Hayase.

626
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,334
738 points.

627
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:27,937
Huh? No way. Really?!

628
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:29,939
Iwasaki.

629
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,540
752 points.

630
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:35,644
Yay! It's higher than my goal!

631
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:37,012
Kosugi.

632
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:38,981
810 points.

633
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,684
It's lower than I thought…

634
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:43,319
Kenta.

635
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,287
803 points.

636
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:48,157
Yeah. Okay.

637
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,358
Amano.

638
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,694
801 points.

639
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:53,229
Huh?

640
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:55,097
801 points?!

641
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,066
Amano, that's amazing!

642
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,702
-Yeah!
-Very well done.

643
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:00,836
You worked hard.

644
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:04,440
Iwai. 484 points.

645
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:08,043
Kohashi. 492 points.

646
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,747
Too bad. You didn't get enough to pass.

647
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:14,450
It wasn't enough for us.

648
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:17,119
I hoped we could get it in one shot.

649
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:19,655
But before, you couldn't
have even gotten 300.

650
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:22,458
The results from your studies
are showing. You did well.

651
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,126
We'll take it again next year!

652
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:27,396
You all gotta get into UTokyo
for our sake!

653
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:28,697
-Okay.
-Yeah.

654
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:31,167
And Fujii.

655
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:35,437
719 points.

656
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,713
-And lastly Seto.
-Yeah.

657
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,282
620 points.

658
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,484
Huh?

659
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,720
620 points? What does that mean?

660
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,490
Honestly, it's going to be tight.

661
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:56,392
With this score,

662
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:59,195
it's impossible without a miracle.

663
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:10,239
Hey Seto, where are you going?

664
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,343
It's impossible, right?

665
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,413
I have no chance of passing.
There's no point.

666
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,752
I'll take it next year with the guys.

667
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:25,821
Seto.

668
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,293
Seto might not make it…

669
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,296
Fujii's score was lower than expected.

670
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,532
That kid really
does crumble under pressure.

671
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,335
Anyhow, we'll have the results in a month.

672
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,237
I trust you adjusted your attitude.

673
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,938
O-Of course.

674
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,150
Are you crying?

675
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:57,753
I'm not crying.

676
00:40:58,387 --> 00:40:59,555
You're fine.

677
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,191
With that score, you'll make the cutoff.

678
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:04,960
Are you scared of failing?

679
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,097
I'm scared.

680
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:10,299
Always.

681
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:13,235
Fujii.

682
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,473
Why do you want to go to UTokyo?

683
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:24,380
Because it's the top
university in Japan, right?

684
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:26,882
That's right.

685
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:30,319
It has to be the number one
or it doesn't matter.

686
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:32,955
Nobody will take me seriously!

687
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:34,490
Well then, Fujii.

688
00:41:36,158 --> 00:41:37,660
You should change to Humanities.

689
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:41,363
There's still time
before you submit your application.

690
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:44,466
Change to Humanities 3.

691
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,969
Change from science to the arts?

692
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,570
You know it yourself.

693
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:51,073
If you go ahead with Sciences 2,

694
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,543
your math and science scores are too low.

695
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,646
I bet you tripped up on Math 2 and Math B

696
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:00,549
and messed up your priorities
with physics and chemistry.

697
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,686
I can't switch to Humanities this late!

698
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:07,723
You can. You'd be surprised
how many students switch and get in.

699
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,992
Most Humanities students
aren't great at math.

700
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:11,293
That's how you get ahead.

701
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,031
That's bullshit! I've spent three years
working towards a science major, studying.

702
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:19,268
I have! Me!

703
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,403
Not willing to switch to get in?

704
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:24,606
-Your pride won't allow it?
-You know it!

705
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,575
Because you won't beat your brothers?

706
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,846
Fail to get into UTokyo
because of stubborn pride

707
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:33,916
or get in, and stand
at the starting line that is UTokyo.

708
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:35,351
Which do you choose?

709
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:40,656
Fujii.

710
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:43,659
Stop living life
based on what others think.

711
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:46,628
No matter what
your parents or brothers say,

712
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,564
switching to Humanities is not shameful.

713
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,368
If someone laughs at you,
bring them to see me.

714
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:57,639
Okay?

715
00:42:57,706 --> 00:43:00,008
UTokyo is just the start.

716
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:04,046
It's not for someone else
or for acceptance.

717
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:05,914
Go to UTokyo for yourself!

718
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:10,919
It doesn't matter if it's the arts
or science. UTokyo is UTokyo!

719
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:12,721
Shed your shame and reputation.

720
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:15,424
Choose success. Stop at nothing.

721
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,561
I know you can do it.

722
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:22,197
Be confident.

723
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:37,379
Fujii.

724
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:40,949
I…

725
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:42,818
I'll quit Sciences 2,

726
00:43:44,386 --> 00:43:46,188
and test for Humanities 3.

727
00:43:46,255 --> 00:43:48,557
-Huh?
-Is that even possible?

728
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:50,192
English 80, math 60.

729
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:53,729
Fujii can get enough points
with English and math.

730
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:57,366
Literature 70, geography and history 50.

731
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:00,002
With that, he'll have
a passing score of 260.

732
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:02,271
But, studying for arts now?

733
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:07,576
Everyone, please.

734
00:44:07,643 --> 00:44:09,144
Huh? Fujii, what's going on?

735
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:11,847
Teach me literature and history.

736
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:21,023
If you'll have me,

737
00:44:23,926 --> 00:44:25,227
ask anytime.

738
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,199
You can borrow my history notes.

739
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:32,468
I can help with literature.

740
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:37,306
Fujii.

741
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:38,707
Well said.

742
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:40,576
Get what help you can.

743
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,045
Yes, sir.

744
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,082
Alright everyone, help him out.

745
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:48,283
Yes, sir.

746
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:07,970
HISTORY

747
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:09,938
NAO HAYASE

748
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,919
GET INTO UTOKYO!!

749
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:26,021
HUMANITIES 3

750
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:27,256
<i>I understand.</i>

751
00:45:27,322 --> 00:45:29,091
Alright, tomorrow it is.

752
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,927
That was the former chairman.

753
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:36,131
He's holding an emergency board meeting
tomorrow about selling the school.

754
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:39,334
We've got to fight to protect this school.

755
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:42,137
I'm ready. Are you, Mizuno?

756
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:43,605
Yes, Mr. Takahara.

757
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:46,074
Let's see what they've got first.

758
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:49,811
Mr. Sakuragi, Ms. Mizuno.
As the school's consulting lawyers,

759
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:51,780
could you come to the meeting?

760
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:54,049
Of course. Right, sir?

761
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,552
Whatever you say.

762
00:45:56,618 --> 00:45:59,955
Everyone,
for the students of Tatsumi Gakuen,

763
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:01,590
let's do all we can.

764
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:02,958
Yes, ma'am.

765
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,862
You're home.

766
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,097
Hey.

767
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:14,002
I bet you're hungry.

768
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,939
Is ramen okay? With extra pork.

769
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,874
Sure.

770
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:20,709
Okay.

771
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,378
<i>Is Seto okay?</i>

772
00:47:29,444 --> 00:47:31,346
Who knows.

773
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:34,116
-Sir!
-More importantly, you're ready?

774
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:37,285
No matter who comes,
I'll give them a smack-down.

775
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:39,454
I get to pull out all the stops!

776
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:44,559
I wonder what sort of dirty lawyer
they've got working for them?

777
00:47:53,935 --> 00:47:55,303
It's starting soon. Sit down.

778
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,271
Yes, ma'am.

779
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,245
They've arrived.

780
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:13,355
Sakuragi.

781
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:16,124
Do you think you can get five kids
into UTokyo?

782
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,694
Everyone's here.

783
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,228
Who is this?

784
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,431
They're leading the project.

785
00:48:22,497 --> 00:48:26,101
From Jager Corporation,
Mr. Matsubara and Mr. Kajitani.

786
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:29,671
Good to meet you.
I'm the project leader, Matsubara.

787
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:31,740
I'm Kajitani. Nice to meet you.

788
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,809
Please, have a seat.

789
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:38,513
Is this everyone?

790
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,684
No, I invited
my consultant lawyer to come.

791
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:44,252
Come in.

792
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,620
Pardon me.

793
00:48:52,928 --> 00:48:54,730
Ms. Kishimoto!

794
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,298
Ms. Mizuno. What's wrong?

795
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:58,033
Cat got your tongue?

796
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,368
What is going on?

797
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:02,437
Please, don't act so surprised.

798
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:07,109
The lawyer helping with
the purchase is you?

799
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:08,977
On that day…

800
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:10,512
This is a nice place.

801
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,014
Cape Taibusa is wonderful.

802
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:14,683
<i>You said you came here for work,</i>

803
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,885
but it wasn't a coincidence.

804
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:20,021
Yes. I began coming here regularly
long before you did.

805
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,456
On business.

806
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:26,128
Ah, yes, let me introduce
my two excellent assistants.

807
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:27,529
Come in.

808
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:36,872
Huh?!

809
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:38,140
Long time no see, <i>senpai</i>.

810
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:41,443
Sakamoto… why?

811
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,880
It's "President Sakamoto."
I've helped you out a lot.

812
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:45,981
Right, <i>sempai</i>?

813
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:48,350
You were one year apart
at Ryuzan, weren't you?

814
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:49,718
We were UTokyo classmates.

815
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:53,255
Long time no see.
Mr. Sakuragi. Ms. Mizuno.

816
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:56,191
Yoneyama too. Why are you here?

817
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:57,492
Oh, didn't I tell you?

818
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,227
We've teamed up with Ms. Kishimoto.

819
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,563
We're working on the IT for this project.

820
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,365
Yoneyama is helping me.

821
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:05,600
-He's really brilliant.
-You didn't tell me!

822
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,903
-Sorry about that.
-Since when?

823
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:10,438
Since before you two came.

824
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:14,676
So you knew all about
the sale from the beginning?

825
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:17,412
Mr. Sakuragi and I joined this school

826
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:19,381
and began helping with the rebuild.

827
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:20,715
You lied about supporting us?

828
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:22,617
I was just as surprised as you!

829
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:24,519
You asked for help finding Mr. Sakuragi.

830
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:27,656
I never guessed
the school you two were helping

831
00:50:27,722 --> 00:50:29,057
was this one!

832
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,460
What a coincidence!

833
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:35,564
You've been laughing
at us this whole time.

834
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,432
You even involved Yoneyama.

835
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:38,967
You misunderstand, Ms. Mizuno.

836
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,069
After the accident,

837
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:43,138
Mr. Sakamoto has helped me a lot.

838
00:50:43,872 --> 00:50:47,209
I finally got into UTokyo after two years
thanks to Mr. Sakamoto.

839
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:49,644
Unlike someone else I could mention.

840
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:52,380
I'm healthy and doing well now

841
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,449
thanks to Mr. Sakamoto and Ms. Kishimoto.

842
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:58,820
This is good real-world experience for me.

843
00:50:58,887 --> 00:50:59,988
What is this?

844
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:02,691
These past two years,
do you know how hard…

845
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,326
Can we begin?

846
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,696
Chairman, can we get down to business?

847
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,631
Yes.

848
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:11,366
Mr. Matsubara, go ahead.

849
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:15,403
Yes. I'm sure you already know.

850
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,907
We aim to start construction in 2022.

851
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,475
See here.

852
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:24,579
The red sections
are areas we've already acquired.

853
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,648
Ours is the only piece left.

854
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,250
I won't sell this school.

855
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:31,353
It's the last bastion for the community.

856
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,789
For the sake of the students,
we can't close the school.

857
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:36,024
Sorry.

858
00:51:36,091 --> 00:51:39,594
But if Mr. Sakuragi
gets five students into UTokyo,

859
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:41,930
I've heard you'll
have to leave this school.

860
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:43,899
-Right? Mr. Tatsuno.
-Yes.

861
00:51:43,965 --> 00:51:46,601
I'll make sure
you keep your promise, Kumiko.

862
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,637
I will keep my promise.

863
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:52,207
Of course you will get
five students in, won't you?

864
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:54,342
-Mr. Sakuragi.
-No.

865
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:57,412
It's seven.

866
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:02,484
All seven will get into UTokyo.

867
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:05,587
Did you hear that, Chairman?

868
00:52:06,187 --> 00:52:07,822
Time to stop acting foolish.

869
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:09,324
Why don't you admit defeat

870
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:12,160
and start getting ready to leave?

871
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,173
It's you who should
admit defeat and leave.

872
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,978
Ms. Kishimoto, I'm sure you're familiar
with the school's articles of endowment?

873
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:31,379
Yes, of course.

874
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,648
The Tatsumi Gakuen articles of endowment.

875
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:37,519
In other words, the basis
for operating this school.

876
00:52:37,585 --> 00:52:38,887
What are you saying?

877
00:52:39,854 --> 00:52:43,224
To think that this clause had been added.

878
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,226
I had no idea.

879
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:47,362
June 3, 2019.

880
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:51,366
Submitted to MEXT.
Additional clause article 6, paragraph 9.

881
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:52,367
It says this.

882
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:56,838
"Even if the chairman is elected
by a majority of the board of directors,

883
00:52:56,905 --> 00:53:01,309
if three-quarters of the teaching staff
file an objection,

884
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:05,013
it will be rejected."

885
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,482
If we… no.

886
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:12,520
<i>When</i> we get five or more
students into UTokyo,

887
00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:16,024
according to the contract,
Chairman Kumiko must quit.

888
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:19,694
Even if the previous chairman
is selected to be chairman,

889
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:24,866
according to this amendment,
if over three-quarters of staff say no,

890
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:26,334
it's a no-confidence vote.

891
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:31,139
All of the teachers
here are against the sale.

892
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:32,941
A chairman who wants to sell

893
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:35,610
will never be able to be chairman.

894
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:37,445
In other words, this school

895
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:39,848
will not be handed over to you.

896
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,487
When I was on business overseas,

897
00:53:45,553 --> 00:53:49,157
you went to all the trouble
to sneak the amendment in.

898
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:52,694
I guess you intended to use it
to unseat me as chairman

899
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:54,529
and quietly submitted the application.

900
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:58,433
And now I'm using it to have your neck.

901
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,101
You never thought of that?

902
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:01,569
Kumiko…

903
00:54:01,636 --> 00:54:04,739
Even if I am unseated as chairman,

904
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:08,276
if over three-quarters of teaching staff
are opposed,

905
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:12,180
you will never become chairman.

906
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:16,084
We will get seven students into UTokyo.

907
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:18,053
And we won't give up this school.

908
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:21,022
Mr. Sakamoto. No…

909
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:22,190
Sakamoto.

910
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,693
You betrayed us and that's serious.

911
00:54:26,294 --> 00:54:29,764
Yoneyama, you should
distance yourself from this case.

912
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:31,833
If you want to stay clean.

913
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:42,877
But I wonder.

914
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:45,547
Would over three-quarters of staff

915
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:48,283
choose your side?

916
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,052
Huh? Don't be ridiculous.

917
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,787
Right, Mr. Takahara?

918
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:02,030
Leave it to me.

919
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:07,535
Come in!

920
00:55:21,816 --> 00:55:26,087
If you're in favor of selling the school,
go to the former chairman.

921
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:29,791
If you're opposed,
stand with the current chairman.

922
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:30,692
Go ahead.

923
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:49,777
Mr. Takahara, didn't you get approval?

924
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:51,079
Oh, I did.

925
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:55,116
All of them approved my proposal.

926
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,058
Yes, yes.

927
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,294
That means…

928
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:09,063
Yes, just like me,

929
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,799
they approve the sale of the school.

930
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:16,404
-Huh?
-Vice Principal, what is this?

931
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:17,639
Oh, shut it.

932
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:19,741
I have always

933
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:21,543
hated you.

934
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:24,078
The thought of not seeing your face

935
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:25,413
gives me a thrill.

936
00:56:27,148 --> 00:56:28,783
Thanks, Mizuno.

937
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,386
I didn't know about that article.

938
00:56:31,452 --> 00:56:34,455
The plan was almost spoiled.

939
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:37,659
I'm lucky to have
such a smart former student.

940
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:38,693
Thanks.

941
00:56:40,228 --> 00:56:42,830
I found the clue to preventing
the sale of the school!

942
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:44,999
We can use this, Mizuno!

943
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:47,969
You were a traitor all along?

944
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:51,239
Yes.

945
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:54,809
This is bullshit!

946
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,979
-Oh!
-You always told everyone to work hard.

947
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,348
You pretended to support us.
That's a low blow.

948
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,016
Sakamoto. Yoneyama.

949
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,752
Did you forget
everything Mr. Sakuragi taught you?

950
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:09,257
Now, now. Don't get upset, Mizuno.

951
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:10,992
You got duped.

952
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:13,228
Anyway, I can't wait!

953
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:16,264
This is going to become a resort complex!

954
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,366
Schools don't make money anyway.

955
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:20,435
And we weren't even at capacity.

956
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:23,504
The world is money, money, money.

957
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:25,673
Listen, Mizuno. Remember this.

958
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:30,378
Those closest to you
are the most dangerous.

959
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,880
Didn't they teach you that at UTokyo?

960
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:36,951
You invited us to this school…

961
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:39,821
Yes. It was part of the plan all along.

962
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:42,090
I thought Mr. Sakuragi was a sure thing.

963
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:43,858
And then you came!

964
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:46,127
That wasn't part of the plan.

965
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:48,763
After all, you're
clearly out of your depth.

966
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,665
I was so worried.

967
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:54,002
But then Mr. Sakuragi came.

968
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:56,804
The students are well on their way.

969
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,274
Yes, yes, I'm so smart.

970
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:01,909
And that's that, Ms. Mizuno.

971
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:04,779
You are relieved from your post.
Dismissed.

972
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,147
Good night.

973
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:11,886
Alright, please continue, Ms. Kishimoto.

974
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:15,023
Thank you for your continued support,
Vice Principal Takahara.

975
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,859
Do your job properly to the end.

976
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:20,128
Mr. Sakuragi.

977
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:32,540
<i>It's not over.</i>

978
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:33,708
<i>There's still one more.</i>

979
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:35,176
<i>It has to be a complete victory.</i>

980
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:36,978
<i>I want to destroy them completely.</i>

981
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:38,179
I've invited a trusty guest.

982
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:39,414
Long time no see.

983
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,915
Huh?

984
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:42,450
<i>Aren't you embarrassed?</i>

985
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:44,485
I felt like I wasn't alone. Thanks.

986
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:46,421
<i>Alright, I'm off.</i>

987
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:48,690
<i>Dear god, let everyone pass.</i>

988
00:58:48,756 --> 00:58:49,757
<i>"Next year"?</i>

989
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:51,926
This moment will decide your future.

990
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:53,394
