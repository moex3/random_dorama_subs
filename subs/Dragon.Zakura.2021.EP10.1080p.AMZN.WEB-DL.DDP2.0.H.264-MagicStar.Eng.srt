1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,242
I've gotten you involved in a weird fight.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,411
I'm very sorry for that.

3
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,047
-I apologize.
-Stop that.

4
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,016
You were deceived as well.

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,817
I'm responsible for what happened.

6
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:20,154
Don't worry about me.
Just try to get everyone to pass.

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,422
Give it your all, please.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,190
I said this before, but

9
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,026
I will do so, without question.

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:29,764
Even so, I'm worried
about that boy Yoneyama.

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,768
He's your former student who
tried to commit suicide, isn't he?

12
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,137
But it really is okay, isn't it?

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,007
If we're going to crush my mentor,
it has to be a complete victory.

14
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,377
Me too. I want to destroy them completely.

15
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,979
That's a rough turn of phrase.

16
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,815
-You can't stop me.
-Listen here…

17
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,886
What bothers me is what Mr. Sakuragi
said before we left.

18
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,988
Kumiko. See you later.

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,857
I heard most residents were opposed.

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,393
Do you expect to get consent
from a majority?

21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,162
Mr. Matsubara.

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,832
We already have. That's why we're here.

23
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,334
<i>Mr. Matsubara. Is that true?</i>

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,569
Well?

25
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,272
That's what I said at the meeting.
Kajitani…

26
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,674
Residents in favor

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,676
are close to 50% now.

28
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,813
But we're struggling to get
the final 100 votes.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,714
One hundred votes…

30
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,850
With integrated resorts,

31
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:26,887
people hear about casinos and gambling
and it's an automatic rejection.

32
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,122
Sheesh!

33
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,623
I see.

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,859
I'll come up with a way to deal with that.

35
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,662
-Huh?
-Can you leave it to me?

36
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:36,964
Understood.

37
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,966
We mustn't delay.

38
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,736
We've got to use our ace in the hole.

39
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,938
What's that?

40
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:46,841
Hard cash.

41
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,610
Cash is best for times like this.
It can't be traced.

42
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,046
Giving cash to the opposing residents?

43
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,081
If it gets out, you'll lose your license.

44
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:56,917
Oh, I won't do it.
I'll just give the orders.

45
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,921
And I won't leave any trace
that I gave the orders.

46
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,324
Whoa, you're scary!

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,726
You don't want Ms. Kishimoto as an enemy.

48
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,529
Good thing we're on the same side.

49
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,265
We're lucky to have
connected with you, Mr. Takahara.

50
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,502
If the school sale goes well, by next year

51
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,504
you'll be a prefectural assembly member.

52
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,505
Is that right?

53
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,873
Yeah, well…

54
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,375
But Ms. Kishimoto, you're incredible.

55
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,677
If we succeed with this plan,

56
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,080
you'll be the legal adviser
for the resort.

57
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,450
-I see!
-Hey, this vote-getting.

58
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,985
You guys help too.

59
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,854
A young IT industry genius like you

60
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,824
could easily get their
personal information, no?

61
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,859
If they have debt.

62
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,795
Their income, their families,
their weaknesses!

63
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,732
Come on, I'm the president
of this company.

64
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,135
Let's use that to our advantage!

65
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,571
You'll be rewarded handsomely.

66
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,640
That sounds nice.

67
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:57,778
Now we just need five or more students
to get into UTokyo.

68
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,581
Iwai and Kohashi are out of the running.

69
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,083
Seto here has 620 points.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,252
He won't get in on his Common Test score.

71
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,255
At this point, these three are out.

72
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,159
There are six left. Fujii, Kosugi,
and Kenta Hara will be no problem.

73
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,029
Amano got 801 on the Common Test.

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,631
At this rate, he should pass.

75
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,302
This is an important
final month for our students.

76
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,971
We don't want them to have any regrets.

77
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,542
Ms. Mizuno, how much debt
does your office have?

78
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,344
Huh? Um…

79
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,748
-About ten million yen.
-Yeah? Alright.

80
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,550
I'll take care of that ten million.

81
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,919
But I can't allow you to…

82
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,421
You two

83
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,389
don't need to worry about a thing.

84
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,825
I want you to focus on the students.

85
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,729
I learned something in these ten months.

86
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,864
Thanks to you two,

87
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,000
the students have changed remarkably.

88
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,605
How many years has it been since
I saw students with such bright eyes?

89
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,340
Chairman…

90
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,443
Please.

91
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,713
Work a miracle for those children.

92
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,815
A miracle…

93
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,751
might just happen.

94
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,925
-Welcome!
-Welcome.

95
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,026
The usual.

96
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,594
Yes, sir.

97
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,499
Yum. Thanks.

98
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,776
Hey, why don't you say anything?

99
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,012
I just came for some ramen.

100
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,413
Most would say something.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,215
-What?
-You know…

102
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,183
You thought I came to stop you?

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,319
-No.
-Oh, good.

104
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,788
I've got no business with quitters.

105
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,524
Hey, hey, stop!

106
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,660
Who said I quit?

107
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,630
I told you. I'll take the exam again
next year with Kohashi and Iwai.

108
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,933
Isn't that called quitting?

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,369
"Next year"?
You haven't even seen the results.

110
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:07,641
You need at least 80% on the Common Test
to get into Humanities 3, don't you?

111
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,376
I got 620 points.

112
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,646
-I'm not even close.
-True.

113
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,481
You might not get into Humanities 3.

114
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,952
But you should try for Humanities 2.

115
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,254
Humanities 2?!

116
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,189
Looking at this year's applications,

117
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:26,460
the cutoff for Humanities 2
will probably be lower than Humanities 3.

118
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:30,097
You might be able to get in with your 620.

119
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,400
If you apply for Humanities 3
and fail the first round, you're out.

120
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,835
You'll be done.

121
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,771
You'll need a high secondary exam score
to get into Humanities 2,

122
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,741
but you can think about that
after the first round.

123
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,177
It's all or nothing. At least apply.

124
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,012
All or nothing…

125
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,880
What? What's wrong?

126
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,751
Even if you fail, you were going to
take it again next year!

127
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,119
It's the same either way.

128
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,954
I suppose that's true.

129
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,190
I've as good as failed.

130
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,558
Listen, Seto.

131
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,393
Hm?

132
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,162
This moment will decide your future.

133
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,366
Will you waste each day

134
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,102
or do your best to the last second?

135
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,505
Which do you choose? It's up to you.

136
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,240
See ya.

137
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:27,654
AKIRA SETO CHANGES FROM HUMANITIES 3 TO 2

138
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,991
AND ONE MORE PERSON

139
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:34,962
Sir.

140
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,966
Yeah? What's up?

141
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,003
After all,

142
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,938
I want to apply for Sciences 1.

143
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,142
You said it. "It's not for someone else."

144
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,344
"Go to UTokyo for yourself."

145
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,181
Those words stuck with me.

146
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:59,787
I always wanted to go into engineering
and build robots, so I chose UTokyo.

147
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,525
You told me to switch to Science 2,

148
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,093
and to Humanities, but…

149
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,931
If I'm going to UTokyo for myself,
I want to try for Science 1.

150
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,772
I'm just helping you
find the quickest path.

151
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,742
But there isn't one way to live life.

152
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,778
You can choose the difficult path.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,250
It's your life.

154
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,397
DAYS UNTIL THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

155
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,598
35.

156
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,947
DAYS UNTIL THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

157
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,450
COMMON TEST FOR UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS
RESULTS DAY

158
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:11,859
Huh?

159
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,929
Aw, c'mon!

160
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,200
-Akira!
-Huh?

161
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,337
Why do you put us through so much, Akira?!

162
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,639
-Guys…
-Keeping us in suspense.

163
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,907
What do you mean?

164
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,909
You passed the Common Test.

165
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,713
Huh? But I only got 620 points.

166
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,949
Exactly, it was 620 points!

167
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,151
The Common Test cutoff line!

168
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,120
Look! Humanities 2 is 620!

169
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,255
Huh?

170
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,424
Humanities 3 was 700 points,
just like he said.

171
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,326
You did it!

172
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,429
Yay! Yay!

173
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,866
Everyone gathered in front of the shop
and checked the announcement.

174
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,903
We were all worried about you
and we couldn't look alone.

175
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,771
-Even Fujii came.
-Huh?

176
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,608
I just came to eat ramen.

177
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,845
Aw, there you go again, Fujii baby.

178
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,848
DAYS UNTIL THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

179
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,186
DAYS UNTIL THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

180
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>It's tomorrow,</i>
<i>so I'm sure everyone's nervous.</i>

181
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,961
<i>They're probably pushing too hard,</i>
<i>getting too tense.</i>

182
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,364
Don't worry. I have just the thing.

183
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,670
What?!

184
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,484
Hey everyone, come in.

185
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,423
-Whoa!
-What?

186
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,327
-Isn't that…
-No way. Wow.

187
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,329
The actress Mari Kobayashi!

188
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,730
Hi.

189
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,566
Ogata works at
a multinational consulting firm.

190
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,635
Okuno is an engineer at Tokiwa Motors.

191
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,937
I'm sure you all know Kobayashi.

192
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,439
Why are celebrities here?

193
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,042
They're all my classmates
from Ryuzan High School.

194
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,878
Thanks to Mr. Sakuragi,
they all got into UTokyo.

195
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,247
They've all experienced the UTokyo exam.

196
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,083
They're here to give you advice.

197
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,785
This is a valuable opportunity.
Ask lots of questions!

198
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,888
-Whoa, seriously?
-Yay!

199
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,170
Alright? The UTokyo exam is no picnic.

200
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,941
People with over 800 on the Common Test
have been known to fail.

201
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,343
Please don't tell me that now.

202
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,414
Alright, what sort of student
makes it through? Fujii.

203
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,651
A student who can stay calm
and demonstrate their abilities?

204
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,854
That's right. But that's not all.

205
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,955
Okuno!

206
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,891
I guess it would be…

207
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,626
Luck, right?

208
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,727
Luck?

209
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,297
That's right. Students who have
luck on their side will pass.

210
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,832
How can anyone control that?

211
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,534
You're saying we should pray?

212
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,870
What are you saying? Everyone here

213
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,505
is already really lucky.

214
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:16,976
In your last year of high school,
you met Mr. Sakuragi and Ms. Mizuno.

215
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,513
You're the only students in Japan
who have that.

216
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,649
Oh yeah. You're right.

217
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,552
-We really are lucky.
-That's right.

218
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,790
Especially Seto, Hayase,
Iwasaki, Amano, and Kenta.

219
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,525
You already worked miracles.

220
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,428
Did you forget what terrible grades
you all had last April?

221
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,763
It has only been ten months.

222
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,533
You've got enough ability
to pass the Common Test.

223
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,435
If that's not a miracle, what is?

224
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:43,969
That's true.

225
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,137
I mean to say,

226
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,740
you can make miracles happen
anytime you want.

227
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,244
Listen. Tomorrow and the next day.

228
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,879
Just think about yourself.

229
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,981
You never know what will happen.

230
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,051
Don't think about other people.
Just focus on yourself.

231
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,121
-Alright?
-Yes, sir!

232
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,157
You can do it!

233
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,962
You can do it!

234
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,101
You can do it!

235
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,539
You can do it! You can do it!

236
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,179
THE DAY OF THE UTOKYO SECONDARY EXAM

237
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,548
<i>Please, let me win.</i>

238
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,421
Alright, I'm off.

239
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,824
Kaede. Your dad made these for you.

240
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,860
He said to take them to the exam.

241
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,295
Go say thank you.

242
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,731
Dad.

243
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,901
Thank you.

244
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,739
The Olympics are once in four years.
The UTokyo exam is every year.

245
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,276
Yeah.

246
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,250
Off I go.

247
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,819
HUMANITIES 3 EXAM HALL

248
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,388
<i>I've experienced this many times</i>
<i>in practice exams.</i>

249
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,891
<i>Yeah. I can do it like always.</i>

250
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,794
<i>Humanities 2 is full of scholars</i>
<i>like I figured.</i>

251
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,429
<i>Whoa, he seems confident.</i>

252
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,067
<i>She's fired up.</i>

253
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,703
Ah! I can't take it!

254
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,006
<i>Whoa, is he okay?</i>

255
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,675
<i>Now I think of it, I've got it easy.</i>

256
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,678
<i>I'll do it for real next year.</i>
<i>I won't get in this year.</i>

257
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,814
<i>It's just for the experience.</i>

258
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,350
<i>Ah, no, no!</i>
<i>My headache medicine isn't working!</i>

259
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,420
<i>I worked so hard to stay healthy.</i>

260
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,389
<i>I can't believe I'm sick on exam day.</i>

261
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,393
<i>I'm sure there are examinees here</i>
<i>who have seen my YouTube.</i>

262
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,729
<i>Oh yeah, I'll comment</i>
<i>my support to everyone.</i>

263
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,700
<i>-Why the rapping?</i>
<i>-This is all simple English!</i>

264
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,001
<i>Don't underestimate UTokyo!</i>

265
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:56,902
What is all this?

266
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:01,574
<i>Just like Dad said, even if I fail,</i>
<i>I can try again.</i>

267
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,375
<i>If I don't give up until I win,</i>

268
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,644
<i>this is not nearly as stressful as</i>

269
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,281
<i>once-in-a-lifetime events</i>
<i>like the Olympics or nationals.</i>

270
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,117
<i>Entrance exams are a game.</i>
<i>Mr. Sakuragi said so.</i>

271
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,487
<i>I can play a game with so many people!</i>
<i>This is fun.</i>

272
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,089
Yeah, fun!

273
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,695
Harada. Looks like we got the worst seats.

274
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,934
SCIENCES 1 EXAM HALL

275
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,470
Alright everyone, please begin.

276
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,311
<i>There. A rephrasing question.</i>

277
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,114
<i>Calm down and look it all over.</i>

278
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,418
<i>Think about what the question asking.</i>

279
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:50,122
<i>It's just like my teachers taught me.</i>
<i>It will be okay.</i>

280
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,324
<i>Whoa! Hey, hey!</i>

281
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
<i>This was a question in a past exam!</i>

282
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,794
<i>Lucky!</i>

283
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,531
<i>Eliminate unnecessary information.</i>
<i>Concisely.</i>

284
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,668
<i>I've never seen this question before!</i>
<i>This is fun!</i>

00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,904
Yeah, yeah!

286
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,387
Aiolocaria hexaspilota.

287
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,524
They are distributed from Hokkaido to
Kyushu, the most common Japanese ladybug.

288
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,625
In winter, they…

289
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,928
He's up to the same things
even on test day.

290
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,196
-Hey.
-You're all alone.

291
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,432
-We have to find your friends…
-Hey, Wobbly.

292
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,901
Hey, what are you doing?

293
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,336
Aiolocaria hexaspilota.

294
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,971
Huh? What's that?

295
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,241
Hunting for bugs at the UTokyo exam?

296
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,410
Are you mocking UTokyo?

297
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,212
I don't know how you got through
the Common Test.

298
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,581
<i>Tomorrow and the next day,</i>

299
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,050
just think about yourself.

300
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,852
You never know what will happen.
Don't think about other people.

301
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,321
Just focus on yourself.

302
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,323
You just can't stop wobbling, can you?

303
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,126
And what's up with your pencil grip?

304
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,728
Just focus on myself today.

305
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,996
Focus on myself.

306
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,031
Hey, are you listening?

307
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,933
Let go of that bug!

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,569
Quit making that noise! You worm!

309
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,438
Are you listening to me?

310
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,377
Hey! Hey! Knock it off!

311
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,246
-What are you doing?!
-Fujii.

312
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,214
Who are you?

313
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,918
The test was too hard
and you've gone funny? Just like this guy.

314
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,219
Right? What about that?

315
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,620
Hey! Stop it!

316
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,324
You don't know anything!
Don't make fun of my friend!

317
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,728
Jerks like you will never get into UTokyo!

318
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,530
You'll fail and Kenta will pass.

319
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,468
Huh? You make no sense. Let's go.

320
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,004
-Apologize to Kenta!
-What the hell?

321
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,010
Fujii! Are you okay?

322
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,212
Let's go. The test is starting.

323
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,414
-Show me your hand!
-I'm fine.

324
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,649
You're bleeding!

325
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,852
-Nurse's office!
-Kenta!

326
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,122
I've spent three years
getting ready for this day.

327
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,393
We can go to the nurse's office
after the exam.

328
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,163
More importantly, Kenta.

329
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,566
Did they bother you during the exam?

330
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,570
Excuse me. My friend

331
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,639
was sitting beside and in front of

332
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,608
two guys who bullied him during the exam.

333
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,644
If something happens in the next exam,
please say something.

334
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,713
Alright, I will.

335
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,349
More importantly, are you okay?

336
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,185
I'm fine. It's nothing.

337
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,888
Fujii!

338
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,657
Thank you.

339
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,539
What are you two doing?!

340
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,075
Oh, nothing.

341
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,445
If you do anything more,
you'll be asked to leave.

342
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,747
Yes, sir.

343
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,886
It's okay.

344
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,412
THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO
EXAM RESULTS DAY

345
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,563
Isn't it time to go?

346
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,198
Yeah.

347
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,766
Hey, Yuta.

348
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,670
Those YouTube hate comments…

349
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,405
Don't worry about them.

350
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,077
It was you and Mom, wasn't it?
Replying to them.

351
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,547
<i>Don't worry about these comments!</i>

352
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,416
<i>I support you! I hope you pass!</i>
<i>Do your best!</i>

353
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>I saw them and I felt like I wasn't alone.</i>

354
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,189
<i>Thanks to you two,</i>
<i>I did my best to the very end.</i>

355
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,258
Thanks.

356
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,096
Selling Tatsumi Gakuen within the year.

357
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,964
Our plans are finally moving forward.

358
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:30,402
Yes, they'll start once we see
five students get into UTokyo.

359
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,603
-Takahara.
-Yes, sir.

360
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,574
-It's alright, isn't it?
-Yes, I'm sure they'll do it.

361
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,376
The online announcement will be up soon.

362
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,247
-Let's all hold hands.
-Okay.

363
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,715
I'm sure everyone got in.

364
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,118
Yeah, everyone got in.

365
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,354
Yeah, got in.

366
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,957
Yeah.

367
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,692
-Yeah.
-Okay…

368
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,328
Let's go.

369
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,900
Let's meet here when we're done.

370
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,175
Dear god, let everyone pass.

371
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,144
-Well? Did it load?
-Not yet.

372
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,679
Why won't it load?

373
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,814
We should've gone to see it in person.

374
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,483
No. That's for the students.

375
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,987
It loaded! Mine loaded!

376
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,527
First is Kosugi.

377
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,861
Her number is

378
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>A30438.</i>

379
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,346
<i>It's there…</i>

380
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,249
Kosugi passed!

381
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,220
Thank goodness! That's great!

382
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,025
MARI KOSUGI

383
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,827
First one.

384
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,829
Who else is in Humanities 3?

385
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,799
-It's Hayase.
-Her number is A31120.

386
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>Seto didn't get in…</i>

387
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,579
<i>But I know I did.</i>

388
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,483
<i>I was born lucky after all.</i>

389
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,130
<i>Hayase didn't get in.</i>

390
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,164
It's not here.

391
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,700
Hayase…

392
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,605
Next. How about Kenta?

393
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,676
Sciences 2. His number is

394
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,644
<i>A51412.</i>

395
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,383
<i>I can't get through. Can't get through.</i>

396
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,386
<i>I can't get through…</i>

397
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,796
<i>51412… 51412…</i>

398
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,765
<i>51412. Where? Where?</i>

399
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,568
<i>51412… 51412…</i>

400
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,172
It's there! Mari!

401
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,708
Yeah! Kenta Hara.

402
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,142
He got in!

403
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,347
Thank goodness!

404
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,349
Thank you very much!

405
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,054
That's our Kenta!

406
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,392
How can you traitors live it up…

407
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,894
-It's okay.
-But…

408
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,831
Maybe they were dissatisfied
with the way I ran the school.

409
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,467
But they care a lot about the students.

410
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,337
All the teachers at
this school are our comrades.

411
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,873
Chairman…

412
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,675
Who's next in Sciences 2?

413
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,510
Amano and Iwasaki.

414
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,214
-First, Amano…
-50174…

415
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,350
A50174.

416
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:19,558
A…50174.

417
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,094
I did it…

418
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:25,731
I did it…

419
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,601
I did it!

420
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:02,234
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

421
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,603
<i>Amano got in!</i>

422
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:06,939
<i>Congratulations.</i>

423
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,578
<i>Dad, Mom.</i>

424
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:15,847
<i>God of Badminton.</i>

425
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:19,618
<i>Please… let me get in.</i>

426
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:28,760
<i>It's there… It's there!</i>

427
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,262
<i>It's there!</i>

428
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,700
<i>Iwasaki got in! That's four!</i>

429
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,705
Iwasaki…

430
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,743
She did well, Iwasaki. Alright!

431
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,813
She's Olympic material in badminton.

432
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,514
Four students from that school?

433
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:53,785
-That's impressive.
-Sakuragi's no joke.

434
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:56,588
<i>Former Chairman, that's four.</i>
<i>We can relax now.</i>

435
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,557
<i>It's still only four. Don't relax yet.</i>

436
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,827
<i>Last is our shoo-in, Fujii. He'll get in.</i>

437
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,896
-The last science student is Fujii.
-Yes.

438
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,432
<i>Sciences 1. Examinee number</i>

439
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,569
<i>A41811.</i>

440
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:30,822
Fujii's number…

441
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:32,257
It wasn't there.

442
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,227
I see.

443
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:40,766
In just one moment,

444
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:44,936
the plan we've worked on for over a year
just went up in smoke.

445
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,106
Someone will pay.

446
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:53,111
Fujii.

447
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:59,751
Mari! Mari, Mari.

448
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:03,989
I got in! I got into UTokyo!

449
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:06,124
-You too?
-Yeah!

450
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,327
-That's great, Kenta!
-Yeah, yeah.

451
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:10,862
Congratulations.

452
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:12,297
The same school again.

453
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,732
Yeah.

454
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,468
Hey, Wobbly.

455
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,070
Hey, Worm.

456
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:20,572
What's this? You got in?

457
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:23,608
-Come here.
-Hey, stop that.

458
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,509
Shut up!

459
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,944
Kenta…

460
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,879
Go on! Hey!

461
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:31,016
You were such a nuisance and you passed?

462
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,318
-Screw you!
-Stop that!

463
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,619
Out of the way!

464
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,324
Hey!

465
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:44,696
Kohashi? Iwai?

466
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:52,337
So you're the ones
who doted on our sweet Kenta.

467
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,639
I heard you looked after him
during the exam!

468
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,511
-What do you think you're doing?
-I, uh…

469
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,080
And? Did you guys get in?

470
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,683
Hey, how'd you do?

471
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:09,788
Oh yeah? You failed?

472
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,523
I figured!

473
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,960
You two will never get into UTokyo!
Get lost!

474
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,229
Never come back!

475
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:22,367
Kohashi, Iwai. Wow…

476
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:26,304
Four students getting into UTokyo
from our school is a miracle!

477
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:29,875
And now the chairman
doesn't have to step down.

478
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:32,144
The school won't be sold!

479
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,946
Hip hip hooray, right?

480
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,081
Okuda.

481
00:27:36,148 --> 00:27:37,315
It's not over.

482
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:39,451
There's still one more.

483
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,387
Oh. Akira didn't get in either.

484
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,157
Yeah, he looked like he failed.

485
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:47,125
He must have also gone home in shock.

486
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:49,060
Oh, Seto!

487
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:52,197
Hey, Akira! What are you doing?

488
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,933
For next year. I looked around UTokyo.

489
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,235
-So you…
-Yeah.

490
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:01,640
I failed so badly, it wasn't even close.
I couldn't even find the first number.

491
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:08,146
Oh! Weren't you looking
at the Humanities 3 board?

492
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:09,047
Yeah.

493
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,019
Seto, you tested for Humanities 2!

494
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,222
-Oh.
-Don't say "Oh."

495
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,391
Humanities 2 starts with "A2."

496
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:21,693
Of course it's not in Humanities 3!
Let's go!

497
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,595
-Whoa!
-Let's go! Let's go!

498
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,233
Isn't it over there?

499
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,668
Why look? It's not there.

500
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:33,371
You never know. What's your number?

501
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:35,807
-A20503!
-Sorry, excuse me.

502
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,108
Pardon me.

503
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,676
Excuse me.

504
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:56,894
It's there…

505
00:28:58,229 --> 00:28:59,330
It's there!

506
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,736
It's there!

507
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:08,673
Look carefully. Your number's there!

508
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,776
No mistake. You got in.

509
00:29:11,843 --> 00:29:13,678
Seto got in!

510
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:15,780
You got in!

511
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:18,950
Seto, you got in! Yay!

512
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:22,086
-Congratulations.
-Hooray!

513
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:25,089
I got in…

514
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,759
Me, at UTokyo…

515
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,328
I'm a UTokyo student!

516
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,665
Seto…

517
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,300
He passed!

518
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,011
Thank you very much!

519
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,522
Seto passed.

520
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:58,856
There we go!

521
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:20,578
-Hooray! Hooray!
-Man.

522
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,648
I never thought Seto would get in
and I'd fail.

523
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,249
What a plot twist!

524
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:28,619
Just kidding.

525
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,156
I should have known.

526
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:34,692
I never worked hard in my life.

527
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,427
No matter how hard I worked,

528
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:37,829
it didn't mean much anyway.

529
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,331
That's not true.

530
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,401
Nao, you worked really hard.

531
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,739
-Maybe…
-You worked hard!

532
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,513
You really worked hard.

533
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,084
Yeah…

534
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:03,654
I'm glad I worked hard with you.

535
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,571
Fujii!

536
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,640
You're late.

537
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:24,642
Sorry.

538
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:25,610
Sit down.

539
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:37,622
Amano, Iwasaki.

540
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,324
Kosugi, Kenta.

541
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,759
Seto.

542
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,661
Congratulations.

543
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:47,999
You grabbed that passing ticket
with your own hands.

544
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:49,867
How you use it is up to you.

545
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:54,238
You can go to UTokyo and pursue your goals

546
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:58,476
or use the confidence you got from passing
to find a new dream.

547
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,478
I've taught you all I can.

548
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:03,080
You can do what you want.

549
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:04,715
Yes, sir.

550
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:07,285
And the two of you who failed.

551
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,587
Fujii, Hayase.

552
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:12,223
-You two…
-Don't say any more.

553
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,026
I did have confidence.

554
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:18,963
I felt like I did way better
than the practice exams.

555
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,132
I'm

556
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,501
really,

557
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,637
really frustrated.

558
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:30,908
I've never been so frustrated
about anything in my whole life.

559
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:34,412
I never knew I had this emotion in me.

560
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:38,316
I had no idea.

561
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:43,521
If I never tried for UTokyo,

562
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,723
I probably never would have known.

563
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:52,029
I'm really glad I tried for UTokyo.

564
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:57,568
Mr. Sakuragi.

565
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:00,504
Ms. Mizuno.

566
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:03,307
Thank you very much.

567
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:10,715
Fujii.

568
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:13,351
Something to say?

569
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:18,689
After I saw the announcement,
I went straight home.

570
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,224
Then

571
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:22,893
I kneeled and begged my parents.

572
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:24,895
Kneeled?

573
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:28,132
I begged them to let me
take the UTokyo exam again next year.

574
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,334
I'll repeat my third year.

575
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:34,638
I asked them to let me study
with the UTokyo Special Course.

576
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,540
I'll admit it.

577
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,243
I'm an idiot.

578
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:44,382
I was always mocked by my parents
and my brothers.

579
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,685
I wanted to prove them wrong
and worked really hard,

580
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,322
but now

581
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:55,860
I don't care what my family says.

582
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:57,161
Fujii.

583
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:01,065
You idiot!

584
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,235
During your important secondary exam,

585
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,070
you hurt your wrist

586
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,305
to help Kenta.

587
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:12,009
I heard from Kenta.

588
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:15,946
I knew something happened to Kenta, but

589
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,518
Fujii, you rescued him?

590
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,821
When Fujii protected me,

591
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,423
he hurt his right hand.

592
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:28,692
-Is it my fault?
-No.

593
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:33,297
That day, when I helped you…

594
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,500
I was…

595
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:41,539
I was…

596
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,543
so happy.

597
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,582
The way I was before,
I never would have helped.

598
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,086
But I was able to go help him.

599
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:58,089
I…

600
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,492
I was able to become that person.

601
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,762
I was so, so happy.

602
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,633
After that, during the test,
I got worked up.

603
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,772
But I have no regrets.

604
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,842
Kenta, don't worry about it.

605
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:24,748
I told you to just think about yourself.

606
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,853
You huge idiot!

607
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:32,456
Even so,

608
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,926
with how you are now,
you'll get in next time.

609
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,597
It's a sure thing.

610
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:44,135
You said it. A sure thing.

611
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:46,270
I said it.

612
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,472
I'll bet on it if you want.

613
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,774
Bring it on!

614
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:54,078
Okay Fujii, it'll be us four.

615
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:56,347
We're Team UTokyo Special Course
next year.

616
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,415
Yeah, let's do it together!

617
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:01,152
You guys will need
two more years, I figure!

618
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:04,021
Don't say that.

619
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:07,725
Yeah. We're sure to get in next year.

620
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,859
Right, Hayase?

621
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,761
Well…

622
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:12,496
About that,

623
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:13,531
I'm good.

624
00:36:14,098 --> 00:36:15,065
Huh?

625
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,135
What are you saying?
Are you giving up again?

626
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,970
No. It's just…

627
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:23,007
I never told anyone about this, but…

628
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:25,609
I actually…

629
00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:30,548
I got into the School of Business
at Aoyama Gakuin.

630
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,383
-Huh?
-What?

631
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:36,453
-He he.
-Don't say "he he."

632
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,422
Hey, I never heard about that either!

633
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,591
Sorry, I forgot to mention it.

634
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,259
What? You took the exam?

635
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,360
For Aoyama Gakuin?

636
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:47,765
I mean, I used my Common Test results.
I just put in my application.

637
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,700
So I didn't have to go to the exam.

638
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,136
And I got in, so…

639
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:55,906
What? Tell us sooner…

640
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,641
You're clever!

641
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,743
With my personality,

642
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,980
could I repeat a year
to study and try again?

643
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:05,015
I'm not confident I could.

644
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:09,920
I never really felt like
it had to be UTokyo anyway.

645
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:15,392
I wanted to be a person
who could work hard.

646
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:18,329
So when Kaede

647
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:21,031
said "Nao, you worked hard,"

648
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:25,302
I felt like it was all worth it.

649
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,340
Using the Common Test
to apply for a private university.

650
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:32,643
-I'm sorry.
-Why do you need to apologize?

651
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,812
You researched it yourself
and took action.

652
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:37,681
You didn't let another choose your life.

653
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:41,218
You thought carefully and chose your path.

654
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,254
Be proud.

655
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:45,222
Yes, sir.

656
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,759
So, next year it will be us three
left at this school.

657
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:50,027
Yeah.

658
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,630
We're counting on you, sir!

659
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:56,267
But, this school… Next year…

660
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,301
Mizuno.

661
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:59,470
-But…
-What? What?

662
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:00,971
What's happening next year?

663
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,775
Hey, I heard from a customer.

664
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,945
This place might be turned into a resort.

665
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,514
Hey, what are you saying?

666
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,518
You mean the school will be gone?
What'll happen to us?

667
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:17,588
Ms. Mizuno. Mr. Sakuragi.

668
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:18,956
They're here.

669
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:39,510
Kumiko, you promised.

670
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:43,147
Right here and now, resign as chairman.

671
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:48,185
Can't you hear me? Kumiko, resign.

672
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:51,488
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise.

673
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:55,426
Poor thing… Because of the students
you love, you have to quit.

674
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:56,727
The students did well.

675
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:00,998
I am proud of their hard work.

676
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:05,436
Is that right? Now,
please sign the paperwork.

677
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,382
Yes, now it's official.

678
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:21,285
Kumiko Tatsuno is no longer
chairman of this school.

679
00:39:21,352 --> 00:39:25,756
The former chairman has recommended me
for the position.

680
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,892
Can I get a show of approval
from the board?

681
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,594
Please raise your hands.

682
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:35,399
Yes, three for, one against.

683
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:39,870
In following, I, Takahara,
am now the chairman.

684
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:41,905
Thank you everyone.

685
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:43,307
You snake!

686
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:47,344
I'd like to put forward
an emergency motion.

687
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:51,081
Those in favor of selling the school,
raise your hand.

688
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,986
So it's decided.

689
00:39:56,053 --> 00:40:00,591
Now we have officially decided
to sell Tatsumi Gakuen.

690
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:01,458
Takahara.

691
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,894
Could you call me "Chairman?"

692
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:05,095
You're the worst.

693
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:08,899
You said you couldn't forgive selling it
for money, and now look at you.

694
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:12,736
You're talking like I'm the bad guy,
but it's a misunderstanding.

695
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:14,872
Listen. Through this decision,

696
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,074
all the local residents will profit.

697
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:21,078
They should call us their saviors.

698
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:23,781
Right?

699
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,520
Saviors? That's a good one. A masterpiece.

700
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:30,788
I know, right?

701
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,023
Yeah.

702
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:37,694
Hm? Okay, that's enough.

703
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,664
That's enough.

704
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:43,534
Sorry, it was just so funny.

705
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:46,503
I mean,

706
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,773
you buy the votes of the
opposing residents with cash

707
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,209
and now you say this!

708
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:56,647
What do you mean?

709
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,749
What… that's unfounded…

710
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:00,350
That's rich, coming from you!

711
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:03,854
What are you two saying?!

712
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,489
Enough fooling around!

713
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:06,723
Shut up.

714
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,559
-Yoneyama.
-Yes, sir.

715
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,264
<i>We mustn't delay.</i>

716
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:17,367
<i>We've got to use our ace in the hole.</i>

717
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,770
<i>-What's that?</i>
<i>-Hard cash.</i>

718
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:22,439
<i>Cash is best for times like this.</i>
<i>It can't be traced.</i>

719
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,374
<i>-I see.</i>
<i>-Yeah, but.</i>

720
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,976
<i>Giving cash to the opposing residents?</i>

721
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:28,045
<i>If it gets out, you'll lose your license.</i>

722
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,881
<i>Oh, I won't do it.</i>
<i>I'll just give the orders.</i>

723
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:34,852
<i>And I won't leave any trace</i>
<i>that I gave the orders.</i>

724
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:36,787
<i>Whoa, you're scary!</i>

725
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:39,122
Ms. Kishimoto, what is this?

726
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:41,358
It's a misunderstanding!

727
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:44,595
We would never buy off the residents.

728
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:46,563
Yes. How could we?

729
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,400
Wow, with this much evidence,
can you really say that?

730
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,235
Huh?

731
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,738
<i>This is for you.</i>

732
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:00,477
<i>What is this?</i>

733
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:04,381
<i>I hope you will vote in favor</i>
<i>of building the resort.</i>

734
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,683
<i>Thank you in advance.</i>

735
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,520
What should I do?
I could send it to the news right now.

736
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:12,122
What will the world think of this?

737
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:15,325
What are you saying?
You're just as guilty.

738
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,794
You used personal information
without permission.

739
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:20,063
-You gave it to us!
-Oh, that?

740
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,999
The information I gave you was fake.

741
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:25,869
I'd never do such a dangerous thing!

742
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,571
No…

743
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:28,772
Too bad!

744
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,941
You, a legal adviser for the resort?

745
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,143
Say goodbye to your lawyer's license.

746
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,046
And Takahara, your seat
as a prefectural assembly member?

747
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:36,947
Up in smoke.

748
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:39,816
Takahara!

749
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,253
Give me a break, you jerk!

750
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,657
You couldn't be
a politician or an educator.

751
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:50,627
You're completely unacceptable! You rat!

752
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:56,400
Hang on, you guys were taking
these videos, which means

753
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:58,302
you were on our side from the start?

754
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:02,739
Since when?

755
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:07,110
Did you know all of this?

756
00:43:07,177 --> 00:43:09,446
You all ganged up to frame me?

757
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:12,182
Sir, did you know?

758
00:43:12,249 --> 00:43:14,384
Huh? How would I know?

759
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:17,321
But I did get a feeling.

760
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:21,258
They're my former students after all.

761
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:24,528
The e-mail about buying
the land around the school

762
00:43:24,595 --> 00:43:27,898
sent by an anonymous account.
You're the only one who would do that.

763
00:43:27,965 --> 00:43:30,667
Impressive as usual, Mr. Sakuragi.
You saw it all.

764
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,270
We wanted to do it as a surprise for you.

765
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,605
What are you saying?

766
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:37,808
We've been working on this for two years.

767
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:39,810
Trying to find the one who trapped you.

768
00:43:40,644 --> 00:43:42,713
Right before my exam, two years ago.

769
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:45,682
I got several e-mails from Mr. Sakuragi.

770
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:49,519
"You're no good. You won't pass."
Over and over.

771
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:52,122
Huh? I never send e-mails to students.

772
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:53,056
Yeah.

773
00:43:53,857 --> 00:43:56,493
It wasn't you sending those e-mails.

774
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:02,032
It was Ms. Kishimoto. Wasn't it?

775
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,503
I thought it was odd,
so I asked Mr. Sakamoto to look into it.

776
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,873
<i>And I learned that it was sent by you.</i>

777
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,743
At the time, I didn't know that.

778
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,646
I believed Mr. Sakuragi sent them
and I was freaking out.

779
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:16,980
Sir!

780
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,549
<i>Thus, he failed</i>
<i>and tried to commit suicide.</i>

781
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,984
<i>Not only that.</i>

782
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,119
In the commotion,

783
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:24,321
the news reported
things that weren't true.

784
00:44:24,388 --> 00:44:26,323
Mr. Sakuragi disappeared.

785
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,858
It was really odd.

786
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:32,295
The news wasn't accurate, but it was
very specific about internal matters.

787
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:35,132
It could only be an insider
leaking information.

788
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:38,468
Someone who was against Mr. Sakuragi.

789
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:41,805
And not long after that,
Sakuragi Law Office

790
00:44:41,872 --> 00:44:44,141
was completely taken over by you.

791
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,143
Don't say such scandalous things.

792
00:44:46,777 --> 00:44:50,881
I just made my best judgment
as manager of the office.

793
00:44:51,448 --> 00:44:55,052
He didn't do the education consulting work
the nation wanted him for

794
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,921
and didn't generate the profit he could.

795
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,323
-That sort of person is unnecessary!
-Huh?

796
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,728
For the office? For the profits?
What platitudes are you spouting?

797
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,964
You think I'll accept excuses like that?

798
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:10,500
I feel bad for you.

799
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,737
I didn't expect you
to try to commit suicide.

800
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:17,007
-But I…
-Shut up!

801
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:20,877
Do you know what I went through
because of you?

802
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:23,680
Not just me. You turned Mr. Sakuragi's
life upside down.

803
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,583
I said it already, didn't I?

804
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,318
You can't stop me.

805
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:37,461
Not until I've destroyed you completely.

806
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,537
You really did all that.

807
00:45:47,604 --> 00:45:51,575
You can't complain
even if all this proof gets out.

808
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:53,477
What do you say, sir?

809
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:56,713
We can leak everything
to the press right now.

810
00:45:57,447 --> 00:45:59,850
Leave it at this, Yoneyama.

811
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:04,387
Why? I've worked for two years at this.

812
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:05,422
That's why.

813
00:46:06,523 --> 00:46:07,524
It's for you.

814
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:10,827
I understand why you want to crush her.

815
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:15,265
But revenge doesn't make anyone happy.

816
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:20,470
Success gained from trapping someone
is empty success.

817
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:23,206
If you've watched Kishimoto
for two years, you know.

818
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:25,909
I don't care what happens to Kishimoto.

819
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,778
People like her will fail eventually.

820
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:31,181
But I don't want you
to go down the same path.

821
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:33,550
Look forward, Yoneyama.

822
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,686
You must live your own life.

823
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:46,329
It's like he said.

824
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:49,332
If she starts something else,
I'll send this out.

825
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:57,941
Nonsense!

826
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,778
I've had enough of this farce.

827
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:06,183
It doesn't matter if this gets out.
We're still selling.

828
00:47:06,249 --> 00:47:10,453
At any rate, Kumiko has stepped down.

829
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,521
Stop right there.

830
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:14,157
I never knew this was going on.

831
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:16,626
What are you saying?

832
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:19,663
You said you'd leave the methods to us!

833
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,599
Not only did you buy out the residents,

834
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,501
you tricked the chairman

835
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:28,004
and forced the deal
without thinking of the students.

836
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:29,406
Your methods are too devious.

837
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:34,277
As the project leader,
I cannot proceed further.

838
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:37,480
I'll report this incident to my company.

839
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:39,783
Good day.

840
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:41,952
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

841
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:44,187
Hey! Wait!

842
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:45,922
Stop!

843
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,524
-Father.
-Shut up!

844
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:49,993
Not the daughter card now!

845
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,063
This happened because
you don't do what I say!

846
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,397
Now look at this!

847
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:58,602
Educational background
really doesn't matter.

848
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,838
Everyone around me

849
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:04,608
has amazing educations

850
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,043
and they're all useless, lazy idiots!

851
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,511
That's not true.

852
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,983
Of everyone here,
the most useless and lazy

853
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:14,084
is you.

854
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,218
What?

855
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:18,154
You make decisions
based on short-term business conditions.

856
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:20,290
You tried to sell
while the price was high.

857
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:21,591
Shut up!

858
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:23,059
This school

859
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:26,263
was a terminal case with two years left.

860
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:30,634
My idiot daughter can't turn it around.

861
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:33,670
-That's why…
-You understand nothing.

862
00:48:34,304 --> 00:48:36,206
If you thought about the long-term value,

863
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:38,408
you wouldn't have done
such a stupid thing.

864
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:43,246
Plus, your daughter
may have made mistakes.

865
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:45,715
But she was a good chairman.

866
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:50,754
The pillar of the school
doesn't need management skills.

867
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:53,323
It's strong beliefs as an educator

868
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,526
keeping the teachers and students in mind.

869
00:48:57,527 --> 00:49:00,363
Management can be left to someone else.

870
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:03,333
But to support and protect the school,

871
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,835
the top person must
have steadfast beliefs.

872
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:08,371
Chairman Kumiko had that.

873
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:14,744
If you can just step out of the way,
this school can be rebuilt.

874
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:18,782
Preposterous.

875
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:22,319
Stop.

876
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:26,256
I may have been naive.

877
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:28,458
My methods were certainly wrong.

878
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,560
But watch.

879
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:34,064
I will rebuild this school.

880
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:50,647
<i>Mr. Sakuragi, Ms. Oink. Long time no see.</i>

881
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:54,250
<i>Actually I heard from</i>
<i>Sakamoto and Yoneyama</i>

882
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,086
<i>and I've been helping them all along.</i>

883
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:56,987
FROM YUSUKE YAJIMA

884
00:49:57,053 --> 00:50:01,257
<i>Two years ago, Kishimoto bullied Yoneyama</i>

885
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:03,860
<i>in a plan to eliminate Mr. Sakuragi.</i>

886
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:06,763
<i>But there was no proof</i>
<i>of what Kishimoto did.</i>

887
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,699
<i>So these two infiltrated Kishimoto</i>

888
00:50:09,766 --> 00:50:11,901
<i>and waited for her to slip up.</i>

889
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:16,039
<i>That's why, Oink, don't be mad</i>
<i>that they kept it from you.</i>

890
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,274
<i>You're close to Kishimoto</i>
<i>so they kept quiet.</i>

891
00:50:19,442 --> 00:50:23,446
<i>There was one more person</i>
<i>helping from the shadows.</i>

892
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:26,349
<i>They'll come to visit you soon.</i>

893
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:27,984
<i>Say hi for me when they come.</i>

894
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:31,755
-Thank you.
-Sir.

895
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,228
Another message?

896
00:50:38,895 --> 00:50:40,797
<i>You should go to the staff room.</i>

897
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:43,066
<i>It's about time for my plan to bear fruit.</i>

898
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:44,000
Ah.

899
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:54,044
Yes, it was our UTokyo Special Course
that produced five successful applicants.

900
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,146
What? Applying for the new school year?

901
00:50:56,212 --> 00:50:58,782
Thank you. Yes, that's right.

902
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:02,385
Ah, yes. You can find that on our website.

903
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,056
What is happening?

904
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:09,259
-What's all this?
-I planted this.

905
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,960
Yajima-<i>senpai</i> told me to.

906
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,395
FIVE TATSUMI STUDENTS ACCEPTED TO UTOKYO

907
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:15,031
Next year they'll have
a full class for sure.

908
00:51:15,098 --> 00:51:18,068
Didn't you say
you'd get a five-year contract?

909
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,336
You've got work to do.

910
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:23,773
Things will get busy
at the UTokyo Special Course.

911
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:29,879
-Well. Maybe I should help out.
-Yeah.

912
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:42,625
ONE WEEK LATER

913
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:44,761
<i>So when is this mystery person coming?</i>

914
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:46,996
The other helper that Yajima mentioned.

915
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,899
They'll show up eventually.

916
00:51:53,036 --> 00:51:56,072
So it was you who helped out.

917
00:51:57,674 --> 00:52:01,077
I just lent them a system
that I developed.

918
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:02,245
Legally, of course.

919
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:05,415
Sorry to take up your time, Kosaka.

920
00:52:07,117 --> 00:52:09,252
It's for the youths with a future.

921
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:10,854
Also…

922
00:52:11,688 --> 00:52:14,457
I wanted to repay you a little.

923
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:18,828
-Yoshino!
-Naomi!

924
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:20,930
-Long time no see!
-How are you?

925
00:52:20,997 --> 00:52:22,632
I'm good!

926
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:24,134
That's amazing. Five people?

927
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,437
-Yes, five!
-That's great! You worked hard.

928
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:30,874
-It was hard!
-I'm glad you're well.

929
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,609
Thank you.

930
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,315
GRADUATION DAY

931
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:42,152
Good morning.

932
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,787
Huh? The tent is gone.

933
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:48,024
-Oh yeah. Sir, did you move?
-I guess.

934
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,160
You can pay your rent now.

935
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:52,028
Good for you.

936
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,131
Just like you guys, I'm graduating.

937
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:57,433
-You're joking.
-What are you saying?

938
00:52:59,836 --> 00:53:02,372
Huh? Really?

939
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:04,073
What do you mean?

940
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,610
Mr. Sakuragi,
are you quitting this school?

941
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:09,078
Yeah.

942
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,080
Ms. Mizuno, is that true?

943
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:19,289
Give me a break. I can't accept that.

944
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:20,924
You promised!

945
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,259
Yeah. You're leaving us here?

946
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:26,663
You're getting us into UTokyo, right?
We postponed graduation!

947
00:53:26,729 --> 00:53:29,465
Kohashi. Iwai.

948
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:32,001
You'll be okay.

949
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:36,472
You grew so much in just a few months.

950
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:40,543
You're like dry sponges,
sucking up knowledge.

951
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,278
Your strength is

952
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,348
your sincerity.

953
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:49,085
You will definitely
get into UTokyo next year.

954
00:53:49,152 --> 00:53:50,153
Believe in Mizuno.

955
00:53:52,455 --> 00:53:53,456
You too, Fujii.

956
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,027
You have everything you need to win.

957
00:53:58,661 --> 00:54:02,165
Don't give up. Keep going. You'll get it.

958
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:09,372
I, I… I wanted to study
with you some more.

959
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:10,506
Kenta.

960
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:13,309
You'll be a UTokyo student!

961
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,614
You'll study at UTokyo.

962
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:19,849
Go and become a good researcher.

963
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:23,920
I know you'll build a future where
people and insects can live together.

964
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:25,955
Yeah…

965
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:31,995
-Kosugi.
-Yes, sir.

966
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:35,031
Never again hold back because of another!

967
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:39,202
You can build any future you want.

968
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:40,903
Yes, sir.

969
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:44,207
Amano.

970
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:46,476
Yes, sir.

971
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:49,479
You're bolder than you realize.

972
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,982
Don't be afraid of mistakes.
Jump in without hesitation.

973
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,019
Yes, sir.

974
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,721
Iwasaki.

975
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:04,327
With your grit, you can achieve any goal.

976
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:08,398
I'm looking forward to the Olympics.

977
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:11,934
Yes, sir.

978
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:14,604
Hayase.

979
00:55:16,306 --> 00:55:18,174
You stuck with it to the end.

980
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:21,678
Combine your natural luck
with effort and you're invincible.

981
00:55:23,146 --> 00:55:25,381
-Use it all up.
-Yes, sir.

982
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:29,185
Seto.

983
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:31,721
Yeah.

984
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:35,358
You still have a habit of deciding
what your limits are.

985
00:55:38,194 --> 00:55:39,429
Before you give up,

986
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:41,931
ask people for help.

987
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:43,900
Yes, sir.

988
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,437
Listen. All of you.
The most important thing in life

989
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:54,310
is not going to UTokyo, or winning,
or getting results.

990
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:58,481
It's every moment you spent
working towards your goals.

991
00:55:58,548 --> 00:56:01,517
The effort you spent trying
to change your lives.

992
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:04,420
That path, that passion.

993
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,289
And your love for your friends.

994
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,591
That has real value.

995
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:13,730
Mizuno here changed her life
by going to UTokyo.

996
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:15,732
However.

997
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:18,668
She didn't just change her own life.

998
00:56:20,036 --> 00:56:22,238
She changed mine too.

999
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:30,580
She's meddlesome and gullible.

1000
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:33,616
She can't stand by when people need help.

1001
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:37,653
She's compassionate
and cares about her friends.

1002
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:42,725
She never forgets a favor.

1003
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,431
Because of her,

1004
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:52,835
she helped me get back on my feet
when I had nothing.

1005
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:55,805
Mizuno.

1006
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,242
Thank you very much.

1007
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,013
Sir…

1008
00:57:11,454 --> 00:57:13,456
Do you remember the words I said?

1009
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:17,660
The only one who can change
your shit life is you.

1010
00:57:18,194 --> 00:57:20,563
People can't change others.

1011
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,064
I said that.

1012
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:24,233
But remember this.

1013
00:57:26,202 --> 00:57:29,138
When you move with pure intentions,

1014
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:33,443
that has the power to move others.

1015
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,179
Believe in yourself. Go straight ahead.

1016
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:42,485
If you do, that will bring
courage and hope to others.

1017
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:46,622
Your passion, effort, and kindness

1018
00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:48,891
will move the people around you.

1019
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:53,463
And that will spread, and change society.

1020
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:57,300
Build a life, change the status quo!

1021
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,536
The ones who will build your future

1022
00:58:01,304 --> 00:58:03,105
are not the nation or your surroundings.

1023
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,876
It's yourselves.

1024
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,146
You idiots are idiots no longer.

1025
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:14,450
You have friends.

1026
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:17,954
Expand that circle.

1027
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:21,190
Got it?

1028
00:58:23,226 --> 00:58:25,161
Walk the path you believe in!

1029
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:28,097
Nice to meet you!

1030
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:29,031
<i>We mustn't kill.</i>

1031
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:30,032
I want to try with all of you!

1032
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:31,267
<i>I want to join the UTokyo Special Course!</i>

1033
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:32,802
<i>I decided to make a move.</i>

1034
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:33,903
I want to be involved with badminton.

1035
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,937
I have good luck.

1036
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:37,940
Ugly and stupid can go to UTokyo!

1037
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:38,908
