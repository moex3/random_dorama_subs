00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>"Hear us. Hear us."</i>

2
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,247
<i>"Hear our cries."</i>

3
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:21,087
<i>"Our friend is trapped under a tree,
unable to move."</i>

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,928
<i>"The animals looked into the girl's eyes
and pleaded in their hearts."</i>

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,568
"Save him." "Please."

6
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:45,045
"Then, the girl saved
the squirrel trapped under the tree."

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,115
"This girl has a special power."

8
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,426
"When she locks eyes with another,

9
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,363
<i>only then can she hear
the voice in their heart."</i>

10
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>Dolce &amp; Chocolat. is known for</i>

11
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,175
their cute and delicious
chocolate and coffee,

12
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,112
but they both use cacao beans
that were meant to be discarded--

13
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,580
We don't use cacao beans.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,418
These shells, known as cacao pods,

15
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,923
hold about 30 seeds surrounded by flesh,
which we call the cacao pulp.

16
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,191
And this is a cacao bean.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,125
Okay.

18
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,627
Boss sure is aggressive today.

19
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,263
Chocolate usually only uses cacao nibs,

20
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,133
which are cacao beans
with their husks removed.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,671
But these discarded husks can still
be used to make delicious chocolate.

22
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,372
Isn't that ridiculous?

23
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,245
Y-Yes.

24
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,316
We use cacao husks
that would usually be discarded

25
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,387
to produce chocolate, chocolate-flavored
coffee, and other everyday goods.

26
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,626
I'm going out to the shop.

27
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,527
-See you.
-Okay.

28
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,163
<i>Chocolate and coffee
made from discarded cacao.</i>

29
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,666
<i>That's my life right now.</i>

30
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,274
That looks so tasty. I want some too.

31
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,442
No, Noa.

32
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,677
But you always say no.

33
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,480
We're not here for you today, Noa.

34
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,383
Why? I want some.

35
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,553
-I wanna eat some.
-Noa, calm down.

36
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,422
Can we help you, Sir?

37
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,091
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,926
We're here to buy a gift,

39
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,295
but she insists on having some too.

40
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,597
Mind your manners.

41
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,566
I want some too.

42
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,239
<i>I don't have enough money to buy two.</i>

43
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,143
<i>And Noa gets cavities so easily.</i>

44
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,547
Can I have one box of ten?

45
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,748
Um…

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,952
I also recommend this.

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,755
It's the same price as that one, but…

48
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,493
<i>Then I can bring one as a gift</i>

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,461
<i>and take the other home.</i>

50
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,432
And this one uses xylitol
instead of sugar,

51
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,100
so cavities aren't a concern.

52
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,635
Really?

53
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,470
She always gets cavities.

54
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,739
Really? This is perfect.

55
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,276
Hey, how does this chocolate sound?

56
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,845
Really? I love you, Dad!

57
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,981
I love you too!

58
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,916
Brush your teeth after, okay?

59
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,884
Okay.

60
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,852
<i>Wow, this is incredible.</i>

61
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,354
Isn't this pretty, Dad?

62
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,755
I'm glad you like it.

63
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,158
I always wanted to bring you here, Yuri.

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,593
TWELVE YEARS AGO

65
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,962
Oh, what?

66
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,764
KIRITAPPU CAPE

67
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,733
Dad, sea otters!

68
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,270
They're really here!

69
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,838
Oh, I see them.

70
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,442
Since we're here,
let's take a closer look tomorrow.

71
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,110
Yeah, I'd love that.

72
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,015
Yuri!

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,151
<i>Ever since that accident,</i>

74
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,522
<i>I've been able to hear the thoughts of
anyone I locked eyes with.</i>

75
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,294
<i>It was confusing at first,
and my feelings were often hurt.</i>

76
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>But I realized that it isn't all bad
once you figure out</i>

77
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,799
<i>how to properly use this power.</i>

78
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,034
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

79
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,738
<i>People's thoughts
aren't always out of ill will.</i>

80
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,774
-Get home safely.
-Bye-bye.

81
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,412
You're so good at this, Yuri.

82
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,215
It's almost scary
how well you can read people's feelings.

83
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,616
You think?

84
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,519
But why can't you get a boyfriend?

85
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,226
Is it because you're still
caught up on an ex from high school?

86
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,729
People's thoughts?

87
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,197
Yeah.

88
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,038
It's not like that.

89
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,443
<i>But I just know…</i>

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:17,417
<i>how hard it can be to find romance
when you have this power.</i>

91
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,343
<i>When people fall in love,</i>

92
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,247
<i>they end up wishing…</i>

93
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,452
<i>To know their partner's thoughts,</i>

94
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,122
<i>even if it may hurt them.</i>

95
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,942
I'm so hungry.

96
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,083
GOHAN
RECEIVE ORDER

97
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,418
12 MINUTES, 360 YEN

98
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,728
Time for food.

99
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,602
"This is a secret,
but if you want pibimbap,

100
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,843
there's a restaurant called Ondol Eatery
that tastes better."

101
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:26,913
A sea otter?

102
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,318
Aihara.

103
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,252
Yes?

104
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,155
You switched
the coffee bean order numbers.

105
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,225
How did you mix up
Colombian and Jamaican beans?

106
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:44,130
I don't think I'm suited for
tedious jobs like this.

107
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,266
Something with
more responsibility or meaning…

108
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,902
-That might--
-You can only go up one step at a time.

109
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,038
-What?
-Whatever job you get,

110
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,973
do it with positivity and grace.

111
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,609
-Makes sense.
-Yeah.

112
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,844
For starters…

113
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,481
Is Hanaoka interested in
anything other than work?

114
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,916
-Who knows?
-It's so strange.

115
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,085
I wonder if he has any hobbies.

116
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,954
Can't you just talk to him about work?

117
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,456
Then the conversation
won't go anywhere. Anyway--

118
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:11,991
Sorry, Kame.

119
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,193
-I'm clocking out.
-What?

120
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,971
Jeez.

121
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,940
Why is this here?

122
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,675
Seriously?

123
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,546
It's okay. I'll handle this.

124
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,285
-Thanks.
-It's fine. I'm climbing the ladder now.

125
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,454
I've been thinking,

126
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,624
aren't these better on the wall
instead of the desk?

127
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,993
Then, they'd be out of the way.

128
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,061
We should've bought those
in the first place.

129
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,364
You can go to lunch after your meeting.

130
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,265
Thank you.

131
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,703
-That's--
-No, Aihara.

132
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,839
Interrupting Boss's meal
will get you killed.

133
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,973
Kill--

134
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,683
Thanks, Hanaoka. What is this?

135
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,719
Convenience store by the station,
vanilla cream flavor, 124 yen.

136
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,388
Impressive. Thanks, as always.

137
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,693
And if we change all the trash cans
to the ones that hang on the walls,

138
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,129
it'll cost us 44,450 yen in expenses.

139
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,766
For now, I'll have everyone
put theirs under their desk.

140
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,001
Impressive. Sorry, as always.

141
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,307
-You'll miss your meeting.
-Oh!

142
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,656
I'm so hungry.

143
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,193
I'm so hungry!

144
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,103
"Pibimbap."

145
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,405
They meant bibimbap, right?

146
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,009
Ondol Eatery.

147
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,313
SIGNATURE DISH, BIBIMBAP

148
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,720
Hm?

149
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,421
A-OK

150
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,425
270 YEN
ONDOL EATERY

151
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,497
Let's go.

152
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,102
Enjoy.

153
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,432
Thank you for the food.

154
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,165
Is this made of bagasse?

155
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,368
It’s microwave-safe
but not oven-safe, right?

156
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,177
"Hope this energizes you."

157
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:55,147
"This restaurant's Korean pancakes
are good too."

158
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,084
Korean pancakes.

159
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,690
Seafood. Kimchi. Potato.

160
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,035
Let's get some.

161
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,243
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER.
I FEEL ENERGIZED. THANK YOU.

162
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,879
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER.
I FEEL ENERGIZED.

163
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,749
Cute.

164
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,685
Enjoy.

165
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,307
"The <i>rapokki</i> is to die for."

166
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,443
<i>Rapokki</i>?

167
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,316
That looks delicious.

168
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,219
I want some, but…

169
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,555
RAPOKKI

170
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,193
When you visit home,
you have to buy souvenirs, right?

171
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,461
You gotta think about
who to buy them for, right?

172
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,365
But the first person I thought of
wasn't my boyfriend.

173
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,034
It was my co-workers.

174
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,537
My mom asked me
if I wasn't getting him anything,

175
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,372
and that's when I remembered him.

176
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,975
I realized, "This is bad."

177
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,712
Are you listening?

178
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,786
Sorry, so basically,
what are you trying to say?

179
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,920
So, basically,

180
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,490
I think it's true love
when you want to buy them souvenirs.

181
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,629
Well, I don't have a guy
to buy souvenirs for,

182
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,899
nor would I buy a souvenir
as an excuse to see one.

183
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,567
So I don't really get it.

184
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,269
I guess you can't relate.

185
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,570
Yeah… What?

186
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,106
I've never had this before.
It's delicious.

187
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,009
Isn't it?
I got a great source of information.

188
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,944
Did someone suggest this place?

189
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,114
A food delivery guy.
He always leaves me notes.

190
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,183
-What?
-Yeah?

191
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,885
Isn't that shady?

192
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,786
What? Why?

193
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,023
That person guides me to delicious food.

194
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,692
He's like a god.

195
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,594
Don't look at me like that.

196
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,097
Maybe you feel a spark then.

197
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,008
YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN CANCELED

198
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,276
Why?

199
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,582
Why, God?

200
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,987
70-MINUTE WAIT
60-MINUTE WAIT

201
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,190
Why's there such a long wait?

202
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,526
Is it some kind of holiday today?

203
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,774
It's raining.

204
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,211
That's why it's taking so long.

205
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,016
I'm so hungry. Oh no, I'm so hungry.

206
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,913
Huh?

207
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,514
Huh?

208
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,415
What?

209
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,302
Oh, I'm sorry.

210
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,308
Sorry! I'm really sorry!

211
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,780
Are you God?

212
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,282
God?

213
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,252
No, I mean, the delivery guy?

214
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,055
Oh, were you my customer?

215
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,429
Um, are you mad?

216
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,064
No, I'm not.

217
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,106
My bike slid a lot in the rain

218
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,076
and ruined the food.

219
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,278
I wrote this to say I'm sorry.

220
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,682
Was the food completely ruined?

221
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,018
If the container was just smashed a bit…

222
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,386
It went tumbling down.

223
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,591
It rolled and rolled down the hill.

224
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,194
I understand.

225
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,896
Bye, then.

226
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,564
Where are you going?

227
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,166
To buy food.

228
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,834
It's dangerous in this heavy rain.

229
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,868
It's windy too.

230
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,670
But I need to eat.

231
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,906
I'm truly sorry.

232
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,975
I'm just hungry.

233
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,078
I'm incredibly hungry.

234
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,814
I'm starving!

235
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,150
-Are you mad?
-I'm not mad.

236
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,827
Do you by chance like<i> soondubu</i>?

237
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,361
<i>Soondubu</i>?

238
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,099
Very much.

239
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,435
Got it. Please wait here.

240
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,403
Five minutes.

241
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,009
Please wait in your room!

242
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,484
I SLIPPED ON MY BIKE
AND DROPPED YOUR FOOD. I'M VERY SORRY.

243
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,391
Oh, here's your <i>soondubu</i>.

244
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,995
I made some earlier.

245
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,730
Have some.

246
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,034
-What?
-Um…

247
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,139
I live in Tatsumi Building
by the greenway.

248
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,074
It's nearby.

249
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,711
What?

250
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,948
Oh, could it be you don't trust the food?

251
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,719
Of course, you wouldn't. Don't worry.

252
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,098
There's nothing weird in it.

253
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,435
I'm Yun Tae-o.

254
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,172
I'm 26 years old,
and came to Japan almost two years ago.

255
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,706
I'm from Korea.

256
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,545
I'm not anyone suspicious.

257
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,417
It's delicious.

258
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,920
It'll energize you.

259
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,888
Here.

260
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,228
Well then, I'm truly sorry.

261
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,040
A sea otter?

262
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,810
God's <i>soondubu</i>.

263
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,428
It's warm.

264
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,412
It's rare to see you without an appetite.

265
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,849
You need your strength.

266
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,188
I can't drink coffee. It's too bitter.

267
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,223
This coffee

268
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,827
uses cacao, just like chocolate.

269
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,663
It's just like chocolate?

270
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,898
Even though it's not sweet?

271
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah.

272
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,938
It can be sweet or bitter
depending on how you use it.

273
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,775
Life's the same way.

274
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,513
It all depends on you
whether it's bitter or sweet.

275
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,584
I don't get it.

276
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,325
It's so bitter.

277
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,535
It's so sweet.

278
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,674
Now, eat your<i> omurice</i> too.

279
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,342
Thank you for the food.

280
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,871
I'm home, Mom.

281
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,777
I'm famished.

282
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,483
Oh, I gave away my <i>soondubu</i>.

283
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,026
I'm starving!

284
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,329
That face

285
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,265
was terrifying.

286
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,335
In other words,

287
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,973
when God talks, it's in Japanese.

288
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,508
Are you mad?

289
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,147
But his thoughts are in Korean.

290
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,324
It's bitter.

291
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,142
Oh, sorry.

292
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,977
Go ahead.

293
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,245
Thank you!

294
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,387
Professor Zaitsu, good morning!

295
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,656
Oh, good morning, Tae-o!

296
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,060
RESEARCH LAB
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION MAJOR

297
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,232
Did you sleep well,
fishes one through six?

298
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,336
Good morning!

299
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,404
Morning.

300
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,742
Good morning, Tae-o.
Humidity went down 2%.

301
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,743
Sorry.

302
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,081
Did you eat, Senpai?

303
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,683
Yeah, hey.

304
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,128
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER.
I FEEL ENERGIZED. THANK YOU.

305
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,931
What is that?

306
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,600
Someone replied to me.

307
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,569
Oh, at your delivery job?

308
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,470
That's right.

309
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,239
It's the first reply I've ever gotten.

310
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,208
I was really happy.

311
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,243
What a nice person.

312
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,177
Yes--

313
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm starving!

314
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,151
Is she a nice person?

315
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:49,988
Bravo.

316
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,493
"Good food is the best way to energize."
Your mom would always say that, right?

317
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,095
Yes.

318
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,532
That reminds me,

319
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,135
Park sent us some kimchi.

320
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,739
This year's kimchi tastes like
your mother's cooking too.

321
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,040
Yes, this is great!

322
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,375
I want some too.

323
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,344
We only got enough for me and Tae-o.

324
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,380
Professor, can't you go with the flow?

325
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,651
Because of you,
this is the only kimchi I can eat.

326
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:24,189
Do I count as a sea otter foodie,
spending five million yen a year on food?

327
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,157
Are you a sea otter?

328
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,393
<i>Kyoshuku desuga.</i>

329
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,564
You don't resemble one.
You look totally different.

330
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,833
<i>Kyoshuku desu.</i>

331
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,800
"<i>Kyoshuku…</i>"?

332
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,103
What's "<i>kyoshuku</i>"?

333
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,973
Oh, it means sorry or thank you.

334
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,942
He's sorry?

335
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,811
Which is it?

336
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,616
The samples arrived
for our Valentine's Day product!

337
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,419
-Whoa!
-They're here!

338
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,521
-Here, Boss.
-Oh, thanks.

339
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,290
-Here, Nishina.
-Thanks.

340
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,526
Red was a good choice
for the packaging. It pops.

341
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,662
The taste's just as good.

342
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,699
The strong bitter taste of the vanilla
with 72% cacao gave me goosebumps.

343
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,634
-It's Mahiro's masterpiece.
-Yes.

344
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,370
This is so good.
Anyone would be happy to receive this.

345
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,305
Right?

346
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,840
<i>It'll energize you.</i>

347
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,709
Here.

348
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,178
You won't see her for another six months.

349
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,014
Why won't you see your daughter
for six months?

350
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,183
May I speak to you, Mahiro?

351
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,918
I'd like to ask you something later.

352
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,553
What?

353
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,695
I think you should go bold
and choose this one.

354
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,230
But this would normally be better.

355
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,933
Wouldn't you prefer
something rare and precious?

356
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,637
I feel like our flagship product's
timeless charm is a great selling point.

357
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,975
Is there some kind of trouble?

358
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,676
A thank you gift for the <i>soondubu</i>.

359
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:52,611
What?

360
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,179
A gift to God.

361
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,747
A thank you for his hospitality.

362
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,050
If this isn't about work, then go home.

363
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,952
Which would you be happier to get?

364
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,555
You're costing us electricity, so go home.

365
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,856
Wait.

366
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,661
Wouldn't giving chocolate at this time
of the year mean something special?

367
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,532
VALENTINE'S DAY IN KOREA

368
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,170
AS IN JAPAN, WOMEN GIVE CHOCOLATES
TO THOSE THEY LIKE

369
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,046
Go home right now.

370
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,347
Why Korea?

371
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,416
Just because.

372
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,119
-What?
-What?

373
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,912
I live in Tatsumi Building
by the greenway.

374
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,556
TATSUMI BUILDING

375
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,002
Excuse me.

376
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,514
YUN

377
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,582
Yun.

378
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,628
-I'm sorry.
-What?

379
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,265
Did I accidentally do something again?

380
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,267
Oh, not at all.

381
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,070
I came to return the soup jar.

382
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,273
I see.

383
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,546
<i>Kyoshuku desu.</i>

384
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,282
That's what I should be saying.

385
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,186
It was incredibly delicious.

386
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,421
Really?

387
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,057
It was delicious and warm.

388
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,061
It really energized me, truly.

389
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,664
Thank you for the food.

390
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,833
Who are you?

391
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,837
Oh, you gave me the <i>soondubu</i>
the other day.

392
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,239
I know that.

393
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,308
You seem like
a different person from before,

394
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,778
so I was a bit surprised.

395
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,479
Oh, really?

396
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,058
Oh, this soap is…

397
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,394
It's not much, but I wanted to thank you.

398
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,999
-Well, then…
-Um, wait one second.

399
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,974
Let's see. Where did I put it again?

400
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,113
I use this soap too.

401
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,317
Yesterday, I used this to blow bubbles.

402
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,220
Wait one second.

403
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,826
Um, where did I put that again?

404
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,533
Eco-friendly soap bubbles.

405
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,538
-Come with me.
-What?!

406
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,312
Watch this.

407
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,596
This is…

408
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,738
He's a god after all.

409
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,876
-What?
-No, it's nothing.

410
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,249
These bubbles are eco-friendly,
so rest assured.

411
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,320
And they don't harm humans either.

412
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,824
You can use it as much as you want

413
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,660
without worrying about the environment.

414
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,431
Wouldn't it be nice if more
and more things were made like that?

415
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,502
It would be very, very nice.

416
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,197
I'm having <i>japchae</i> today.

417
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,432
Is that okay with you?

418
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,536
What?

419
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,650
-Actually, I think I'll go--
-It's done.

420
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,275
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

421
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,744
Are you mad--

422
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,012
I'm not mad!

423
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,049
Let's eat.

424
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,920
But…

425
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,941
Oh no, I can't understand him at all.

426
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,776
Oh, it's okay.

427
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,627
There's nothing weird in it.

428
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,963
Don't be mad.

429
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,606
Please eat.

430
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,243
Thank you for the food.

431
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:21,759
It's delicious!

432
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,523
Get energized.

433
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,100
Why are you smiling so much?

434
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,104
I'm happy.

435
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,408
It's been a while

436
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,312
since I ate with someone at home.

437
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,518
Time to eat.

438
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,423
I'm eating.

439
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,736
That was a great meal.

440
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,206
It was absolutely delicious.

441
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,642
Oh, now I get it.

442
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,845
You get mad when you're hungry.

443
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,481
Are you talking about me?

444
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,416
Did that help you

445
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,785
get energized?

446
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,988
Yes, I'm fully charged.

447
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,023
Cute.

448
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,832
Kimchi…

449
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,038
I said, "Do you like it?"

450
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,342
Yes, I like kimchi.

451
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,711
If there's super spicy kimchi

452
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,014
and slightly spicy kimchi,

453
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,715
which do you prefer?

454
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,819
The super spicy kimchi

455
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,055
might be hard for me to eat.

456
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,958
Got it.

457
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,930
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER

458
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,233
Why did you keep this?

459
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,334
It's so poorly drawn.

460
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,602
The sea otter?

461
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,705
You were the first to reply to me.

462
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,574
I was happy.

463
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
So,

464
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,215
I like this sea otter.

465
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,895
It seems you like sea otters.

466
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,563
I love them.

467
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,001
I'm studying sea otters
at graduate school.

468
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,307
Are you studying endangered animals?

469
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,042
Yes.

470
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:29,113
Did you know
that sea otters are endangered?

471
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,855
On the 2020 Red List,

472
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,791
sea otters were listed
an A1 endangered animal.

473
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,095
A1 endangered animals

474
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:50,001
are at extremely high risk
of going extinct in the wild

475
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,069
in the near future.

476
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,308
Why do you like sea otters?

477
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,776
Why?

478
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,650
No reason.

479
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,585
Kids are cute.

480
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,520
Ghosts are scary.

481
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,556
It's the same idea.

482
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,092
I like them because I like them.

483
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,895
Simple as that, right?

484
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,234
Do you like sea otters?

485
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,910
-Yes.
-Really?!

486
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,981
We're the same, huh?

487
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,283
Wow, you like them too?

488
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,885
I mean,

489
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,487
sea otters are so cute.

490
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,124
You're so innocent.

491
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:49,827
"Innocent"?

492
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,697
Like a child.

493
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,701
True to your feelings.

494
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,536
That's what it means.

495
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,945
When I think about it,
when I was doing my part-time job today,

496
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,148
I was called carefree.

497
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,651
Does that mean the same thing?

498
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,520
Well…

499
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,027
You have a positive attitude.

500
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,629
That's what it means.

501
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,937
I have a positive attitude
and I'm true to myself.

502
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:35,940
I agree.

503
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,709
How old are you?

504
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,611
Me?

505
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,846
Yes, you.

506
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,484
-Thirty.
-And your name?

507
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,519
I'm Motomiya.

508
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,488
I mean your first name.

509
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,993
I'm Yuri.

510
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,095
Yuri.

511
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,065
Yuri, huh?

512
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,104
That's a cute name.

513
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,221
POLLOCK ROE PASTA

514
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,124
LEAVE AT DOOR

515
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,631
RECEIVE IN PERSON

516
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,740
Today's delivery is pasta.

517
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,010
Thank you.

518
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,144
Enjoy.

519
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,586
-Yuri, today's--
-Thank you.

520
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,124
She must be hungry today.

521
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:03,928
Cute.

522
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,403
Are you a mad Yuri today?

523
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,737
Or a nice Yuri?

524
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,506
-What?
-Hm?

525
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,309
NAMASTE NAAN CURRY

526
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,348
GET ENERGIZED!

527
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,085
"Get energized."

528
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,156
Thanks for the food.

529
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,625
Yeah, this is good.

530
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,427
Where'd you buy this?

531
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,863
At the food truck in the back.

532
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,633
The university president
told me it's good.

533
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,336
Even the president's looking out for you?

534
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,871
You're like a penguin.

535
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,373
An emperor penguin perhaps?

536
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,512
You're affectionate and true to yourself
when you express your feelings.

537
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,214
Hm? True to myself?

538
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,284
Oh, "innocent," right?

539
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,620
I'm innocent and carefree.

540
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,156
Tae-o, that's not something
to be proud of.

541
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,458
It's an insult.

542
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,461
Is it an insult?

543
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,197
Carefree means
you don't think about anything.

544
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,236
<i>You have a positive attitude.</i>

545
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>That's what it means.</i>

546
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,443
She really is a wonderful person.

547
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,247
A wonderful person? Is this love?

548
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,650
It's not love.

549
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,319
Not yet.

550
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,487
Not yet?

551
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,658
I'll let you know if it turns into love.

552
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,293
Bravo.

553
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,130
-Tae-o, you start tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

554
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,566
I'm nervous, as if I'm the one going.

555
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,901
However, as Tae-o's foster parent,

556
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,538
I must be like the golden eagle,
starving its child so they leave the nest.

557
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,742
This is bad.

558
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,545
My nerves raised my body temperature,
making the room warmer.

559
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,815
Thanks, that was delicious.

560
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,628
Hey, do I…

561
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,029
What?

562
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,734
Do I have a habit of getting angry

563
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,969
-when I'm hungry?
-Yes.

564
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,338
I do? Since when?

565
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,974
Before I even met you.

566
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,942
So, since I was in university?

567
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,310
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,545
You never asked.

569
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,815
I see.

570
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,051
You're always like that, Hanaoka.

571
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,723
Motomiya, you're so oblivious
when it comes to yourself.

572
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,724
What?

573
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,826
Yet you can read others so easily.

574
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,462
You think so?

575
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,702
I'm saying

576
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,472
that it really helps our company out.

577
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,376
You can sense how others feel

578
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,646
and always make a calm decision
that matches that.

579
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,682
That's a great advantage
for entrepreneurs.

580
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:16,487
Thanks.

581
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,096
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

582
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,037
<i>The purchase order for
our limited edition Valentine's Day goods</i>

583
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,005
<i>should be sent by next week, right?</i>

584
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,075
Oh right, Aihara.

585
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,645
Send the purchase order
for Valentine's Day goods today, okay?

586
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:42,780
What?

587
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,882
Oh, sure.

588
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,418
<i>That was today? That was a close call.</i>

589
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,625
Hello?

590
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,327
HARMONY CARE CENTER

591
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,733
<i>I use this power to protect my company.</i>

592
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,737
<i>It's for the sake of my dream.</i>

593
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:08,739
<i>For my employees.</i>

594
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:11,909
<i>But most of all…</i>

595
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:14,878
Come in.

596
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,415
Ms. Motomiya.

597
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,953
Dad.

598
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,590
He got phlegm in his throat
and had trouble breathing.

599
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,192
Is he okay?

600
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,261
We sucked it out, so he's fine now.

601
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,730
Thank goodness.

602
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,566
Your daughter came to visit.

603
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,201
Isn't that great?

604
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,503
I'll excuse myself then.

605
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,871
-Thank you.
-Of course.

606
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,047
Dad, are you okay? Does it hurt?

607
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,250
<i>I'm fine.</i>

608
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,853
<i>They're making a big fuss over nothing.</i>

609
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:00,491
I need them to worry at least that much.

610
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,525
<i>I guess that's true.</i>

611
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,862
<i>Oh, give me the usual smell.</i>

612
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,929
Right.

613
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,572
Here you go.

614
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,843
<i>Yes, what a nice aroma.</i>

615
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,545
That's right.

616
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,614
We made this year's
Valentine's Day product.

617
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,216
<i>Oh, show me.</i>

618
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,117
Sure.

619
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,254
<i>On that day 12 years ago…</i>

620
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,221
Ta-da!

621
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,757
<i>At the same time my father lost mobility,</i>

622
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,594
<i>I gained the ability
to hear people's thoughts.</i>

623
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,510
Hey!

624
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,846
Yuri!

625
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,415
-Someone!
-Hey, come back!

626
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,190
Yuri!

627
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:35,052
<i>It's okay. Dad's here to protect you.</i>

628
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,590
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

629
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:44,695
I believe your father
will never move again.

630
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,535
In your father's case,
the left and right side of his brain

631
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,303
have suffered a stroke,

632
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,874
making it difficult for him
to communicate his thoughts.

633
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,610
Dad.

634
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,212
I'm sorry.

635
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,186
I'm so sorry.

636
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,190
<i>No, Yuri.</i>

637
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,898
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

638
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,001
Dad?

639
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,438
<i>I'm glad you're safe, Yuri.</i>

640
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,112
I can hear you.

641
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,050
I can hear you…

642
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,421
I can hear your voice, Dad.

643
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,728
Dad.

644
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,503
Here is this month's bill.

645
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,672
It includes today's medical expenses.

646
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:02,839
Okay.

647
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,877
<i>To continue sharing a life with my father,</i>

648
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,147
<i>I need money.</i>

649
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,815
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

650
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:17,921
<i>That's why I decided to use this power
to protect my company.</i>

651
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:24,528
<i>Because it's up to me
whether to make life bitter or sweet.</i>

652
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,097
-Ms. Motomiya.
-Ms. Oki.

653
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,800
-Thank you for earlier.
-It's nothing.

654
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,972
Makoto is so blessed to have
a daughter who cares for him.

655
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,844
<i>She pays so much every month,
even though there's no cure.</i>

656
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,479
<i>I feel so sorry for her.</i>

657
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,515
<i>They can't even chat when she visits--</i>

658
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,086
Ms. Motomiya?

659
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,521
Oh, right.

660
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,392
Please continue to take
good care of my father.

661
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,462
Please come visit anytime.

662
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,197
-Get home safely.
-Thank you.

663
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,834
<i>And yet…</i>

664
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,372
<i>There are times
when the bitterness is inevitable.</i>

665
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,583
Yuri.

666
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,286
Yuri!

667
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:30,360
You, the cute lady over there
looking around everywhere!

668
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,831
Yuri, wait one second!

669
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,403
Yuri.

670
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,778
Yuri, this is great.

671
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,847
Today's my last day with my part-time job,

672
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,149
so I wanted to see you.

673
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,618
I'm happy I got to see you.

674
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,666
If you'd like, let's do it together.

675
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,601
What?

676
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,238
Huh?

677
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,277
Remember how the wind and rain
was really strong the other day?

678
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,682
Oh, the day when your bike slipped
and you couldn't deliver my food?

679
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:32,355
Because of that,
a lot of leaves flew over,

680
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,757
so I'm cleaning up.

681
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,593
Why are you doing that, Mr. Yun?

682
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:38,628
Call me Tae-o.

683
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,832
Why are you doing that, Tae-o?

684
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,868
My landlord's back hurts.

685
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,774
I'll show you how to do it first.

686
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,476
Here.

687
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,815
Whoa.

688
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,384
Now, then.

689
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,920
This sucks them up.

690
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:09,693
This blows a lot of wind.

691
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,328
Don't mix them up.

692
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,063
Okay.

693
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:19,769
You're doing great.

694
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,541
There are so many different leaves.

695
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,544
-Whoa.
-What?

696
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,715
This is a ginkgo leaf.

697
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,785
Wild ginkgos are endangered.

698
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,255
What? Is that true?

699
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,929
This is a dawn redwood leaf.

700
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,331
-Really?
-Yes.

701
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,067
Then…

702
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,604
-Is this one too?
-That's…

703
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,607
a common one.

704
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,253
I'm glad.

705
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,988
What?

706
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,490
I'm glad.

707
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,736
What's the matter?

708
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,472
Nothing.

709
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,518
Don't look at me.

710
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:42,986
What?

711
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,624
What are you doing?

712
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,492
Have you gone crazy?

713
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:58,301
Don't look.

714
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,469
Don't look at my eyes.

715
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:22,892
Um…

716
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,268
Please forgive me!

717
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,645
Wow, this is pretty.

718
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,520
So pretty.

719
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:51,421
What?

720
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,560
Oh, you're right.

721
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,832
These are the leaves we were cleaning up.

722
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:04,801
But now…

723
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,738
they've become so pretty.

724
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,387
Rather than bitter, make it sweet…

725
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,231
Thank you very much.

726
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,501
You've given me energy again.

727
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,338
Yuri, you…

728
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,576
are like a different person
every time we meet.

729
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,351
<i>I want to know you more.</i>

730
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,234
I'm really sorry.

731
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:25,682
Yuri!

732
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,919
Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

733
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,354
I'll cook.

734
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,156
No, I wouldn't.

735
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,492
Do you like rice or noodles?

736
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,128
I like both, but…

737
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:39,496
Rice, I guess.

738
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,864
Do you like curry?

739
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,999
Curry? Yes, I do.

740
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,367
Do you like fried rice?

741
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,035
I like fried rice.

742
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,404
Do you like<i> omurice</i>?

743
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,706
-I like <i>omurice</i> too.
-How about me?

744
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:50,707
I like…

745
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,276
"Me"?

746
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,714
Do you like me?

747
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,954
Excuse me.

748
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,994
I'm happy I got to see you.

749
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,457
You know, I can hear people's thoughts.

750
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,892
People's thoughts?

751
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,295
<i>That's scary.</i>

752
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,742
I…

753
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,278
like you.

754
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,283
THIS IS A SECRET,
BUT IF YOU LIKE PIBIMBAP…

755
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,938
GET ENERGIZED!

756
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,473
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER

757
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,206
Good morning.

758
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,475
-Good morning.
-Morning.

759
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,610
Good morning. Hello.

760
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,477
Are you free?
I want you to meet our new intern.

761
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,512
Oh, sure.

762
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,280
Come in.

763
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,597
Huh?

764
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,098
Yuri?

765
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,003
I knew we'd meet again.

766
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,177

<i>I've never done this before!</i>

768
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:16,946
Let's eat.

769
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,282
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

770
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,185
We don't need workers
who mix up their work and private life.

771
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,686
I love you.

772
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,622
Why does he have to work under me?

773

<i>Are you drunk?</i>
