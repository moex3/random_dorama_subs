1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>Ever since that accident,</i>

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,545
<i>I've been able to hear the thoughts of
anyone I locked eyes with.</i>

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,053
<i>I'm Yun Tae-o.</i>

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,589
<i>I'm 26 years old.
I came to Japan almost two years ago.</i>

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,158
<i>When he talks, it's in Japanese.</i>

6
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>But his thoughts are…</i>

7
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,763
<i>…in Korean.</i>

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,164
Excuse me.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,634
-I want you to meet our new intern.
-Oh, sure.

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,336
Come in.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,278
Huh? Yuri?

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,250
I knew we'd meet again.

13
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,221
What? No one told me about this.

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,690
HR was always my responsibility.

15
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,126
Oh, that's right.

16
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,098
This is our CEO, Yuri Motomiya.

17
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,600
What? Yuri is the CEO?

18
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,036
Are you really the CEO?

19
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,205
Do you two know each other?

20
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,941
Or rather, we're…

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,543
Yes, we're good friends.

22
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,049
Yes, I'm fully charged.

23
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,684
Cute.

24
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,286
I'm happy I got to see you.

25
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:35,462
No, he's just a deliveryman
who brings food to me.

26
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,397
That's all.

27
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,799
Really?

28
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,337
Then, you might know already,
but he's Mr. Yun Tae-o.

29
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,041
His school connected us, and he'll work
here until he graduates in two months.

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,676
We'll have him start as an intern.

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,012
Then, if everything goes smoothly,

32
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,314
we'll sign him on.

33
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,850
If everything goes smoothly…

34
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,828
If everything goes smoothly.

35
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,834
We don't need workers
who mix up their work and private life.

36
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,205
Now, let me introduce you to the team.

37
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,112
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

38
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,781
You can go now.

39
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,789
I'm Yun Tae-o, 26 years of age,
and I came to Japan almost two years ago.

40
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,158
Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,828
-He's glowing.
-His legs are so long.

42
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,863
Mr. Yun is…

43
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,431
Please call me Tae-o.

44
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,567
So, Tae-o…

45
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,936
-Sea otters, right?
-Yes.

46
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,338
He's studying endangered animals,

47
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,341
so I'd like to put him in charge of
the upcoming seminar project.

48
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,579
But we'll start you off with
basic work as an assistant.

49
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,214
All right! Is he my assistant?

50
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,216
He'll be with Nishina for now.

51
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,517
Oh, okay.

52
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,519
You speak Korean, right?

53
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,820
A little.

54
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,290
You can speak Korean?

55
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,458
I've been there a few times.

56
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,060
And I have a few friends.

57
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,628
That's great.

58
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,231
-I look forward to working with you.
-Me too.

59
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,136
It's nothing.

60
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,372
Are you hungry, Yuri?

61
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,142
-"Yuri"?
-"Yuri"?

62
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,310
It's not like that.

63
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,553
They know each other.

64
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,156
-Did he get in through connections?
-No.

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,124
It's a coincidence. Really.

66
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,459
A coincidence…

67
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,027
How do you know each other?

68
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,729
Well…

69
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,668
-I'd bring food…
-Food?

70
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,471
-Yeah, food.
-I'd go "ding ding."

71
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,506
-Yeah, ding ding.
-Ding?

72
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,609
-Ding…
-Um, delivery.

73
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,980
Yes, he worked part-time as a delivery boy
and brought me food.

74
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,881
-I see.
-I see.

75
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,783
-Are you done?
-Yes.

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,088
Anyway, I want Tae-o to work hard

77
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,524
as an intern who is set
to become a full-time employee.

78
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,194
So give him your full support as well.

79
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,295
-Okay.
-Okay.

80
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,930
Nishina, show him his desk.

81
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,864
Okay.

82
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,267
Tae-o, your seat is over here.

83
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,234
Thank you.

84
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,840
And get a grip, Motomiya.

85
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,242
Got it?

86
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,344
Of course.

87
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,793
We don't need workers
who mix up their work and private life.

88
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,430
What? You're rejecting them?

89
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,134
FIVE YEARS AGO

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,201
P.S. HOW ABOUT DINNER?

91
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,237
Even if they're a client,

92
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,539
we can't trust people like this.

93
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,508
That's true, but…

94
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,545
We don't need workers
who mix up their work and private life.

95
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,449
Be careful, Motomiya.

96
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,850
What?

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,721
Be careful.

98
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,824
Okay.

99
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,175
If anything happens,
he could even fire me, the CEO.

100
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,679
Yuri.

101
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,384
Please stop being like this.

102
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,920
Please treat me
like your boss at the office.

103
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,054
Why?

104
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,557
Hanaoka told you too, right?

105
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,992
If things go smoothly, you sign with us.

106
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,029
Hanaoka doesn't go easy on people.

107
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,765
He'll cut out anyone who mixes
work and private affairs.

108
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,266
Private…

109
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,137
People who can't keep
their work and private life separate.

110
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,341
So, please don't talk to me at the office
unless it's work-related.

111
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:23,116
Even so, I'm happy
I get to see you every day.

112
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,317
And…

113
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,053
We're outside the office now.

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,521
It's basically the office.

115
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,657
Could it be that you're mad?

116
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,859
I am.

117
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,329
Oh, you must be hungry.

118
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,797
Let's eat.

119
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,067
I told you, I'm not eating
with you anymore.

120
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,644
I really won't.

121
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,392
Why does he have to work under me?

122
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,376
Hey, Tae-o… Sir.

123
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,444
Yes?

124
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,413
My kid replied when I sent your photo.

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,382
-That's rare.
-Yeah, it's been six months.

126
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,252
My daughter's a fan of K-pop.

127
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,987
I know this isn't much of a thanks,

128
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,555
but here.

129
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,991
Is this <i>jogi</i>?

130
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,727
-From where?
-I bought it in Shin-Okubo yesterday!

131
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,128
How do you eat that?

132
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,597
Thank you.

133
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,099
You're such a nice person, Mr. Kamei.

134
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,100
Don't be a stranger.

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,402
You can just call me Kame.

136
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,737
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

137
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,572
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

138
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,407
Yuri, good morning.

139
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,308
Did you eat?

140
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,511
That's not your concern anymore.

141
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,683
Looks tasty.

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,185
I'm going to grill this later.

143
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,363
Can you look over
the Strawberry Farm contract?

144
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,932
-Got it.
-Okay.

145
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,738
-You're okay, right?
-Yes.

146
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,577
You're clearly acting strange
since Tae-o came, Motomiya.

147
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,912
I'm completely fine.

148
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,949
-If you say so.
-Yeah.

149
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,129
How is he that perceptive?

150
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,198
To increase our e-commerce profits,
we'll change our posts

151
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,934
to match the algorithms.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,003
Yeah, the taste and design are important,

153
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,839
but let's be more proactive about
sharing our initiatives.

154
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,874
-Okay.
-Good.

155
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,243
Lunch is here.

156
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,545
-Oh, thanks.
-Thank you.

157
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,647
-Fried rice and <i>babaocai</i>.
-Great, thanks.

158
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,982
-Tae-o.
-Yes, thank you.

159
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,084
-<i>Mapo</i> tofu for Boss.
-Thanks.

160
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,753
The restaurant recommended
the extra spicy one.

161
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,121
-Chili shrimp?
-Me.

162
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,190
-Hanaoka and Kame.
-Thanks.

163
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,027
Here, Boss.

164
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,468
Thank you.

165
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,108
You don't like <i>babaocai</i>?

166
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,009
I do.

167
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,512
But Yuri can't have anything too spicy.

168
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:25,725
Oh, you knew because I never ordered
any spicy food, right?

169
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,060
You have a great memory, Tae-o.

170
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,504
<i>Why does Boss
act so formal around Tae-o?</i>

171
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,942
You sure are amazing, Tae-o.

172
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,948
I'm so tired of this.

173
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,159
Huh? What's the matter?

174
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,529
Oh, Yuri?

175
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,297
Yuri, thank God.

176
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,699
Why are you soaking wet?

177
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,501
Um…

178
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,735
come with me.

179
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,538
What? I told you, I can't.

180
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,274
There's water coming from above.

181
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,375
What?

182
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,309
Well…

183
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,923
Calm down.

184
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,258
Wait.

185
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,336
I don't understand!

186
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,575
When you grill fish, the sprinklers will
go off if you don't run the ventilator.

187
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,476
Be careful.

188
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,778
Okay. I sincerely apologize.

189
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,213
I apologize.

190
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,816
It'll take about two days
to clean the room,

191
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,252
so figure out your own lodging
during that time, okay?

192
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,187
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,621
Yes, sir.

194
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,496
Should we find you a hotel?

196
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:15,501
It's gotten late, so I'll ask my professor
to let me stay over.

197
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,502
Professor?

198
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,838
My professor at the research lab.

199
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,554
He didn't pick up.

200
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,360
Are you okay?

201
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,270
<i>Hello, Iiyama lab.</i>

202
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,506
Senpai, I can't get in touch
with the professor.

203
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,708
He's on a work trip in Hokkaido.

204
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,077
Then please let me stay at your house.

205
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,411
Sure. When?

206
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,347
<i>Right now.</i>

207
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,648
I can't right now.

208
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,084
I'm observing the black hagfish.

209
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,188
You don't have to be there.
Just give me the key.

210
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,122
What?

211
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,333
How was it?

212
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,269
It was no good.

213
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,141
Thank you for this.

214
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,077
No problem.

215
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,886
Is this basically the office too?

216
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,789
This is…

217
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,961
Basically…

218
00:13:53,833 --> 00:14:00,239
I'm doing this as a boss for my employee.

219
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,575
I'm doing this as a boss for my employee.

220
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,245
I'm doing this as a boss for my employee.

221
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:27,433
As a boss, for my employee.

222
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,810
For my employee, as a boss.

223
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,451
As an employee, for my boss.

224
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,120
As an employee, for… What? No!

225
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,464
Yuri?

226
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,968
Did you fall asleep?

227
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,189
What do I do?

228
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,358
I don't want to wake her.

229
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,470
Yuri!

230
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm sorry!

231
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,473
Are you okay?

232
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,113
I've never done this before!

233
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,782
Never done what before?

234
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,665
I fell from the bed. That's all.

235
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,272
Did you fall from the bed? That's cute.

236
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,283
Is something the matter?

237
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,719
My suit is wrinkled.

238
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,389
It's fine if you wear casual wear.

239
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,491
We don't have a dress code.

240
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:20,959
I appreciate it.

241
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,902
Here.

242
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,575
<i>Gamsahabnida</i>

243
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,981
You know "<i>Gamsahabnida</i>," huh?

244
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,785
Yeah, but that's all I know.

245
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,021
That, and "<i>annyeonghaseyo</i>."

246
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,626
"Hello" and "Thank you," huh?

247
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,900
<i>Xie xie.</i>

248
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,336
<i>Khop khun kha.</i> Merci.

249
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,938
Gracias.

250
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,806
What is that?

251
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,376
I realized we know hello and thank you

252
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,147
in quite a few languages
even if we may not speak them.

253
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,052
I think it's kind of wonderful
that the word we know is "Thank you."

254
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,356
I like that side of you.

255
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,431
<i>Gamsahabnida.</i>

256
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,202
But there's one more.

257
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,505
Besides saying hello and thank you,

258
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,408
there's a word you surely know.

259
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,911
What is it?

260
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,748
I wonder.

261
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,023
Yuri?

262
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,127
Yuri, please wait a second.

263
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,598
Like I said, you can't follow me.

264
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,066
But it's the same place.

265
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,536
Things will get really bad
if people see us come to work together.

266
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,307
Whoa, careful!

267
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,848
First, you fell from your bed,

268
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,452
and now you're getting hit by a bike?

269
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,426
Start walking in ten minutes.

270
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,095
And call me Boss at work.

271
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,635
Wait.

272
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,737
She's doing it again.

273
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,313
But she's still cute.

274
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,327
I told you not to follow me!

275
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,740
Who did you think I was?

276
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,578
I didn't think you were anyone.

277
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,290
Almond milk isn't compatible
with Japanese ingredients,

278
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,626
so soy milk or rice milk
might work better.

279
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,895
I'll find a few varieties then.

280
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,197
Thank you.

281
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,466
<i>Gamsahabnida</i>.

282
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,534
<i>Annyeonghaseyo?</i>

283
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,869
-Right?
-What?

284
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,006
Besides those two,
what other Korean words do you know?

285
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,942
Korean words?

286
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,978
<i>Saranghaeyo.</i>

287
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,083
"I love you"?

288
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,154
<i>Te amo.</i>

289
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,257
<i>Je t'aime. Saranghaeyo.</i>

290
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,825
Why are you asking about Korean?

291
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,896
Oh, you were looking up
things about Korea earlier too.

292
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,599
It was just randomly on my mind.

293
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,805
Is that something that just
randomly comes to mind?

294
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,240
Speaking of <i>saranghaeyo</i>,

295
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,075
my boyfriend and I broke up.

296
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,778
What? When?

297
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:39,251
So, a new intern joined the company.

298
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,685
-Right?
-Yes. Huh?

299
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,923
He's a great kid.
He's bright, energetic, and a hard worker.

300
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,592
-I want to meet him soon. I'm so excited.
-Why?

301
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:52,164
I mean, he might be one of the only people
I can love in this world.

302
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,799
You can't.

303
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,768
Why?

304
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,803
Huh?

305
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,937
"Why"?

306
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,541
Well, it would be an office romance.

307
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,578
Hm? Did we have a rule against it?

308
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:11,516
We don't, but it's wrong
when you think about it, right?

309
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,755
Oh, that Hanaoka guy
hates stuff like that, doesn't he?

310
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,156
Yeah.

311
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,591
Exactly.

312
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,500
I'll check the inventory at the store
and let you know.

313
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,801
-Please do.
-Okay.

314
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,973
Oh, Yuri. Is it your lunch break?

315
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,520
I already ate.

316
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,756
Then it's time for dessert.

317
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,124
What?

318
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:06,905
Here.

319
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,175
This is dessert?

320
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,111
You actually haven't eaten lunch, right?

321
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,646
How did you know?

322
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,849
Because your face looks scary.

323
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,223
Thanks.

324
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,158
Let's eat.

325
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,094
Enjoy your meal.

326
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,428
I'm expressing my love.

327
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,002
Is it good?

328
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,105
Yeah, it's good.

329
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,718
I found this in the morning.

330
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,054
Here's a…

331
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,389
present for you, Yuri.

332
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,063
Why?

333
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,198
Yuri.

334
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:49,407
In Korean, Yuri means "glass."

335
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,117
Thank you.

336
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,193
Yuri.

337
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,596
How pretty.

338
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,472
Yeah, glass is pretty.

339
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,578
What do the kanji in your name mean?

340
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,513
Oh, um…

341
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,615
Oh, here.

342
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,939
Someone who can help people.

343
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,844
A place where people can return to.

344
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,816
It means they wanted me
to become that kind of person.

345
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,087
That's lovely.

346
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,718
Hold on.

347
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,324
<i>Even if I look at his eyes
and hear his thoughts,</i>

348
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,159
<i>I don't have to worry about it.</i>

349
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,729
<i>I've never met someone like that.</i>

350
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,831
-Here.
-I need a lot more.

351
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,800
<i>Being with this person
whose thoughts I can't read</i>

352
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,004
<i>puts me at ease, and I enjoy it.</i>

353
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,044
-Tae-o.
-Yes?

354
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,413
Why'd you become an intern at our company?

355
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,216
It's thanks to my professor.

356
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,685
Your professor at grad school, right?

357
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,855
When I was a kid,

358
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,125
he was doing research
at a university in Korea.

359
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,730
He lived next door
and often played with me.

360
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,600
This is a sea otter? It's so cute!

361
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,335
What is it in Japanese?

362
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,971
-A <i>rakko</i>.
-<i>Rakko</i>?

363
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,672
<i>Rakko.</i>

364
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,311
There aren't many, but you can
see them in the wild in Japan.

365
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,046
I'll take you there one day.

366
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,415
Hooray!

367
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,218
I'm home.

368
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,987
-Welcome home.
-Welcome home.

369
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,157
Thanks, Iiyama. Did you eat?

370
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,194
Now that you mention it,
I didn't eat anything today.

371
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,962
That's no good.

372
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,864
You need to get energized!

373
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,203
I'll help you, ma'am.

374
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,538
No, it's okay.

375
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,275
Iiyama, please teach me about sea otters.

376
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,457
Tae-o.

377
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,570
It'll be okay.

378
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,708
When you feel lonely,

379
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,943
you shouldn't be alone.

380
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,427
Tae-o,

381
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,998
do you want to go to Japan with me?

382
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,139
And your dad?

383
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,912
My parents got divorced when I was young,

384
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,381
so I don't know where he is.

385
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,651
But…

386
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,521
the professor is my dad.

387
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,494
By researching
with the professor in Japan…

388
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,364
I got better.

389
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,937
When I felt lost about
what to do after graduation,

390
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,406
this is what the professor said.

391
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,841
We need people who research,

392
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,745
but also people who give shape to those
results and spread them to the world.

393
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,583
I think you could do either
since you are so loved by others.

394
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,023
How do you spread results to the world?

395
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,127
I know several companies
that do such work.

396
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,495
Please tell me.

397
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,999
I… I want to try it.

398
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:57,108
That's why I'm happy
I could join your company.

399
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:11,422
You have your own reason
for coming here, don't you.

400
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,725
What?

401
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,228
Sorry.

402
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,497
It's my landlord.

403
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:21,966
This is Tae-o.

404
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,537
Really? Thank you.

405
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,942
It seems they finished cleaning.

406
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,178
That was faster than I thought.

407
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,154
-Yuri?
-You can go home now.

408
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,056
I'm sure you're busy with your room.

409
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,325
Good work today.

410
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,349
I'm Motomiya, liberal arts.

411
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,253
Hanaoka, you're a business major,

412
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,056
but why are you always taking
environmental studies classes?

413
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,130
I'm in the renewable energy lab,

414
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,735
I'm contemplating if I should
go into research after graduation.

415
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,303
-Why?
-Why?

416
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,074
I don't know if we can fix the environment
through research alone.

417
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,449
Environmental issues

418
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,920
can potentially be fixed
particularly through business.

419
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,689
"Business"?

420
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,631
Tell me more.

421
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:07,338
I have my own reason for being here too.

422
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,159
"Yuri."

423
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,370
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER.
I FEEL ENERGIZED. THANK YOU.

424
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,839
YURI

425
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,214
<i>It's rare for you to come right before
visiting hours end.</i>

426
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,017
I'd be going back to an empty house.

427
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,720
<i>Did you eat?</i>

428
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:56,988
I'll eat when I get home.

429
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,556
<i>Delivery again?</i>

430
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,926
<i>No, you need a home-cooked meal
once in a while.</i>

431
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,496
I've been eating home-cooked meals
quite a bit lately.

432
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,266
<i>-Huh?</i>
-What?

433
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,001
<i>Who cooked for you?</i>

434
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,405
<i>What? Huh?</i>

435
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,140
<i>It's like that, is it?</i>

436
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,542
No, it's not like that.

437
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,312
And I won't be eating them anymore.

438
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,114
<i>You won't?</i>

439
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,586
Oh right, I bought some magazines.

440
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,827
<i>Hot spring sommelier textbook.</i>

441
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,131
<i>Let's find the hot spring
that's best for you.</i>

442
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,734
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

443
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,538
Are you becoming
a hot spring sommelier next?

444
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,479
That's fine and all, but don't ask me
to bring back hot spring water.

445
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,116
I won't do it.

446
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,655
Oh, you're here to visit
Mr. Motomiya, right?

447
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,790
Oh, yes.

448
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,592
Are you not going to see him again?

449
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,095
I just remembered something urgent.

450
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,231
-Excuse me.
-I see.

451
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,469
<i>Yuri!</i>

452
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,144
MAHIRO HAS ADDED TAE-O
TO THE GROUP CHAT

453
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:01,912
Why?

454
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,417
TAE-O'S WELCOME PARTY
IS AT SEVEN P.M.TODAY.

455
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,853
BOSS WILL JOIN TOO!

456
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,555
BOSS WILL JOIN TOO!

457
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,325
Tae-o, welcome to Dolce &amp; Chocolat.!

458
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,828
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

459
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,764
Cheers!

460
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,670
So good!

461
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,271
That's good.

462
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,413
<i>This is what that was about, right?</i>

463
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,249
<i>You better thank me, Yuri.</i>

464
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,752
I didn't ask for this.

465
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,358
Whoa, are you good at drinking?

466
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,026
Yes, I like alcohol.

467
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,161
Do you as well?

468
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:54,098
Well, I'd say I can drink
the most out of anyone here.

469
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,300
So you're the party director.

470
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,668
The director?

471
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:03,441
People like you who have
a strong tolerance and liven up the party

472
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,776
are called the party director in Korea.

473
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,347
Director, huh?

474
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,817
All right, this director
will teach you how to drink.

475
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,019
Tae-o, keep up.

476
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,287
Yes, sir!

477
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,756
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

478
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:23,127
-Let's drink!
-Let's drink!

479
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,831
Kame?

480
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,499
Tae-o.

481
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,934
You're too strong.

482
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,535
Director?

483
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,170
I'm okay.

484
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:38,642
The director can still drink!

485
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,517
Are you okay?

486
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,598
What just happened?

487
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,701
Nothing. He just got drunk.

488
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,873
But I thought Hanaoka
has only been drinking oolong tea.

489
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,077
It's from earlier when this happened.

490
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,078
What?

491
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,815
He got drunk just from that?

492
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,316
He can't even have a drop.

493
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,920
And when he gets drunk,
he drops everything and leaves.

494
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,390
That's the only cute thing about him.

495
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,092
Oh, Tae-o, come here.

496
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,294
Sit by me.

497
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,462
-Don't be shy.
-What?

498
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,197
Come on, Tae-o.

499
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,633
How about we call it a night?

500
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,305
You can come to work
in the afternoon tomorrow, so rest up.

501
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,677
Thank you.

502
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,782
MESSAGE FROM TAE-O

503
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,118
<i>Would you like to get some ice cream?</i>

504
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,321
Why ice cream?

505
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,197
IN KOREA, GETTING INVITED TO ICE CREAM
MEANS HE WANTS TO BE ALONE WITH YOU!

506
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,033
HE WANTS TO BE ALONE WITH YOU.
IT'S HOW MEN MAKE A MOVE!

507
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,381
Here is your receipt.

508
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,682
Thank you.

509
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,292
TAE-O

510
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:14,899
Yuri.

511
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,367
I found you.

512
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,102
How? Where did you come from?

513
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,703
Let's get ice cream.

514
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,604
I will not.

515
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,574
I am the CEO.

516
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,810
I can't get overly close with an employee.

517
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,513
Okay.

518
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,117
You came to our company
with a goal in mind, right?

519
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,886
If anything happens,
you can't sign with us.

520
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,288
Yes.

521
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,222
So…

522
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,256
I'm sorry.

523
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,492
What?

524
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,595
I finally understand.

525
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,900
You were doing this
for my sake, weren't you?

526
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,105
I like how you usually are,

527
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,541
but I like your CEO side too.

528
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,876
You look cool.

529
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,617
I'm proud of you.

530
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,856
Thanks.

531
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,291
But that's why…

532
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,192
Director!

533
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,362
Yeah, right?

534
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,431
I drank a lot.

535
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,003
We can't let them see us, right?

536
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,973
Smell this. It's nice.

537
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,975
That's so nice!

538
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,843
Just what you'd expect from Hanaoka.

539
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,128
-Let's get <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen.
-Yeah!

540
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,899
Keeping a boss and intern dynamic
in the office is fine.

541
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:01,305
I'll only talk about work in the office.

542
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,707
Instead of saying Yuri,

543
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,844
I'll call you Boss.

544
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,215
Thanks.

545
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,952
But in exchange, from now on,

546
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,121
when we're outside,

547
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:23,060
you'll make lots of time
for just the two of us, right?

548
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,403
H-Hey.

549
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,873
Are you doing this on purpose?

550
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,174
Doing what?

551
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,981
It's nothing.

552
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,155
But…

553
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,361
I'm doing this
because I want you to like me.

554
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,595
What?

555
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,367
After all, I'm a 26-year-old man.

556
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,105
So, hurry.

557
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,776
Fall in love with me.

558
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,446
What?

559
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,234
Subtitle translation by: Chul Woong Kim

<i>It's not like that.</i>

561
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,671
<i>He acts differently with the boss.</i>

562
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,107
<i>There's a lot of evidence here.</i>

563
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,175
Be careful.

564
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,676
You just gotta try it.

565
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,710
How many times?

566
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,912
Please go on a date with me.

567
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,280
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

568
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,247
I don't get it.
