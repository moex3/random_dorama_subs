1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,384
TAE-O HAS SENT A STAMP

2
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,685
GOOD MORNING

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,589
<i>Good morning, Yuri.</i>

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:24,891
<i>Have you woken up yet?</i>

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,526
Good morning.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,101
<i>It was so cold last night.</i>

7
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,671
<i>Were you able to sleep well?</i>

8
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,775
<i>I hope you didn't catch a cold.</i>

9
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,511
<i>Did you have breakfast?</i>

10
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,280
<i>I'm making some right now.</i>

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,990
TAE-O HAS SENT A PHOTO

12
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,572
TAE-O HAS SENT A PHOTO

13
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,407
What is it this time?

14
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,085
That looks so tasty.

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,790
<i>I always have this
after a night of drinking.</i>

16
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,828
<i>I wish I could share some with you.</i>

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>It's very cold outside today.</i>

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,645
<i>Keep warm and try not to catch a cold.</i>

19
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,720
HAVE A GOOD DAY

20
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,722
This is…

21
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,059
kind of a lot.

22
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,949
Let's do our best.

23
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,854
Please wait for me!

24
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,627
Good morning.

25
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,029
Good morning.

26
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,473
<i>Please treat me
like your boss at the office.</i>

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,644
I'll only talk about work in the office.

28
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,612
Instead of saying Yuri,

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,215
I'll call you Boss.

30
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,458
U-Um, about those texts this morning…

31
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,375
We'll be in trouble if you say any more.

32
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,613
We're at the office.

33
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,716
"We're at the office…"?

34
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,191
What?

35
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,365
In the office,

36
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,835
our relationship is a secret.

37
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,176
Bye.

38
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,912
Wait!

39
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,514
Wait there.

40
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,991
Good morning.

41
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,393
It's not like that!
You've got it all wrong.

42
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,567
What was that?

43
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,336
Nothing.

44
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,673
Yes?

45
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,574
Take a look.

46
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,010
They are behind schedule by a week.

47
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,979
-Try giving them a call.
-Okay.

48
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,649
Tae-o, the Valentine's task
I gave you earlier--

49
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,716
Here it is.

50
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,321
-Thanks, you're so efficient--
-I'm working right now.

51
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,427
Do you need anything else, Boss?

52
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,665
That's okay. Thanks.

53
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,533
Understood!

54
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,842
The new coffee beans
from Colombia just came in!

55
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,680
-Is it really from Colombia?
-I'm positive.

56
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,783
We got three types.

57
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,852
It smells nice.
I wonder what it tastes like?

58
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,820
Let's all try some.

59
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,954
Then I'll--

60
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,257
Sorry.

61
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,558
I'm working right now.

62
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,032
Did his personality change?

63
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,470
It's weird how he acts
differently with the boss.

64
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,475
<i>Could this be…</i>

65
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,813
-<i>Workplace harassment?!</i>
-No!

66
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,916
-No?
-Huh?

67
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,751
-What do you mean?
-Boss?

68
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,220
-What were you saying "no" to?
-What?

69
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,922
-No.
-What?

70
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,423
-We're not done yet.
-Oh, right.

71
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,625
Right, right.

72
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,593
Boss?

73
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,561
Yes?

74
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,047
Oh, Tae-o, um…

75
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,116
Can we talk?

76
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,719
I-I'm working right now.

77
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,457
What is this?

78
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,227
Coffee is ready.

79
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,129
-Oh nice.
-Thanks.

80
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,130
-Thank you.
-Okay.

81
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,799
-Aihara, can you help?
-Yes.

82
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,867
Tae-o.

83
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,838
This smells amazing.

84
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,448
What? Where are they going?

85
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,194
Be careful.

86
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,896
Yes, I know.

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,565
At the office, I'm just an intern.

88
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,300
What?

89
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,703
What do you mean?

90
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,472
Huh?

91
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,940
Well um…

92
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,576
It's almost Valentine's Day.

93
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,912
Our workers tend to
work themselves too hard.

94
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,314
You should take care too.

95
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,585
So that's what you meant.

96
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,288
Thank you, I'll do my best.

97
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,723
Is there anything else?

98
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,192
Anything else?

99
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,860
Like what?

100
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,797
Things on your mind or any issues.

101
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,133
Issues?

102
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,402
Hanaoka told you too, right?

103
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,838
If things go smoothly, you sign with us.

104
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,574
Hanaoka doesn't go easy on people.

105
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,777
He'll cut out anyone who mixes
work and private affairs.

106
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,614
No, nothing at all.

107
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,216
There aren't any issues.

108
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:05,985
Really?

109
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,225
Everything's totally fine.

110
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,862
-Well then, keep it up.
-Okay.

111
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,068
That was close.

112
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,871
Really close.

113
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,386
-Aihara, thanks.
-Yup.

114
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,693
What happened?

115
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,841
Hanaoka?

116
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,756
What?

117
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,803
Why is she staring?
He'll find out about us.

118
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,344
I don't get it.

119
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,558
Hello, Dolce &amp; Chocolat..

120
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,993
Yes.

121
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:57,730
Okay.

122
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,601
Um…

123
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,204
Hello, this is Aihara
from Dolce &amp; Chocolat..

124
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,406
It's good to hear from you.

125
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,777
-Yes.
-I can't. Senpai.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,114
Yes.

127
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,450
I really can't go over there.

128
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,417
Right…

129
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,318
Please.

130
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,225
Yes, excuse me.

131
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,497
Hurry up.

132
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,500
My apologies.

133
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,771
We got a call.

134
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,739
What?

135
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,741
They want us to participate in an event.

136
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,342
What?

137
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,645
A call about an event.

138
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,880
-A call about an event.
-An event? From where?

139
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,818
The Chocolat Festival.

140
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,153
Chocolat?

141
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,455
The Chocolat Festival?!

142
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,391
Yes.

143
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,363
Hello, this is Motomiya.

144
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,601
The Chocolat Festival
is finally calling for us.

145
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,104
What kind of festival is it?

146
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:17,343
A Valentine's Day fair that only invites
the crème de la crème of Japan's shops.

147
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,078
Crème de la crème?

148
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,548
He means the shops
are specially selected.

149
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,853
But it's being held
the week after next, right?

150
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,425
Yes, it seems the shop they originally
chose suddenly dropped out.

151
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,027
How lucky! I'm excited for us.

152
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:40,866
But we're only allowed to have
a booth on one condition.

153
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,302
A condition?

154
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,405
Before the day of the event,

155
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,875
we need to make a new limited-edition
product for just the event.

156
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,877
A new product?

157
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,647
We only have eight days.

158
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,751
Eight days? That's pretty tough.

159
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:05,257
But this is our chance
to reach out to new customers.

160
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,730
So, I want to accept their offer.

161
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,335
Any thoughts?

162
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,840
<i>Will we make it in time?</i>

163
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,343
<i>I don't want to settle for
something second-rate.</i>

164
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,517
Is it okay if I think up
some ideas for the new product too?

165
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,353
We need to do market research too.

166
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,756
I'll do everything I can
to think of a new product.

167
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,363
Okay then.

168
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,932
I'll re-examine our past recipes too.

169
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,167
-Thank you.
-Sure.

170
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,270
Okay, let's be efficient
and split the work.

171
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,105
Don't try to do it all alone.

172
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,874
-Okay.
-Okay.

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,475
All right, let's get to it.

174
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,447
How about this?
Our theme will be the Earth and diversity.

175
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,250
For example,
we'll make animal-shaped chocolate

176
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,120
and use salt-flavored chocolate
to represent marine life.

177
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,558
Well, it's a good idea,

178
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:18,097
but unfortunately it's missing the most
important thing for Valentine's Day.

179
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,433
The most important thing
for Valentine's Day?

180
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,304
Well, if I had to say it
in one word… Romance?

181
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,540
Romance?

182
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,440
That's true.

183
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,478
This chocolate should give you
a bit of courage.

184
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,248
It must empower you
to tell your crush how you feel.

185
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,085
That kind of romantic energy is important.

186
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,591
Nishina, do you have time?

187
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,561
-Yes, I'll go now.
-Okay.

188
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,629
Excuse me.

189
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,874
"Your crush"…

190
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,477
You have someone you like too, right?

191
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,545
What?

192
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,548
<i>Soondubu</i>. Sea otters. <i>Saranghaeyo</i>.

193
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,685
There's a lot of evidence here.

194
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,453
No, it's not like that.

195
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,422
It's this part here.

196
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,490
Can you check the writing?

197
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,892
Sure.

198
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,997
I can't tell what he's thinking at all.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,970
Romance. Confusion. Anxiety.

200
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,606
Overflowing passion.

201
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,641
Intense jealousy.

202
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,351
Yuri, love is just like chocolate.

203
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,786
Okay.

204
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,256
You don't get butterflies
from predictable flavors.

205
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,192
That unpredictability
is why you get curious,

206
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,694
frustrated, and want to know more.

207
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,399
And when you can't hold back
your curiosity anymore…

208
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,103
You just gotta try it.

209
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,116
How is it? Sweet? Bitter?

210
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,931
Did something happen, Tae-o?

211
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,932
You seem down.

212
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,368
I'm really tired.

213
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,405
Is it that hard being an intern?

214
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,775
The work is fun.

215
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,413
The people at the office are nice too.

216
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,447
But…

217
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,415
But?

218
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,050
Is it what I think it is?

219
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,852
Yes.

220
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,122
It's love. I've fallen in love.

221
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,559
-That's what this is?
-Love?

222
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,861
Is that true, Tae-o?

223
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,365
Seriously? What kind of person is she?

224
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,204
She looks really happy when she eats.

225
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,408
She's scary when she's hungry,

226
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,146
but she's warm-hearted and kind.

227
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,882
Bravo.

228
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,452
That's magnificent, Tae-o.

229
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,554
Congratulations.

230
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,760
Sorry, I got so excited
that the humidity went up.

231
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,864
But it's not going well.

232
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,901
I'd actually like to get closer to her.

233
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,404
I want to have meals with her.

234
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,743
But, even after sending all those texts,

235
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,245
she doesn't reply to me.

236
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,481
How much is a lot?

237
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,850
About once every 15 minutes?

238
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,284
That's a bit…

239
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:00,853
Annoying.

240
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,022
Annoying? Is that a compliment?

241
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,992
No, I wouldn't say that.

242
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,367
Octopi reproduce only once in their life.

243
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,172
So, to grab hold of
their first and last love,

244
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,976
they must win a fierce fight and do
everything they can to show their charms.

245
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:30,516
Embarrassingly enough, I'm not well-versed
on human courtship behavior,

246
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,221
but your straightforward personality
is the most charming thing about you.

247
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,823
I know this well.

248
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,562
So, just like this octopus,

249
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,735
why don't you do as you always do,
and dive head first into that love?

250
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,105
Octopi?

251
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,314
Oh, what does she do?

252
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,318
She's a co-worker.

253
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,620
What?

254
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,661
Thank you. I'll do my best.

255
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:17,863
You're leaving?

256
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,565
Good work today!

257
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,540
Hey, Dad.

258
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,878
Has Mom ever given you
Valentine's Day chocolate?

259
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>Is this about the guy
you mentioned the other day?</i>

260
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,252
No, that's different.

261
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,187
This is about work.

262
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:43,622
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

263
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,058
Isn't it obvious?

264
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,896
<i>Hmm, let me think…</i>

265
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,132
<i>A spoon.</i>

266
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,733
Spoon?

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,401
<i>A spoon-shaped chocolate.</i>

268
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,671
<i>In return, she wanted my</i> omurice<i>.</i>

269
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,941
<i>She said that is the message
she wanted to convey.</i>

270
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,044
For real? That sounds so cute.

271
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,047
But that's nice.

272
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,050
A message, huh?

273
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,389
Okay, I'm heading back now.

274
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,560
<i>Yuri, don't push yourself too hard.</i>

275
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,363
Yes, I know.

276
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>It's not all bitter.</i>

277
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,600
<i>It depends on you.</i>

278
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,936
Rather than bitter, make it sweet.

279
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,504
Right?

280
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,239
<i>Exactly.</i>

281
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,778
I'll take you back. Here we go.

282
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,630
<i>What does she do?</i>

283
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,832
She's a co-worker.

284
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,402
A co-worker?

Yuri!

289
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,803
I bought some magazines.

290
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,772
Are you becoming
a hot spring sommelier next?

291
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,445
That's fine and all, but don't ask me
to bring back hot spring water.

292
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,516
What was that?

301
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,804
It'll energize you.

302
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,572
Here.

303
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,078
I could go for some <i>soondubu</i>.

304
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:57,783
Yes?

305
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,960
Hello?

306
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,143
What? Why're you here at this hour?

307
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,212
I thought…

308
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,950
you might still be working.

309
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,487
So I brought this.

310
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,155
-Here.
-What?

311
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,990
It's <i>soondubu</i>.

312
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,026
<i>Soondubu</i>.

00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,196
God!

314
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,465
-No.
-Why?

315
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,266
We're mixing work and private life.

316
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,106
I knew it.

317
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,341
That's why you've been
acting strange all day.

318
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,310
Strange?

319
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,980
What part of me was strange?

320
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,515
All of it.

321
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,052
Well, I wouldn't say strange,

322
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,822
but I want you to act more normal.

323
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,491
Normal?

324
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,060
By that, I mean…

325
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,164
Just like you do with everyone else.

326
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,004
I can't do that.

327
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,972
Why?

328
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,107
I can't treat you like I treat them.

329
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,012
Boss…

330
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,287
Yuri, you're special to me.

331
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,262
Well then, I'll be off now.

332
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,696
You're leaving already?

333
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,139
I got these on the way here.

334
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,310
I picked these up.

335
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,481
Picked them up?

336
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,393
Goodbye, Boss.

337
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,335
He picked these up?

338
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,715
YURI MOTOMIYA

339
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,485
I ALWAYS HAVE THIS
AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING

340
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,220
HAVE A GOOD DAY

341
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,959
Maybe I'm annoying after all.

342
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,446
That was delicious.

343
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,037
THANK YOU.

344
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,582
YURI MOTOMIYA HAS SENT A MESSAGE

345
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,617
She texted me!

346
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,390
<i>Thank you. The</i> soondubu <i>was very good.</i>

347
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,533
<i>I feel energized.</i>

348
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,835
<i>Thank you for the flowers too.</i>

349
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,157
<i>Those flowers are called Linaria.</i>

350
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,394
<i>Do you know what Linaria means
in the language of flowers?</i>

351
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,930
"Language of flowers"?

352
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,269
<i>Try looking it up.</i>

353
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,174
Linaria.

354
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,909
Language of flowers…

355
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,247
LINARIA IN LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS

356
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,484
1. NOTICE MY LOVE FOR YOU
2. ILLUSION

357
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,559
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

358
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,064
She read it.

359
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:21,773
She read it.

360
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,443
Will she reply?

361
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,914
Will she send a reply?

362
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,585
"This is how I feel."?

363
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,222
1. NOTICE MY LOVE FOR YOU

364
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,323
2. ILLUSION

365
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,425
Which is it?

366
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,968
I don't know.

367
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,612
Language of flowers, huh?

368
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,021
Edible flowers?

369
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,158
If we sell chocolate
with edible flower toppings,

370
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,094
customers can choose based on
the message they want to convey.

371
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,263
It's perfect for Valentine's Day.

372
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,598
A message…

373
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,400
The language of flowers?

374
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,368
Yes.

375
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:28,640
For example, this red rose
means love and affection.

376
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,675
This one is respect.

377
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,777
Friendship.

378
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,447
Good luck.

379
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,382
Familial love.

380
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,755
This might let us express
feelings that are usually hard to share.

381
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,190
Thoughts?

382
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,460
Mahiro?

383
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,698
Sounds good. I'll make samples right away.

384
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,235
-Our suppliers and the packaging--
-I'll figure that out.

385
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,303
Let's get started.

386
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,204
-Okay.
-Okay.

387
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,271
Kame.

388
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,108
Tae-o, can you erase the board?

389
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,075
Okay.

390
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,047
-Thanks.
-Sure.

391
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,519
Thank you.

392
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,842
Welcome.

393
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,311
As a gift…

394
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,816
-Please take a look while you wait.
-This would suit you…

395
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,086
May we interest you in chocolate
modeled after the language of flowers?

396
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,556
HIBISCUS, NEW LOVE

397
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,359
Would you like some chocolate
with edible flowers on top?

398
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,460
We have samples!

399
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,594
We made it in time.

400
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,762
Give it a try.

401
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,497
Thanks to everyone's hard work.

402
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,966
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

403
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,202
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

404
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,571
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

405
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,108
<i>Language of flowers?</i>

406
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,178
<i>I'd love to give this to my crush.</i>

407
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,613
<i>I'll work up the courage
to confess my feelings.</i>

408
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,081
A red rose, please.

409
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,818
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

410
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,053
-Nishina, order up.
-Thanks.

411
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,089
We're getting good reviews
on social media too.

412
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,392
Thank goodness.

413
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,964
I'm surprised such a romantic idea
came from Yuri.

414
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,732
-True.
-No, um…

415
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,935
Keep up the good work.

416
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,018
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

417
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,354
Please take one, if you'd like.

418
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,889
Maybe I'll buy one too.

419
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,426
But didn't you two break up?

420
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,529
Yes, so it's for whoever I meet next.

421
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,131
But Valentine's Day
is only ten days away--

422
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,967
That's more than enough time.

423
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,937
Then I'll buy this one.

424
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:13,838
What?

425
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,274
You have someone to give that too?

426
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,976
Yes, I do.

427
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,111
-You do?
-No way. Who?

428
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,881
That's…

429
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,550
a secret.

430
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,188
What? Hold on there. Why?

431
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,691
Tae-o.

432
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,661
Oh, Senpai, you're here!

433
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,196
Who is she?

434
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,066
She's a co-worker, right?

435
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,837
Oh, yeah. I'll introduce you.

436
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:51,809
Um…

437
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,615
This is our CEO and Mahiro.

438
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,550
Mahiro?

439
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,721
He's my senior at university.

440
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,890
Dr. Onoda.

441
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,558
Doctor?

442
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,427
Hello, nice to meet you.

443
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,962
Thank you for watching over Tae-o.

444
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,497
Nice to meet you.

445
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,632
Would you like a sample?

446
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,533
Please.

447
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,402
Oh, thank you.

448
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,170
HIBISCUS, NEW LOVE

449
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,406
Hibiscus?

450
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,141
Are these edible flowers?

451
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,042
Yes.

452
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,445
They mean "new love"
in the language of flowers.

453
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,315
New love?

454
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,787
I see.

455
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,132
Was it not to your liking?

456
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,701
Oh, it's not that.

457
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,374
I've never had chocolate this good before.

458
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,814
Thank you.

459
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,752
Well then, please take good care of Tae-o.

460
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,128
A doctor, huh?

461
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,364
I wouldn't mind that.

462
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,235
She seems nice.

463
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,604
Give it your best.

464
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,373
Okay.

465
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,712
Thank you so much
for taking on our request

466
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,780
on such short notice.

467
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,848
It's our pleasure.

468
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,018
We've always had our sights set
on the Chocolat Festival.

469
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,920
We're truly honored. Thank you.

470
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,056
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

471
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,260
This language of flowers
chocolates is lovely.

472
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,330
The customers loved them too.

473
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,099
I'm so glad we invited you.

474
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,368
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

475
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,537
-We'll be in your care.
-Thank you.

476
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,544
We pulled it off.

477
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,580
What a relief.

478
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,050
I'm really glad.

479
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,453
We finally made it here.

480
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,989
Thank you, really.

481
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,697
I'll finish up here.
Head back to the office first.

482
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
Isn't there other work piling up?

483
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,904
Thanks, I'll leave it to you.

484
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,141
-Thank you.
-Please give it a try.

485
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:41,746
The coffee has an acidic taste,
so it pairs well with this chocolate.

486
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,956
I'm so hungry.

487
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:57,962
God?

488
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:04,902
Hanaoka.

489
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,607
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

490
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,110
Which do you want?

491
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,447
-Are you sure?
-You still haven't eaten, right?

492
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,715
Thank you.

493
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,052
Then let's do this fair and square.

494
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,955
Rock, paper, scissors…

495
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,457
shoot!

496
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,432
Hooray! Then I'll take this one.

497
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,200
-Okay.
-Yup.

498
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,202
I'm so hungry.

499
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,841
Thanks for the food.

500
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,291
Our profits today
are the best we've ever had.

501
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,995
We gotta keep up the pace
until Valentine's Day.

502
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,632
But be careful.

503
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,903
You've always pushed yourself like that.

504
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,206
If you get sick,
it'll only cause me trouble.

505
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,808
Yes, I'll be careful.

506
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,178
Thank you, as always.

507
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,654
That's cute.

508
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,592
Yeah, it was a gift.

509
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,829
Is that where you got
the language of flowers idea from?

510
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,633
Oh, right.

511
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,939
It's thanks to these flowers.

512
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,549
Coming.

513
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:36,954
Good evening.

514
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,925
Why are you here, Boss?

515
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,862
This is from the other day.

516
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,766
I still haven't thanked you properly.

517
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,036
Thank you.

518
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,673
For the <i>soondubu</i> and the flowers.

519
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,412
The Chocolat Festival went well
thanks to you, Tae-o.

520
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,685
Thank you so much.

521
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,189
Bye, then.

522
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,791
Hold on!

523
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,395
I'll walk you home.

524
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,197
It's dangerous.

525
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,938
Okay, if you insist.

526
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,608
One second.

527
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,513
How is your health?

528
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,917
Hanaoka said everyone falls ill

529
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,454
when Valentine's Day comes.

530
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,358
I'm fine.

531
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,026
That's great.

532
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:51,929
I'm glad.

533
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,867
You're finally back to your usual self.

534
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,671
It's because this isn't the office.

535
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,443
Or is this considered the office?

536
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,244
Is this okay?

537
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,312
It's fine.

538
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:15,986
More importantly, I want you
to treat me normally at the office too.

539
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,858
I want you to call me Boss.

540
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,862
But other than that, I prefer
that you be your usual self.

541
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,398
Really? Is that really okay?

542
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,200
Yeah.

543
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,303
What a relief.

544
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,476
Honestly, I tried really hard.

545
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,145
It was really tiring.

546
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,014
Why'd you push yourself so hard?

547
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,651
I wanted to keep our secret.

548
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,059
Because I don't want to trouble you, Yuri.

549
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,766
Am I annoying?

550
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,335
No, not annoying.

551
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:09,940
Well, there were a lot of texts though.

552
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,010
How many times can I text you?

553
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,678
It's not about how many times.

554
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,651
Wait right here.

555
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,276
Here. This is for the<i> soondubu</i>.

556
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,243
Oh.

557
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,212
Thank you.

558
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,351
Let's eat.

559
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,820
Let's eat.

560
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,632
This is delicious.

561
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,570
Ice cream tastes great
in the winter, doesn't it?

562
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,839
Yes, I know what you mean.

563
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,144
Can I…

564
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,014
ask for one favor?

565
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,886
I did my best.

566
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,888
I did my very best, so…

567
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,692
Yuri.

568
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,362
Please go on a date with me.

569
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:48,906
I understand that things are busy
right now, so once Valentine's Day ends,

570
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,675
I want to have a meal with you.

571
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,411
A meal?

572
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,783
Well, that much I can do.

573
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,819
Really?

574
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:06,690
Okay then.

575
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,792
Promise me.

576
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,219
Can I let go now?

577
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,087
No.

578
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,829
Please stamp your seal here.

579
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,966
My seal?

580
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,046
Follow my lead.

581
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,721
Now we've made a copy.

582
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,189
A copy?

583
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,159
This is how we do things in Korea.

584
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,398
This is what we do
when we make an important promise.

585
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,635
An important promise?

586
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,539
Now, let's do it again.

587
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,877
I wrote a sign on there too.

588
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,345
A sign?

589
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:09,847
What kind?

590
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,149
A secret sign.

591
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,990
Done.

592
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,129
<i>Yaksok.</i>

593
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>Yaksok?</i>

594
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,170
A promise?

595
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,307
Make sure you remember, okay?

596
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,752
Thank you very much.

597
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,389
Things turned out great
because of your flowers.

598
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,224
Glad to hear it

599
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,193
Thank you so much.

600
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,561
Thank you.
