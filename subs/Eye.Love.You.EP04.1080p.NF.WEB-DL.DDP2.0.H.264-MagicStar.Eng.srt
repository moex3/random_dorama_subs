1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,546
Yuri. Please go on a date with me.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,517
I understand that things are busy
right now, so once Valentine's Day ends,

3
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,053
I want to have a meal with you.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,022
<i>Yaksok.</i>

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,126
Once Valentine's Day ends…

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,164
I wonder which day he meant.

7
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,103
This is so cute!

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,873
I've never heard of this game.

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,475
You feed your sea otter and raise it.

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,147
Huh? What's happening?

11
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,950
It evolved!

12
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,186
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,789
Looks like they're having fun.

14
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,756
I'll be off.

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,924
Bye then.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,825
Stay safe.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,726
Thank you.

18
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,130
All right.

19
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,206
Oh, Tae-o. Going somewhere?

20
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,208
I'm helping at the Chocolat Festival.

21
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,377
-Okay, good luck.
-Thank you.

22
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,112
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

23
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,748
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,416
Yeah, good luck!

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,551
I'll be off!

26
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,455
Yu… Boss.

27
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,391
H-Hey.

28
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,096
Have you eaten?

29
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:36,996
Yeah.

30
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,366
-By the way…
-Yes?

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,972
About the promise…

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,974
-We'll go.
-Yeah, but…

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,643
Well, um…

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,647
When will we go?

35
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:01,721
Are you perhaps busy
on the night of Valentine's Day?

36
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,425
It's not that busy
on the night of that day.

37
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,162
So it's fine if we meet on the day of.

38
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,065
Then I'd prefer Valentine's Day.

39
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,300
The 14th.

40

41
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,073
What?

42
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,208
Did you forget?

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,346
I haven't forgotten.

44
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,418
Didn't I tell you to take notes
so that you don't forget?

45
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,053
My apologies, Boss.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,555
-I'll be off, Boss.
-Bye.

00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,731

Thank you so much.

50
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,136
Is that where you got
the language of flowers idea from?

51
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,673
It's thanks to these flowers.

-Good morning.

Good morning, Nishina. Have you eaten?

68
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, I did.

69
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,534
Oh, by the way…

70
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,169
He says that to everyone?

71
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,006
-I downloaded the Rakkyun game.
-Good morning.

72
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,274
Really?

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,942
Good morning.

<i>Then I'll buy this one.</i>

75
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,753
You have someone to give that too?

76
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,454
Yes, I do.

77
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,223
<i>No way. Who?</i>

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,658
<i>That's…</i>

79
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,493
<i>a secret.</i>

00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,064
Oh, right. The chocolate.

81
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,634
Hanaoka!

82
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,636
This is bad. The strawberries!

83
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,637
What?

84
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,571
They're late!

85
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,606
What happened?

86
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,242
The ones for next week's dry fruit series?

87
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,610
Yes, exactly!

88
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,212
But production won't make it
if they don't arrive today.

89
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,684
Yes, but the farm owner's wife collapsed
and they've stopped harvesting.

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,486
Well, the couple runs
that small farm on their own.

91
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,989
How much have they harvested so far?

92
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,023
Not sure.

93
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,025
He hung up, saying
he's got his hands full.

94
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,527
What do we do?

95
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,499
Go to the factory and ask them
for a production schedule change.

96
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,301
-Yes.
-I'll go to the farm.

97
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,669
Right now? It's in Tochigi.

98
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,638
-It's our fastest bet.
-Okay.

99
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,674
We might have to help harvest.
Who else can come?

100
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,311
Nishina?

101
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,680
Sorry, I have a PR meeting
in the afternoon.

102
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,848
Okay. Kame?

103
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,184
The Chocolat Fest ends today,
so we have to tidy up.

104
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,385
Oh, right.

105
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,288
I'll go.

106
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,924
Tell me their phone number.

107
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,825
Okay.

108
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,759
For real?

109
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,564
No, I don't want both of us
to be gone on Valentine's Day.

110
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,132
Right.

111
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,201
What a relief.

112
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,803
Then who else is free?

113
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,588
Why are they all staring at me?

114
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,783
By the way,

115
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,653
what time will we get back by?

116
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,056
Depends on the situation,

117
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,526
-but I think we can get back tonight.
-Really?

118
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,761
That's great. I didn't know it was nearby.

119
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,197
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

120
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,149
<i>I'll get back by 7 p.m.
Let's have dinner!</i>

121
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,519
A Valentine's date.

122
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,489
Chocolate!

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,898
What is she doing?

124
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,000
Come here.

125
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,902
Pardon my intrusion.

126
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,073
Was there an incident? An accident?

127
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,726
Thank you.

128
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,094
Of course.

129
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,769
Sorry.

130
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,506
Thanks.

131
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,542
Are you hungry?

132
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,443
Hm?

133
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,815
A soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie.

134
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:37,917
Oh.

135
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,387
I avoid sugar around this time of the day.

136
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,233
Is it good?

137
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,907
I guess.

138
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,975
In Korea,

139
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,180
this is how we feed kids who won't eat.

140
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,636
Is snow a rare sight for you?

141
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,573
No, I'm sending it to the person I like.

142
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,911
Oh, um…

143
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,885
I don't think…

144
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,021
she likes that kind of thing.

145
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,857
"She"?

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,596
It's Motomiya, right?

147
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,165
-No.
-Huh?

148
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,666
Who is Motomiya?

149
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,201
Who could that be?

150
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't understand Japanese.

151
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,738
But…

152
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,609
You're having dinner together?

153
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,078
That's your chance to give it to him.

154
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,546
Right?

155
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,481
It's a date on Valentine's Day, right?

156
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,085
-Yes.
-It'd be crazy not to give him any then.

157
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,554
You have no other choice.

158
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,323
In fact, that's not
where our main problem lies.

159
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,559
Where's our problem?

160
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,995
What chocolate are we giving him?

161
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,229
Oh, right.

162
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,567
I think our Valentine's product would…

163
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,470
To someone who works here?

164
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,038
It's gotta be special.

165
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,008
Special?

166
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,381
After all, someone else
might want to give Tae-o chocolate too.

167
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,515
What?

168
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,451
As for the Chocolat Festival…

169
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,487
She might steal him away from you.

170
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,921
…we should raise them higher.

171
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:00,493
Is there anything
Tae-o likes in particular,

172
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,895
or something you'd like to give him?

173
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,504
Linaria?

174
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,639
Linaria?

175
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,415
Okay, now I get it.

176
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,418
You two were having
a sneaky little romance.

177
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,485
-No…
-Well,

178
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,555
allow me to make something for you.

179
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,359
Chocolate with a top-quality taste
and Linaria in the language of flowers.

180
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,260
Are you sure?

181
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,829
Maybe I'll get someone
to notice me too while I'm at it.

182
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,698
LINARIA IN THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS

183
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:40,866
Who?

184
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:48,674
Oh, did you really find someone new?

185
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:00,152
<i>Bad news!
Hanaoka might have found out about us!</i>

186
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,490
"Found out about us"?

187
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,899
TOBU TOCHIGI CENTRAL HOSPITAL

188
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,537
Thank you.

189
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,375
She's just slightly anemic.

190
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,812
She hit her head when she fell,
so they're running tests,

191
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,949
but I'm glad it was nothing serious.

192
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,518
I see. That's a relief.

193
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,288
The harvest is almost done,
so let's go now and help too.

194
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,258
-Okay.
-But her tests aren't done.

195
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,531
I understand that you're worried,

196
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,834
but it won't make much difference
waiting here or at the farm.

197
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,937
That's true.

198
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,777
I'll stay with her then.

199
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,781
I'll be by her side.

200
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,982
Would that help?

201
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,116
Are you sure?

202
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,685
Okay, then.

203
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,621
Thank you.

204
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,660
Thanks. I'll take care of things there.

205
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,561
Okay.

206
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:17,963
Thank you again.

207
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,064
Let's go.

208
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,309
Onoda, are you into sea slugs now?

209
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,512
Yeah, since my black hagfish paper
is going well.

210
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,951
Oh, I met the person Tae-o likes.

211
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,453
This is our CEO and Mahiro.

212
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,721
Mahiro?

213
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,230
<i>Oh, what does she do?</i>

214
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,399
<i>She's a co-worker.</i>

215
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,300
YURI MOTOMIYA

216
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:03,742
Tae-o likes someone
from the same company, right?

217
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,578
Yes.

218
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,082
W-What was she like?

219
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,483
Well, she-

220
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,751
"C"?!

221
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,886
No, she--

222
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,355
The CEO?! He can't!

223
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,691
No, I'm not saying CEO!

224
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,393
What?

225
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,629
She's a chocolatier.

226
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,700
A chocolatier?

227
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,902
She seems nice.

228
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,871
Her chocolate was good.

229
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,342
I see. A chocolatier.

230
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,945
So, it's not the CEO, right?

231
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,814
Yes.

232
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,817
Bravo!

233
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,619
Sorry.

234
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,953
The humidity went up.

235
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,123
MAHIRO IKEMOTO HAS SENT A MESSAGE

236
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,031
<i>Hello, it's Mahiro Ikemoto.</i>

237
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,868
<i>I wanted to ask for your advice, Onoda.</i>

238
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,403
Mahiro?

239
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,738
What is it?

240
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,308
Well, I got a text
from the person Tae-o likes.

241
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,478
From the chocolatier?

242
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,982
I wonder…

243
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,617
What is this about?

244
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,487
There's no mistaking it.

245
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:26,191
She wants love advice from you,
as she surely must like Tae-o as well.

246
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,594
So it's mutual?

247
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,929
Of course it is.

248
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,766
With that lovable smile and personality,

249
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,103
any living being
would fall for a guy like that.

250
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,474
Then she should just tell Tae-o directly.

251
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,143
I take back my bravo, Onoda.

252
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,149
She is an African crested porcupine.

253
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,619
An African crested porcupine?

254
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,489
The African crested porcupine
is easily frightened

255
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,793
and covers its whole body in quills
to intimidate others.

256
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,797
Her back may be covered in sharp quills.

257
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,101
So, give her a push from behind.

258
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,737
Gently.

259
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,618
All right.

260
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,761
<i>I can spare some time
if it's after 9 p.m. today.</i>

261
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,066
9 p.m. on Valentine's Day?

262
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,268
He's definitely interested.

263
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,206
I got this in the bag.

264
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,583
-I'll take it.
-Okay.

265
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,720
-Got it.
-Thanks.

266
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,156
This is the last.

267
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,758
Thank you.

268
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,793
What time will you get to Tokyo?

269
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,962
I think I'll get there a bit past six.

270
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,963
Got it.

271
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,464
Thank you.

272
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,600
Thanks for your help.

273
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
I'm home, dear.

274
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,980
How were the tests?

275
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,349
They were all good.

276
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,117
I just need some rest.

277
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,219
Really? What a relief.

278
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,622
Thank you so much.

279
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,524
I'm glad it was all okay.

280
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,826
I'm sorry for the trouble.

281
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,727
It's fine.

282
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,362
The shipment went out okay.

283
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,532
We'll be leaving now.

284
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,700
Please take care.

285
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,701
Goodbye.

286
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,743
Excuse me.

287
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
I'd like to thank you somehow.

288
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,014
It's fine.

289
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,482
Please stay for dinner.

290
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,716
No, dinner is--

291
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,119
-Just stay the night.
-What?

292
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,822
I can't stay the night.
I need to return by seven.

293
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:10,722
Do you have plans?

294
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,692
Well…

295
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,929
Of course he does. It's Valentine's Day.

296
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,164
No.

297
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:23,302
Of course, a great guy like him
would have a date on Valentine's.

298
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,206
No, I don't have any plans today.

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,507
We'll stay over.

300
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,777
Please, come in then.

301
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,655
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

302
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,790
HE DEFINITELY FOUND OUT

303
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,259
OH NO

304
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,797
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

305
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,332
HANAOKA

306
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,375
Hello?

307
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,145
The strawberries were sent out.

308
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,616
Oh, what a relief. Thanks, got it.

309
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,154
And we're staying here tonight.

310
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,322
Oh… What? Staying there?

311
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,824
Tae-o too.

312
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,227
Oh, um… I see.

313
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,364
<i>So, um…</i>

314
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,832
Bye then.

315
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,900
Wait a sec--

316
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,841
Yes?

317
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,812
Boss, is Tae-o coming back today?

318
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,713
What?

319
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,052
Oh, I just got a call
saying they won't make it back today.

320
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,457
Does that mean you got a call from Tae-o?

321
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,529
No, it was from Hanaoka.

322
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,499
Really?

323
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,334
Understood.

324
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,844
All done.

325
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,513
Put that down.

326
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,581
But…

327
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,816
I'll do it, so hurry to bed now.

328
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,184
Yes, okay.

329
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,686
I'll carry it.

330
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,687
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

331
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,788
Over here.

332
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,523
Relax.

333
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,491
FATE

334
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,028
I'm sorry about today.

335
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,865
Since you're here, let's drink up.

336
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,037
Hanaoka can't drink alcohol.

337
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,273
I can't drink today either.

338
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,641
Oh, really? Then…

339
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,648
You two can have some tea.

340
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,321
Thank you.

341
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,389
Here you go.

342
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,690
Thank you.

343
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,229
Tae-o.

344
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,398
My bad.

345
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,535
I'm always so cold to you.

346
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,773
My bad.

347
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,915
You two can have some tea.

348
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,787
Can you really get this drunk from that?

349
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,422
And yet…

350
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,594
I don't have any charm in my arsenal.

351
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,965
My bad.

352
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,568
He's very strange when he gets drunk.

353
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,971
Sir.

354
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:46,872
Yes?

355
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,043
Even though you were worried
about your wife,

356
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,880
we came in and made you pick strawberries.

357
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,351
We sincerely apologize.

358
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,720
What happened to "My bad"?

359
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:06,591
Compared to me, you're so kind, Tae-o.

360
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:13,398
You're such a cute, kind little guy.

361
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,769
And yet I'm…

362
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,373
I forgive you, so please sleep.

363
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,111
Listen up, Tae-o.

364
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,249
You're a good kid.

365
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,219
But you know…

366
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,089
Even so,

367
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,928
that doesn't mean
she'll see you in a romantic way.

368
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,965
What do you mean?

369
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,267
I feel sorry for you.

370
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,308
The person you like…

371
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,913
When it comes to love…

372
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,685
My bad.

373
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,922
Why are you sleeping now?

374
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,129
He's sleeping too?

375
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,799
Hanaoka? Hey.

376
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,642
<i>Yuri.</i>

377
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,544
<i>Yuri?</i>

378
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,481
Oh, sorry, what was that?

379
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,786
<i>Congratulations on finishing
Valentine's Day.</i>

380
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,521
<i>You seem tired.</i>

381
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,891
Yeah, I really am.

382
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Did something happen at work?</i>

383
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,229
No.

384
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,034
<i>Oh, or could it be
you actually found someone you like?</i>

385
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,541
I haven't.

386
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,678
I haven't found anyone.

387
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,183
<i>You're perceptive of others' feelings,</i>

388
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,486
<i>but you don't understand
your own very well.</i>

389
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,525
<i>Or are you resisting them?</i>

390
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,363
What am I resisting?

391
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,000
<i>Your true feelings.</i>

392
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,447
He's Dr. Onoda.

393
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,882
Doctor?

394
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,454
For a doctor, don't look unattainable.
Be approachable.

395
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:56,895
<i>For a doctor, don't do high-class glamor.
Look natural and ephemeral.</i>

396
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:02,734
<i>For a doctor, even while being ephemeral,
show you have a strong will.</i>

397
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,372
Now then, let's go snatch a doctor.

398
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,042
Welcome.

399
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,627
Welcome.

400
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,131
Sorry for being late.

401
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,600
It's okay. I understand.

402
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,235
You're in a busy line of work.

403
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,071
Oh, what would you like?

404
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,172
Water, please.

405
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,240
Water?

406
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,376
I can't drink. I'm still working.

407
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,777
Sorry, I'd like some water.

408
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,878
Yes, sir.

409
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,014
It's okay. I understand.

410
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,850
You never know
when you'll be called in for work.

411
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,752
Here.

412
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,928
What kind of doctor are you, Onoda?

413
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,462
The marine life department.

414
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,664
Is that a thing?

415
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,598
Yes.

416
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,401
You wanted advice?

417
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,071
Oh, let's see…

418
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,444
Actually, my heart
has been pounding recently.

419
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,545
Pounding?

420
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,847
Intensely?

421
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,753
Or is your heart fluttering?

422
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,790
Yes, sort of like that.

423
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,125
I see.

424
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,962
She's hiding her true feelings.

425
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,332
That's a trait that only exists
in humans and not animals.

426
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,801
But she has no need
to hide those feelings.

427
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,071
Do you know why?

428
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,074
Because their feelings are mutual.

429
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,376
Onoda.

430
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,246
Your job is to casually make sure

431
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,649
<i>that they realize this fact.</i>

432
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,687
It's okay.

433
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,857
The heart belongs to you,

434
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,193
more than you may believe.

435
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,363
The heart? My actual heart?

436
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,633
You should try facing it head-on.

437
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,401
That kind of treatment exists?

438
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,169
You don't need treatment.

439
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,871
That fluttering isn't an illness.

440
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,775
You have no need to fear.
You have no need to erect your quills.

441
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,610
Quills?

442
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,415
Are you trying to say

443
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:35,120
that my feelings will be accepted?

444
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,322
I'm sure of it.

445
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,157
You're sure?

446
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,661
Do you understand?

447
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,197
Oh, yes.

448
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,432
It's time for me to go.

449
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,202
Wait, what?

450
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,238
After all, it's a full moon.

451
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,776
Excuse me.

452
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,450
Take this as a thank you for today.

453
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,354
Are you sure?
I love your chocolate. This is great.

454
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,658
It's linaria chocolate I made
just for today, not meant for sale.

455
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:18,396
Please look up what it means
in the language of flowers.

456
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,165
Don't you know?

457
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,132
What?

458
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,269
I know what it means.

459
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,738
Yet you won't tell me what it is?

460
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,806
Huh?

461
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,875
Oh, um…

462
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,312
Please notice

463
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,615
my love for you.

464
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,789
Don't worry. I'm sure it's been noticed.

465
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,228
Now then, please watch over Tae-o.

466
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,534
What?

467
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,612
WHAT HAPPENED?
I HEARD YOU'RE STAYING THE NIGHT

468
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,755
READ

469
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,557
YUN TAE-O

470
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,093
Hello?

471
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,997
<i>I broke our promise.</i>

472
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,066
<i>My bad.</i>

473
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,102
It is what it is.

474
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,838
<i>I couldn't reply either.</i>

475
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,306
<i>My bad.</i>

476
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,679
More importantly,
are things okay with Hanaoka?

477
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,716
I'm not sure, but he's drunk right now.

478
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,317
What? Drunk?

479
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,953
Sorry, hold on.

480
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,359
Open up, Yuri.

481
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,128
What?

482
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,934
Weren't you staying the night?

483
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,702
I made a promise.

484
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,980
But we didn't get to have dinner.
My bad.

485
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,417
Why do you keep talking like that?

486
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,355
Have some strawberries. They were a gift.

487
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,256
Oh.

488
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,660
They look tasty. Thanks.

489
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,297
Well then, good night.

490
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,332
What? You're leaving already?

491
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,270
Are you lonely?

492
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,205
Of course…

493
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,940
not.

494
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,980
I'm sure you're lonely,
but Hanaoka is sleeping right outside.

495
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,419
Oh, then you should go quickly.

496
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:03,428
Dream about me.

497
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,497
What?

498
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,336
I cast a spell.

499
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,639
Dream about me, okay?

500
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,850
I'm sorry, I won't anymore.

501
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,688
Have a good night then.

502
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,123
Wait.

503
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,096
No, it's nothing.

504
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,330
Thanks.

505
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,666
Sleep tight.

506
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,677
Tae-o.

507
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,179
Here.

508
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,258
"<i>Joa</i>"?

509
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,130
Good morning.

510
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,175
<i>Joa haeyo</i> means
"Do you like me?" in Korean.

511
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,444
He said "like."

512
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,749
What do I do?

513
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,052
Yes?

514
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,557
Oh, right.

515
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,628
Good work on your business trip.

516
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:18,529
Thanks.

517
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,405
Hey--

518
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,707
The wife's condition seemed fine,

519
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,077
so their future shipments should be fine.

520
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,147
I see.

521
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:38,850
That's great.

522
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,786
Thanks.

523
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,333
That Valentine gift
isn't for someone special, right?

524
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,807
Well, we work with chocolates.

525
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,576
No, that's not what I meant.

526
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,282
Did you have Mahiro make those?

527
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,686
Oh, um…

528
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,488
Don't abuse your power too much.

529
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,390
It's not like that.

530
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,227
You're not like yourself lately, Motomiya.

531
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,431
How so?

532
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,137
You're not influenced by emotion.

533
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,908
That's why I trust you.

534
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,809
And the company--

535
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,876
I know.

536
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,618
I know that better than anyone.

537
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,660
If you say so.

538
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,508
<i>Can we go on a date today?</i>

539
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,160
You haven't dated anyone
since high school?

540
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,196
Or I guess you could say

541
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:36,267
that guy was my first and last boyfriend.

542
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,102
He's your last one?

543
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:43,040
I don't plan on dating anyone anymore.

544
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,643
I bet he cheated on you. Tell me.

545
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,345
Let's stop talking about me.

546
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,856
I thought you weren't going to
date anymore.

547
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,339
<i>You're not like yourself lately, Motomiya.</i>

548
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,777
You're not influenced by emotion.

549
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,489
Yuri!

550
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,775
Thank you.

551
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:53,878
Sorry to interrupt.

552
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,082
Let's eat.

553
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,283
Enjoy.

554
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:07,725
Um, has Hanaoka noticed anything?

555
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,062
No, don't worry about it, Tae-o.

556
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,297
Really?

557
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,634
Yes. Let's focus on the food. Time to eat.

558
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,850
You're as pretty as always today.

559
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,155
Yesterday,

560
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,594
when I wasn't around, what were you up to?

561
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,899
What was I up to? The same as always.

562
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,301
I worked.

563
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,871
Right, you worked as always. What else?

564
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,040
And I chatted with Mahiro.

565
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,076
I see. You chatted with Mahiro. What else?

566
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,715
Actually, I think Mahiro
found someone she likes.

567
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,118
And how about you?

568
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,956
Have you found someone you like?

569
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,802
I missed you while we were apart, Yuri.

570
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,808
While we were apart,

571
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:35,112
did you somehow become cuter?

572
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,552
What's the matter?

573
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,889
I got too embarrassed.

574
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,998
Thank you.

575
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,972
Is the food good?

576
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,641
Yes, it's delicious.

577
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,411
And what a lovely restaurant.

578
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,514
Nishina told me about it.

579
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,415
What?

580
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,852
I see.

581
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,093
Nishina told you?

582
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,962
I…

583
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,097
I see.

584
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,366
It's okay.

585
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,901
Nishina is my senpai.

586
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,636
That's all.

587
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
I wasn't--

588
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,507
And Nishina is in a relationship.

589
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,541
Like I said…

590
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,078
-What? She's in a relationship?
-Yes.

591
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,547
She told me

592
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,053
they've been dating since high school.

593
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,821
That's so long.

594
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,558
Wait, then what about that chocolate?

595
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,595
They were for her co-workers.
Everyone got some.

596
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,236
Okay, I see now.

597
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,273
Could it be that you're jealous?

598
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,474
No.

599
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,611
Then why does it bother you?

600
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,418
Huh?

601
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,026
Forget about it.

602
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,829
I'm going to the restroom.

603
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,409
"<i>Nareul joa hani kka</i>"?

604
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,414
No, I shouldn't.

605
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,024
<i>You're perceptive of others' feelings,</i>

606
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,760
<i>but you don't understand
your own very well.</i>

607
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,597
<i>Or are you resisting them?</i>

608
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,302
<i>Your true feelings.</i>

609
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,360
-"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"?
-Yes.

610
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,897
Seeing the stars makes me want to sing.

611
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,932
I don't see any.

612
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,367
Jeez.

613
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,435
-Yuri.
-Yes.

614
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,237
This is when it gets romantic.

615
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,241
It's called reading the room.

616
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,643
Oh, right.

617
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,412
Sorry.

618
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,351
I guess I have no choice.

619
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,198
That's…

620
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,235
Yes, I got it at the restaurant earlier.

621
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,925
<i>I already know</i>

622
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,431
<i>why I get jealous over him…</i>

623
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:34,778
<i>and the reason
why I want to know his inner thoughts.</i>

624
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,632
It's gotten romantic now, hasn't it?

625
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,239
Well, then.

626
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,985
<i>I can't resist anymore.</i>

627
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,192
<i>I…</i>

628
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,296

629
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,601

Here.

632
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,188
For me?

633
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:04,968
Bye.

634
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,607
