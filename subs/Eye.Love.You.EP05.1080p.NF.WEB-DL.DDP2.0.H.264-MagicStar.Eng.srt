1
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,320
"<i>Nuna</i>"?

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,224
ALARM

3
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,362
"<i>Nuna…</i>"

4
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,299
What does that mean?

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,174
Good morning!

6
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,475
Good morning.

7
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:49,282
Nuna… Nuna!

8
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,552
Huh?

9
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,956
<i>Nuna?</i>

10
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,733
Look, my daughter's favorite scene
is coming up.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,368
Did she contact you?

12
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,303
No, I found this on her social media.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,907
A father checking their daughter's
social media is terrifying.

14
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>I'm your big sister!</i>

15
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>There's no way you're my big sister!</i>

16
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,217
<i>I'm your big sister.</i>

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,519
Big sister?

19
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,089
Your daughter enjoys this?

20
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,658
You could say she's a genius.

21
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,359
<i>I'm your big sister.</i>

22
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,567
<i>Are you really my big sister?</i>

23
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,435
<i>Big Sis?</i>

24
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>Yes, I'm your big sister!</i>

25
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,340
Hey, doesn't this old guy look like you?

26
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,209
What if I were your <i>nuna</i>--

27
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,010
-I'd hate that.
-Of course.

28
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,879
<i>I never stopped looking for you.</i>

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>Me neither.</i>

30
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,617
Big Sis?

31
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,786
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

32
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,254
Good morning.

33
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,590
The meeting will start in five minutes.

34
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,624
Okay.

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,766
It's thanks to all of you
that we got through the Chocolat Festival.

36
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,336
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,907
On the first day,
we achieved our highest sales ever.

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,475
Business was booming.

39
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,848
Here are the results from the survey
we conducted at the Chocolat Festival.

40
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,016
REASON FOR PURCHASE

41
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,885
As of right now,

42
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,955
our taste and packaging
have brought us plenty of fans.

43
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,826
Now I'd finally like us
to gain recognition for…

44
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,862
environmental friendliness.

45
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,863
It's 7%?

46
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,466
That's surprisingly low.

47
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,803
But our biggest selling point
is that we use discarded cacao.

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,072
It'd be nice if more people knew.

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,344
Now that we have gained
new customers at the Chocolat Festival,

50
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,847
this is our chance to highlight our work.

51
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,686
So, in regards to our seminar next week,

52
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:12,325
I'd like to revise the contents
to fit our ideology more.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,529
And we have Tae-o,
an environmental expert.

54
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,097
Yes.

55
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,735
We reserved a venue at Tae-o's university
so we can target students.

56
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,005
You'll be in charge, Tae-o. Is that okay?

57
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,810
Yes, but if it's possible,

58
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,748
it'd be nice to have something
they can touch and taste.

59
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,251
I see.

60
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:45,692
Maybe they can smell the cacao beans
used for chocolate, or taste cacao nibs.

61
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,360
Nice idea.

62
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,997
So, that's cacao beans and cacao nibs.

63
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,366
And cacao husks, too.
Aihara, get those ready.

64
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,134
Yes, leave it to me.

65
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,903
Nishina, please support Tae-o.

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,071
Okay.

67
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,138
I'll be in your care.

68
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,540
-Ask me anything.
-Okay.

69
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,777
Tae-o, just think of
Nishina as your <i>nuna</i>.

70
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,680
Nishina is your <i>nuna</i>, Tae-o.

71
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
<i>Nuna.</i>

72
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,117
"<i>Nuna</i>"?

73
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,753
You just wanted to show off
what you learned earlier.

74
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,388
-What was that?
-<i>Nuna</i>.

75
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,123
-It's fine, Tae-o.
-<i>Nuna</i>.

76
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,191
Yes, <i>nuna</i>.

77
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,097
<i>Nuna</i>? Big Sis?

78
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,988
BIG SISTER, <i>NUNA</i>

79
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:57,864
<i>NUNA</i> MEANS "BIG SISTER" IN KOREAN

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,066
So it does mean big sister.

81
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,770
WHAT EXACTLY IS A <i>NUNA</i>?

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,643
<i>You hear "</i>nuna<i>" all the time,
but what does it even mean?</i>

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,536
Yeah. I'll do my best.

84
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,974
Tae-o. Here.

85
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:44,977
For me?

86
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,817
To me, Yuri is…

87
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,018
No, wait.

88
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,722
I'm special to Yuri, right?

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,132
Yeah, Senpai?

90
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,934
I heard about the seminar.

91
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:13,373
The professor told me to help out
since you're working so hard.

92
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,274
Oh, in that case,

93
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,078
can you double-check
my facts about the animals?

94
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,580
Got it.

95
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,652
<i>I have time after 3:30 p.m. on Monday.</i>

96
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,121
Then I'll see you at the lab.

97
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,589
Thank you.

98
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,490
Sure.

99
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,091
Oh, right.

100
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,129
Take this as a thank you for today.

101
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,232
It's linaria chocolate I made
just for today, not meant for sale.

102
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,702
Oh, the girl you like gave me chocolate.
Thank her for me.

103
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay.

104
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,041
Huh? What did you say?

105
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,216
The person I like?

106
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,526
Then what is this?

107
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,834
<i>"</i>Nuna<i>" means big sister.</i>

108
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,869
<i>In Korea, the word </i>nuna

109
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,907
<i>refers to your biological sister
or an older woman who you're close with.</i>

110
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,276
"Who you're close with"…

111
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,313
<i>Idols often use this
with older female fans.</i>

112
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,450
-<i>Like, "</i>Nuna<i>, thanks for the letters!</i>
-Fans?

113
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:35,321
<i>A lot of Japanese women feel their heart
skip a beat when they're called</i> nuna<i>.</i>

114
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:40,393
<i>But they actually use </i>nuna <i>a lot
even when you're not a romantic interest.</i>

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,129
<i>So don't let it
get your hopes up, everyone.</i>

116
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,030
Cute.

117
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,498
I like that side of you.

118
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,166
Please go on a date with me.

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,802
You're as pretty as always today.

120
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,485
But I want to be someone special to you.

121
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,457
He doesn't see me

122
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,327
as a romantic interest?

123
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,310
-We're back.
-Hey there.

124
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,646
Good work today. Have you eaten?

125
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,683
He's asking them too.

126
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,354
Tae-o, you always care so much
about if people ate.

127
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,256
We haven't. Should we finally go today?

128
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,560
My newest recommendations are avant-garde
<i>tonkotsu</i> ramen or neo-Korean food.

129
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,695
Oh, avant-garde <i>tonkotsu</i>
ramen is fine too.

130
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,165
If you want <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen, just say it.

131
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,104
Yuri, did you eat?

132
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,505
Have you eaten?

133
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,806
Let's eat.

134
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,149
HAVE YOU EATEN? KOREA

135
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,926
<i>Tonkotsu</i> ramen would've been nice.

136
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,761
We already decided on Korean food.

137
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,500
<i>When Korean people say, "Have you eaten?",</i>

138
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,204
<i>it's the same as when a Japanese person
says, "Hello, how are you?"</i>

139
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,776
<i>Yet when a Korean guy asks
a Japanese person that,</i>

140
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,480
<i>they might think,
"What? Could they be inviting me?"</i>

141
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,283
<i>But it doesn't mean
they're inviting you to a meal.</i>

142
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,452
<i>-So, don't get the wrong idea.</i>
-Really?

143
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,020
<i>My Japanese friends often ask,</i>

144
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,290
<i>"Hey, Kibarun, my Korean friend
asked me if I've eaten--"</i>

145
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,359
HOW DO YOU USE "<i>JOA</i>" PROPERLY?

146
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,995
<i>How do you even use "</i>joa"<i>properly?</i>

147
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:01,267
<i>Korean, just like English, has two words
when expressing attraction.</i>

148
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,369
Joa <i>is "like" in English.</i>

149
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,338
Saranghae<i> is "love."</i>

150
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,573
<i>And when the word "</i>joa<i>"--</i>

151
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,114
He hasn't said "<i>saranghae</i>" to me.

152
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,318
<i>Actually, in Korea, when you express
your love to a romantic interest,</i>

153
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,488
<i>they often use "</i>saranghae<i>"
instead of "</i>joa<i>."</i>

154
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,725
<i>So, Koreans will often chant</i>

155
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,029
<i>"</i>saranghae<i>," which means "I love you,"
to their favorite idols instead of "</i>joa<i>."</i>

156
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,498
<i>So, just because you were told "</i>joa hae<i>"--</i>

157
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,867
Oh, sorry.

158
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,802
I knocked.

159
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,204
Right, okay.

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,642
It's about Tae-o.

161
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,243
Huh?

162
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,714
His internship period is ending soon.

163
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,986
I want to decide
within the month if we'll hire him.

164
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,355
Oh.

165
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,759
I see. Right.

166
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,232
If tomorrow's seminar goes well,

167
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,234
I'm thinking of hiring him.

168
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,135
How about you?

169
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,571
And what does he want?

170
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,007
He wants to join us.

171
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,045
I see.

172
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,251
Then let's move forward with that.

173
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,756
How about you?

174
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,294
Is that okay, Motomiya?

175
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,266
<i>You're not like yourself lately, Motomiya.</i>

176
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,839
You're not influenced by emotion.

177
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,509
That's why I trust you.

178
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,211
-And the company--
-I know.

179
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,514
I know that better than anyone.

180
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,685
Of course,

181
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,090
I want you to decide
whether to hire Tae-o or not

182
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,492
after seeing how capable he is.

183
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,764
Got it.

184
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,170
Fried and <i>yangnyeom</i> chicken. Enjoy.

185
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,138
Thank you.

186
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,339
Listen here, Tae-o.

187
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,743
Apparently, the boss has been longing for
this seminar since founding the company.

188
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,545
"Longing"? What does that mean?

189
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,680
It means she has wanted this
for a long time.

190
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,482
Really?

191
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,919
Company ideologies like ours
tend to be seen as overly conscious.

192
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,689
First, we focus on the chocolate's taste
and build up our name.

193
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,160
Then, one day, we'll share our ideology.
That's what she always said.

194
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,262
Really?

195
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,164
That's true.

196
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,766
Now that the company has grown a bit,

197
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,068
people might be inclined to hear us out.

198
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,605
Yeah, Hanaoka has been waiting
for this chance.

199
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,709
Why are you suddenly
talking about Hanaoka?

200
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,847
Hanaoka's raison d'être
is to make our boss's dream come true.

201
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,515
What do you mean?

202
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,285
Yeah, he does give off that vibe.

203
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,186
I see it.

204
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,122
Yeah, their bond is unbreakable.

205
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,826
True. I've never seen the boss
rely on anyone besides Hanaoka.

206
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,695
To the boss, Hanaoka is special--

207
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,629
Special?

208
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,566
Are you okay?

209
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,700
Oh, no.

210
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,202
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

211
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,504
-Take a seat.
-I'll…

212
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,339
head back first.

213
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,908
-Huh?
-We're still…

214
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,144
-You're not done eating.
-Tae-o.

215
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,446
-Huh?
-I'm taking your <i>japchae</i>.

216
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,315
What?

217
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,894
Why?

218
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,737
Motomiya's out.

219
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,706
I see.

220
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,477
Are you special, Hanaoka?

221
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:39,945
What?

222
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,315
Am I not special?

223
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,184
What?

224
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,058
It's time. I'm heading to the university.

225
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,026
What?

226
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,029
<i>I'm buying a watch. Just you wait.</i>

227
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,081
This is the seminar venue.

228
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,918
When you're done, please tell the office.

229
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,353
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

230
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:31,330
Sorry I made you visit with me
when you're dealing with love troubles.

231
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,798
No, not at all.

232
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,072
Looks like we'll have plenty of space
for taste testing.

233
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,507
No need for a kitchen.

234
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,375
Really? That's great.

235
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,079
Um, love guru.

236
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,416
Yes, please share what happened with me.

237
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,130
Let's take a seat and collect ourselves.

238
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,238
Hello.

239
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh, Tae-o.

240
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,542
Wait one second.

241
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,212
Tae-o.

242
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,083
Professor, thank you
for the seminar venue.

243
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,219
Oh, it's fine. Anything for you.

244
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,022
It's also my duty to show students

245
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,661
that working at a company like this
is also an option.

246
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,029
Thank you.

247
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,399
More importantly, Tae-o,

248
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,801
how are things going
with the person you like?

249
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,009
I'm not special.

250
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,212
What? Not a romantic interest?

251
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,316
Not special?

252
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,855
<i>Nuna</i>, huh?

253
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,791
In what context did he call you that?

254
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,396
He didn't call me that directly.

255
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,331
He said it indirectly?

256
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,236
Why don't you ask him then?

257
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:18,837
Ask what?

258
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,172
What does "<i>nuna</i>" mean?

259
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,640
Am I not a romantic interest?

260
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,642
Didn't you want to eat with me?

261
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,745
Don't you love me?

262
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,815
Do you really think I can ask that?

263
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,650
But, wait.

264
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,520
Do you want to date him?

265
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,758
What do you mean you're not special?

266
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,829
No, Tae-o, I think
that's just a misunderstanding.

267
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,335
Then what's that?

268
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,272
What is that?

269
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,074
I got it from the person Tae-o likes.

270
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,241
I see.

271
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,142
What?!

272
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,945
Onoda, how could you do that?!

273
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,847
I've misjudged you!

274
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,082
It was a thank-you gift.

275
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,584
Tae-o's was the real deal.

276
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,821
No.

277
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,690
It's the same chocolate.

278
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,826
-Cute.
-Cute.

279
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,563
Mine is not romantic either.

280
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,932
No, you've got it all wrong.

281
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,634
How do I put this?

282
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,573
Notice her love.

283
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,075
I think…

284
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,113
She has noticed my feelings.

285
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,048
But…

286
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,786
She has another special someone.

287
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,490
Dating…

288
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,694
I'm not really sure about that.

289
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:55,467
And if we hire him, I'll officially be
his boss and he'll be my employee.

290
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,804
On top of all that, I'm his <i>nuna</i>.

291
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,106
Those are all excuses.

292
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,381
I mean, I'm scared.

293
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,583
Of what?

294
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm scared…

295
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,191
of learning that Tae-o…

296
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,860
doesn't like me.

297
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:24,997
I wonder…

298
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,768
if she won't fall in love with me.

299
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,272
I'm telling you--

300
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,642
Hanaoka is special.

301
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,948
I wonder if she likes Hanaoka.

302
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,349
It's not like that.

303
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,751
You're being loud!

304
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,852
My apologies!

305
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,858
Well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to tell you,

306
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,129
but I'll say it since I shouldn't have to
keep it a secret.

307
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,700
The person you like asked for my advice.

308
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,704
That chocolate was
just her way of thanking me.

309
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,006
Advice?

310
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,511
She said you made her heart pound.

311
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,912
Pound?

312
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,480
Don't you get it?

313
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,350
Her heart fluttered.

314
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:19,918
Fluttered?

315
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,956
Notice her love already.

316
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,198
Fluttered?

317
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:46,378
Yuri, do you know
the essential "-ing" for romance?

318
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,513
I've heard of it before.

319
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,353
Wasn't it timing, feeling, and happening?

320
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,623
No, it's not three things. It's just one.

321
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,724
What is it?

322
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,058
Fighting!

323
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,126
You have to fight.

324
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,195
I have to fight?

325
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,065
Yuri.

326
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,969
Romance is impossible
if you're too afraid to know how he feels.

327
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,038
You need to be prepared to fight.

328
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,343
The doctor.

329
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,611
Why is he here?

330
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,179
Tae-o was just here too.

331
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,550
He wanted to see the coral tank first,
so he might still be here.

332
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,088
Where is that tank?

333
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,890
It's near the cafeteria.

334
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,295
Yuri.

335
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,520
Good luck!

336
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,325
Are you sure?

337
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,927
Of course.
This is incredible growth for her.

338
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,630
But why's the CEO going?

339
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,931
Shouldn't you be going?

340
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,466
What?

341
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,635
Anyway, why are you here?

342
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,237
Returning library books.

343
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,807
But aren't you a doctor?

344
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,777
A doctor? Well, I <i>am</i> from
the department of veterinary science.

345
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,313
Oh, you're a veterinarian?

346
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,481
I'm not.

347
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,184
Huh? What's going on?

348
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,789
What are you?

349
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,334
Tae-o…

350
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,747
Tae-o?!

351
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,816
What?

352
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,621
Oh, if you're looking for Tae-o,
he already left.

353
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,390
Oh, is that so?

354
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,558
Excuse me.

355
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,030
He wasn't here.

356
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:07,946
By doctor, he meant
he's in academics, not medicine?

357
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,383
Are you for real?

358
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,026
Well, I don't care.

359
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,495
You're a man of my past anyway.

360
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,429
What?

361
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,067
By the way, why didn't you become a vet?

362
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,904
I couldn't. I'm not good with blood.

363
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,707
That's rough.

364
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,582
Here we go. Huh? Hm?

365
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,922
Although I do occasionally
run into blood in the lab.

366
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,157
You're hopeless.

367
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,026
I've gotten over it.

368
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,829
Everything happens for a reason.

369
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,932
I think it's because I realized

370
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,269
it's not that scary
if I know why blood comes out.

371
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,371
Maybe you could've become a vet.

372
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,174
True.

373
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,045
But even if I became a vet,

374
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,182
I'd probably have done research
instead of clinical work.

375
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,884
Why?

376
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,654
Because I like it.

377
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,697
Then, by chance…

378
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,805
do you also want to know
why I invited you out

379
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,008
on Valentine's Day?

380
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,944
<i>There's no mistaking it.</i>

381
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,046
She wants love advice from you,

382
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,315
as she surely must like Tae-o as well.

383
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,053
I already know why.

384
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,988
You do?

385
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,759
Yes, and I'm giving it a lot of thought.

386
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,194
You can trust me.

387
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,969
Then is it okay if I keep my hopes up?

388
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,872
Yes, please. Keep your hopes up.

389
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,535
It's gotten romantic now, hasn't it?

390
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,780
TAE-O
LET'S GO AGAIN. GOOD NIGHT.

391
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,322
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
DID YOU GO HOME ALREADY?

392
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,201
I want to see him.

393
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,109
Well, tomorrow's the seminar.

394
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,412
TAE-O HAS SENT A MESSAGE

395
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,184
<i>Everything's set for tomorrow.</i>

396
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,353
LEAVE IT TO ME

397
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,272
Yuri, is something up?

398
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,744
Are you ready for tomorrow?

399
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,182
Oh, yes, it'll be fine.

400
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,184
I see.

401
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,486
<i>Yes.</i>

402
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,422
<i>What are you doing?</i>

403
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,389
Hm?

404
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,395
I'm by the swings.

405
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,864
At the park?

406
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,100
<i>Yes.</i>

407
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,836
Swinging sounds nice.

408
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,472
Yes.

409
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,244
Want to come here?

410
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,049
Right now?

411
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,884
Right now…

412
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,723
Or any other time.

413
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,728
Is that so?

414
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,871
Then is it okay if I come over right now?

415
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,008
Right now…

416
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,112
is fine too.

417
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,282
Shall we meet?

418
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,621
Yes.

419
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,176
KOTARO AIHARA HAS SENT A MESSAGE

420
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,377
Yuri!

421
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,319
Yuri.

422
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,054
I'm sorry.

423
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,489
About what?

424
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,192
It feels like I made you come here.

425
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,829
It sounded like you wanted to see me.

426
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,436
I'm kidding.

427
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,071
I'm the one who wanted to see you.

428
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,110
Shall we take a walk?

429
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,381
Yes.

430
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,528
-Um…
-Um…

431
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,263
Sorry, what is it?

432
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,600
Sorry, what were you saying?

433
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,168
Oh, it's nothing.

434
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,481
Let's climb up.

435
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,361
Wait for me.

436
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,399
You're slow.

437
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,502
Your legs are longer than mine.

438
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,338
It's because you're small.

439
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,342
I'm not small. I'm a normal size.

440
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,182
Oh, you're not small?

441
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,089
See, I'm not small.

442
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,725
How cute.

443
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,401
What kind of advice
did you want from Senpai?

444
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,037
What?

445
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,891
Is your heart fluttering?

446
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,763
Yes.

447
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,734
Mine has been for a while too.

448
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,704
Why?

449
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,679
Why are you saying that?

450
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,320
You don't know why?

451
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,156
I don't.

452
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,494
Do you know now?

453
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,843
<i>I love you.</i>

454
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,752
Me too.

455
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,188
Hm?

456
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,591
Me too.

457
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,170
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,008
Yuri?

459
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,096
BUSINESSES CAN SOLVE
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES?!

460
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,400
WAITING ROOM

461
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,669
A medical doctor sounds nice,

462
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,405
but a PhD sounds nice too.

463
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,941
-Yeah.
-I've made up my mind.

464
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,809
I'll make him fall for me after all.

465
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,478
Yeah.

466
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:18,015
He's a bit unique. A bit mysterious.

467
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,351
He's hard to figure out.

468
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,021
He's also cryptic and can't take a hint,

469
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,424
but it's just enough
for me to feel attracted.

470
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,325
Yeah.

471
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,595
I can get any man I want if I get serious.

472
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,529
Yeah.

473
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,170
How about you? Did you two meet up?

474
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,605
What?

475
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,075
Yeah, but…

476
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:53,885
<i>I love you.</i>

477
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,524
I just had so much on my mind yesterday.

478
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,061
But once this is over,

479
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,732
I want to properly tell him how I feel.

480
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,636
Yes, I'm so proud of you!

481
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,840
Now that that's decided,
let's get this seminar over with.

482
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,311
What are you two doing?

483
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,414
Could it be you're going after a student?

484
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,450
In a sense, I guess he is a student.

485
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,987
By the way, where are
the cacao beans for tasting?

486
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,223
I thought you were bringing them, Boss.

487
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,358
What?

488
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,160
Huh? But I sent you a text yesterday.

489
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,162
A text?

490
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:44,802
Yuri!

491
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,348
<i>Hello! I left the beans, nibs, and husks
on your desk for tomorrow's seminar.</i>

492
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,616
<i>Please take one last look.</i>

493
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,853
I thought you'd check and bring them.

494
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,457
You should've taken responsibility
and brought them!

495
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm sorry, I'll go get them.

496
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,963
But we're starting in ten minutes.

497
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,965
Sorry, I should've checked.

498
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,266
What do we do?

499
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,702
Okay, let's head over now.

500
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,374
What's the matter?

501
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,376
Did something happen?

502
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:45,563
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,400
I forgot the cacao husk samples
at the office because of my oversight.

504
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,502
What do we do?

505
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,703
Calm down.

506
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,339
It's nothing to panic over.

507
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,110
We can get cacao beans
at the nearby import goods shop.

508
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,411
I'll go buy them.

509
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,380
The ones on the market have a weak scent.

510
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,081
Should we go without the beans?

511
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,388
Let's roast them.

512
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,327
We'll roast them on the venue
and have them smell the aroma.

513
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,663
But we don't have a roaster.

514
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,399
If it's just the aroma,
we can use a frying pan instead.

515
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,368
There's a frying pan in the lab.

516
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,903
I'll borrow one from the doctor.

517
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,937
What? A doctor?

518
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,906
Aihara, go get beans from the shop.

519
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,107
Got it.

520
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,477
Sorry, can you guys set up?
I'll see if we can use a fire in the room.

521
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,079
-Okay.
-Okay.

522
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,414
Hanaoka.

523
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,983
Sorry, I should've checked properly.

524
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,352
-You usually wouldn't make this error.
-Okay then.

525
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,387
Let's focus on work for now.

526
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,890
We'll figure it out.

527
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,258
-Okay, then.
-Okay, then.

528
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,526
MASS PRODUCTION &amp; ANIMALS

529
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,595
Here's a question for you all.

530
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,069
Do you know how many species
on this planet as of now

531
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,738
are facing extinction?

532
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,484
Yes.

533
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,754
Is it about ten species?

534
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,890
The answer is

535
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,293
forty thousand species.

536
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,134
There are many reasons as to why,

537
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:35,573
but first, we can say
that global warming is one of them.

538
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,581
The smell of chocolate changes
with roasting duration and temperature.

539
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,284
For example, this is
a light roast at a low temperature,

540
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,221
so it causes a fruity, floral aroma.

541
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:54,024
Is that girl the one who Tae-o likes?

542
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,530
Bravo!

543
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,433
Everyone, come to the front

544
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,368
and give it a smell.

545
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,671
People in the back too.

546
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,773
Come forward.

547
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,446
Looks like things will be okay.

548
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:16,947
Yes.

549
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,651
It's all thanks to you, Hanaoka.

550
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,325
As for Tae-o…

551
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,127
Let's hire him.

552
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,772
Yeah.

553
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,330
-Are you leaving?
-Yeah.

554
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,569
About today…

555
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,573
Thank you so much.

556
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,512
Sorry, as always.

557
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,317
It's my job.

558
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,588
Good work.

559
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,990
Good work today.

560
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,425
Also…

561
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,197
Let me make this clear.

562
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,602
There's no rule against dating co-workers.

563
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,739
What?

564
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,514
No, I--

565
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,515
It's obvious.

566
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,296
<i>I'm fine now.</i>

567
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,105
<i>This is fine.</i>

568
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,709
<i>I'm okay with this.</i>

569
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:03,981
What?

570
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,925
Anyway,

571
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,428
that's all.

572
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,934
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

573
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,307
See you tomorrow.

574
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,555
<i>I thought I'd never again</i>

575
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,459
<i>be oblivious to someone's feelings.</i>

576
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,466
<i>But maybe it's precisely because
I can read people's thoughts</i>

577
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,904
<i>that I never tried
to notice people's true feelings.</i>

578
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,645
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

579
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:16,253
<i>Even when it came to
someone precious who was always close by,</i>

580
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,492
<i>I was oblivious this entire time.</i>

581
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,340
Yuri.

582
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,121
I…

583
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,926
want to be someone special to you.

584
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,262
Hm?

585
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,001
How do you feel about Hanaoka?

586
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,938
What do you mean?

587
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,711
Is Hanaoka someone special to you?

588
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,287
Do you like him?

589
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,164
Why are you always running away?

590
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:49,446
I…

591
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,949
like you, Yuri.

592
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,690
What about you, Yuri?

593
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,867
Do you not like me?

594
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:22,613
I don't.

595
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,887
I'm sorry.

596
