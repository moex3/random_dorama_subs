1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,273
In regards to Tae-o's employment,

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,609
as he has completed
his internship successfully,

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,380
he will be joining us
as an official employee next month.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,248
Tae-o, congratulations!

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,517
That's great!

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,086
Congratulations!
Your employee ID is shining!

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,323
Yes.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,092
Hm? Doesn't he seem kind of gloomy?

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,927
You seem down, Tae-o.

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,796
Oh, not at all.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,634
I'm happy too.
I look forward to working with you all.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,310
Do you not like me?

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,280
I don't.

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,849
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,123
This is a happy moment, right?

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,591
Yeah, probably.

17
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,429
Well, congratulations! Right?

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,597
Right, guys?

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>A business get-together?</i>

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:16,543
Yes, it's a networking event with angel
investors who want to invest in ESG.

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,912
It's at Lake Akan, Hokkaido.

22
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,881
Hokkaido?! That sounds nice.

23
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,150
I could really go for some crab.

24
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,855
Motomiya and I will go that day.
Nishina and Aihara will come support us.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
-Yes.
-For real?

26
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,324
All right!

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:37,430
There will be a lot of guests from abroad
as well, so can you come too, Tae-o?

28
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,700
What? Me?

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,601
Yes.

30
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,071
I heard there will be
investors from Korea. Is that okay?

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,375
Oh, sure. Please come.

32
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,548
Okay, I understand.

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,386
Tae-o, it's your first work trip.

34
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,521
Good luck!

35
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,722
Good luck.

36
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,458
Good luck!

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,960
Good luck!

38
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,163
Did I do it wrong?

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,166
Maybe that's what drove
your wife away, Kame.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,401
Let's wrap it up here.

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,302
-Yes.
-Okay.

42
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,671
-Keep up the good work.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,009
A Hokkaido date sounds fun, huh?

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,043
It's not like that!

45
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:48,301
Huh? Why is it so tense in here?

46
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,171
Does that mean you rejected Tae-o?

47
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,074
I guess you could say that.

48
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,544
This seriously makes no sense.

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,913
Weren't you going to
tell him you like him?

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,082
That's true, but…

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,518
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,157
I was having trouble sorting through
my thoughts this time.

53
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,526
Huh? What do you mean?

54
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,964
Sorry, I don't really know myself…

55
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,570
That explains the tension.

56
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,072
Then Hokkaido next week will be…

57
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,875
hell.

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,620
What is happening?

59
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,402
How do you feel about Hanaoka?

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,238
What do you mean?

61
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,908
Is Hanaoka someone special to you?

62
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,311
Do you like him?

63
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,329
Time to get energized.

64
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,174
<i>You haven't been back
to Hokkaido since the accident.</i>

65
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,876
<i>Have a good time.</i>

66
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,846
It's for work, not vacation.

67
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,050
But I wouldn't mind some good food.

68
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,653
What do you want as a souvenir, Dad?

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,423
<i>Yuri, honestly, are you a bit scared?</i>

70
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,761
Yeah.

71
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,364
But it's okay.

72
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,067
It's not like
we're going to Kiritappu Cape.

73
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,870
And it's been 12 years.

74
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,241
<i>Have some good food,</i>

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,744
<i>see some beautiful sights,
and come back in high spirits.</i>

76
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,180
<i>That's the best souvenir you could bring.</i>

77
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,049
Sure.

78
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:16,949
Thank you.

79
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,287
What?

80
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,188
<i>Sorry.</i>

81
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,726
The Marioka Department Store asked for
a revision of today's press release.

82
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,494
<i>I'm urgently heading to the office.</i>

83
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,129
That sounds rough.

84
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,331
We'll be fine here.

85
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,999
Okay, got it.

86
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,268
We'll handle things here.

87
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,402
Feel better.

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,172
Good morning. What happened?

89
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,407
Aihara slept wrong and hurt his neck.

90
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,608
He can't come today.

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,243
From just that?

92
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:45,945
Did something happen?

93
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,314
Nishina had a work emergency.

94
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,782
What?

95
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,683
What?

96
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,785
That means…

97
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,656
Good morning.

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,627
What is it?

99
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,096
Well…

100
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:06,833
Um…

101
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,213
TANCHO KUSHIRO AIRPORT

102
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,314
TANCHO KUSHIRO AIRPORT

103
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,149
Is this hell?

104
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,219
What is this?

105
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,389
Um, excuse me.

106
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,289
Yeah?

107
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,425
Which one would you like?

108
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,794
Oh, thanks.

109
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,795
-That's corn soup.
-What?

110
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,430
No, it's nothing.

111
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,401
Those are red-crowned cranes.

112
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,839
They're an endangered species, right?

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,909
But they're slowly growing their number.

114
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,213
They're also much larger
than other wild birds.

115
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,582
What were they called?

116
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,619
<i>Sarurun Kamuy.</i>

117
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,587
Huh?

118
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,022
In the Ainu language,

119
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,726
it means god of the Marsh.

120
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,395
God?

121
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,508
All right, goodbye.

122
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,988
Want me to take it?

123
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,224
-Could you?
-Give it here.

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,325
Thank you.

125
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,027
Okay, here goes.

126
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,528
All right.

127
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,997
Wait…

128
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,799
-Motomiya.
-What?

129
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,601
Get closer.

130
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,470
-No, I'll take it alone.
-It's okay.

131
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,737
Don't worry about it.

132
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,442
Come on, stand next to him.

133
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,678
All right, this spot is good.

134
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,745
All right.

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,281
Okay, here goes.

136
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,417
I'm taking it now.

137
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,885
Say cheese.

138
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,591
Hey, since we're doing this,

139
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,359
how about a smile?

140
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
Okay? Come on, let's go.

141
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,198
Hurry up.

142
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,700
Nice.

143
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,270
Yes, we've arrived!

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,472
Hokkaido!

145
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,052
I heard there's a famous
seafood rice bowl place over there.

146
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,787
Wow, that sounds delicious.

147
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,491
Apparently the soup curry over there
is also popular.

148
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,959
Oh, really?

149
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,828
Where should we go?

150
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,898
Which do you want to eat?

151
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,633
Hm? Me?

152
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,801
Well…

153
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,807
<i>If we're in Hokkaido,
seafood rice bowls are a must.</i>

154
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,781
Which should we get?

155
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,516
Well, um…

156
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,586
<i>Soup curry?</i>

157
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,788
<i>Seafood rice bowl?</i>

158
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Definitely seafood rice bowl.</i>

159
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,597
-Which one?
-Which one?

160
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,968
I don't know.

161
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,770
RAMEN AKAN

162
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,872
You were craving ramen?

163
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,173
Um, yeah.

164
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,783
<i>I need to be considerate here.</i>

165
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,553
-Sit there.
-Sit there.

166
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,454
What?

167
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,460
It's okay. Sit by Tae-o.

168
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,561
Oh, okay.

169
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,463
No, please sit there.

170
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,931
Okay.

171
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,666
No, it's really fine.

172
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,902
Sit there.

173
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,937
You can't.

174
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,442
Everything all right?

175
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,509
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,014
Sorry.

177
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,750
Thanks.

178
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,352
Here you go.

179
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,087
Thank you.

180
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,321
Thank you.

Our corporate philosophy is

182
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,696
addressing environmental issues
starting with daily deliciousness and fun.

183
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,234
For our customers to understand
such issues through everyday experiences,

184
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:40,139
we use cacao husks that
are usually disposed to manufacture

185
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,143
and sell chocolate, as well as
daily necessities, and clothing.

186
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,311
If you please.

187

Hello, I'm Yun Tae-o.

188
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,617
I'm Tae-o Yun.
I'm your interpreter for today.

189

Our corporate philosophy is

190
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:58,457
addressing environmental issues
starting with daily deliciousness and fun.

191
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,041
-The get-together is tomorrow at 11.
-Okay.

192
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,512
I want you to talk to the international
guests about our business.

193
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,880
Okay, got it.

194
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,215
Anything you want to ask me?

195
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,518
Is it possible…

196
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,087
in Japan…

197
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,592
people don't like guys
that come on too strong?

198
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,994
What?

199
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,462
It's nothing.

200
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,797
Wait.

201
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,233
Um…

202
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,203
Okay, then.

203
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,039
Hey.

204
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,409
As of now, are you and Motomiya…

205
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,477
She rejected me.

206
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,479
What?

207
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,815
Wait, but…

208
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,550
Why?

209
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,251
B-But you two…

210
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,319
I…

211
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,023
know why.

212
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:05,925
Huh?

213
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,102
Wait, it's me?

214
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,475
You two have a special relationship.

215
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,443
N-No, we don't. You're wrong.

216
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,046
But Yuri feels that way.

217
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,582
No, there really is nothing between us.

218
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,217
What about you then?

219
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,118
Huh?

220
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,122
Do you like Yuri?

221
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,695
Sorry I'm late.

222
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,664
Answer me. Why can't you do that?

223
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,066
Tae-o, calm down.

224
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:47,967
What's the matter?

225
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,936
No, we're just talking about work, right?

226
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,438
Come on, let's go now.

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,475
Come on, Tae-o.

228
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,079
I'M JOINING DOLCE &amp; CHOCOLAT..
<i>KYOSHUKU DESU</i>.

229
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>My heart was broken.</i>

230
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,320
Didn't they like each other?

231
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,489
I thought that was the case.

232
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,824
I don't get it either.

233
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,026
I'm worried about him.

234
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,629
Well, he'll be fine.

235
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,565
He still has a chance
if they work at the same company.

236
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,567
But…

237
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,206
Tae-o, do you want to go to Japan with me?

238
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,810
No!

239
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,578
I can't let it go!

240
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,146
What?

241
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,184
He's actually not as strong as he looks.

242
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,518
Contrary to belief…

243
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,556
he's a sensitive boy!

244
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,291
O-Okay…

245
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,128
Please, go convince her immediately!

246
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,062
What?

247
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,297
-I'm begging you!
-Wait!

248
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:52,998
Please!

249
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,540
What? The doctor?

250
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,383
<i>Can we meet urgently?
I want to speak with you.</i>

251
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,955
He finally took the bait.

252
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,876
I-It…

253
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,411
It's so far.

254
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,649
Y-Yeah, we should've just grabbed
a hotel at Lake Akan.

255
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,185
Jeez, that Aihara.

256
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,153
Why'd he choose a place so far out?

257
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,924
Does he really think
this will reduce costs?

258
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:52,858
-Right?
-Yeah.

259
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,027
And he even hurt his neck
on a day like this.

260
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,762
Yeah, seriously.

261
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,031
Sorry, it was me.

262
00:14:59,098 --> 00:14:59,932
What?

263
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,635
I made the reservation.

264
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,839
I see.

265
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,713
Well, this kind of thing
isn't bad once in a while.

266
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,448
There's so much nature.

267
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,084
And the view's nice too, right?

268
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621
-Right?
-Y-Yeah.

269
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,392
Yuri.

270
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,459
Yes?

271
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,094
Isn't it an inconvenience?

272
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,195
What?

273
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,499
Having me around.

274
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,136
No, not at all.

275
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,472
Are you tired, Motomiya?

276
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,874
-Yeah.
-You know,

277
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,843
you've never been good around crowds.

278
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,578
-That's right.
-Yes.

279
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,980
Hanaoka,

280
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,416
you sure know everything

281
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,285
when it comes to Yuri.

282
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,128
Why is this happening?

283
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,236
I'm so happy you invited me out, Onoda.

284
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,272
More importantly, what happened?

285
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,173
What?

286
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,874
I'm talking about Tae-o.

287
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,643
Why reject someone you like?

288
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,647
Oh, I'm not too sure either.

289
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,449
What?

290
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,052
Who else would know better than you?

291
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,821
Huh? About what?

292
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,756
You know what I mean.

293
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:32,791
What?

294
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,393
Hm?

295
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,099
So basically, the person Tae-o likes
is that boss,

296
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,068
and the one who rejected him
is also that boss?

297
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,236
Exactly.

298
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,207
Then you have absolutely
nothing to do with Tae-o's--

299
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,175
Absolutely nothing to do with it.

300
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,048
Then what did I do all that for?

301
00:16:59,051 --> 00:16:59,985
In other words,

302
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,323
everything was for no reason?

303
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,091
No, I'd say there was…

304
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,127
a reason for it.

305
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,395
Huh?

306
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,132
After all, that's how we met.

307
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,800
You and me.

308
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,336
How is that significant?

309
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,075
Anyway, in that case,
I'm going back to my research.

310
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,529
It seems you've already forgotten, Onoda.

311
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,065
That fateful Valentine's Day.

312
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,701
Right, the Linaria…

313
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
Then why did you give that to me?

314
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,611
As for that…

315
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,081
think about it on your own.

316
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,982
What?

317
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,553
Think about it
until you figure out the reason.

318
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:14,460
Keep thinking long and hard about me.

Okay, thank you.

340
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:22,187
<i>AINU: LEARN ABOUT THE</i> KAMUY

341
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,457
Thank you for today, you two.

342
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,192
We still have tomorrow,

343
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,194
but good work so far.

344
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,562
Good work.

345
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,663
-Yes.
-Yes.

346
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,403
Excuse me.

347
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,339
Allow me to start the fire.

348
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,140
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

349
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,376
There we go.

350
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,780
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

351
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,053
Um, so…

352
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,189
Are you tourists?

353
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,123
Well…

354
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,157
Work trip.

355
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,826
Oh, you're here for work?

356
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,262
Sorry, I thought you were friends.

357
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,696
You seem close in age.

358
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,998
Well, yes.

359
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,034
We're classmates from university.

360
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,702
Wow, since university?

361
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,970
Now you work together?

362
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,873
You must be like family then.

363
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,712
Well…

364
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,717
Or rather, we simply started
a company together.

365
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,719
Started a company? Incredible.

366
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,622
That's no easy feat.

367
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,226
You two must be bound deeply by fate.

368
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,000
Have a good time then.

369
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,306
Um…

370
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,443
May I ask something?

371
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,878
-Hm?
-Hm?

372
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,713
Well, um…

373
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,617
Why did you start this company?

374
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,689
That's because…

375
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,427
When we were in university,

376
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:14,666
I was actually torn on whether
I should become a researcher or not.

377
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,668
I see.

378
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,938
During that time,

379
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,009
Hanaoka said that environmental issues can
be fixed particularly through business.

380
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,980
I guess you could
say that was the trigger.

381
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,820
I knew it.

382
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,324
You're special to each other.

383
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,892
What?

384
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,595
No, I…

385
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,734
But it's not me.

386
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,203
What?

387
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,104
Huh?

388
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,507
The one Motomiya needs…

389
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,977
isn't me.

390
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,048
Hanaoka?

391
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,318
It's not me.

392
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,890
My bad.

393
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:18,163
Really, it's my bad.

394
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,698
Again?

395
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,199
Oh, no.

396
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,202
But you only had tea.

397
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,904
Huh?

398
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,674
Excuse me, is there alcohol in this food?

399
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,943
Sake steamed scallops
and salmon miso soup.

400
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,914
Both of them use
plenty of Kushiro's local sake.

401
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,016
Sorry, Hanaoka.

402
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,318
-Are you okay?
-Hanaoka?

403
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,687
-Is he perhaps allergic?
-It's fine.

404
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,756
-Are you okay? I'm sorry!
-Don't sleep here.

405
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,559
-Jeez!
-I can never get used to this.

406
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,727
-Hey!
-My bad.

407
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,896
Tae-o.

408
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,131
My bad.

409
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,870
Please go to sleep.

410
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,283
I'll bring some water.

411
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,317
Thanks.

412
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,285
Of course.

413
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,266
My bad.

414
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,040
It's my fault.

415
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,146
I just…

416
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,319
want things to go well between you two.

417
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,691
Otherwise, I…

418
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,968
My bad.

419
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,576
I'm back.

420
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,411
Welcome back, Onoda. How was it?

421
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,280
Did you convince her?

422
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,016
It was a misunderstanding.

423
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,050
Bravo! That's great.

424
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,820
No, it was my misunderstanding.

425
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,057
-What?
-The person Tae-o likes isn't Mahiro.

426
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,860
Then who in the world…

427
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,229
It's the company CEO.

428
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,532
The CEO…

429
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,700
What? The CEO?

430
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,769
But don't worry.

431
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,906
According to Mahiro,
the CEO likes Tae-o too.

432
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,442
Is that true?

433
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,578
Is that information accurate?

434
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,979
I'm sure of it.

435
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,118
The CEO…

436
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,800
KIRITAPPU CAPE

437
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,869
TWO TOURISTS INJURED

438
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,584
<i>I just…</i>

439
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,722
want things to go well between you two.

440
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,659
You're still up.

441
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,128
Yes.

442
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,832
Are you having trouble sleeping too?

443
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,401
Yeah, a little.

444
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,008
Would you…

445
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,411
like to look with me?

446
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,279
What?

447
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:37,922
Sure.

448
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,783
Oh, here.

449
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,587
But Tae-o, you…

450
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,056
Did you know?

451
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:16,661
Sea otters have the most fur on Earth.

452
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,831
I see.

453
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,967
Each one has 800 million hairs.

454
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,870
That's cool.

455
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:31,543
I'm also good at withstanding the cold.

456
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,049
Don't misunderstand.

457
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,984
I'm not trying to say

458
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,555
that I have a lot of hair.

459
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,828
Thanks.

460
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:00,939
It's pretty.

461
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,276
Yes.

462
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,246
It's very pretty.

463
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,579
Sorry.

464
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,251
I thought it'd be prettier lying down.

465
00:29:58,763 --> 00:29:59,831
You're right.

466
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,837
It's prettier this way.

467
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,115
You'll catch a cold.

468
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,691
Tae-o.

469
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,461
Let's share the blanket.

470
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,931
Thank you.

471
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,905
-Oh, it's a shooting star!
-What?

472
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,674
Oh, um…

473
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,509
The star…

474
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,346
Oh.

475
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,281
-A shooting star?
-Yes.

476
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,185
-Right.
-Wow, I wish I could've seen it.

477
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,456
Do you make wishes in Korea too?

478
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,325
Yes, we do.

479
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,894
Do you have a wish, Yuri?

480
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,795
What?

481
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,263
I'm not sure.

482
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,165
Do I?

483
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,069
Try saying one.

484
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,472
I'll make it come true.

485
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,742
Isn't that the shooting star's job?

486
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,183
Tae-o,

487
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,286
do you have a wish?

488
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,757
I do.

489
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,093
What is it?

490
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,164
If I tell you,

491
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,200
will you grant it?

492
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,779
Oh, I'm sorry.

493
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,652
You've already rejected me.

494
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,993
I can't get between you two.

495
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,696
I know that.

496
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,780
Shall we head back now?

497
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,582
Wait.

498
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,990
Um…

499
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,060
Stop doing this already.

500
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,667
Please…

501
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,705
stop leading me on.

502
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,018
I no longer have…

503
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,423
feelings for you.

504
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,763
I'm sorry.

505
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,630
We have a Korean person too.

506
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,301
Tae-o, a moment?

507
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:05,736
Yes.

508
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,440
He's Yun, one of our employees.

509
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,176
He researched animals at university.

510
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,346
This is Min, a Korean investor.

511
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,149
Can we talk, Hanaoka?

512
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,083
Okay.

513
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,519
-Sorry, I'll be right back.
-Sure.

514
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,729
Hello, I'm Yun Tae-o
from Dolce &amp; Chocolat..

515
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,101
Yes, hello.

516
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,070
Nice to meet you.

517
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,772
MIN HA-NA

518
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,779
Min Ha-na?

519
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,982
MIN HA-NA

520
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,587
Huh?

521
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,041
Nuna.

522
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,983
Good work.
Will we be on time for our flight?

523
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,884
Yeah.

524
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,256
Huh?

525
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,194
Tae-o said he's not going home today.

526
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,094
What?

527
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,831
Apparently, he's going to Kiritappu Cape.

528
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,099
Kiritappu?

529
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,136
He said he's going to see sea otters.

530
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,573
Sea otters. I see.

531
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,654
Since we're doing this,
how about a smile?

532
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,656
Okay?

533
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,019
It'll energize you.

534
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,187
<i>Here.</i>

535
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,131
<i>Yuri,</i>

536
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,066
<i>you're special to me.</i>

537
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,336
<i>Yaksok.</i>

538
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,317
<i>It's gotten romantic now, hasn't it?</i>

539
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,591
<i>How about me?</i>

540
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,128
Do you like me?

541
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:41,752
Hey…

542
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,223
Hanaoka.

543
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,826
-I…
-No need to say it.

544
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,297
I can tell either way.

545
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,237
Head over

546
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,339
to Tae-o.

547
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,644
But…

548
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,549
Then let's decide
with rock-paper-scissors.

549
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,551
What?

550
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,653
If I win,

551
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,622
you'll go to Kiritappu Cape.

552
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,726
Be serious.

553
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,330
And you're even not good
at rock-paper-scissors.

554
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,231
Yeah.

555
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,066
That's why,

556
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,837
if I still happen to win,

557
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,638
just go.

558
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,706
Rock, paper…

559
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,444
scissors…

560
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,812
Here's your shrimp bread.

561
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,781
Oh, thanks.

562
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,349
What about you?

563
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,117
That was the last one.

564
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,822
Then let's decide who gets to eat it
with rock-paper-scissors.

565
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,390
I'm fine.

566
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,560
No, I want the decision to be fair.

567
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,063
Okay.

568
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,964
Let's do it.

569
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,501
<i>-Rock, paper, scissors…
-Rock, paper, scissors…</i>

570
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,603
shoot!

571
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,143
-Hooray!
-Aw, man.

572
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,280
Well, I'll just dig right in then.

573
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,494
But you know, Hanaoka,

574
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,164
you're so bad at rock-paper-scissors.

575
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,337
You're just good at it.

576
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,850
<i>Scissors…</i>

577
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,052
<i>shoot.</i>

578
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,660
How?

579
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,130
Go, Motomiya.

580
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,507
It's fine. Just go.

581
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,714
Come on, hurry up.

582
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,022
Thank you, Hanaoka.

583
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,326
Thank you.

584
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,870
I've been with you all these years.
Of course I know.

585
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,250
Yuri.

586
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,190
Yuri?

587
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,992
Tae-o.

588
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,763
Why are you here?

589
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,833
I came to see you, Tae-o.

590
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,003
Why?

591
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,575
I can't go back like this.

592
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,611
Because…

593
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,082
I haven't told you how I feel at all.

594
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,053
Yuri…

595
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,324
To be honest, I…

596
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,263
I actually…

597
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,079
Yuri!

598
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,284
Do you like rice?

599
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,025
Yes, I do.

600
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,028
Do you like curry?

601
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,464
I do.

602
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,467
Do you like fried rice?

603
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,837
I like fried rice too.

604
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,773
Do you like <i>omurice</i>?

605
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,609
I like <i>omurice</i> too.

606
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:09,847
What about me?

607
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,515
I like you too!

608
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,495
I like you, Tae-o!

609
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,730
I love you!

610
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,573
I like you too!

611
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,777
I love you!

612
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,680
I love you a lot!
