1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,172
I love you a lot!

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,160
YUN TAE-O

3
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,364
Hello?

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,099
<i>Good morning.</i>

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,000
What?

6
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,635
<i>Open up.</i>

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,605
What?!

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,081
Good morning, <i>jagi</i>.

9
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,482
"<i>Ja</i>"?

10
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>A-Annyeonghaseyo.</i>

11
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,989
Let me see your face.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,791
I'm not wearing makeup.

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,094
My girlfriend is being
so cute this morning.

14
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,498
Um, so, did you need something?

15
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,399
Right.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,702
I'm delivering your breakfast.

17
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,204
After all, I'm your boyfriend.

18
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,939
-I'm coming in.
-What?

19
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,744
Um…

20
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,113
You actually made this for me?

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,115
Yes, I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?

22
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,751
Thank you.

23
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,323
I <i>am</i> your boyfriend, right?

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,324
Hm?

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,701
You and I are dating, right?

26
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:45,905
Yes.

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,009
I wanted to hear those words.

28
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,950
Would you say our first day as a couple
was yesterday or today?

29
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:57,851
Um…

30
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,487
Yesterday, I guess?

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,358
That means today
is our second day together.

32
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,063
Tae-o.

33
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,933
Want to go somewhere
on our day off tomorrow?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,702
Sure, how about Korea?

35
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,605
Korea? That's way too sudden.

36
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,273
Is it?

37
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,310
Um, but…

38
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,914
I'd love to visit
where you were born and raised someday.

39
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:36,990
There is a park near my house
with a beautiful view.

40
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:43,196
If you yell your wish from there,
it comes true.

41
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,202
Then let's go yell out
our wishes together, okay?

42
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,938
Yes, let's do that.

43
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,250
You're so pretty.

44
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,887
Let's eat.

45
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,624
B-Before that,

46
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,027
I'll wash my face and brush my teeth.

47
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,128
-Wait.
-Huh?

48
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,597
I'll brush them for you.

49
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,898
I'll brush them myself.

50
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,799
I'll do it.

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,700
No.

52
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,869
-Are you embarrassed?
-I'm not!

53
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,271
Is she embarrassed?

54
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,341
So cute.

55
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,155
<i>If I win, you'll go to Kiritappu Cape.</i>

56
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,858
Go, Motomiya.

57
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,032
-Good morning.
-Boss!

58
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,234
Sorry about Hokkaido.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,302
-Ouch!
-It's fine. Don't push yourself.

60
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,870
-Okay.
-Take a seat.

61
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,138
Sit down.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,174
Ouch.

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,208
Good morning.

64
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,979
Good morning.

65
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,686
I compiled a report from our work trip.
Take a look.

66
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
Sure.

67
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,360
And here are some souvenirs
for your afternoon meetings.

68
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,527
Sure, thanks.

69
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,896
And these are samples
for our new spring products.

70
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,265
There's a mug.

71
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,368
-A mug.
-And a tumbler.

72
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,871
-Tumbler.
-And corks with a spring design.

73
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,905
-Okay.
-And also,

74
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,907
-there are gift boxes.
-Okay.

75
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,477
-Check them by noon.
-By noon?!

76
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,778
Tell me if it's too much.

77
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,580
I'll shift things around.

78
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,384
Noon. Got it.

79
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,160
-I'm sorry! Ouch!
-It's okay.

80
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,061
Just sit.

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,063
Are you okay?

82
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,765
Yeah, thanks.

83
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,139
Thanks.

84
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,874
This looks delicious!

85
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,577
You finally made it to the avant-garde
<i>tonkotsu</i> ramen place, Kame.

86
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,646
Finally, <i>tonkotsu</i> for lunch.

87
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,248
Hurry, pass me the chopsticks.

88
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,751
-Here you go, Tae-o.
-Thank you.

89
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,486
-Here.
-Thanks.

90
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,221
Enjoy your meal.

91
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,289
LET'S EAT HERE

92
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,625
A heart.

93
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,526
Hm?

94
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,999
Now I see.

95
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,235
Did you get a girlfriend?

96
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,136
No.

97
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,271
What? "No"?

98
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,707
Do you have something to hide?

99
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,110
Nope.

100
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,713
It's fine. I found one.

101
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,881
I knew it. Congratulations!

102
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,416
Congratulations for what?

103
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,785
Um…

104
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,458
When you want to make
special memories in Japan,

105
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,693
where do you usually go on dates?

106
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,365
You eat delicious food

107
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,567
or go to the beach.

108
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,801
We've done both.

109
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,803
In that case…

110
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,374
An <i>oncheon</i>?

111
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,877
-An <i>oncheon</i>, huh?
-Yeah.

112
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,579
What's an <i>oncheon</i>?

113
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,382
<i>Oncheon</i>s are <i>oncheon</i>s.

114
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,983
-Hot springs.
-Are they tasty?

115
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,718
They're delicious.

116
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,836
It's been a while, Park.

117
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,240
I would like to earnestly make a request.

118
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,346
There is something
I would like you to procure.

119
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,339
Good mor…ning.

120
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,543
Did you put on makeup today?

121
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,145
Y-Yes.

122
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,084
She's so cute.

123
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,821
Time for the hot springs.

124
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,757
-Hot springs?
-Yes.

125
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,058
We're going right now.

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,426
Hot springs? Right now?

127
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,261
Yes, the hot springs.

128
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,704
SUPER BATHHOUSE

129
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,372
Hot springs?

130
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,841
Hot springs.

131
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,442
-Let's go.
-S-Sure.

132
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,379
They said we can choose any<i> yukata </i>here.

133
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,282
Hm?

134
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,186
Oh,<i> gwiyeowo </i>means "cute."

135
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,722
<i>Gwiyeowo.</i>

136
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,926
Choose for me, Yuri.

137
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,529
What color would look good on me?

138
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,664
What? Well…

139
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,568
I think a bright color would suit you.

140
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,103
White, perhaps?

141
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,774
<i>Gwiyeowo.</i>

142
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,344
-Really?
-Yes.

143
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,778
I'll wear white, then.

144
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,047
But gray might be good too.

145
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,250
-I'll wear gray.
-But blue…

146
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,384
I'll wear blue.

147
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,288
Oh yeah, it's your birthday.

148
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,956
Must be nice.

149
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,094
<i>Can we meet today?</i>

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,262
<i>I can't.</i>

151
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,796
<i>Why?</i>

152
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,797
READ

153
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,868
<i>The spring tide is today.</i>

154
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,570
What?

155
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,407
There's no hope.

156
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,112
Why am I always the only one
in such despair?

157
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,259
This is cute.

158
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,868
<i>-Hello?</i>
-When can you meet then?

159
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,603
<i>-What?</i>
-And also,

160
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,405
what even is a spring tide?

161
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,911
<i>Would you like to go
to the beach too then, Mahiro?</i>

162
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,479
What?

163
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,488
I'd love to.

164
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:01,767
What is happening?

165
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,070
We're harvesting sea slugs.

166
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,073
Sea slugs?

167
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,077
Sea slugs are found hiding
in the rocks' shadows or in seaweed.

168
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,713
You can only harvest them
during spring tides.

169
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,048
Mahiro, you're lucky.

170
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,641
What is it?

171
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,776
Oh, I couldn't read the letters.

172
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,444
That app is handy, isn't it?

173
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,345
Yeah.

174
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,915
Do you want to enter
the open-air baths together?

175
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,785
We can't, and I won't.

176
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,953
We can't?

177
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:56,989
Well…

178
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,161
The stone sauna might be okay.

179
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,903
Oh, I had trouble tying this.

180
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,776
Thank you.

181
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,212
How does the <i>yukata</i> look on me?

182
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,081
It really suits you.

183
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,917
It suits you too.

184
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,125
No.

185
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
How about a <i>ppoppo</i>?

186
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,564
What's a <i>ppoppo</i>?

187
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,266
Look it up.

188
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,072
<i>Ppoppo.</i>

189
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,908
PPOPPO
KISS

190
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,243
We can't.

191
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,952
CAN I KISS YOU?

192
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
Don't be like this in public.

193
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,193
Well, then.

194
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,177
It's so hot.

195
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,520
It's so hot.

196
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,772
It's Nishina! Nishina is here!

197
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,477
Come on.

198
00:12:59,011 --> 00:12:59,845
Let's go.

199
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:09,922
That was close.

200
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,191
Huh?

201
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,697
Shall we go home?

202
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,167
What? We're leaving?

203
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,035
She'll find us, you know.

204
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,270
You think so?

205
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,307
Wait one second.

206
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,753
What do you think?

207
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,022
It's cute.

208
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,223
Really?

209
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,025
Wait one second.

210
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,597
Here.

211
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,336
So cute.

212
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
-Come here.
-Hm?

213
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,716
REST AREA

214
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,590
This was fun.

215
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,991
-Really?
-Yeah.

216
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,259
Let's come again.

217
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,361
How about tomorrow then?

218
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,629
Tomorrow?

219
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
Tomorrow is…

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,975
Huh? Tae-o?

221
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,110
Oh, Nishina!

222
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,683
Is that your girlfriend?

223
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,519
Yes.

224
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,926
When I said hot springs,
I didn't mean here.

225
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,327
What?

226
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,196
Nice to meet you.

227
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,866
I work at the same company as Tae-o.

228
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,167
Oh, she's--

229
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,837
What is she doing?

230
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,011
She gets shy easily.

231
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,780
Oh, I see.

232
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,149
Sorry for interrupting.

233
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,921
We'll be heading out first then.

234
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,322
Bye.

235
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,357
Let's go.

236
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,496
Oh, well. I'm gonna have a beer.

237
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,980
Excuse me.

238
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,086
-Yes?
-Did you give it some thought?

239
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,922
The reason why I gave you the chocolate.

240
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,425
I don't really understand

241
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,996
what's going on in your mind
or anything that you do.

242
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,732
It's always too unpredictable to me.

243
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,135
That's my line.

244
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,688
What do I have to do

245
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,825
for you to notice me?

246
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,260
Notice you?

247
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,635
May I?

248
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,271
Yes.

249
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,602
Did that

250
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,171
help you notice me?

251
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,045
I'll forget that happened just now.

252
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,347
What?

253
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,052
The turnover time
for human skin cells is around six weeks,

254
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,554
while the lips
only take three to four days.

255
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,390
So, in four days' time,
it'll be as if it never happened.

256
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,960
What are you talking about?

257
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,596
What about yourself?

258
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,698
You know how I feel, don't you?

259
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,634
What? I don't understand at all.

260
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,936
You know that I like you, right?

261
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,075
What?

262
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,243
Huh?

263
00:17:58,977 --> 00:17:59,812
What?!

264
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,654
Nope.

265
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:20,999
So cute.

266
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,872
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

267
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,876
Peter Piper picked a peck of…

268
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,846
peppered pickles.

269
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,714
Peppered pickles?

270
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,216
-Peppered?
-Dang it!

271
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,527
Heard of it before?

272
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,663
I think I have.

273
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,503
The <i>daruma</i> fell over.

274
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,771
<i>Daruma</i>?

275
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,340
Yeah, it falls over.

276
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,741
Let's try it.

277
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:04,743
All right.

278
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,246
Here we go.

279
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,852
The <i>daruma</i>…

280
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,053
fell over!

281
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,465
The <i>daruma</i> fell over.

282
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,703
<i>Ppoppo?</i>

283
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,272
<i>Ppoppo.</i>

284
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,507
PPOPPO
KISS

285
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,382
The <i>daruma</i> fell over!

286
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,086
"<i>Ppoppo haedo dwae</i>"?

287
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,721
Huh?

288
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,260
The <i>daruma</i> fell over!

289
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,035
"<i>Han</i>"?

290
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,670
One more time?

291
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,039
What?

292
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,878
It's Mahiro.

293
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,482
Hello?

294
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,117
<i>He rejected me!</i>

295
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,519
What?

296
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,453
Like I said,

297
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,988
the doctor

298
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,123
rejected me!

299
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,359
What?!

300
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,928
I can't believe this!

301
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:34,032
Who would actually get rejected
at the beach in the winter?

302
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,967
Um…

303
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,536
What happened exactly?

304
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,038
<i>Could it be</i>

305
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,408
that you really didn't know?

306
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,110
Yes.

307
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,146
Were you

308
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,650
-referring to romantic feelings--
-Yes.

309
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,954
When could that have happened?

310
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,526
I…

311
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,564
have never seen you in that way.

312
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,371
I've never been rejected before.

314
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,739
Never?

315
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,274
That's impressive.

316
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,579
Have you ever been rejected?

317
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,548
I have.

318
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,250
Was it

319
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,786
your ex-boyfriend from high school?

320
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,987
Yeah.

321
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,092
-Why?
-Huh?

322
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,143
It's fine if you don't want to say.

323
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,184
Sorry.

324
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,589
I don't care either way.

325
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,832
You're always like this, Yuri.

326
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,167
Hm?

327
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,869
You always evade the topic

328
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,771
and look away.

329
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,709
I know you're bearing something.

330
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,081
I thought you'd tell me one day,

331
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,918
but in the end,

332
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,955
you're never going to tell me, huh?

333
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,761
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,839
I apologize, I got too emotional.

335
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,476
I'll take my leave now.

336
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,591
I…

337
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,264
can hear other people's thoughts.

338
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,601
What?

339
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,172
What do you mean?

340
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,841
When I lock eyes with someone,

341
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,247
I can hear what that person is thinking.

342
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,151
Why are you suddenly
turning this into a magical fantasy?

343
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,186
Sorry, it's hard to believe, right?

344
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:48,226
<i>Does she not want to tell me
the truth that badly?</i>

345
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,327
No.

346
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,698
It's true.

347
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,501
What?

348
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,370
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,173
But…

350
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,842
I can hear everything.

351
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,379
<i>Seriously?</i>

352
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,482
Seriously.

353
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,657
<i>Good evening.</i>

354
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,426
Good evening.

355
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,998
-Annyeong…
-…<i>haseyo</i>.

356
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:28,733
Gamsa…

357
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,202
…<i>habnida</i>.

358
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,403
Sarang…

359
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,573
<i>…haeyo.</i>

360
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:38,944
This…

361
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,847
can't be real.

362
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,251
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,987
When did it start?

364
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,524
By the time we met,

365
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,326
I was already…

366
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,069
<i>That's scary.</i>

367
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,374
You know, I can hear people's thoughts.

368
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,810
People's thoughts?

369
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,212
<i>That's scary.</i>

370
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,752
I apologize, I think
I'll have to leave for today.

371
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,163
Is Senpai out today?

372
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,333
He says he has a fever from overthinking.

373
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,669
I wonder what happened to Onoda.

374
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,304
Overthinking?

375
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,874
<i>The person Tae-o likes isn't Mahiro.</i>

376
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,576
It's the company CEO.

377
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,111
Overthinking…

378
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,112
Um…

379
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,881
-Tae-o.
-Yes?

380
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,989
Um, it's about the person you like.

381
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,126
Is it true that she's the CEO?

382
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:02,661
Yes.

383
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:06,031
But your heart was broken, yes?

384
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:07,999
Actually…

385
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,469
she became my girlfriend!

386
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,539
What is the meaning of this?

387
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,576
Today is our fourth day.

388
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,582
You're kidding.

389
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,884
This can't be.

390
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,086
Why not?

391
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,258
Because…

392
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,329
Do you…

393
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,031
know everything about her?

394
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,367
Everything?

395
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,772
There may be something
you have yet to know about her.

396
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,143
What do you mean?

397
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,720
Could you please

398
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,523
reconsider dating her?

399
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,065
Tae-o, you…

400
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,271
are like a son to me.

401
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,125
I'll be going now.

402
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,532
Kame, you're up.

403
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,404
You messed up.

404
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,175
That's hard. Try it.

405
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,916
-Wow, that was right.
-It was?

406
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,185
-Wow. What?
-Thank you.

407
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,920
What does<i> ganjang </i>mean?

408
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,689
<i>Ganjang gongjang</i> means

409
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,589
soy sauce factory.

410
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,757
Good morning.

411
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,325
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

412
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,560
Kame, one more try.

413
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,998
-No, there's no "<i>doenjang</i>."
-Totally wrong.

414
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,099
Wait, what?

415
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,634
<i>Ganjang gongjang.</i>

416
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,535
Now I get it.

417
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,636
-Once more.
-Got it.

418
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,771
<i>Ganjang gongjang jonjang janggo</i>.
How's that?

419
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,174
-It's not<i> jonjang janggo</i>.
-I was so close.

420
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,276
-That was close.
-It was, right?

421
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,777
Why did I tell her?

422
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,279
Not <i>ganjo</i>. <i>Ganjang</i>.

423
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,647
Try again, Kame.

424
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,984
-Not <i>gonjang janggo</i>.
-Totally wrong.

425
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,119
What's with that tone?

426
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,963
Seriously? This tastes awful.

427
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,352
What would you do
if I said I'm from the future.

428
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:15,820
What?

429
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,989
What would you do?

430
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,993
Should I reply seriously?

431
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,931
Don't you think

432
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,001
it would be scary?

433
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,069
Not sure.

434
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,206
Even now, you're already
pretty mysterious to me, Mahiro.

435
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,541
It's scary.

436
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,343
What?

437
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,249
The way you always start
nonsensical conversations like this,

438
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,185
or how your emotions
are always gushing out,

439
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,087
is hard for me to understand.

440
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,289
I often think it's scary.

441
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,491
Are you picking a fight?

442
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,561
I'm just answering your question.

443
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,596
What are you trying to say?

444
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,298
I'm just saying

445
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,968
that regardless of whether
you came from the future or not,

446
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,838
you're still Mahiro to me.

447
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,757
Oh, Boss.

448
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:30,728
Yuri.

449
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,899
What is it?

450
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,303
I'll go home with you,

451
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,504
since we're dating.

452
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,541
Are you hungry?

453
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,447
Yeah.

454
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,562
-Did something happen?
-Hm?

455
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,398
You seem down.

456
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,367
No, I'm fine.

457
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,169
Say whatever you want.

458
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,137
I'll…

459
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,206
give you some energy!

460
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,880
Sorry.

461
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,584
Don't say sorry.

462
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,720
Why are you feeling down?

463
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,793
Mahiro and I…

464
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,961
…had a fight?

465
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,863
Not a fight, but…

466
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,912
Did you talk through everything properly?

467
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,018
Yuri, you're hard to understand…

468
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,958
And people usually don't know
what others are thinking.

469
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,465
In that moment, you told me upfront

470
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,668
that you like me.

471
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,872
I was really happy.

472
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,142
That was…

473
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,681
only because you said it to me upfront.

474
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,317
How about Mahiro?

475
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,556
Mahiro is always upfront too, isn't she?

476
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,244
<i>It's okay.</i>

477
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,981
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

478
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,689
As for dinner together,
let's push it to tomorrow.

479
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,793
Go.

480
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,234
Yeah.

481
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,437
Thank you.

482
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,074
I'll be off.

483
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,510
Get there safely.

484
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,210
Mahiro?

485
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,607
I'm sorry…

486
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,744
for scaring you.

487
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,581
I should be the one apologizing.

488
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,988
Please.

489
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,224
Open your eyes.

490
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,842
I ran away earlier…

491
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,380
and hurt you, Yuri.

492
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,284
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,888
It's because I told you so suddenly.

494
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,690
But I'm the one who made you tell me.

495
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,458
-No, I--
-It was me.

496
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,163
You always blame yourself like that.

497
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,401
You're always thinking of others

498
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,437
and being considerate.

499
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,808
No.

500
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,312
That's not it.

501
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,618
To be honest…

502
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:03,094
It's because I was afraid
you would be scared of me.

503
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,631
I mean,

504
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,467
you were thinking you're scared, right?

505
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,507
I wouldn't get to ask
for your advice anymore,

506
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,643
or eat lunch with you,

507
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,847
or be friends with you,

508
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,450
or listen to your pointless stories.

509
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,454
Losing all of that scared me.

510
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,161
So, the reason
why I couldn't open up to you

511
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,399
was for my benefit.

512
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,280
I knew it.

513
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,485
You are you,
and that's all there is to it.

514
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,458
You love me, don't you?

515
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,730
It's fine.

516
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,667
It's fine, even if you're from the future.

517
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,372
You haven't told Tae-o, right?

518
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,242
No.

519
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,043
You don't have to.

520
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,312
Friends and lovers are different.

521
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,749
So…

522
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,754
I'll protect you.

523
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,631
Wait, you just called
my stories pointless.

524
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,266
They <i>are</i> pointless.

525
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,336
I like that about you.

526
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,507
<i>Huh?</i>

527
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,442
<i>You told Mahiro?</i>

528
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,679
Yes, I was finally able to tell her.

529
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,681
<i>I see…</i>

530
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,549
<i>I see.</i>

531
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,352
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

532
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,259
Someone gave me a push from behind.

533
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,194
<i>Oh, really?</i>

534
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,969
Dad, I…

535
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,540
found someone I like.

536
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,542
<i>Huh?</i>

537
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,044
<i>Huh?!</i>

538
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:39,750
I'm dating him now.

539
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,588
<i>What?! Wh-What kind of person is he?</i>

540
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,291
He's a kind person.

541
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,927
<i>What? Is that so.</i>

542
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,096
<i>I see.</i>

543
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,466
<i>Congratulations, Yuri.</i>

544
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,435
<i>I see…</i>

545
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,037
You're too happy about this.

546
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,712
I'm glad you two made up.

547
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,915
Yeah, it's all thanks to you. Thank you.

548
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,050
Now we can finally

549
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,653
have dinner together.

550
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,688
It's been a while, huh?

551
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,090
Was Hokkaido the last time?

552
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,661
But Hanaoka was there at the time.

553
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,341
When was the last time we had a meal
with just the two of us?

554
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,178
I think…

555
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,750
Oh, right.

556
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,153
That place was tasty. We should go again…

557
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,789
Hm?

558
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,638
When was it again?

559
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,145
<i>I like you, Yuri.</i>

560
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,548
<i>But I don't think we can continue this.</i>

561
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,251
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

562
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,434
Yuri.

563
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,962
<i>If he finds out…</i>

564
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:14,538
<i>we may never look at each other again.</i>

565
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,280
<i>He is the only one…</i>

566
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,319
The <i>daruma</i>…

567
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,720
<i>He can never know.</i>

568
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,590
…fell over.

569
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,853
Yuri.

-Potatoes.
-Potatoes.

575
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,100
I forgot the potatoes.

576
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,136
-I'll go buy them.
-I'll go too.

577
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,205
-Head back first.
-What?

578
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:15,159
BEST BIBIMBAP EVER.
I FEEL ENERGIZED. THANK YOU.

579
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,136
Min Ha-na.

580
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,741
Professor, someone named Park
sent you a package.

581
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,775
Thank you.

"When she locks eyes with another,

591
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,581
What?

00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:28,625
"One day, the girl met
a boy with a kind heart."

593

<i>Get energized!</i>

605
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:52,376
If you could get rid of that power…

606
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,812
In that case, Dad and I…

607
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,114
Are you prepared for this?
