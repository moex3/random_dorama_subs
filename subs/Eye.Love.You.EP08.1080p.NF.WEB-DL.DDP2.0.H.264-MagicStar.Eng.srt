1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,808
"When she locks eyes with another,

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,312
only then can she hear
the voice in their heart."

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:18,284
"One day, the girl met
a boy with a kind heart."

4
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:23,490
"The boy showed
a great amount of love to the girl."

5
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,063
<i>"However, the girl kept
her power to hear people's hearts</i>

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,566
<i>as a secret from the boy."</i>

7
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,637
"In the end, the two of them

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,141
were met with much misfortune."

9
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,610
Misfortune…

10
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:50,717
<i>"That was the fate
given to the girl who could hear</i>

11
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,486
<i>people's hearts."</i>

12
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,424
What is this?

13
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,733
I'm home, Yuri.

14
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,836
-Welcome back.
-Hungry, right?

15
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,837
I'll cook now.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,475
By the way, Tae-o…

17
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,214
Um…

18
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,949
What is it?

19
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,720
It's nothing.

20
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,522
Don't worry.

21
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,659
Just five minutes.

22
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,874
THE GIRL WHO CAN HEAR YOUR HEART

23
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,248
KOREAN CHILDREN'S BOOK

24
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,250
AUTHOR: MIN HA-NA

25
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,418
OUT OF PRINT

26
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,153
"Out of print."

27
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,557
Misfortune.

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,632
"That was the fate given."

29
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,540
Is it just a coincidence?

30
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,376
No, but…

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,248
Hm?

32
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,051
<i>Come in. Do you copy?
Mahiro, reporting in.</i>

33
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,721
<i>Can you hear me, Yuri?</i>

34
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:46,432
<i>I want you to try the samples I made
for the new summer product.</i>

35
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,573
<i>Whoa, you actually heard me.</i>

36
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,744
<i>Oh, and how about we get some lunch soon?</i>

37
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,046
<i>A new bakery opened up nearby.</i>

38
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,720
<i>Yuri, you seem kind of down today.</i>

39
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,022
<i>Something wrong?</i>

40
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,695
<i>What is she doing?</i>

41
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,411
Let me get this straight.

42
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:36,182
Basically, a picture book
written about the same power as yours

43
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,284
is in Tae-o's possession.

44
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,153
Yeah.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,989
And coincidentally, that story

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:48,027
is linked to the memories
you made together for some reason.

47
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,029
Yeah, seems like that.

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,604
To add to the mystery, Tae-o somehow has

49
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,441
a business card
from Min Ha-na, the author.

50
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,677
What do you think?
Is it just a coincidence?

51
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,146
It's all way too connected.

52
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,848
Right?

53
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,650
I'm so confused.

54
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,053
There's more to that book, right?

55
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,954
Yeah.

56
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,157
Maybe I'll understand
if I read the whole thing.

57
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,662
No, there's no way.

58
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,865
I mean, it's just a picture book.

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,102
I'm sure it's a coincidence.
You're worrying too much.

60
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,207
You're right.

61
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,577
TAE-O'S PICTURE BOOK

62
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,580
MUCH MISFORTUNE
PICTURE OF THUNDER, TURTLE, PAPER SLIPS

63
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,644
Is this…

64
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,013
true?

65
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,121
What happened?

66
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,690
Kame…

67
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,192
The thunder…

68
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,093
Ouch!

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,362
-Kame, are you okay?
-That hurts!

70
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,599
He got scared by the thunder just now
and threw his back out.

71
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,634
What?

72
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,636
-Please get up.
-I don't think I can.

73
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,473
-That hurts!
-Thunder. Turtle.

74
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,711
-Yuri!
-Huh?

75
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,279
<i>Turtle! Thunder!</i>

76
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,247
<i>-"Kame" means turtle!</i>
-Huh?

77
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,051
<i>Come on, the turtle and thunder!</i>

78
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,354
<i>From the picture book!</i>

79
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,623
Kame?

80
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,660
-Kame! Get up!
-Don't hit me!

81
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,831
That picture book isn't a coincidence.

82
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,165
What?

83
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,707
<i>Yuri, leave this to me.</i>

84
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,376
Huh?

85
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,045
<i>I have a plan.</i>

86
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,447
Can't you just speak out loud?

87
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,586
I, the chocolatier,
will solve this mystery.

88
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,596
Let's solve the mystery after chocolate.

89
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,336
Coming.

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
Hello.

91
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,713
<i>Annyeonghaseyo.</i>
Sorry for coming along too.

92
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,614
It's okay.

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,983
Yuri told me. Come in.

94
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,152
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,722
Sorry about this.

96
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,623
It's fine.

97
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,057
I'm happy to host.

98
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,827
Food tastes better when you share it.

99
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,630
-Come in.
-Thank you.

100
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,165
This must be it.

101
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,276
Oh, are you hungry?

102
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,712
No worries.
I've already prepared the food.

103
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,247
Please.

104
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,083
Sit tight for a moment.

105
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,194
<i>Come in. Do you copy?
Mahiro, reporting in.</i>

106
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,361
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

107
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,400
<i>No, use the signal we agreed on.</i>

108
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,938
<i>All right, let's run through it.</i>

109
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:57,643
<i>I'll lure away Tae-o now,
and you'll use that time to read the book.</i>

110
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,544
<i>Okay?</i>

111
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,615
<i>All right.</i>

112
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,784
Hey, <i>oppa</i>.

113
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,421
Want to come to the convenience store
with me? I forgot to buy alcohol.

114
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,889
I'm not your <i>oppa</i>.

115
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,158
It's fine. Come on, let's go, <i>oppa</i>.

116
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,392
It's not fine.

117
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,229
And I have a ton of alcohol.

118
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,605
I'm feeling like wine tonight.

119
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,808
Wine? With Korean food?

120
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,913
Jeez, let's just go, <i>oppa</i>.

121
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,716
<i>Now's your chance.</i>

122
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,252
We'll be back!

123
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,454
See you soon.

124
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:42,922
Hurry up.

125
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,578
Senpai, you're finally here.

126
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,616
Why? Why is he here?

127
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,951
He's trying to come in!

128
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,486
Wait, you can't!

129
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,023
Hello.

130
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,891
Hello.

131
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,460
Why is Onoda here?

132
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,095
I invited him.

133
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,731
Food tastes better when you share it.

134
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,269
-Come in.
-Thanks.

135
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,172
Don't mind if I do.

136
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,808
Like I said, that's incorrect.

137
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,343
I'm not your <i>oppa</i>.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,146
But <i>oppa</i> means "big brother," right?

139
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:45,384
From what I remember, women in Korea
use <i>oppa</i> to refer to older men, right?

140
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,156
Yes, but Mahiro is older than me.

141
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,959
What's the big deal?
Just let me call you <i>oppa</i>.

142
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,561
No, absolutely not.

143
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,296
You're such a stickler.

144
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,065
<i>Oppa.</i>

145
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,905
Hm, this wine is nice.

146
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:06,872
That's great.

147
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,510
Mahiro was just saying
how she wanted to drink wine.

148
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,379
-Really?
-Huh?

149
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:15,915
Yes, I guess.

150
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,618
Do you like wine?

151
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,622
Well, when I'm in the mood for it.

152
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,403
Her favorite alcoholic drink is wine.

153
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,805
What region?

154
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,741
What?

155
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,875
How often do you drink?

156
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,677
Do you have a high or low tolerance?

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,147
What kind of drunk are you,
and how do I take care of you?

158
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,049
-And--
-H-hold on.

159
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,184
What are you doing?

160
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,257
I want to do research

161
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,459
about you, Mahiro.

162
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:02,962
What?

163
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,997
Research?

164
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,667
I don't quite understand.

165
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,668
I apologize.

166
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,403
But…

167
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,706
This is the only way I'll know.

168
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,880
I want to reconsider this again
once I get to know you properly.

169
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,316
In my life,

170
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,318
what role

171
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,788
does your existence play?

172
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,123
Huh?

173
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
Now I see.

174
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,536
Yuri.

175
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,438
Let's go buy some ice cream.

176
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,672
Right now?

177
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,007
Yes, now.

178
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,210
Wait, but, um…

179
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,279
Hurry, let's go.

180
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,215
What? But…

181
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,454
Yuri, we have to be considerate here.

182
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,354
Considerate?

183
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,123
Watch your feet.

184
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,738
May I…

185
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,574
continue with my questions?

186
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,611
Yes.

187
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,386
Yuri.

188
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,493
Are you a bit cold, by chance?

189
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,996
Oh, just a bit.

190
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,731
That's no good.

191
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,470
Your hands are cold.

192
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,444
It's not a big deal.

193
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,112
Not yet.

194
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,981
They're still cold.

195
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,555
Tae-o.

196
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,893
-Actually…
-Yuri.

197
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,695
Close your eyes.

198
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,377
So adorable.

199
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,254
Do you feel warm now?

200
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,790
Thanks, are these meat buns?

201
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,993
No, they are not meat buns.

202
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,696
Well, then.

203
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,565
It's time

204
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,500
for a quiz.

205
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,669
Okay.

206
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,371
What's in here?

207
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,040
Um…

208
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,744
If they're not meat buns,
are they red bean buns?

209
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:07,880
Was I right or wrong?

210
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,748
You were wrong.

211
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,251
Then… curry buns.

212
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,386
-No.
-Pizza buns.

213
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,555
What else could they be?

214
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,426
Here's a hint, just for you.

215
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,028
Give it a taste.

216
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,466
Thanks for the food.

217
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,118
Is this crab?

218
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,923
Ding, ding! That's correct.

219
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,692
It's my favorite. Crab buns.

220
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,199
You like crab buns, Tae-o?

221
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,166
I didn't know.

222
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,652
Seeing Mahiro and Onoda earlier
got me thinking that

223
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,724
there's still so much
I don't know about you, Tae-o.

224
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,462
Yuri,

225
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,133
what is your favorite food?

226
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,935
My favorite?

227
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,138
<i>Omurice</i>, I think.

228
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,674
<i>Omurice</i>?

229
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,811
My father was a chef,

230
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,014
so he would often make it for me
at the restaurant.

231
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,217
Oh, also,

232
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,753
I like coffee and chocolate.

233
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,757
He would always give me some with my food.

234
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,366
So that's why our company
makes chocolate and coffee.

235
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,134
Yeah.

236
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,870
But, well,

237
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,943
my father has never had the chance
to drink our coffee.

238
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,090
There's a lot for me too.

239
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,028
There is still a lot
I don't know about you, Yuri.

240
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,797
That's why

241
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,568
I want to learn more.

242
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,536
But…

243
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,175
even if I don't know,
my feelings are still the same.

244
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,062
Your kind side.

245
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,197
Your angry side.

246
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,433
Every side of you.

247
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,270
I love them all very much.

248
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,274
That's why

249
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,813
I am incredibly happy right now.

250
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,499
Me too.

251
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:49,935
Thank you.

252
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,807
Shall we head back now?

253
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,707
Yes.

254
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm headed this way.

255
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,996
You're not walking me back?

256
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,269
Mahiro.

257
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,173
I'll contact you.

258
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,708
Huh?

259
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,177
I still have more questions.

260
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,314
I'll send you a list later.

261
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,116
Goodbye then.

262
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,495
Onoda is a bit eccentric,

263
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,165
but he's giving you some serious thought.

264
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,234
Do you think so?

265
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,071
I feel more like I'm a research subject

266
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,940
than a romantic interest.

267
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,782
Oh, that's right. I read the picture book.

268
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,584
What? You really read it?

269
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,022
When Onoda was busy calculating
what my alcohol limit is,

270
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,057
I read the next two pages.

271
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,626
I even took photos.

272
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,560
Thank you.

273
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,897
What did it say?

274
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,401
Well…

275
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,174
If there were a way

276
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,243
to get rid of that power…

277
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,647
would you want to?

278
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,687
"The girl said to the god,

279
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,692
'Tell me how to get rid of this power.'"

280
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,398
"Then, the god told her how."

281
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,534
"She must…"

282
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:10,809
LOCK EYES WITH THE ONE SHE LOVES
FOR 33 SECONDS

283
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,179
<i>It never even crossed my mind.</i>

284
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,717
<i>If I could get rid of this power…</i>

285
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:24,089
I am incredibly happy right now.

286
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,526
<i>…both my love and I</i>

287
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,731
<i>can gaze upon each other
like this forever.</i>

288
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,805
<i>But…</i>

289
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,875
<i>if I lose this power…</i>

290
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,027
<i>Dad and I…</i>

291
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,465
<i>can never talk to each other again.</i>

292
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,472
What's most important to me?

293
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:27,185
BUT IF YOU DO NOT HURRY, YOU WILL LOSE
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU

294
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,299
Yes?

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,436
Yuri, I'm coming in.

296
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,177
I'd be torn too

297
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,847
about whether to keep that power or not.

298
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,286
Yeah, it's a hard choice to make.

299
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,791
But if you don't hurry,
something bad might happen.

300
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,527
But it's just a picture book.

301
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,295
Who knows if it's true or not?

302
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,198
-Boss!
-Yes?

303
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,633
This is horrible!

304
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,735
-Ouch!
-Hey!

305
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,071
-Are you okay?
-Venture Capital Partners,

306
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,140
the very important VCP, has gone bankrupt!

307
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,375
-What?!
-Ouch!

308
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,483
You're kidding me.

309
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,353
Who is Venture Capital Partners?

310
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,788
They were going to invest in us.

311
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,291
Isn't this pretty bad?

312
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,992
That doesn't begin to describe it.

313
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,763
VCP was supposed to invest 70 million yen.

314
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,897
70 million?!

315
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,066
At this rate, our cash flow will run out.

316
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,469
Can we ask
our other investors for a higher sum?

317
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,205
Let's give it a try.

318
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,640
And I'll hit up
every private investor I know.

319
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,075
Thank you.

320
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,317
It happened again.

321
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,592
HARMONY CARE CENTER

322
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,094
Excuse me.

323
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,297
Hello?

324
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,166
<i>Is this Yuri Motomiya?</i>

325
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,735
Your father's condition suddenly worsened.

326
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,071
What?

327
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,175
<i>I've called the doctor as well,
so please come to the center.</i>

328
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,645
Boss.

329
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,747
-Hello.
-Sorry, I'll be back.

330
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,048
Trouble again?

331
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,851
Must be tough being the CEO.

332
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,723
Tae-o, what's wrong?

333
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,762
No, it can't be.

334
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,099
This is something different. It has to be.

335
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,672
HARMONY CARE CENTER

336
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,642
His breath has stabilized now,

337
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,512
so there shouldn't be a problem
if he continues to recover like this.

338
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,081
Thank you.

339
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,149
Goodbye then.

340
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,729
Dad…

341
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,780
<i>Yuri.</i>

342
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,350
What a relief.

343
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,555
What a huge relief.

344
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,728
Sorry about the timing.

345
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,630
How is your father?

346
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,734
They said his bronchial tube was inflamed,
so he had trouble breathing.

347
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,135
It's gone down now.

348
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,973
<i>I'll go to work
once the paperwork is done.</i>

349
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,741
Don't worry about us.

350
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,910
<i>Stay by your father's side.</i>

351
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,645
-But--
-It's fine.

352
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,480
I'll figure it out.

353
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,051
Thank you.

354
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,859
<i>Your power will disappear
if you lock eyes for 33 seconds?</i>

355
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,363
I don't know if it's true though.

356
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,900
But if it's true,

357
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,703
it might be my fault this happened to you.

358
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>What are you saying?</i>

359
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,141
<i>This isn't your fault.</i>

360
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,279
<i>But rather,
this must've been so hard on you,</i>

361
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,114
<i>worrying on your own.</i>

362
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,157
<i>Hey, Yuri.</i>

363
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,863
<i>Want to test that method with me?</i>

364
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,299
What?

365
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,537
<i>If it goes well, you can actually
get rid of your power, right?</i>

366
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,407
That's true, but…

367
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,777
<i>Are you scared?</i>

368
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,446
I mean…

369
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,784
if I really lose my power…

370
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,721
that would mean you and I…

371
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,391
<i>We can still talk.</i>

372
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:40,398
<i>Yesterday, I was losing consciousness,</i>

373
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,201
<i>and I thought it was all over.</i>

374
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,670
<i>That's when I heard it.</i>

375
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,573
<i>Your voice.</i>

376
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,979
<i>"Dad! Dad!"</i>

377
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,314
<i>You called for me over and over.</i>

378
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,819
<i>Even if you lose your power,</i>

379
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,956
<i>your voice will still reach me.</i>

380
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:12,130
<i>I can even feel
the warmth from your hand, you know.</i>

381
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,905
<i>Let's try it, Yuri.</i>

382
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,379
But…

383
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,780
<i>It's okay.</i>

384
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,949
<i>I…</i>

385
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,551
<i>will always be happy.</i>

386
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,293
<i>Now, let's give it a go.</i>

387
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:44,963
<i>Yuri.</i>

388
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,098
<i>Don't look away, okay?</i>

389
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,270
<i>Three…</i>

390
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,472
<i>Two…</i>

391
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,175
<i>One.</i>

392
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,380
<i>Yuri.</i>

393
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,516
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

394
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,294
Yuri.

395
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,697
I want you to listen.

396
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:26,071
Thank you for coming into
this world as my daughter.

397
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,207
Hey, don't be like that.

398
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,244
You were so small when you were born.

399
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,814
<i>You know,</i>

400
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,886
<i>I made a promise to myself
when I felt your little hand,</i>

401
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,424
<i>that no matter what may come our way,</i>

402
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,927
<i>I would protect you.</i>

403
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,865
So, on that day,

404
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,004
I was proud that I could protect you

405
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,575
with my own two hands.

406
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,579
But…

407
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,649
That was why you…

408
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,655
Yuri, I think
you're misunderstanding something.

409
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,895
I feel incredibly blessed right now.

410
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,436
And then there's this.

411
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,278
Smells nice.

412
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,322
How delicious.

413
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,493
Your coffee, Yuri,

414
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,696
is the most delicious in the world.

415
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,442
<i>Thank you, Yuri.</i>

416
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,617
No.

417
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,222
This isn't what I want.

418
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,001
Dad.

419
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,306
This isn't what I wanted after all.

420
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,647
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,155
Dad, I'm sorry.

422
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,271
I love you, Dad.

423
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>I love you too.</i>

424
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,555
What?!

425
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,589
<i>Huh?</i>

426
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,392
How?

427
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,094
<i>Huh? What?</i>

428
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,997
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

429
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,201
I hear you. I hear you, Dad.

430
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,803
<i>Huh? Why?</i>

431
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,639
<i>Did we mess up?</i>

432
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,909
I don't know.

433
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,845
I'm not sure.

434
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,982
But I'm so glad.

435
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,586
What a relief.

436
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,189
I'm so relieved.

437
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,658
<i>Huh?</i>

438
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:12,297
<i>Does this mean the picture book
was just a coincidence?</i>

439
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,967
Of course it was.
It's just a picture book.

440
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,772
Why did we believe that it was 33 seconds?

441
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,974
<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

442
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,910
<i>I tried so hard to not blink.</i>

443
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,745
Sorry.

444
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,015
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,559
I'm so hungry now.

446
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,532
Tae-o?

447
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,133
Why are you here?

448
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,303
Welcome home. Is your father okay?

449
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,404
Yeah.

450
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,039
He's fine now.

451
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,041
What a relief.

452
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,012
I'm sorry I worried you.

453
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,913
Not at all.

454
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,453
Um, did you have dinner, by chance?

455
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,654
Hm?

456
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:12,857
Delivery's here.

457
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,632
Enjoy.

458
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,802
<i>Omurice</i>?

459
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,205
Since it's your favorite.

460
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,807
Thank you.

461
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,175
Delicious food

462
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,580
is the best way to get energized.

463
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,849
That's why

464
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:43,054
I always make sure to eat
on both good and bad days.

465
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,259
If you do that, you'll eventually
get to enjoy the food one day.

466
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,130
Enjoy.

467
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,666
Yes, thanks for the food.

468
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,152
It's delicious.

469
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,422
Of course. I made it.

470
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,725
Time to eat.

471
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,132
Tastes better eating with you.

472
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,774
Hey, Tae-o.

473
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,345
Just so you know,

474
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,418
my father got in
an accident a long time ago.

475
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,222
He's been bedridden ever since.

476
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,327
Even so,

477
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,831
he's still the same.

478
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,500
He's kind

479
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,368
and positive.

480
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,005
That's why

481
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,008
I've always loved

482
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,112
my dad.

483
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:24,288
It's wonderful how much
you cherish your family.

484
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,529
Do you feel energized?

485
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:33,831
Yes.

486
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,903
Get energized.

487
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,406
Get energized!

488
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,376
Energized!

489
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,245
Energized.

490
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,147
I'll bring some dressing.

491
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,339
Professor.

492
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,009
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly.

493
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,147
There's something
I want to tell you, Tae-o.

494
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,290
It was 12 years ago

495
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:38,196
when I was at Kiritappu Cape
in Hokkaido to do fieldwork.

496
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:44,035
I saw a fishing boat accident.

497
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,841
<i>To save the sea otters,</i>

498
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,378
Yuri Motomiya jumped into the ocean.

499
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,415
Yuri?

500
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,083
Yes.

501
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,357
However,

502
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,661
Ms. Motomiya looked
as if she were about to drown,

503
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,064
so her father tried to save her.

504
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,204
I couldn't stop thinking about those two.

505
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,707
Hello.

506
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,608
12 YEARS AGO

507
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:27,678
I am an endangered species
researcher at Sochi University.

508
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,180
My name is Iiyama.

509
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,421
The sea otters Ms. Motomiya tried to save
were successfully rescued.

510
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,992
I sincerely thank you both.

511
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,694
<i>However,</i>

512
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:49,100
her father was no longer able to speak.

513
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,306
I was concerned for him,

514
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:01,312
so I would visit the hospital
from time to time.

515
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:08,152
That's why I know of
Yuri Motomiya from afar.

516
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,258
I think your girlfriend
is incredibly heroic.

517
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,462
A wonderful person with a kind heart.

518
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,600
However,

519
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,137
she is harboring a secret.

520
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,643
Tae-o.

521
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,479
Please…

522
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,751
think of this
as a request from your father.

523
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:48,125
Your girlfriend, Motomiya Yuri…

524
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,263
Please break up with her.

525
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,310
Please keep us in mind
if another opportunity arises.

526
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,213
Thank you. Goodbye.

527
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,695
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

528
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,669
Hello?

529
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,006
Is this Hanaoka from Dolce &amp; Chocolat.?

530
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,408
<i>Yes, this is he.</i>

531
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,579
This is Min. We met at Lake Akan, Hokkaido
during the gathering.

532
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,016
Ms. Min.

533
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,919
It's great hearing from you.

534
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,758
Actually, I saw the news about VCP
and thought of you.

535
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,731
If you're okay with it,
I'd like to be of help.

536
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,567
Really?

537
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,535
<i>Yes.</i>

538
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,805
Your company's work piqued my interest.

539
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,542
I'd like to speak with you in person.

540
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,978
I'll be in Japan next week.

541
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,149
Thank you. I'd love to meet you.

542
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,885
I'll be in touch.

543
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,193
Dad, how are you feeling?

544
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,729
Did you have a visitor? Someone you know?

545
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,299
<i>Yuri.</i>

546
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,768
<i>Take a seat.</i>

547
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,954
<i>Actually, I want to talk to you
about that man.</i>

548
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,723
Hm?

549
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,927
It's been a while. It's Iiyama.

550
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,467
You can hear me, correct?

551
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,674
If you can hear my voice,

552
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,613
could you give me a response by blinking?

553
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,353
Thank you.

554
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,258
I actually wanted to ask you something.

555
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,294
It's about your daughter,

556
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,930
Yuri Motomiya,

557
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,900
and her secret power.

558
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,068
What?

559
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,704
It can't be.

560
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,806
How does he know?

561
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,242
<i>In the past,</i>

562
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,578
I realized something

563
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,515
when you and your daughter were talking.

564
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,553
She…

565
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,356
can hear people's thoughts.

566
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,927
Am I right?

567
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,111
So, she really can.

568
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,048
Actually,

569
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:09,219
there's one more person
who knows her secret.

570
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,191
This person's name is…

571
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,928
<i>Yun Tae-o.</i>

572
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,501
<i>Her boyfriend.</i>

573
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,841
First, please read this picture book.

574
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,946
There's no need.

575
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,448
Tae-o.

576
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,018
Could it be

577
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,988
that you already know her secret?

578
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,625
Yes, I know.

579
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:24,928
But…

580
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,298
I've made my choice.

581
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,502
I…

582
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,009
I…

583
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,113
will always love

584
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,050
Yuri.

585
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,793
Are you prepared…

586
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,496
for what's to come?

587
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,167
You <i>do</i> know

588
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,037
how this book ends, right?

589
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:18,415
Professor.

590
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:22,986
You know,

591
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,289
I'm Yun Tae-o.

592
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,152
Subtitle translation by: Chul Woong Kim

593
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,687
<i>My Yuri.</i>

594
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,122
<i>Matching pajamas?</i>

595
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,324
I love how things are now the most.

596
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,293
<i>Can you hear my thoughts?</i>

597
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,163
<i>I don't want them to meet the same fate.</i>

598
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,166
I truly love you, Yuri.
