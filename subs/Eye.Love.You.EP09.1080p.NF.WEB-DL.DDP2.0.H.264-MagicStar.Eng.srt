1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,442
Actually, there's one more person
who knows her secret.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,045
This person's name is…

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,681
<i>Yun Tae-o.</i>

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,150
<i>Her boyfriend.</i>

5
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,555
Tae-o…

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,326
knows about my power?

7
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>I knew it.</i>

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>So, you really are dating
someone named Yun Tae-o.</i>

9
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,643
But…

10
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,647
What does this mean?

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>I heard about all of this</i>

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:56,156
<i>from Professor Iiyama,
who teaches at Tae-o's graduate school.</i>

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,828
<i>It seems that Professor Iiyama
found out about your power</i>

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,631
<i>and told Tae-o about it.</i>

15
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:10,036
But Tae-o already knew about it
before I told him.

16
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,842
At this rate, something bad
might happen to the two of them.

17
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:28,054
So, could you please force
the two of them to break up?

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,627
Is it true?

19
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,966
Does Tae-o really know about my power?

20
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,303
It's hard to believe.

21
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,539
<i>If your boyfriend</i>

22
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,176
<i>is trying to hide it,</i>

23
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:55,748
<i>he may have his own reasons for doing so.</i>

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,934
Are you prepared for what's to come?

25
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,011
Let's recap.

26
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:32,485
Number one. Does Tae-o
really know about your power?

27
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,491
Number two. When did he find out?

28
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:44,397
Number three. Who in the world
is Professor Iiyama?

29
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,833
There's one thing that really bothers me.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,003
If Tae-o knows my power,

31
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,373
why is he keeping that a secret from me?

32
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,176
That's true.

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,480
Why is he keeping it
a secret from you?

34
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,749
Let's look into that.

35
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,650
How?

36
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,753
All you can do is ask him directly.

37
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,154
I can't do that.

38
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,524
We're not even sure
if he really knows or not.

39
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,661
Then translation is our only option.

40
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,562
Translation?

41
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,198
You'll translate Tae-o's thoughts
into Japanese.

42
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:20,867
How?

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,406
We have the perfect time
and place for that.

44
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,475
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW WITH CEO

45
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,444
The performance review?

46
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,582
Today's meeting is with Kame, right?

47
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,657
You know, I look forward to
this performance review every year.

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
You do?

49
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,760
Aren't you nervous?

50
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,031
No. Boss takes the time to let me
talk about my daughter every year.

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,435
-Don't you see, Aihara?
-Let's push his meeting to next week.

52
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,303
-What?
-All right then.

53
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,973
Let's do this, Yuri.

54
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,075
U-Um…

55
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:07,113
Can you really keep dating Tae-o
and act like you don't know anything?

56
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,118
You're right.

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,191
If you want to open the door to his heart,
you need to make the first move

58
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,393
and knock.

59
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,598
Yeah.

60
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,317
Come in.

61
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,388
Take a seat.

62
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,256
Okay.

63
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,966
Want to get some coffee?

64
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,901
-Sure.
-All right.

65
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:09,175
We'll start this review
with a stress check.

66
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,544
A stress check?

67
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,179
Yes, a stress check.

68
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,681
It's a part of the review.

69
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,316
I see.

70
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,420
Now, let's begin.

71
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,255
Okay.

72
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,733
In a land far, far away, there once lived

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,537
a sea otter and a dog who were friends.

74
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,672
A sea otter?

75
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:45,111
The sea otter had a delicious tangerine,

76
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,881
but kept it a secret from the dog.

77
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,618
The sea otter has a tangerine?

78
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,088
But the dog had actually

79
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,191
found out about the secret.

80
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,127
The sea otter… A tangerine.

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,528
Now, then.

82
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,035
What would you do if you were the dog?

83
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,659
"You can send it"?

84
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,595
Send what?

85
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,464
Sea otters don't eat tangerines.

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,201
That's true, but…

87
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,672
Sea otters like to eat
sea urchins or clams.

88
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,607
Um…

89
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,410
That wasn't the point.

90
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:55,014
Also, sea otters and dogs
live in different habitats.

91
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,583
Like I said, that wasn't the point.

92
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,932
THE GREEN ONIONS WENT INSIDE

93
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,434
"The green onions went inside"?

94
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,302
This isn't working.

95
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,605
YURI, LET'S CALL OFF THE PLAN

96
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,506
What?

97
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,448
Is something the matter?

98
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,882
Not at all.

99
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,084
That makes the end

100
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,153
of the stress check.

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,054
Is it over?

102
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,322
Yes, that's enough.

103
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,657
-Boss.
-Yes?

104
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,694
Isn't there anything else
you want to ask me?

105
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,130
What?

106
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,566
You can ask me anything.

107
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,006
Thank you for today.

108
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,309
I hope you'll consider our proposal.

109
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,846
Yes, I look forward to
giving you a positive response.

110
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,947
Thank you.

111
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,924
Our office is nearby.
If you have time, would you like to visit?

112
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,827
I'd like you to meet our CEO too.

113
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,432
Yes, I'd love to.

114
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,707
Kame, can you show me
this month's sales chart?

115
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,809
-This one.
-Thank you.

116
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,253
<i>We'll move on to Special Plan C.</i>

117
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,058
<i>Please continue
to look into Tae-o's thoughts.</i>

118
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,696
<i>I call it Operation Sleepover!</i>

119
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,232
<i>Don't let me go home tonight.</i>

120
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>I'll go meet Professor Iiyama.</i>

121
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,407
<i>Don't worry. I've got just the trick.</i>

122
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,343
Please, right this way.

123
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,182
We have two departments. A lifestyle
department and kitchen department.

124
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,887
The lifestyle department mainly develops
ideas for daily essentials.

125
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,390
The kitchen department…

126
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,391
<i>I wonder…</i>

127
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,163
<i>does Tae-o really know about my power?</i>

128
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,733
Ms. Min?

129
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,370
Let me introduce you.

130
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,605
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,774
I actually have to go now.

132
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,375
Ms. Min?

133
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,853
This is my desk.

134
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,960
It does seem on-brand for you.

135
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,530
You really do only show
interest in your research subjects.

136
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,605
So, where is Professor Iiyama?

137
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,006
Huh?

138
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,675
I was curious.

139
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,279
He hasn't been here since yesterday.

140
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,181
He hasn't?

141
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,918
I wonder what happened.

142
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,486
Who knows?

143
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,556
Maybe he found a new research subject.

144
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,826
I'll go home for today then.

145
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,363
Huh? Wait.

146
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,767
Huh?

147
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,436
Do you really want to leave now?

148
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,705
For today, yes.

149
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,841
This is my workplace.

150
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,345
In other words, it's a chance for you
to learn more about me.

151
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,781
Huh?

152
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,717
Am I the only one
who wants to learn more here?

153
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,191
Don't you want to
learn more about me, Mahiro?

154
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,834
MAHIRO IKEMOTO HAS SENT A MESSAGE

155
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,003
<i>Professor Iiyama was away.</i>

156
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,739
<i>It seems he hasn't come lately.</i>

157
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,384
-Tae-o.
-Huh?

158
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,255
What is it, Boss?

159
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,192
Do you want to…

160
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,498
have a date at my home today?

161
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,368
An at-home date?

162
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,770
Yeah, an at-home date.

163
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,772
Yeah, sounds nice.

164
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,311
Let's go. It'll be our first at-home date.

165
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,379
Yeah.

166
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,922
These are <i>Hypselodoris festiva</i>.

167
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,657
I see.

168
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,695
The <i>Armina papillata</i> I'm studying
are endangered in some regions.

169
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,165
So, by studying a sea slug
with similar life patterns--

170
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,533
I see.

171
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,737
And with that, let's start dating.

172
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,873
-What?
-To learn about each other,

173
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,141
we start by dating.

174
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,609
I told you.

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,612
This is the only way I'll know.

176
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,715
But to learn more about
a romance between you and me,

177
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,551
both you and I have to take part.

178
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,691
Your way of thinking
is way too different from my own.

179
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,061
It's precisely because
we have trouble understanding things

180
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,363
that we become curious.

181
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,300
I see.

182
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,572
That must be why I'm so interested in you.

183
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,976
You're interested

184
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,245
in me?

185
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,448
I am. Incredibly so.

186
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,721
Then how about you and I start dating?

187
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,324
You have a point.

188
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,430
The species that survive are ones
that continue to change and adapt.

189
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,765
Huh?

190
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,235
We're on the brink of mass extinction.

191
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,070
Huh?

192
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,339
Let's survive this time together.

193
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,747
Yes, if you insist.

194
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,684
From here on out,
let's survive this together.

195
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,786
For you and your life.

196
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,659
What was that?

197
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,527
Huh?

198
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,628
What?

199
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,529
Hm?

200
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,575
I'll cook today.

201
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,444
That's great.

202
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:06,912
Oh, right.

203
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,981
Let's take a photo.

204
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,317
-Yuri.
-Yes?

205
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,852
Look here.

206
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,256
Kimchi.

207
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,157
Kimchi?

208
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,593
Yeah. Kimchi.

209
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,794
Kimchi.

210
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,362
Kimchi.

211
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,530
Kimchi!

212
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,034
So cute.

213
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,570
I haven't cooked in a while.

214
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,606
Sorry it's taking so long.

215
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,307
No, it's okay.

216
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,943
I'll help. Here.

217
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
Thank you.

218
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,550
Wow, looks tasty.

219
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,089
Give it a taste.

220
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,258
Are you going to tell me to open wide?

221
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,628
Open wide? Oh, sure.

222
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,374
Is it good?

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,375
Mm.

224
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,376
It's good.

225
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,011
What a relief.

226
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,315
But in my <i>umma</i>'s <i>soondubu</i>…

227
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,353
we put this in.

228
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,821
Oyster sauce?

229
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,057
-Yeah.
-Oh, can you put it in?

230
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,060
Okay then.

231
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,643
Now, open wide.

232
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,522
Mm, that's so good!

233
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,690
So good.

234
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,761
So, this is God's secret ingredient.

235
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,165
Good to know.

236
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,269
All right.

237
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,172
Let's eat.

238
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,310
I've been wondering for a while,
but what does that mean?

239
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,716
Oh, it means, "Enjoy your food."

240
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,652
<i>Masissge meogeoyo.</i>

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,488
Such kind words.

242
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:31,924
Enjoy your food.

243
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,326
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

244
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,161
Enjoy.

245
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,237
Thank you for the food.

246
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,271
Thank you.

247
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,706
Was it good?

248
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,642
Of course,<i> uri </i>Yuri made it.

249
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,611
<i>Uri</i> Yuri?

250
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,646
What does that mean?

251
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,981
<i>Uri </i>Yuri.

252
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,751
It means "My Yuri."

253
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:00,886
<i>Uri </i>Yuri.

254
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,892
So, I'm your <i>Uri</i>?

255
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,826
Yeah.

256
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,628
For the "u" sound,

257
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,698
move your mouth more like this.

258
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,899
Huh?

259
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,641
Keep your mouth like that.

260
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,590
Please wait a moment.

261
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,359
-Five minutes.
-Huh?

262
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,971
What is Operation Sleepover?

263
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,273
Listen, Yuri.

264
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,743
Nothing can beat
when couples are flirting with each other.

265
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,080
Flirting with each other?

266
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,050
That's the only time you can
get away with asking anything.

267
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,822
Flirting with each other?

268
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,069
Here.

269
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,370
-Huh?
-Take it.

270
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,447
Uri <i>Yuri</i>.

271
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,718
Tae-o, I…

272
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:44,957
<i>Yuri.</i>

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,059
<i>Will you…</i>

274
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,102
Yuri!

275
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,071
Thanks for waiting.

276
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,508
What is it?

277
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,043
No, it's nothing.

278
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,846
Yuri.

279
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,181
Let's wear this together.

280
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,483
They're matching sets.

281
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,684
Huh?

282
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,720
Couple pajamas.

283
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,555
Couple pajamas?

284
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,632
Does it look okay?

285
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,770
It's so cute.

286
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,476
You've gotten even cuter.

287
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,877
Oh, take a seat.

288
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,290
-Kimchi.
-Kimchi.

289
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,097
Oh, next,

290
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,867
-let's <i>jjan</i>.
-<i>Jjan</i>?

291
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,136
-Here.
-Thank you.

292
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,341
<i>-Jjan.
-Jjan.</i>

293
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,452
<i>Uri </i>Yuri, open wide.

294
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,128
Sorry, too slow.

295
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,830
Open wide.

296
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,912
So comfortable.

297
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,893
Hey, Tae-o.

298
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,229
Yes?

299
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,701
Do you like books?

300
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,872
Yeah, I do.

301
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,211
Even in university, I was always reading.

302
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,379
I see.

303
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,147
Um…

304
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,549
What about picture books?

305
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,684
Picture books?

306
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,387
Or manga.

307
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,955
I like them.

308
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,958
What kind?

309
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,629
-Time traveling?
-Time traveling.

310
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,033
Oh, superpowers. Those are fun.

311
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:41,933
Yes.

312
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,304
Tae-o,

313
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,040
which would you visit?

314
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,174
The past or the future?

315
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,812
I…

316
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,416
prefer the present.

317
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,221
I love the present the most.

318
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,392
In that case,

319
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,363
if you could have any superpower,

320
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,865
what would it be?

321
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,768
A superpower?

322
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,970
What kinds are there?

323
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,572
For example,

324
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,475
stopping time.

325
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,876
That's no good.

326
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,279
Then I can't talk to you.

327
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,981
There's also teleportation.

328
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,516
That's nice.

329
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,987
If anything ever happens to you,
I can get to you right away.

330
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,258
Then…

331
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,163
What about hearing people's thoughts?

332
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,870
If I could also hear people's thoughts…

333
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,010
Oh.

334
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,348
-I'm going home.
-What?

335
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,683
It's time.

336
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,119
I really need to get home now.

337
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,327
"Also"?

338
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,564
-Could you please take this on?
-Yes.

339
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,935
-Keep me updated, Aihara.
-Okay.

340
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,352
Yes?

341
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
Can I have a moment, Motomiya?

342
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:42,854
Sure.

343
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,223
-It's about the investors.
-Right.

344
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:50,061
A Korean venture capitalist
is positively interested in investing.

345
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,396
They'll tell us soon.

346
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,665
That's great. Thank you.

347
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,401
Read through these materials
from the investor.

348
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,372
MIN HA-NA
HOMETOWN: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

349
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,777
<i>Min Ha-na…</i>

350
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,581
It seems she liked us
at the Hokkaido get-together.

351
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,151
The Hokkaido get-together?

352
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,052
Yeah.

353
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,756
Is something the matter?

354
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,659
No, I'll read through it.

355
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,562
I'll let you know when she replies.

356
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,397
Yes, thank you.

357
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,074
Min Ha-na…

358
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,411
She's from Seoul, South Korea.

359
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,081
Could she be…

360
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,885
someone he knows?

361
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,498
Tae-o.

362
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,976
You've grown so much, Tae-o.

363
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,545
So, it <i>was</i> you, <i>Nuna</i>.

364
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,815
You look the same.

365
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,885
Have you been well?

366
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,886
Yeah.

367
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,891
But what brings you here?

368
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,795
I want to ask you something.

369
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,002
This place is nice.

370
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,007
What do you want to ask, <i>Nuna</i>?

371
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:51,750
When we met in Hokkaido,
I thought you'd have long forgotten me,

372
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,085
a <i>nuna</i> who only temporarily lived nearby.

373
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,490
Is that why you left so quickly?

374
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,459
Back then,

375
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,064
I thought I was satisfied
just knowing you were living well.

376
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,234
But yesterday,

377
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,003
I saw your company's CEO.

378
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:20,211
Ms. Motomiya has
the same power as me, right?

379
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,149
And you two are dating.

380
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,051
Right?

381
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,956
Tae-o, that's the one thing
you shouldn't do.

382
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,724
Why does it have to be her?

383
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,327
Why? You know about her power.

384
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,731
Tae-o.

385
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,107
You know that lies

386
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,776
don't work on me.

387
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,683
It's okay.

388
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,420
I don't mind.

389
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,462
It was around then.

390
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,264
Nice to meet you.

391
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,166
MIN HA-NA

392
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,462
<i>That's when</i>

393
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,999
I realized that you two might have

394
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,802
the same power.

395
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,040
I like Yuri.

396
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,577
Even if you two have the same power,
my feelings won't change.

397
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:02,981
You…

398
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:08,353
remember the ending
of that picture book, right?

399
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,157
You can't stay together.

400
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,760
You should break up
before something happens.

401
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,328
It's my decision.

402
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,598
And I'll take responsibility.

403
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,834
-But--
-Regardless

404
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,071
of what happened to you long ago

405
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,240
or how the picture book ends…

406
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,379
I will never break up with her.

407
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,417
Thanks for worrying about me.

408
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,052
I'll be going now.

409
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,440
<i>Have you lost your trust in him?</i>

410
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,982
The thoughts in Tae-o's mind…

411
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,953
Tae-o's feelings…

412
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,455
What could they be?

413
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,093
I can't tell.

414
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:28,032
<i>It's hard to understand
everything about someone.</i>

415
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,101
<i>But,</i>

416
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,104
<i>I don't think you have to doubt</i>

417
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,874
<i>his feelings of love for you.</i>

418
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,901
Sorry Tae-o, this is for your sake.

419
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,578
Is this about the investment?

420
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,113
No,

421
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,984
I need to briefly return to Korea
on a late-night flight tonight.

422
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,753
But before that…

423
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,156
there is something

424
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,326
I want to give to Ms. Motomiya
as soon as possible.

425
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,530
To Motomiya?

426
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,369
Shall I pass it along to her?

427
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,174
Yes.

428
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,823
<i>A picture book?</i>

429
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,126
<i>For Motomiya? Why?</i>

430
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,837
This story…

431
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,075
is about me.

432
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,143
What?

433
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,248
The ending of this book…

434
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,337
Hanaoka, what is it?

435
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,876
Motomiya.

436
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,380
<i>Motomiya.</i>

437
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,054
<i>I knew it. Can you hear me?</i>

438
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,059
<i>Can you hear</i>

439
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,995
<i>my thoughts?</i>

440
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,903
I'm sorry for testing you.

441
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,811
I need to talk to you.

442
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,336
Ms. Min Ha-na

443
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,505
came to see you.

444
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,175
What?

445
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,280
She wanted to give this to you.

446
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,488
This is…

447
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:22,133
She also has a message for you.

448
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,637
<i>This story</i>

449
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,440
is about me.

450
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,342
What?

451
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,746
The ending of this book

452
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,284
is something that actually happened
between me and my partner.

453
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,223
I don't want

454
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,927
those two to meet the same fate as us.

455
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,300
"Something that actually happened…"

456
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,971
"Us"?

457
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,228
HEAR US, HEAR US
HEAR OUR CRIES

458
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,643
"The girl hurried over

459
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,679
to her loved one's side."

460
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:52,824
"However, fate
would not wait for the two."

461
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,947
"The boy

462
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,250
became a star, shining in the night sky."

463
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,456
"The boy, who became a star,

464
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,926
continued to yell his love for her
in his heart."

465
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,930
"That voice never reached the girl."

466
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,443
I couldn't believe

467
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,813
what Ms. Min was saying at first.

468
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,048
So I looked into it.

469
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,251
Sorry.

470
00:35:56,187 --> 00:36:00,825
I thought some information might only be
in Korean, so I asked Nishina to help.

471
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,959
Then, we found

472
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:07,632
a school newspaper from
Ms. Min's university 22 years ago.

473
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,538
At the time,

474
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,941
<i>it seems Ms. Min had a boyfriend
at the same university.</i>

475
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,620
<i>While attending university, her boyfriend…</i>

476
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,122
U SEON-HO, DECEASED

477
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,423
…passed away.

478
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:41,132
The "us" that Ms. Min was talking about

479
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,967
is about her

480
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,104
and her deceased boyfriend.

481
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,506
I'm sure of it.

482
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,949
He knew everything.

483
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,653
Tae-o.

484
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,415
<i>That's why he…</i>

485
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,086
<i>Want to go somewhere
on our day off tomorrow?</i>

486
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,321
<i>Sure, how about Korea?</i>

487
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,424
<i>He was always</i>

488
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:47,865
<i>just treasuring the moments he had
with me in the present.</i>

489
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,803
I am incredibly happy right now.

490
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,939
I prefer the present.

491
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,509
I love the present the most.

492
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,361
Oh, Yuri?

493
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,196
What is it?

494
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,301
I was just missing you.

495
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,311
I'm glad. Come in.

496
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,180
Thanks.

497
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,459
Yuri, did you eat?

498
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,829
Shall I make you something?

499
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,598
Sure. Sorry.

500
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,601
Why are you apologizing?

501
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,442
I want to talk.

502
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,377
By chance,

503
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,280
can we do it after we eat?

504
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,082
Sure.

505
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,051
I have <i>japchae</i>.

506
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,520
Five minutes.

507
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,788
It'll be done soon.

508
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,124
Take a seat.

509
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,131
Tae-o.

510
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:09,874
Listen.

511
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,652
I…

512
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,955
Meeting you…

513
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,759
Falling in love with you…

514
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,664
That's the first time

515
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,669
I realized what loving someone is like.

516
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,340
I felt happy.

517
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,144
I felt pained.

518
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,614
I felt scared.

519
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:54,985
I felt blessed.

520
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:03,594
I was surprised I could feel
such a whirlwind of emotions.

521
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,263
I only know this

522
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,134
because I met you.

523
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,007
Thank you so much.

524
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,146
Tae-o…

525
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,418
I love you.

526
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,529
So, let's break up.

527
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,442
Why?

528
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,561
<i>Did you find out?</i>

529
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,316
It doesn't matter.

530
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,225
Yuri,

531
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,163
I truly love you.

532
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,345
<i>Yuri.</i>

533
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,037
Thank you.

534
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,014
MICROPHONE

535
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,799
DON'T GO

536
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,869
<i>"The boy became a star,
shining in the night sky."</i>

537
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,638
Yuri!

538
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,542
<i>"The boy, who became a star,
continued to yell</i>

539
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,413
<i>his love for her in his heart."</i>

540
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,785
<i>"That voice never reached the girl."</i>

541
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,923
Why did you make such a sad story?

542
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,896
The person I loved

543
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,466
became a star, just like this boy.

544
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,106
Because I loved him.

545
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:22,946
You know, Tae-o,

546
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,483
in this world,

547
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,423
<i>there are people who you must never love.</i>

548
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,099
