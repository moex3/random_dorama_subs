1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:05,872
Yuri!

2
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,338
Tae-o?

3
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,106
Yes?

4
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,144
I'm okay.

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,745
Are you okay, Yuri?

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,516
I'm okay. Are you hurt anywhere?

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,952
I'm okay.

8
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,030
I knew it. It's my fault.

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,367
It's my fault. I'm really sorry, Tae-o.

10
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,268
It's fine.

11
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,907
It's not your fault, Yuri.

12
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,311
See?

13
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,948
I'm completely fine.

14
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,156
Thank you.

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,866
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

16
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,102
I insist.

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,204
I'll walk you home.

18
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,809
I won't leave you.

19
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,335
You're a scaredy-cat, aren't you?

20
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,505
I like that about you.

21
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,641
That's a flaw.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,977
A flaw?

23
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,712
Yeah, it's a bad thing about me.

24
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,646
What?

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,883
Are there any bad things about you?

26
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,952
There are a lot.

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,191
Oh, by chance, do you mean
how your face gets scary

28
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,093
and such?

29
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,129
That's only when I get hungry, right?

30
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,366
Hmm, who knows?

31
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,015
Anything else?

32
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,617
Well…

33
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,124
It's also not good how you treat me

34
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,027
like a dog.

35
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,696
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,164
Oh, right.

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,234
Your sea otter drawings are bad.

38
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,636
Why was your sea otter…

39
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,673
able to stand?

40
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,842
Throw that note away. It's embarrassing.

41
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,995
I like everything about you, Yuri.

42
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,032
Everything.

43
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,603
I loved it all.

44
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,189
Yes. Thank you.

45
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,762
Oh, um, sorry about that.

46
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,268
Goodbye then.

47
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,858
Take care.

48
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,966
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

49
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,270
-Here's the package.
-Thank you.

50
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,839
This is bad, Boss!

51
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,808
It's from Tae-o!

52
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,244
What's wrong?

53
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,282
RESIGNATION LETTER

54
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,554
Huh? Why did he resign?

55
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,890
Did I accidentally bully him at work?

56
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,560
I got my divorce papers like this too.

57
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,461
What a nightmare.

58
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,666
We'll look into this,
so please go back to work, everyone.

59
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,114
AUDIO CALL

60
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,462
<i>Yuri and I…</i>

61
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,500
broke up.

62
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,735
I see.

63
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,338
What about work?

64
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,345
Would you like to return to the lab?

65
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,679
No.

66
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,748
I'm going back to Seoul.

67
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,251
What?

68
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,154
Yuri…

69
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,493
learned about how the picture book ends.

70
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,902
If…

71
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,674
something happened to me again…

72
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,044
Yuri…

73
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,089
would blame herself.

74
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,263
If that will keep you safe,

75
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,299
I won't stop you.

76
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,070
Tae-o.

77
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,675
There are people out there
praying for your safety.

78
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,177
Please keep that in mind.

79
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,114
Yuri too…

80
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,650
She's surely…

81
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,661
Thank you.

82
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,129
Time to eat.

83
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:12,278
Delicious food
is the best way to get energized.

84
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:19,685
That's why I always make sure to eat
on both good and bad days.

85
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,588
<i>Enjoy.</i>

86
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,290
We finished
the chocolate shaved ice recipe

87
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,792
for this summer's pop-up shop.

88
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,495
Can you choose a container
and price that matches it

89
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,830
and proofread the press release?

90
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,333
-Yes.
-Aihara, please proceed with the schedule.

91
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,502
She sure is working hard.

92
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,506
I wonder why things
aren't going well for her.

93
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,680
Because of the power she's had until now,

94
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,249
she's gone through so much.

95
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,918
Now, she's even lost Tae-o.

96
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,055
-Please finish it quickly if you can.
-Okay.

97
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,323
But I'm sure this company,

98
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,626
including us,

99
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:41,367
were protected time and time again
by Motomiya's power.

100
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,273
You might be right.

101
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,745
However, even if
she has broken up with Tae-o,

102
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,115
having that power

103
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:02,888
means that she can never
fall in love with anyone.

104
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,394
That's too painful.

105
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,336
-By the way, Hanaoka…
-Yeah?

106
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,139
You remember what today is, right?

107
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,745
Of course I haven't.

108
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,213
You've definitely forgotten.

109
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,217
I'm so glad the three of us
get to celebrate again this year.

110
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,586
-Here's this year's cake.
-Whoa.

111
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,922
-Ta-da! It's coffee-flavored.
-Wow, looks delicious.

112
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,724
Our chocolatier is so talented.

113
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,594
Just so you know,
it's the best cake in the world.

114
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,130
Well, let's have a toast.

115
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,770
To celebrate Dolce &amp; Chocolat.
and its ninth year…

116
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,905
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

117
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,973
Congratulations.

118
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,076
Let's eat.

119
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,677
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

120
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,254
This is so good!

121
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,822
You're amazing, Mahiro.

122
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,723
Right?

123
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,091
-It's great.
-I'm glad.

124
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,534
It's so good!

125
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,427
-Hey.
-Yuri.

126
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,499
Um…

127
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,804
Do you want to try that thing with Tae-o?

128
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,705
Huh?

129
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,508
From the picture book.

130
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,778
Getting rid of your power.

131
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,181
Oh, that.

132
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,154
I tried it with my Dad,
but my power didn't go away.

133
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,089
Oh, really?

134
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,426
So, that was the only fictional part
of that book?

135
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:27,032
But if you get rid of your power,
you and Tae-o can be together.

136
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,973
It's okay.

137
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:39,845
Hanaoka and I will look after
your happiness no matter what.

138
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,413
What? Me too?

139
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,548
Of course.

140
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,650
How long have we been
in this together, huh?

141
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,120
It's your job
to protect Motomiya, isn't it?

142
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,889
Yes.

143
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,823
Yes.

144
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:56,929
Thanks.

145
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,230
Keep eating.

146
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,301
This is good.

147
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,202
That's great.

148
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,949
FROM MIN HA-NA
DEAR MR. HANAOKA

149
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,894
Hello?

150
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,764
<i>Sorry for calling at this late hour.
This is Hanaoka.</i>

151
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,668
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I wanted to ask you something.

152
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,071
It's about the picture book.

153
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:48,247
Is it true that you lose your power
if you lock eyes for 33 seconds?

154
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,123
<i>That was…</i>

155
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,794
what I hoped for.

156
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,764
Hope?

157
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,067
At the time,

158
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,170
soon after I lost him,

159
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,839
I had the chance to go to Hokkaido.

160
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,111
When I was there,
I read an old Ainu legend.

161
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,381
<i>In that legend,</i>

162
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,486
there was a method
for getting rid of a similar power.

163
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,623
<i>I wasn't able to test it.</i>

164
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,129
<i>That's why I put it in the picture book…</i>

165
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,501
Hope.

166
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,815
I HAVE A QUESTION. YOU STUDY
ANIMALS FROM HOKKAIDO, RIGHT?

167
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,155
Excuse me.

168
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,957
The chocolatier?

169
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,165
Mahiro?

170
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,266
Why are you here?

171
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,736
There's something I'd like to ask you two.

172
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,342
I see. An Ainu legend.

173
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,144
So, you do know it?

174
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,946
Yes, though I'm not an expert,

175
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,848
I looked into Ainu narratives long ago

176
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,318
out of curiosity on one of
my many research trips to Hokkaido

177
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,454
where I studied the northern pika.

178
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,122
Wow, that's perfect.

179
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,727
I think I have the book too.

180
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,628
What?

181
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,735
I think it was around here.

182
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,504
Not here.

183
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,706
Oh, here it is.

184
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,308
Found it.

185
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,178
Yes, the <i>ohainu</i>.

186
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,550
This Ainu legend tells of someone
who saves humans and animals

187
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,653
after hearing the voice of a god
who once saved their life.

188
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,922
This is it.

189
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,325
I never made the connection before.

190
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,594
It's like the picture book.

191
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,833
Oh, here it is. 33 seconds.

192
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,204
But this method doesn't get rid of it.

193
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,574
Isn't there anything else?

194
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,809
Sorry, but this
isn't my area of expertise--

195
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,845
I'm sure there must be a way.

196
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,379
Please come up with something.

197
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,515
Ms. Chocolatier, please calm down.

198
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,285
Are you really giving up here?
Aren't researchers supposed to be smart?

199
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,955
Please use that brain to think of a way.

200
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,257
-Um, I--
-How about this?

201
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,159
What is that?

202
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,299
Documents about the Ainu language.
The professor asked me to decipher them.

203
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,902
But I was too lazy and hid them.

204
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,577
Is it a spell? What does it say?

205
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,081
I'm not sure. I'm not an expert either.

206
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,650
It doesn't matter if you are or not.

207
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,986
Decipher it right now.

208
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,222
Those are important papers.
Wait, I'll take those for now.

209
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,257
I'll do it, okay?

210
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,967
Hello? What is it, Mahiro?

211
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,870
<i>Yuri, you do it under the stars!</i>

212
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,472
What?

213
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,408
Like I said, under the stars!

214
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,610
We haven't deciphered everything yet.

215
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,245
And we're still debating it.

216
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,917
You need to lock eyes with the one
you love under the stars for 33 seconds.

217
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,020
<i>You can get rid of that power!</i>

218
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,503
My dear doctor, I'm so impressed.
I'm seeing you in a new light.

219
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,072
You saw me in a bad light before?

220
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,810
I mean, you never said
what I wanted to hear.

221
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,911
What is that?

222
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,616
It's nothing.

223
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,565
As of now, on this very planet,

224
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,502
they say there are
millions of diverse species.

225
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,771
Wow.

226
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:18,877
Of those millions of species,
we are from the exact same species.

227
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,946
That's true.

228
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,415
However, our genes are all different.

229
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,622
Out of all the humans in our species,

230
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,592
your genes draw me in the most.

231
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,433
So, what does that mean?

232
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,802
Basically, what's important here…

233
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,005
The thing that attracts me…

234
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,810
is you alone, on this entire planet.

235
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,680
That's what I mean.

236
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,164
What's the matter?

237
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,568
That's what I mean.

238
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,338
Oh, is this a smooch?

239
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,307
Your word choice gives me the creeps.

240
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,277
I guess that's fine though.

241
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:30,048
I'm the one who fell in love with you
fully knowing that was the case.

242
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,469
Me too.

243
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,740
You…

244
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,442
What?

245
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,183
I…

246
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,653
love you too.

247
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,368
You finally said it.

248
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,495
HARMONY CARE CENTER

249
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,396
<i>I see.</i>

250
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,232
<i>Well done on your decision.</i>

251
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,005
<i>Hey, Yuri.</i>

252
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,945
<i>Life has its bitter days
and its sweet ones.</i>

253
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:13,785
<i>That's because we face our feelings
head-on during our lives.</i>

254
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,558
<i>Simply follow the path
that you want to take.</i>

255
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:25,096
<i>You don't have to hide
your own feelings from yourself.</i>

256
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,900
<i>I'm…</i>

257
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,904
<i>glad I'm your dad.</i>

258
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,175
Dad…

259
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,445
<i>Yuri.</i>

260
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,382
<i>Hold my hands.</i>

261
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,215
Thank you, Dad.

262
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,567
Tae-o.

263
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:36,968
Yes?

264
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,104
Sorry to call you here.

265
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,138
It's fine.

266
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,809
Um, what brings you to Seoul?

267
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,779
A contract with Ms. Min.

268
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,648
I see.

269
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,449
Also…

270
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,653
This.

271
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,389
I can't take this without a signature.

272
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,492
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,635
What a nice place.

274
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,045
Why did you come here without a word?

275
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,883
Because I can't stay

276
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,552
by Yuri's side.

277
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,563
Did you know?

278
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,502
They say that if we consider
our thoughts to be 100%,

279
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,540
the amount conveyed to the listener

280
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,410
is actually only 5%.

281
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,314
Only 5%?

282
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,824
So, wouldn't that 5%

283
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,196
be a waste if we don't treasure it?

284
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,748
What is this?

285
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,855
ITINERARY

286
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,794
You're still considered our employee.

287
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,532
Consider this

288
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,368
an order from your employer.

289
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,277
I'm abusing my power just this once.

290
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:46,858
Yuri?

291
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:57,902
Tae-o.

292
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,032
I missed you.

293
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,771
I missed your voice.

294
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:40,378
I missed your face. I missed you.

295
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,992
Me too.

296
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,538
Can I tell you something?

297
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,009
Yes.

298
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,480
I, um…

299
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,185
I…

300
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,275
I…

301
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,647
can hear…

302
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,151
your thoughts, Tae-o.

303
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,388
I heard them this whole time.

304
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,994
But I couldn't tell you.

305
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,030
I was always too scared.

306
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,005
Yuri, you're…

307
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,810
such a scaredy-cat.

308
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,889
I like you, Tae-o.

309
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,791
I love you.

310
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,628
I want to always be with you.

311
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,530
I don't want to be away from you anymore.

312
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
Me too.

313
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,609
I love you.

314
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,512
But…

315
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,417
I don't want you to suffer.

316
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,255
Those are both how I truly feel.

317
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,309
I'm so relieved.

318
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:31,883
It's so pretty.

319
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,484
Yeah.

320
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,960
Let's begin then.

321
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,563
Okay.

322
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,059
Tae-o.

323
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:21,232
I want to know how you felt back then.

324
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,835
When?

325
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,971
When we first met,

326
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,574
what were you thinking?

327
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,444
-Are you mad?
-I’m not mad.

328
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,214
<i>She's really mad…</i>

329
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,652
<i>Your face was really scary back then.</i>

330
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:44,889
Sorry.

331
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,060
<i>It's okay. I'm sure we'll meet again.</i>

332
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,196
<i>But I wish
we could stay together a bit longer.</i>

333
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,066
<i>Do you like me?</i>

334
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,574
<i>But that's the Yuri I fell in love with.</i>

335
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,814
<i>Every day, no matter when it may be,</i>

336
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,050
<i>I love you.</i>

337
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,254
<i>If Yuri is someone who helps others,</i>

338
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,591
<i>I want to be the one to help her.</i>

339
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,660
<i>That was a lie.</i>

340
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,594
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

341
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,199
<i>To be honest, I really love you a lot.</i>

342
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,769
<i>I really want to enjoy this time</i>

343
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,273
<i>that I'm spending with you right now.</i>

344
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:40,511
<i>I liked you, just the way you are.</i>

345
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,632
<i>No, I don't want this.</i>

346
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,781
Why?

347
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,351
Don't get rid of it.

348
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,923
The one I fell in love with

349
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,062
is you, the Yuri you've always been.

350
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,841
I want to stay with you forever, Yuri,

351
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,311
just the way you are.

352
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,552
I…

353
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,991
can't hear your thoughts.

354
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,164
But I still understand your feelings.

355
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,975
I may not understand all of them,

356
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,115
but I want to know…

357
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,285
your feelings…

358
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,822
As much as I can.

359
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:39,964
It's okay.

360
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,568
We will…

361
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:46,837
get through this.

362
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,348
Tae-o.

363
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,791
I love you.

364
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,431
Me too.

365
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,035
I love you.

366
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,454
ON LEAVE WITH YURI.
<i>KYOSHUKU DESU.</i> TAE-O.

367
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,024
-Aihara.
-Yes?

368
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:20,958
ONE YEAR LATER

369
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,394
The year for the intern
job posting is wrong.

370
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,063
Why would we hire interns for last year?

371
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,998
What? I'm sorry.

372
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,836
Nishina, my daughter got a boyfriend,

373
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,372
and we're all eating together
for the first time today.

374
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,507
So you got a haircut?

375
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,975
Yeah, how is it?

376
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,777
I can't even answer that.

377
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,646
You should let go of the cut.

378
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,951
What? But I can't change it back now.

379
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,023
MIN HA-NA
NEXT YEAR'S BUSINESS PLANS

380
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,229
The reason why your boyfriend died
was coronary artery disease.

381
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:02,933
Even before he met you,
he was suffering from heart issues.

382
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,835
His death…

383
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,872
was not because of your power.

384
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,976
Nor was it your fault.

385
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:19,150
DEAR MR. HANAOKA,
THIS IS MIN FROM KJH.

386
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,090
THE SAKURA ARE IN FULL BLOOM IN JAPAN.
AFTER OUR MEETING…

387
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:35,332
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
COME SEE THEM WITH OUR TEAM?

388
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,976
Hold on a second. I'm so tired.

389
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,144
You're too slow.

390
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,613
Your legs are longer than mine.

391
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,514
That again?

392
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,587
Hey, I'm hungry.

393
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,023
-Are you mad?
-I am.

394
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,492
<i>When people fall in love,</i>

395
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,130
<i>they wish to know
their partner's thoughts.</i>

396
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,966
Yuri, open wide.

397
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,338
<i>However, it's impossible
to look into someone's heart</i>

398
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,575
<i>or to completely understand each other.</i>

399
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,714
-Is it good?
-It's good.

400
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,283
-Get energized.
-Get energized.

401
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,924
Oh, it's a shooting star.

402
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,793
Hm? Where?

403
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,130
Look, it's over there.

404
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,031
Hm?

405
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,501
-Yuri.
-Yeah?

406
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,735
A present.

407
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,205
Glass.

408
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,574
A sea otter color.

409
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,080
It's pretty.

410
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:57,982
For me?

411
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,017
Yeah.

412
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,591
-Here?
-Huh?

413
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:11,762
-Or here?
-Hm?

414
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,567
<i>But that's okay.</i>

415
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,971
<i>Because if you understand…</i>

416
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,872
Thank you.

417
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,109
<i>…each other's hearts,
even just a tiny bit…</i>

418
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,877
<i>I think</i>

419
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,547
<i>that's a miracle.</i>

420
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,485
Wow, it's so pretty. I'm glad we came.

421
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,287
Mr. Motomiya.

422
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,488
Do you like the ocean?

423
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,557
You do, right?

424
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,895
He does love it, but he wants to
hurry to the hot springs.

425
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,898
Okay, let's go.

426
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,433
Let's go.

427
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,444
Oh, did you enjoy your hot spring trip?

428
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,514
Bravo.

429
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,085
May I join you next time?
How about Kusatsu?

430
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,792
Okay, got it.

431
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,066
Um, there's something inside the tank.

432
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,788
No need to worry.

433
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:48,525
That case and ring are titanium, which is
highly resistant to rusting from water.

434
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,462
We can keep it on during work,

435
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,464
and no eight-barbel loaches were harmed--

436
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,632
Did you do research

437
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,869
on how to give a romantic proposal for me?

438
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,376
I spent 773 hours on it.

439
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,481
-I love you, Darling!
-Whoa, wait.

440
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,453
-Oh, right.
-Hm?

441
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,223
That over there

442
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,026
is the house I grew up in.

443
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,193
Oh, really?

444
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:25,763
Which one?

445
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,265
That one.

446
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,101
-That one?
-That one.

447
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,270
-Oh, the blue one?
-No.

448
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,773
The one above it, with the red roof.

449
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,009
Red?

450
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,311
That one?

451
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,212
That's right.

452
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,119
You were born here, huh?

453
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,523
You want to know more about me, right?

454
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,024
Yeah.

455
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:55,926
Why?

456
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:02,700
Because I like you.

457
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:19,016
<i>I love you, Yuri.</i>

458
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,156
Tae-o.

459
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,593
I love you.

460
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:34,865
That's not fair.

461
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,467
I can't hear yours.

462
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,972
Oh, that's right.

463
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,708
How about we yell our wishes?

464
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,076
-Our wishes?
-Yes.

465
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,211
Okay.

466
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,684
I like Yuri.

467
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,819
I love her!

468
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,788
Is that a wish?

469
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,123
-Yes.
-Oh?

470
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,995
I like you too!

471
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,165
I like you, Tae-o!

472
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,000
Yuri!

473
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,070
I love you!

474
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,340
I love you!

475
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,743
I really, really love you!
