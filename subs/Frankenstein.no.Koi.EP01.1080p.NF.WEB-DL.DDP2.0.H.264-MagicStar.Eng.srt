1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,105
120 YEARS AGO…

2
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:44,077
Saki…!

3
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,846
-Answer me, Saki!
-Saki…!

4
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,215
Saki…!

5
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,151
-Did you find her?
-Over here…!

6
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,121
-Is that Saki?
-There she is!

7
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,390
-It's Saki!
-Here she is.

8
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,025
Saki!

9
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,127
Can you confirm that this is your sister?

10
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,765
Was she… killed?

11
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,300
I don't know.

12
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,346
Wake up.

13
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,415
Hey, wake up.

14
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,517
-Tsugumi?
-Are you all right?

15
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,519
She woke up.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,056
Good morning.

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,792
-Are you all right?
-Water.

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,228
Drink some water.

19
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,196
Good.

20
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,164
Are you all right?

21
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,767
Oops, this is sake.

22
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,668
HARUKA TSUGARU

23
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,737
TSUGUMI

24
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,172
Hello?

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,775
<i>Help me.</i>

26
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>What happened?</i>

27
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,679
I went out for drinking
with medical students,

28
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,013
but they set me up.

29
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,316
Are you all right, Tsugumi?

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,319
-They are not medical students.
-Hey! Hey!

31
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,288
Why did you go out with such people?

32
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,190
-Because I thought
-Are you okay? Did you get it up?

33
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,159
-I could pick up some information.
-Hey, open up, Tsugumi.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,561
-What should I do?
-Tsugumi!

35
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,263
I think they're going to
take me somewhere.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,999
<i>Run away.</i>

37
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,636
<i>Don't cry, yell, or get upset.</i>

38
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,506
<i>It's bad for your cerebral vessels</i>
<i>if you suffer an attack.</i>

39
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,608
<i>Do you understand?</i>

40
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,043
<i>Find someone. I'll go there right away.</i>

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,046
-She is running away!
-Wait!

42
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,704
TSUGUMI

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,315
We got you.

44
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,317
Don't run away from us.

45
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,821
TSUGUMI

46
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,429
Aren't we going to your apartment?

47
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,498
My family's summer house is up here.

48
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,433
We can have a party there.

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,370
Don't go home yet.

50
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,306
Help me!

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,587
Help me!

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,109
You've got to be kidding me.

53
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,715
He should be fine. Let's go.

54
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,550
What if he is still alive?

55
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,985
Are you going to ruin our lives?

56
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,219
-Right?
-Stop it.

57
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,754
You should have driven more carefully.

58
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,723
Don't blame me!

59
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,591
-Hey!
-This is your fault.

60
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,426
She's running!

61
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,562
Don't let her go.

62
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,598
-Wait!
-Stop!

63
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,735
Don't even think that you can
run away from us.

64
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,804
-You have a lot of nerve.
-Hey…

65
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
Who are you?

66
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,553
We must get him.

67
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,322
Eat this!

68
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,432
Tsugumi!

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,235
Haruka.

70
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,505
-Tsugumi.
-What happened?

71
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,741
Where am I?

72
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,111
That's what I wanted to ask you.
Where have you been?

73
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,417
They put me in a car.

74
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,085
What?

75
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,789
I run away from them
and went into the forest.

76
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,724
Tsugumi.

77
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,128
Let's go to the police and the hospital.
I'll come with you.

78
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,798
Okay, Tsugumi?

79
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,902
No, they didn't do anything to me.

80
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,403
What?

81
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,540
Nothing happened,
and I didn't see anything.

82
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,276
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,078
I'm fine.

84
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,614
Take some medicine.

85
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,826
What is it?

86
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,229
There it is.

87
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,065
ENTRANCE

88
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,534
<i>I want that paper back. That's not fair.</i>

89
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,370
<i>You have been working hard with her</i>

90
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,706
-Good morning.
-<i>and saving money.</i>

91
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,242
<i>Now you became a great landlord.</i>

92
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,977
-Is this an experiment?
-<i>To the both of you.</i>

93
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,912
<i>Congratulations anyway.</i>

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,048
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

95
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,951
<i>That's the end of the story.</i>

96
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,119
<i>This was Daiku-shirabe.</i>

97
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,955
DAIKO SHIRABE
MIYAJI KEI

98
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,990
-Okay. Check it out.
-Okay.

99
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,063
How was it?

100
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,234
My blood sugar went down.

101
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,172
Although I ate pancake
for breakfast this morning,

102
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,374
my blood sugar level didn't increase.

103
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,610
My blood sugar level has increased.

104
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,112
Is this because of stress?

105
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,915
Do you feel stressed
when you listen to Rakugo?

106
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,119
I think you picked up the wrong one.
That was a story about a carpenter.

107
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,188
My father is also a carpenter.

108
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,391
I felt stressed because this story
reminded me of my father.

109
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,828
I see. But that's too ordinary.

110
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,198
"Stress is bad for health. Smile."

111
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,401
That's not even a scientific fact.

112
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,603
What I want to know is

113
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,943
whether the excellent art of speech
has a good influence on the human body

114
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,813
regardless of personal reasons.

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,215
In other words,

116
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,385
can the theatre play
of Chekhov or Shakespeare

117
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,155
activate the power of DNA
that has been sleeping

118
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,458
and make a positive impact on the cell?

119
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,765
If not, is it because of
the performers or the story?

120
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:30,002
Do you think DNA can work
like an art critic?

121
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,038
Let's try Kokontei Shinsho next.

122
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,439
Let's have a break.

123
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,709
People get bored if they
keep doing the same thing.

124
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:41,647
Boredom is the "enemy" of stress.
I mean, "friend".

125
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,049
You are right.

126
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,919
Dr. Tsurumaru, please take a look at this.

127
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,287
Is this a mushroom?

128
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,189
Yes. Please take a closer look.

129
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,391
Isn't this the Akanarikamitake mushroom?

130
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,494
It's rare. Is this artificially grown?

131
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,164
No. I think it's natural.

132
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,699
It looks different.

133
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,469
The Akanarikamitake mushroom is orange.

134
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,470
This is red.

135
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,139
Have you ever seen a live
Akanarikamitake mushroom?

136
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,209
No. But the natural one wouldn't
grow around here.

137
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,978
I know. That's why I'm curious.

138
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,312
Did you find it near here?

139
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,050
I think it's somewhere around here.

140
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,285
Don't you know where it was found?

141
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,853
No.

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,524
Broadleaf and coniferous trees near
here are cultivated artificially.

143
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,562
The Akanarikamitake mushroom can grow
only in the primeval forest of conifer.

144
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,564
So…

145
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,667
So even if this is not
an Akanarikamitake mushroom,

146
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,871
a similar new mushroom can grow
in the forest near here.

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,509
If you can prove that
it is not an Akanarikamitake mushroom,

148
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,212
it's a newly-discovered species
of mushroom.

149
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,413
Exactly.

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,050
There you go.
That's why you are a "fungi girl".

151
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,120
Don't call me that.
It's like bullying back in school.

152
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,388
Where will you go look?

153
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,790
That's the problem.

154
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:02,361
I don't know where this is found.

155
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,263
Huh?

156
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,933
Finding a new mushroom in the forest
is like grabbing onto a cloud.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,069
<i>…they are cram school students.</i>

158
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>They were semiconscious, laying</i>

159
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,906
<i>on the ground when they were found.</i>

160
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,144
Please turn on the TV again.

161
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,278
Hurry…

162
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,248
<i>… because they got a rash,</i>

163
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,685
<i>it is considered that</i>
<i>they went into the forest</i>

164
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,221
<i>and touched some kind of fungi</i>
<i>that causes an allergy…</i>

165
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,557
What's wrong?

166
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,695
What's wrong?

167
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,064
-Are you sick?
-I'm fine.

168
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,702
Do you know the students
who were on TV?

169
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,803
No.

170
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,006
-I can help you.
-With what?

171
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,708
-Finding the mushroom.
-No, thanks.

172
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,911
Let me help you.
You need a car to go to a mountain.

173
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,679
I am good at mountain climbing.

174
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,048
But you don't know
which mountain you should go.

175
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,250
I have an idea.

176
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,452
Like what?

177
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,488
Don't worry. I can find it by myself.

178
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,324
Just as you'd expect from "fungi girl".

179
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,559
Don't call me that.

180
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,362
Don't push yourself too hard.
You can count on me.

181
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,265
I don't like people who don't try hard.

182
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,802
But I can't just leave people
who are pushing themselves too hard.

183
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,471
-Inaniwa.
-Yes?

184
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,473
Some people don't count on you.

185
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,675
It doesn't mean they're
pushing themselves too hard.

186
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,077
I just wanted to let you know. Bye.

187
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,849
I think she is pushing herself too hard.

188
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,345
Who's there?

189
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,231
Who are you?

190
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,368
Huh?

191
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,237
Why are you here?

192
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,339
Why?

193
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,775
Did you survive?

194
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:15,014
-Didn't you die… 120 years ago?
-Excuse me.

195
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,450
I won't do anything.

196
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,356
I'm just here.

197
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,460
I…

198
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,563
I am not human.

199
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,673
Please forget that you saw me.

200
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,461
Ouch…

201
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,465
It hurts.

202
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,205
Why are you following me?

203
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,277
I am a scientist.

204
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,214
I am still a student.

205
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,684
So, I am an aspiring scientist.

206
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:05,591
That's why I can't believe
what you are saying.

207
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,197
I can't forget about you

208
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,733
because I saw you.

209
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,606
Do you really not know me?

210
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,575
No.

211
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,815
So, I want to know about you.

212
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,154
I want to know what I don't know.

213
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,325
I don't want to die without knowing
what I want to know.

214
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,564
I envy you.

215
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,200
Huh?

216
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,038
Please don't follow me anymore.

217
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,294
What's that?

218
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,301
That's my house.

219
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,343
May I come visit?

220
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,396
Wow. There is electricity.

221
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,702
Thank you for having me.

222
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,482
Do you really live here?

223
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,753
-Do you live alone?
-Yes. I'm alone now.

224
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,889
Were there anyone else before?

225
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,758
My dad.

226
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,164
I've seen a TV drama <i>Kitano Kunikara</i>.

227
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,265
Is that similar to your situation?

228
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,436
I don't know what you are saying.

229
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,405
You don't know that drama?

230
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,509
You don't like watching TV?

231
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,214
I have never watched TV.

232
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,182
Never?

233
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,755
When did you start living here?

234
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,391
Hundred and twenty years ago.

235
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,395
Don't be silly. Please answer my question.

236
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,906
What do you do for a living?

237
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,145
What do you eat?

238
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,721
Mushrooms!

239
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,389
Are they edible?

240
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,790
Can I have one?

241
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,326
I don't know if it's safe for humans.

242
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,095
I'll check.

243
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,297
Please don't be silly.

244
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,175
Who are you?

245
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,647
What did you do before you came here?

246
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,627
I can keep any kind of secret.

247
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,533
Even if you are… a criminal.

248
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,840
I won't tell anyone about you.

249
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,577
I promise.

250
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,419
Aren't you afraid of me?

251
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,621
Afraid?

252
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,591
No. I'm not afraid of you.

253
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:13,298
As I said, I don't want to die
without knowing what I want to know.

254
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,701
I'm not afraid of common sense.

255
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,771
What I'm afraid of is knowing nothing.

256
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,909
Knowing nothing?

257
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,117
Please tell me about yourself.

258
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,093
What's wrong?

259
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:53,238
I was born from my father.

260
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,508
From your father?

261
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,211
What about your mother?

262
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,580
I have no mother.

263
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,583
My father was a doctor of medicine.

264
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,729
I… I was dead.

265
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,469
My father raised me from the dead.

266
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,308
Please don't be silly.

267
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:35,647
It… It sounds like you are Frankenstein.

268
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,787
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,999
My father's room is downstairs.

270
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,768
I am not being silly.

271
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,613
He is my father.

272
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,952
I was born in here 120 years ago.

273
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,789
-In here?
-Yes.

274
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,632
"Kentaro Fukashi."

275
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,335
That is the name of my father.

276
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,540
What is your name?

277
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,410
Name?

278
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,880
He didn't give me a name.

279
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,216
I am not human.

280
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,155
So, I will be here forever.

281
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,297
First, my father taught me about humans.

282
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,602
After he died, I learned
from a radio I found.

283
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,606
But…

284
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,778
I can't live with humans.

285
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,754
You look nothing but a human.

286
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:01,993
Don't you feel lonely to be here
all by yourself?

287
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,347
I am like this forest.

288
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:28,520
My father told me to live like the forest.

289
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,857
But you want to know about
humans, don't you?

290
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,454
-<i>Hello.</i>
-<i>You look so well.</i>

291
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,556
<i>You can't pronounce it clearly though.</i>

292
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,425
<i>It's almost 3 p.m. Let's call SNACK MAN.</i>

293
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,427
<i>Where is he today?</i>

294
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,869
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

295
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,172
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

296
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,809
<i>Ask Amakusa if you are</i>

297
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,248
<i>Worried about something</i>

298
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,816
<i>Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.</i>

299
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,686
<i>Who wants my advice today?</i>

300
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,422
<i>It's from Karashirenkon from Kumamoto.</i>

301
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,591
<i>He is a 35-year-old high school teacher.</i>

302
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,594
<i>A female student said</i>
<i>that she wanted to go out with me.</i>

303
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,863
<i>She is very attractive…</i>

304
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,104
You can go back to town from here.

305
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,173
Please go.

306
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,946
Don't you ever come down
from the mountain?

307
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,017
I have several times in the night.

308
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,521
You want to see people, don't you?

309
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,160
I understand that you are
afraid of seeing people,

310
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,961
but you will get used to them.

311
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,131
You are the one who suffers
by having a narrow view of the world.

312
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,969
You have no problem talking to people.

313
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,571
Let's go.

314
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,750
You will be fine. I'm with you.

315
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,756
Right? Let's go.

316
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,638
MIKUTAKE

317
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,874
I haven't gone beyond here.

318
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,014
You must be the one who saved me.

319
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,017
Right?

320
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,890
It's a bicycle.

321
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,196
It's an electric bicycle.

322
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,698
Electric…?

323
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,967
Would you like to try?

324
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,503
I have never tried
to ride a bicycle before.

325
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,176
You can change your past experience.

326
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,346
Here you go.

327
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,963
Put your feet here.

328
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,668
Push the pedals using your feet
and move forward.

329
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,605
Good.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,043
That's good. See?

331
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,117
Hey! Do you know how to apply the brakes?

332
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,250
Hey!

333
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,321
Hey!

334
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,426
Put on the brakes!

335
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,736
Are you all right?

336
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,904
Are you all right?

337
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,142
I'm fine.

338
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,278
How could you be all right?

339
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,406
"Tsugaru…"

340
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,243
I haven't introduced myself yet.

341
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,346
My name is Tsugumi Tsugaru.

342
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,648
Please wait here.

343
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,124
Tsugaru…

344
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,693
Tsugumi.

345
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,497
I'm home.

346
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,233
Haruka?

347
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,037
It's okay. Please come in.

348
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,672
Yes.

349
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,056
Please take off your shoes.

350
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,223
Here you are.

351
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,296
First, please take a bath
before my sister comes home.

352
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,832
Bath?

353
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,037
Maybe you don't realize that,

354
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,239
but you have a wild smell.

355
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,542
Soil. Tree.

356
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,511
You smell like a mushroom.

357
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,048
Maybe because you eat a lot of mushrooms.

358
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,950
I am used to its smell,

359
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:50,021
but my sister is a nurse
and she is sensitive to smell and dirt.

360
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,660
A bath.

361
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,930
Taking a bath is to soak in hot water.

362
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,534
Like this.

363
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,192
Like this.

364
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,951
Like this.

365
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,258
How should I explain him to Haruka?

366
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,862
A homeless person?

367
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,439
Are you done?

368
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,110
Do you feel dizzy or something?

369
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,047
No. I'm fine.

370
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,851
Please get out before
my sister comes home.

371
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:01,919
Okay.

372
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,355
I'm out.

373
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,494
Please put on your clothes!

374
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,500
I… I saw it.

375
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,972
Now he looks nothing but human.

376
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,010
Please wear this.

377
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,480
I like your jacket, but it stands out.

378
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,483
Let's pretend that you are
my senior at university.

379
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,085
I have many strange seniors.

380
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,989
Here you go.

381
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,901
Good. Let me clear the tub.

382
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,012
An Akanarikamitake mushroom?

383
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,814
Why?

384
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,221
Oh no.

385
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,358
Oh.

386
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,895
-When I say go,
-I'm home.

387
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,364
get out of the house.

388
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,200
-Out?
-Leave the house. Okay?

389
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,036
-Okay.
-Okay.

390
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,408
Hi, Haruka. I took a bath.

391
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,277
Don't you think it's stinky here?

392
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,446
I went to the mountain
from the university today.

393
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,117
Let me get some fresh air.

394
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,125
Did you really take a bath?

395
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,696
You smell like the forest.

396
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,863
Go!

397
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,733
-Huh?
-Go!

398
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,234
What are you talking about?

399
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,403
Go!

400
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,906
Tsugumi, are you all right?

401
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,507
What's wrong with you?

402
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,543
I said go!

403
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,178
Wait a minute.

404
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,755
What is it?

405
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,669
What was that?

406
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,037
-A thief, maybe.
-A thief?

407
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,505
Now that he's gone, it's okay.

408
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,408
I have to go back to the university.

409
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,845
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, Tsugumi!

410
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,849
Good morning.

411
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,789
Did you stay in the lab last night?

412
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,360
What's this?

413
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,529
It's awesome.

414
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,164
Where did you find this?

415
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,968
I… I don't know.

416
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,271
What do you mean?

417
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,807
You don't have to hide it from me.

418
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,019
Wait!

419
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,655
Who is he? Do you know him?

420
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,524
I met him in the mountain.

421
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,060
Why is he in my locker?

422
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,428
He is shy.

423
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,297
I see.

424
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,433
I'm Seiya Inaniwa, a graduate student.

425
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,837
He is eccentric.

426
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,005
Please step back first.

427
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,340
Sure.

428
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,209
Good morning.

429
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,615
Who is he?

430
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,486
Is this okay?

431
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,957
I need to talk to you.

432
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,859
What is it?

433
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,828
He is strange.

434
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,964
-Sure he is.
-Please listen.

435
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,233
-Okay.
-Why is he strange?

436
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,103
He said that he is not a human.

437
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,941
He has been living in the deep forest.

438
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,545
He said that he lived there for 120 years.

439
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,116
Do you think he is out of his mind?

440
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,289
But many strange things happened.

441
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,691
I'm not sure if he is human or not.

442
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,960
Do you think that he is not human?

443
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:14,398
He said that he is Frankenstein.

444
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,869
To be more precise, he is
something similar to Frankenstein.

445
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,272
Actually, Frankenstein is a doctor
who made Frankenstein.

446
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,541
Then he is a monster.

447
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,612
His father was a doctor of medicine
and raised him from the dead.

448
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,382
Is he a mythomaniac?

449
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,218
Do you want me to check
if what he says is true?

450
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,319
Yes.

451
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,389
I have no one to ask but you.

452
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,590
All right.

453
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,925
Are you sure?

454
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:42,893
Yes, of course.

455
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,064
If you think things that can't be
proven scientifically won't happen,

456
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,399
it's blasphemy against science.

457
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,101
-Well said!
-Which side are you on?

458
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,804
Curiosity is the first step to research.

459
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:59,877
His father didn't give him a name
and raised him in the forest.

460
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,147
I saw a skeleton of his father.

461
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,617
Maybe I should report it to the police.

462
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,053
Is there any possibility
that he will hurt humans?

463
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,788
No. Please don't worry about it.

464
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:15,626
He wants to be a human.
He listens to the radio.

465
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,827
Radio?

466
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,399
<i>Time for you and I</i>

467
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,204
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

468
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,475
<i>Ask Amakusa if you are</i>

469
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:36,880
<i>Worrying about something</i>

470
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,555
The radio was the only way for him
to learn about humans.

471
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,660
Say, "Ah".

472
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,120
How is your curry and rice?

473
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,025
It's delicious.

474
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,662
It's nice to see him act normally.

475
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,996
I know.

476
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,198
I can't stop eating.

477
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,602
What are you going to do?

478
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,737
Are you going back to the forest?

479
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,010
What do you want?
Do you want to stay here?

480
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,215
How about my house?

481
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,754
Many people come and stay at my house.

482
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,356
I have extra rooms.

483
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,358
It may be a good place for him
to go back to society.

484
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,827
Your family runs an office of…

485
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,162
Building contractors.

486
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,396
-You mean a carpenter?
-Yes.

487
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,633
I think he is cut out for it.

488
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,371
-You are right.
-That's good.

489
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,439
Yes.

490
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,611
What's wrong?

491
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,115
DAILY LUNCH SPECIALS

492
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,484
-Do you like that pop singer?
-Pop singer?

493
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,387
Her name is Ririe Ohmiya, who used to
belong to an idol group.

494
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,192
He may be a man…

495
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,828
Amakusa.

496
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,599
I see. It's Amakusa.

497
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,803
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

498
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,071
Amakusa?

499
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,376
Amakusa.

500
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,412
Amakusa.

501
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,081
Do you want me to ask
if you can keep that poster?

502
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,396
What's next?

503
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:10,701
Do you want it?

504
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,838
Excuse me.

505
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,940
-I want to buy this.
-Welcome!

506
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,043
-It's 100 yen. Thank you.
-Okay.

507
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,751
This mushroom is artificially cultivated.

508
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,419
Artificially cultivated?

509
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:33,157
This is Shimeji, which is
artificially cultivated by humans.

510
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,894
-Do humans cultivate mushrooms?
-We love mushrooms.

511
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,338
It's raw.

512
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,577
It's tasty.

513
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,314
I like mushroom cultivated by humans.

514
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,984
You do like mushrooms.

515
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,326
Let's go.

516
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,366
INANIWA CORPORATION

517
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,438
Drink later.

518
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,140
Shut up.

519
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,843
You can't see the true character
of people without drinking.

520
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,212
You just drink and reveal
your own character.

521
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,515
So, when can you start working here?

522
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,751
Can he stay here?

523
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,353
He will stay here starting tonight.

524
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,155
I said he had no place to go.

525
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,458
I have nothing to say
if he prepares for what's ahead.

526
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,727
He is not ready, but he has a reason.

527
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:44,628
What's your name?

528
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,235
Hey! I'm asking your name.

529
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,044
<i>"Kentaro Fukashi."</i>

530
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,414
Fukashi.

531
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:06,950
Ken.

532
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,188
Ken? Is that the same as Ken Takakura?

533
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,524
No. Ken is for "the lab".

534
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,462
The "lab"? Not "fist" nor "modesty"?

535
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:24,067
That's the lowest status
among all kinds of kanji.

536
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,838
I don't know what he is saying.

537
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,173
Don't worry, he doesn't make sense
most of the time.

538
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,510
-Excuse me.
-How are you?

539
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,915
She is Tamara.
She used to be a live-in worker.

540
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,952
Now she got married
and works as a housekeeper.

541
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,421
And she is taking care of our boss.

542
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,023
That's your current job.

543
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,091
No, it's not.

544
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,430
Don't look at me like that.

545
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,334
She is Murozono.
She is a live-in craftsman.

546
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,170
Call me Mikoto.
I broke ties with my family.

547
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,272
She is the only person who
lives here other than my family.

548
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,241
Don't ignore me.

549
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,210
Mikoto is my disciple.
She can do everything now.

550
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,847
Call me Murozono. They may think
that I'm your girlfriend.

551
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,883
Many women work here.

552
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,086
He likes women after my mother died.

553
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,955
He picks up girls in town,
takes them to karaoke,

554
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,324
teaches them lessons,
and brings them home.

555
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:25,529
I can't ignore women who are stubborn.

556
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,064
Don't touch me.

557
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,934
You use runaway girls at a low wage.

558
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,071
He is called a night patrol.

559
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,405
Most of them leave soon.

560
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,075
It's rare to see someone
who stays here as long as you.

561
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,110
Don't be rude.

562
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,813
Don't worry about that.

563
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,047
Who are you?

564
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,951
She is Tsugaru, my junior at University.

565
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,454
She is a "fungi girl".

566
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,422
What is that?

567
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,392
Don't use a nickname
that requires explanation.

568
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,893
You are right.

569
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,963
Mikoto. He is your junior
from today. Take good care of him.

570
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,431
Call me Murozono.

571
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,938
I am not his girlfriend.

572
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,940
I'll knock you out if you doubt
that I could be his girlfriend.

573
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,077
-I don't know what she is saying.
-Are you a comedian?

574
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,047
You will get used to it.

575
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,384
Don't you need his CV?

576
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,219
I don't believe in CVs.

577
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:27,657
I only believe in every single day
that you will spend here.

578
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:32,329
You have your CV in your future.

579
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,299
-Yes.
-Just get used to his smug face.

580
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,770
He thinks he says something cool.

581
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,805
It's annoying until you get used to it.

582
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,041
You can say he's annoying if you think so.

583
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,076
Okay.

584
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,879
Let's eat dinner together.

585
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:52,916
I see people, not at interviews
but at dinner.

586
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,552
Can I say "he is annoying" now?

587
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,121
Exactly. You are a fast learner.

588
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,591
Try this.

589
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:04,861
Thank you.

590
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,303
This is your room, Ken Fukashi.

591
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,243
-Can I put it on a wall?
-Sure.

592
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,315
Let me bring your blanket.

593
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:35,225
I'm sorry that I named you.

594
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,995
-Name?
-Your name.

595
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,332
I named you after your father.

596
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,619
You are Ken Fukashi from now on.

597
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,687
Please remember.

598
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,024
Tsugumi Tsugaru.

599
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,760
Yes. That's my name.

600
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,472
I am Tsugumi Tsugaru.

601
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,142
You know me.

602
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,545
I am your friend.

603
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,515
-Friend?
-Yes.

604
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,188
Amakusa… Friend?

605
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,859
No. He is not your friend.

606
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,729
Why?

607
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,898
I know Amakusa.

608
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,334
He has never seen you,

609
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,303
so he is not your friend.

610
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,075
Do you understand?

611
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,621
You can't be his friend even if you
keep looking at his picture.

612
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,197
You can only see someone in front of you.

613
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,735
Like this.

614
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,386
Are you having fun?

615
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,057
He is my senior, Inaniwa.

616
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,559
My senior, Inaniwa.

617
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,362
I'm not your senior.

618
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,496
Well, I guess I am.

619
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,635
Inaniwa is my friend.

620
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,073
-That's nice to hear.
-See?

621
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,128
INANIWA CORPORATION

622
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,598
Listen. You don't have to do
everything from the beginning.

623
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,167
I don't want to embarrass you.

624
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,838
It's important to know that
you can't do anything.

625
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,107
-Am I right, boss?
-Yes.

626
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,377
What do you think you can get
by knowing that you can't do anything?

627
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,179
-Room for growth.
-You are annoying.

628
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,948
What did you just say?

629
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,183
Shishikui, he didn't mean it.

630
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,322
Okay. Mikoto. You try first.

631
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,157
Call me Murozono.

632
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,595
Show him your three years of experience.

633
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,506
Look how thin this is.

634
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:13,810
She can do this because she has
been with me for three years.

635
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,413
Stop talking like
we are in a relationship.

636
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,515
Ouch.

637
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,849
Murozono, you are so good.

638
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,685
Call me Mikoto.

639
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,455
You are Ken Fukashi, right?
It's your turn.

640
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,261
Yes.

641
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,965
You are so good.

642
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,433
Is this great?

643
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,169
It's not good.
I've never seen such a thin shaving.

644
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,271
Idiot. He has no room for growth.

645
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,573
You are not a beginner, are you?

646
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,845
Ken. How long have you
been working with wood?

647
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,480
Hundred and twenty years.

648
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,014
Don't be cheeky.

649
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,884
He doesn't remember his past.

650
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,853
Did he lose his memory?

651
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,555
I see. I got it.

652
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:33,923
Listen, Ken.

653
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,694
Carpenters don't learn by brain.

654
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,162
We learn by body.

655
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,600
How you work is how you remember.

656
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,736
-Keep it up.
-Yes.

657
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,072
-But you are annoying.
-What did you say?

658
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,441
-He didn't mean it.
-What did he mean then?

659
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,182
What's this smell?

660
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,552
I've never noticed
such a strong pheromone.

661
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,696
Shimeji mushrooms?

662
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,399
There is no space here. Go outside.

663
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,035
-Bring them outside.
-Hurry…

664
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,170
-Take it
-You want me to do it?

665
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,739
What do you think is a manly job?

666
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,474
Manual labor, of course.

667
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,377
-Do you like blue-collar workers?
-Yes, like truck drivers.

668
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,047
You said so because they
may be listening to this radio.

669
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,282
Can't you tell?

670
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,919
-You are flattering radio listeners again.
-How annoying!

671
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,721
But I like men who work hard
without talking.

672
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,191
I can't work without talking.

673
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,560
But you look nice when you don't talk.

674
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,462
It means I am not working.

675
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,530
That's enough.

676
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,065
It's almost three o'clock.

677
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,801
Let's call SNACK MAN. Where is he today?

678
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,109
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

679
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,546
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

680
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,348
<i>Ask Amakusa if you are</i>

681
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,684
Are you ready, Amakusa?

682
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,455
<i>Ask Amakusa if you are</i>
<i>Worrying about something</i>

683
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,991
Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

684
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,826
Here is what I got today.

685
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,696
It's from Kizutsuki,
26 years old, from Saitama.

686
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,899
Sometimes I don't know who I am
these days.

687
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,468
<i>I am working for a top-rated company</i>
<i>and I have a girlfriend.</i>

688
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,937
<i>But I don't feel like myself</i>

689
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,772
<i>when I work or when I go out for a date.</i>

690
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,844
Is this because my current life
doesn't fit me well?

691
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:39,782
So I came to a business district in Tokyo.

692
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:44,787
Let me ask people walking by
how much they understand themselves.

693
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,789
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

694
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,690
Sure.

695
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,692
Who are you?

696
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,794
Please answer me without using your name.

697
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,063
Well, I am a businessman.

698
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,200
Is there a human such as a businessman?

699
00:58:57,267 --> 00:59:00,870
If you quit or your company goes bankrupt,
will you also disappear?

700
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,475
Then, I am a father and a good husband.

701
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,944
But it's only your family who think of you

702
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,247
as a father and a good husband.

703
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,051
Isn't that good enough?

704
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,588
I see. That's one answer.

705
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,291
Thank you very much.
Let me ask another person.

706
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,260
Excuse me.

707
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,629
Are you talking to me?

708
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,164
Who are you?

709
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,400
Please answer me without using your name.

710
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,603
I am a dispatch employee and a comedian.

711
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,372
Are you a comedian?
Can you give me a joke?

712
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,207
Can I show you?

713
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,012
Here you go…

714
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,048
Is that true?

715
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,185
It wasn't funny. Was it because
of your joke or because of you?

716
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,388
It's whether your joke is not funny,

717
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,791
or you are not funny?

718
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,259
Which do you think?

719
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:02,398
<i>As a result, Kizutsuki is a person</i>
<i>who knows himself well.</i>

720
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,134
It's important to know
that you don't know.

721
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,503
He worries whether his current life
fits him or not.

722
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,708
But it depends on how he thinks.

723
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,777
If you know who you are,
you can't change yourself.

724
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,746
It must be boring.

725
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,549
When you think you don't know who you are,

726
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,618
try to enjoy being yourself.

727
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,486
See you tomorrow.

728
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:25,888
If you are worrying about something
at snack time…

729
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,158
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

730
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,362
It's so boring. Why do you like it?

731
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,165
Do you think it's funny?

732
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,668
Amakusa? He is doing well.

733
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,506
I'm telling you I don't like him.

734
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,141
What?

735
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,217
Doctor.

736
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,085
How is he doing?

737
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,321
He is doing well.

738
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,423
Inaniwa is taking care of him.

739
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,126
How was his physical exam?

740
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,062
I'm checking on his cells now.

741
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,198
The cell structure itself
is the same as ours.

742
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,234
Then…

743
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,037
But it doesn't prove anything.

744
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,073
I will check his DNA now.

745
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,844
<i>He may have a different type of DNA.</i>

746
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,480
<i>It is possible that</i>
<i>some kind of power in his DNA</i>

747
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,084
<i>has kept him alive and young</i>
<i>for 120 years.</i>

748
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:33,656
DNA not only inherits information
from our ancestors

749
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:38,127
but also keeps making our body day by day.

750
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:44,033
Normally, only five to 10% of them
are working.

751
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,670
More than 90% are still unknown.

752
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,939
We have countless
numbers of effects of DNA

753
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,742
that have not awaken yet.

754
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:57,213
DNA works differently
depending on your mental situation.

755
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,048
That's the theme of my research.

756
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,152
Someday, people will get over
incurable diseases

757
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,221
by believing that they will be cured.

758
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:06,622
Yes.

759
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,125
Thank you.

760
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,760
I really mean it.

761
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,733
I know you are so strange
that you wouldn't flatter.

762
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,668
Good enough.

763
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,221
Hello, my sister.

764
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:41,124
<i>Tsugumi, are you all right?</i>

765
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,025
<i>Don't you have a headache?</i>

766
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,229
I'm fine. Sorry to have worried you.

767
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:50,133
I was worried about you.
You were suffering so much.

768
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,368
I'm fine now.

769
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,270
I'm still at the university.

770
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,507
I may come home late today.

771
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,308
Again?

772
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,110
I'm sorry. Bye.

773
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,879
Hey, Tsugumi?

774
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,851
She is hiding something from me.

775
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:18,027
You are not at the university!

776
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,862
Where are you now?

777
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,069
If you know who you are,
you can't change yourself.

778
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,705
It's boring, isn't it?

779
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,909
When you think you don't know who you are,

780
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,944
try to enjoy being yourself.

781
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,550
I'm Tsugaru. May I come in?

782
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:42,718
Yes.

783
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,560
How are you?

784
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,999
You worked hard today.

785
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,337
What are you making?

786
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,345
KEN FUKASHI

787
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,246
Your name.

788
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,052
You are the first human I talked to
other than my father.

789
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,625
I could have seen the world of humans.

790
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,229
You are right.

791
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,266
Tsugaru.

792
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,305
You gave me a name.

793
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,445
I was so happy.

794
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,386
Is this a name plate?

795
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,260
I am Ken Fukashi.

796
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,964
Yes. You are Ken Fukashi.

797
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,166
I…

798
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:16,045
Do you think I can find out who I am
other than my name in this place?

799
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,552
Do you think I can enjoy being myself?

800
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,389
Do you think I can change myself?

801
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,592
Yes.

802
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,761
You can change yourself.

803
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,729
Let's work on it together.

804
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,465
Yes.

805
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,369
Tsugumi Tsugaru.

806
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,939
Thank you very much.

807
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,045
Yes.

808
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,194
I am glad that I asked for your help.

809
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,998
Did you finally find that you
are pushing yourself too much?

810
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,403
Don't try to do everything
all by yourself.

811
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,073
That man. You are just curious,
aren't you?

812
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:24,981
I don't know why I brought him here.

813
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,350
I don't know what to do with him.

814
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,821
Do you think he is an ordinary human,

815
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:37,126
or do you think he is a monster?

816
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,195
No.

817
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,032
If he is a monster…

818
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:50,606
I will protect you.

819
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,843
I will keep you safe from a monster.

820
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:59,815
I won't let a monster make you suffer.

821
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,786
Inaniwa.

822
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,117
Haruka?

823
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,920
Haruka?

824
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:45,988
Haruka?
