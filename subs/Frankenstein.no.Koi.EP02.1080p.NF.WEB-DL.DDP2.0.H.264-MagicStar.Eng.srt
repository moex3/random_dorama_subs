1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,602
Who's there?

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,641
I am not human.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,644
<i>He told me that he has been here</i>
<i>for 120 years.</i>

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,613
KEN FUKASHI

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,815
Can I change myself?

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,317
Let's change you!

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,100
Haruka?

8
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,036
Haruka…!

9
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,806
Haruka, hang in there! Haruka…!

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,776
Haruka…!

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,422
-Let's take her to hospital.
-Yes, please!

12
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,924
It'd be better to drive her there
by car. I'll get my keys.

13
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,294
Haruka…

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,667
You were there the whole time?

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,506
Did you see it? What's wrong
with my sister? What happened?

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,544
Is she dead?

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,146
Of course not.

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,549
But she will die.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,385
Humans die.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,923
Why do you say that?

21
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,625
I am sorry.

22
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,900
INANIWA CORPORATION

23
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,470
-Mr. Fukashi!
-Please, hurry!

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,539
-It's okay. I'll pick her up.
-Thank you.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,414
Did you do something to my sister?

26
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,852
What on earth are you?

27
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,287
I…

28
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,158
I cannot live in the human world.

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,895
Forget it.

30
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,819
-No muscle stiffness.
-No, there isn't.

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,920
Check her pupils.

32
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,760
Does your sister have any allergies?

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,829
I think it's anaphylaxis.

34
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,665
Do you have any idea
what she touched or breathed in?

35
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,904
Mr. Inaniwa, please do me a favor.

36
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,906
Yes?

37
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,810
I would like to stay with my sister.

38
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:00,914
Would you…

39
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:06,519
go and talk to Mr. Ken Fukashi?

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,156
You mean he knows
why this happened to your sister?

41
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,792
I don't know, but…

42
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,296
Please.

43
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,602
Hey, where is Mr. Ken Fukashi?

44
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,071
Not in his room? Maybe he is
taking a bath then.

45
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,674
Taking a bath earlier than me?
Not in a million years!

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,609
If I find some pubic hair, I'll kill him.

47
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,046
I passed by him on my way home
from shopping.

48
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,649
<i>I blew him a kiss, but he walked past</i>
<i>without noticing me.</i>

49
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,486
-<i>No, he just ignored you.</i>
-<i>No way!</i>

50
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,489
<i>He had been brooding over something.</i>

51
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,793
Could he have recalled
something from his past?

52
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,695
Then he went to have a drink alone.

53
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,363
Why did he go to have a drink?

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,167
A man goes to have a drink
to take a good look at his life.

55
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,702
Well, just wait. He'll be back soon.

56
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,705
Young people nowadays aren't
even as responsible as rookies.

57
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,341
Look who's talking. Child
of the pressure-free education generation.

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm not! And to begin with,
I didn't go to school.

59
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,079
I'd nothing to do with it from birth.

60
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,349
-You're really cool, Mikoto.
-Call me Murozono!

61
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,819
I grew up in a poor family
like you, Murozono.

62
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,487
Call me Mikoto.

63
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,257
Mr. Inaniwa, please try it
to see whether it tastes good or not.

64
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,961
What is it? <i>Shimeji</i> mushrooms?
You bought a lot.

65
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:26,266
Don't just give the workers cheap food!
Put some bacon in it!

66
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,936
-It's a bit of a waste.
-What?

67
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,206
-It's delicious!
-Really?

68
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,742
Your choice is good! I've never had
<i>shimeji</i> mushrooms as good as this!

69
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,176
It's crunchy and moist!

70
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,579
It'd be even better
if you put bacon in it.

71
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,080
-Supermarket Marukame?
-No.

72
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,615
It was growing in the bedding.

73
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,252
<i>I saw them growing close together</i>
<i>this morning</i>

74
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,854
<i>when I checked the bedding we lent Ken.</i>

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,255
<i>It's so funny!</i>

76
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,124
Really?

77
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,526
I see. It's Men's <i>Shimeji</i>, huh?

78
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,695
Damn you! How dare you make me eat that?!

79
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,264
Tamara, is there any <i>shimeji</i> left there?

80
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,165
Yes, a lot.

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,571
-Tsugumi.
-Grandma.

82
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,341
How is Haruka?

83
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,612
We have no idea why this happened to her.

84
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,683
Calm down…

85
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,154
Some transparent fungi
grew on Haruka's face

86
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,791
and her breathing got shallow.

87
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,760
What should I do?
If Haruka just dies like this…

88
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,197
That won't happen.
I won't let it happen.

89
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,242
Tsugumi! Take your medicine, okay?

90
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,744
It's okay. Just take your medicine.

91
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,534
Is this the <i>shimeji</i> mushroom-like thing
that grew in his bedding?

92
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,602
Yes, it is.

93
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,505
Sorry for calling you out
so early in the morning.

94
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,109
-What about him?
-He has disappeared.

95
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,215
If he is the reason that caused
fungi to grow in the bedding,

96
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,384
then is it possible
that he caused the fungi

97
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,786
that's growing on
Tsugaru's sister's face too?

98
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,990
Find him. I want to study more.

99
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,487
<i>Dad.</i>

100
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,393
<i>You should just live here forever.</i>

101
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,804
You…

102
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,942
You shouldn't approach humans.

103
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,514
You cannot survive in the human world.

104
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,251
Am I…

105
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,122
not human?

106
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,560
Humans die.

107
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,167
You had died as a human.

108
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,207
I…

109
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,311
I am dead?

110
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,848
And I brought you back to life.

111
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,425
You're lying!

112
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,361
You're lying!

113
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't remember the time when I was alive

114
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,536
and I don't remember that I died!

115
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,777
<i>I can only remember her face.</i>

116
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,584
<i>Only her face…</i>

117
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,720
<i>is what I thought I knew.</i>

118
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,589
<i>And her face…</i>

119
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,825
<i>looked like she knew me too.</i>

120
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,295
<i>I wanted to know who I am so much…</i>

121
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>I went after her.</i>

122
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,179
My grandmother told me

123
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,917
that this happened
to her younger sister too.

124
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,957
Her face was covered
with the fungi-like thing too.

125
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,827
What happened to her?

126
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,296
In the end…

127
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,467
She didn't regain consciousness,

128
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,170
then she just…

129
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,443
So, my grandmother didn't know
what happened to her as well.

130
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,318
I don't want that.

131
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,757
I'm supposed to die before her.

132
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,526
Tsugumi.

133
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,141
After all, I am…

134
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,344
really not a human.

135
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,420
I am not a human.

136
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,823
But…

137
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,694
you have only one relative.

138
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,969
It is me.

139
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,104
I am the only one

140
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,907
who is by your side.

141
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:57,977
From now on.

142
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,314
For forever.

143
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,419
Look around you when you're sad.

144
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,891
Look at the forest.

145
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,127
You can survive here.

146
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,098
You can survive even though
you're not human.

147
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,434
The trees in this deep forest

148
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,137
have been here for much longer than you

149
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,373
and they're living here.

150
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,575
They haven't got a name,

151
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,977
they don't interact with humans,

152
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,914
but they live here happily.

153
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,885
I'm sure that they'll accept you too.

154
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,290
Listen.

155
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,262
If you think the only way to live
is as a human, you couldn't be more wrong!

156
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,333
You are not a dead person.

157
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,270
I gave you a new life.

158
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,472
Yes.

159
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,777
You are a plant.

160
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,012
A plant.

161
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,148
Yes.

162
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,618
You're a plant that can think.

163
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,225
I apologize…

164
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,896
for letting such a painful function
remain in you.

165
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,398
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,071
I'm so sorry.

167
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,575
But you are alive.

168
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,547
You are alive as you are now.

169
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,215
You're alive.

170
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,819
I am alive.

171
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,523
I am alive.

172
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,502
At the moment, it only depends on how much
your sister wants to survive.

173
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,682
Tsugumi!

174
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,518
-If you touch her recklessly--
-It's fine!

175
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,390
Haruka has been protecting me.

176
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,092
She can't die before me.

177
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,497
It's impossible. I won't let her.

178
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,733
Good evening.

179
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,337
Oh… Who are you?

180
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,239
-Sorry, I'm late.
-Mr. Inaniwa.

181
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,007
I'm Inaniwa, a post-grad student.

182
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,910
Excuse me…

183
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,845
I told Professor Tsurumaru about this.

184
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,950
He told me to bring you this.

185
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,952
What is this?

186
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,321
The essence extracted from
a kind of fungi.

187
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,093
-Dr. Tsurumaru made it?
-Yeah, I made it with him.

188
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,295
We hope it will be the wonder drug.

189
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,399
You mean Dr. Tsurumaru knows the reason?

190
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,203
Yeah. If it is true…

191
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,939
this might cure her.

192
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,875
What will you do?

193
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,148
I'll try it.

194
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,011
It's good.

195
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,080
Thank you.

196
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,882
-Oh, right.
-Over here?

197
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,252
How is she?

198
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,355
My sister is recovering, thanks to you.

199
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,359
She hasn't regained consciousness,
but her vitals are stable.

200
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,328
The doctor said her health
should be okay now.

201
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,000
This is the fungi we removed.

202
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,269
How did you know, Professor?

203
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,907
Why do you think that he was the reason?

204
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,075
I mean Ken Fukashi.

205
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,479
Considering the circumstances,
I thought it was probable.

206
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,849
This is what grew in the bedding
that he slept in.

207
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,185
<i>He had</i> shimeji <i>mushrooms,</i>

208
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,521
so it's possible that fungi
like these had grown.

209
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,293
Fungi that looked like Red Thunder
had grown here before too.

210
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,162
We believe…

211
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,431
that he was the reason too.

212
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:50,002
He keeps numerous fungi species
in his body.

213
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,974
Your sister was infected with
one of them. In that case…

214
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,012
I thought, another fungi species
in his body

215
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,215
should work as a neutralizer.

216
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,051
You mean he is the host of such fungi?

217
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,653
You don't have to be so surprised.

218
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,990
Humans are hosts
to numerous kinds of fungi.

219
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,525
Yes, but…

220
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,063
But the resident microbiota
that supports his body

221
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,300
might not be something that we know of.

222
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,802
-They are unknown?
-Yes.

223
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,306
How the unknown fungi are born

224
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,543
and how they are released
aren't something I know.

225
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,915
If he has been releasing
the spores of the fungi…

226
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,851
Releasing spores?

227
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,552
…I can say that…

228
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,957
his very existence
is a new fungi species itself.

229
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,201
<i>He hasn't come back since that evening.</i>

230
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,172
He must have done something,

231
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,074
so he can't stay here anymore.

232
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:09,948
KEN FUKASHI

233
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,389
TSUGUMI TSUGARU

234
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,390
What is that?

235
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,904
Here you are!

236
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,883
My sister's life is saved.

237
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,223
My sister won't die.

238
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,225
Her disease will be cured.

239
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,994
Cured?

240
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,499
Will you tell me what happened?

241
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,911
I am studying fungi at university.

242
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,980
Perhaps…

243
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:20,052
I can learn something
from the problem you carry.

244
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,423
-I want to know more--
-Miss Tsugaru.

245
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,659
I can't stay with you.

246
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,467
I cannot stay with you.

247
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,206
Please…

248
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,443
forgive me.

249
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,080
Please…

250
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,618
don't find me again.

251
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,171
Sorry, he will not come back.

252
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,707
You met him, didn't you?

253
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,945
He said he wouldn't see you again, miss?

254
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,014
Don't call her that. It's Miss Tsugaru.

255
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,018
Hey, just have dinner now.
And do not make <i>shimeji</i> mushrooms.

256
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,788
Okay, let's have dinner.

257
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,462
But it's a wonder.

258
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,633
Why is Mr. Ken Fukashi's body still alive?

259
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,104
Has he really been alive
for over a hundred years?

260
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,542
I guess he is happier
to live in the forest.

261
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,111
Yeah, perhaps.

262
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,550
He must be afraid of being seen
as a monster.

263
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,587
Are you not afraid of him?

264
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,625
Don't go see him alone again.

265
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,364
Mr. Inaniwa.

266
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,232
Yes?

267
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,340
I cannot have a romantic relationship.

268
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:29,047
It's impossible for me
to create a future with someone.

269
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,620
My future cannot be changed.

270
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,871
From now on, can I…

271
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,310
find out something else
about myself besides my name here?

272
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,080
-Yes?
-Can I…

273
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,016
find myself interesting?

274
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,619
Can I change myself?

275
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:09,988
You can.

276
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,224
I know you can change.

277
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,259
Let's change you!

278
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,615
<i>If you don't care</i>
<i>what people think about you,</i>

279
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,452
<i>you'll only either be a criminal</i>
<i>or a real artist.</i>

280
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,355
<i>Which one are you, Mr. Tokachi?</i>
<i>An artist or a criminal?</i>

281
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,756
<i>I am none of them!</i>

282
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,625
I always care about
what others think about me.

283
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,593
What? I don't think so.

284
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,096
You always say what you want
and I thought you were carefree.

285
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,465
Don't say that I am carefree!

286
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,233
I said it wrong.
I mean it must feel so good.

287
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,169
It's the same…

288
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,804
How rude of you!

289
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,874
I'm saying I live in a way
that won't make people think so.

290
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,410
Really, I'm always timid.

291
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,146
Oh, let's drop the topic
or I'll be less popular.

292
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,648
You see? I do care.

293
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,784
It will be 3 p.m. soon,
so let's call SNACK MAN here.

294
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,419
<i>Where is he today?</i>

295
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,228
<i>The time of you and me</i>

296
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,331
<i>The theory of evolution of me and you</i>

297
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,068
<i>If you are worried, tell Amakusa</i>

298
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,073
<i>Seek Amakusa's advice</i>

299
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,142
Hello. This is Junpei Amakusa.

300
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,344
We received this problem.

301
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,614
Thug Burdock from Chiba Prefecture,
17 years old.

302
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,250
"I had a fight with my friend,

303
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,987
then I tweeted something bad
about him without thinking.

304
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,290
It seems to have hurt my friend
more than I thought.

305
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,192
I kept apologizing,
but he wouldn't forgive me."

306
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,495
<i>"I know I was wrong,</i>

307
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,563
<i>but I have no other way to apologize.</i>

308
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,966
<i>How can I get him to forgive me?"</i>

309
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,269
So, we have come
to a certain place in Tokyo.

310
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,038
This is the office
of the so-called <i>yakuza</i>,

311
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,641
that is, a criminal gang.

312
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,515
I am going to risk my life to see
how far you have to go

313
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,717
<i>to apologize to a friend you have hurt.</i>

314
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,453
Someone that looks like a member
has just come out.

315
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,021
Excuse me. Please let me interview you.

316
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,557
-Hey, don't film my face, jerk!
-It's okay, it's radio.

317
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,425
We won't broadcast your face.

318
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,028
We won't say your name
or your group's name too.

319
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:31,997
What is it?

320
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:36,001
<i>The police's control is stricter</i>
<i>nowadays and it must be tough,</i>

321
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,602
<i>so why did you become a gang member?</i>

322
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,271
You ask me why?

323
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,608
It's because it's where a man belongs.

324
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,412
You think you can't be better
than others if you lead a normal life?

325
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,180
What?

326
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,883
You don't want to work or study,

327
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,185
so you think that you'll manage
to survive in this world?

328
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,087
What are you talking about?

329
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,589
Does it feel good to use violence

330
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:01,393
and make people surrender,
even if others think that you're scum?

331
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,261
-Darn you!
-I'm sorry…

332
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,696
You're looking down on me?

333
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,798
I apologize if I've hurt you.

334
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,099
I'm sorry. Please forgive me!

335
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,635
Don't mess with me, you jerk!

336
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,172
-<i>Please stop it…</i>
-<i>Sorry, it is a radio program.</i>

337
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,740
<i>Shut up, jerk!</i>

338
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,276
<i>Looking at the result,</i>
<i>no matter how much I apologized,</i>

339
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,511
he didn't forgive me.

340
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,916
But my opinion is…

341
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,721
<i>You don't apologize because you want</i>
<i>the person's forgiveness,</i>

342
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,123
<i>you should brace yourself</i>
<i>for punishment when you do it!</i>

343
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,529
Ouch…

344
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,764
If you don't prepare for
the punishment when you apologize,

345
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,168
<i>then you're just pretending to apologize</i>

346
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,605
to escape from what you did.

347
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,809
<i>If you think that being hated by</i>
<i>your friend is the punishment,</i>

348
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,877
accept it when you apologize!

349
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,749
Do not run away from what you did!

350
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,451
<i>Please just don't damage the equipment.</i>

351
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,219
-<i>Take him inside.</i>
-Yes, Boss.

352
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,220
Stand up!

353
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,124
See you tomorrow.

354
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,627
If you have worries in the afternoon…

355
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,063
<i>Seek Amakusa's advice</i>

356
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,376
You should've run away!

357
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,077
You're not funny!

358
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,014
-Am I not?
-You are not.

359
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,584
When people tell you their common worries,

360
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,420
you might want to give advice
in a funny way,

361
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,455
but you never really answer anything.

362
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,459
You are just making fun
of other people's worries.

363
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:42,961
Are you aware of that?

364
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,965
No. I was trying to give advice
in my own way.

365
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,801
Yeah, Mr. Amakusa has tried his best.

366
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,437
Mr. Tokachi, people who seek
advice like it too.

367
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,340
It's because they think that
it's a story, right?

368
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,076
They give us a story,
then it gets accepted,

369
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,011
so they are delighted!

370
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,280
You are not giving them advice
about their worries!

371
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,083
People will grow tired of you soon enough,

372
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,452
you'll be less and less funny,
and it's over for you.

373
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,989
What should I do then?

374
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,391
Exactly. What should he do?

375
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,961
Give some proper advice.

376
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,597
Use your own words, in your own way.

377
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,167
I am learning very hard in my own way

378
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,335
to give people advice already.

379
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,140
Am I really not interesting?

380
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,276
No, you aren't interesting.

381
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,144
Don't be defeated, Mr. Amakusa.

382
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,647
Your looks are deceptive.

383
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,383
-It's radio. His looks doesn't--
-You're annoying.

384
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,551
Don't say anything.

385
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,087
I thought you had a backbone
and some spite!

386
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:45,223
I thought you wouldn't deceive people
by playing cheap tricks.

387
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,058
And what the heck is that song?

388
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,562
It sounds like someone dull
is going to come out now.

389
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,231
-Who are you, Pikotaro?
-Pikotaro is--

390
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,566
Don't say anything!

391
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,335
You half-baked musicians

392
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,003
don't make an effort to pursue
your dreams, that's why.

393
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,306
No, that's not my intention.

394
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,141
I'm just trying to work hard
at where I am now.

395
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,376
You don't belong anywhere!

396
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,146
You're only part of my program!

397
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,549
Don't you dare play cheap tricks
and try to draw attention!

398
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,018
If you want somewhere you belong to,

399
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,387
fight fair and square with your words!

400
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,057
Do it, Amakusa!

401
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,293
Use your own words

402
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,829
to try and snatch it from me!

403
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,933
How dare he say that.

404
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,536
He never has his own words.

405
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,572
He made the program's writers
give me stories.

406
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,642
If they aren't popular, he only
thinks about how to fire them.

407
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,078
Well, that's not true

408
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,347
or he wouldn't be able
to work for decades here.

409
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,314
There you go.

410
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,850
Yes, of course!

411
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,052
I'm trying to comfort you,

412
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,687
so at least go with it.

413
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,291
Don't worry, Ushi. I don't feel down.

414
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,294
That's all right then.

415
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,931
But seriously, the part where
you give people advice

416
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,432
is quite popular.

417
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,003
For instance, my boss
hasn't said anything about it.

418
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,905
Ririe cheers for me too.

419
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,574
You'd better not trust her though.

420
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,979
Rumor has it that they're partners
even in their private life.

421
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,682
It looks like she is cheering for you

422
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,351
to urge Mr. Tokachi
to make greater efforts.

423
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:24,556
Wow, Ushi, you're so good
at observing people.

424
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,960
I have to thank you for making me popular.

425
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:34,098
I'm so boring, but you make me
interesting every time.

426
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,235
I am really grateful to you.

427
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,705
Will you think a bit more highly
of yourself?

428
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,607
I don't need your gratitude.

429
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,210
Because I'm interesting too.

430
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,382
But people will grow tired of me soon
if I'm only interesting.

431
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,454
Does anyone ever listen to what I say?

432
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:06,598
<i>You don't apologize because you want</i>
<i>the person's forgiveness,</i>

433
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,200

What a relief!
I'll call the doctor here now.

438
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,225
This is… the hospital?

439
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,396
Yeah, the hospital you work at.

440
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,300
What happened to me?

441
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,535
You don't remember anything?

442
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,175
Your head… Does your head hurt?

443
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,650
Tsugumi?

444
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,037
Do you know where Miss Tsugumi Tsugaru is?

445
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,539
Who is Miss Tsugaru?

446
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,509
Do you know Miss Tsugumi Tsugaru?

447
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,946
No, I don't. Sorry.

448
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,420
Do you know Miss Tsugaru?

449
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,188
Tsugaru?

450
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,290
What is the first name?

451
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,392
It's Miss Tsugumi Tsugaru.

452
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,227
No, I don't.

453
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,729
I've never heard of her here.

454
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,032
-Look.
-Oh, it's lovely.

455
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,501
Do you know Miss Tsugaru?

456
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,136
Tsugaru?

457
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,305
Her name is Tsugumi.

458
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,542
The girl is Tsugumi though.

459
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,083
What are you doing?

460
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,120
Miss Tsugaru is someone bigger.

461
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,021
What?

462
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,892
Do you know a big Tsugumi Tsugaru?

463
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,893
A big one?

464
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,363
Not little Tsugumi.

465
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,566
It's Miss Tsugumi Tsugaru.

466
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,201
What does she do?

467
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,237
Miss Tsugaru…

468
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,008
She studies fungi.

469
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,276
Oh! So, she is a university student?

470
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,278
Yes, she is.

471
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,147
In that case, why don't you
ask the university?

472
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,716
Walk straight down this road.

473
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,886
There is only one university here,

474
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,154
so it must be the one.

475
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,426
Hey!

476
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,530
When you ask people something,
you should at least say thank you.

477
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,968
Thank you, sir.

00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,117
What are you doing?

486
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,420
I am looking for Miss Tsugaru.

487
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,355
Why are you here so shamelessly?

488
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,325
-I came to see Miss Tsugaru.
-What?

489
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,194
Where is Miss Tsugaru?

490
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,996
-Where can I see her?
-Hey! Calm down.

491
00:34:59,063 --> 00:34:59,997
What an idiot.

492
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,900
-You are too naive.
-Hey!

493
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,470
-Ken lost his memory.
-Yeah.

494
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,573
He just desperately wants
someone's company.

495
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,645
But Ken, why do you want to see her?

496
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,715
I want to apologize.

497
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,351
You want her forgiveness?

498
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,288
I am not apologizing
because I want forgiveness.

499
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,359
I'll apologize and prepare
for the punishment I'll receive.

500
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,431
Punishment, huh? It's a good attitude.

501
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,835
But you have to show her.

502
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:39,971
Show her?

503
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,108
You have to show her that
you are a decent person now.

504
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,212
-I don't get what you mean.
-Go to work, idiot!

505
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,548
Keep working and working and working.

506
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,417
If you think even once that you
want to play or take a rest…

507
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,454
then… die!

508
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,689
"The Ballade for My Mother"!

509
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,626
Mr. Inaniwa made us hear it
many times in the karaoke.

510
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,161
Ken Fukashi,

511
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,198
stop complaining and get to work, okay?

512
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,400
The kanji of "work"…

513
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,638
is composed of "people" and "move".

514
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,973
Wait. Why did you all
became Tetsuya Takeda?

515
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,642
Okay, guys! Let's get to work!

516
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,677
-Okay…
-Thank you, Ken.

517
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:23,414
TSUGUMI TSUGARU

518
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,953
-So, he is there?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

519
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,355
He is now working enthusiastically.

520
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,425
He came here to see Miss Tsugaru.

521
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,826
Yeah.

522
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,129
Thank you.

523
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,065
He is here.

524
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,434
Ken Fukashi has returned.

525
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,506
INANIWA CORPORATION

526
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,654
Why did you come back?

527
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,591
I am sorry.

528
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:08,926
Why do you apologize?

529
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,595
I am sorry.

530
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,366
What happened here?

531
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,307
Do you apologize because you did
something to my sister?

532
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,042
I am sorry.

533
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,313
You said you couldn't stay with me.

534
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,315
Then why did you come back?

535
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,320
I came to apologize.

536
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,957
To ask for my forgiveness?

537
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,760
I am not apologizing
because I want forgiveness.

538
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,861
For what, then?

539
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,399
My punishment.

540
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,535
-Please give me my punishment.
-Punishment?

541
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,739
I came to apologize
and I've braced myself for the punishment.

542
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,675
-I don't get what you're saying.
-I am sorry.

543
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,710
I am sorry!

544
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,580
I am sorry.

545
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,487
What should I do?

546
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:17,295
How do I give you a punishment?
Please tell me.

547
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,172
I…

548
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,841
I don't know how.

549
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,980
I don't know, so please tell me.

550
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,849
What is a punishment?

551
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,391
I should be the one to apologize.

552
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,495
Why do you apologize?

553
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,596
It was my fault.

554
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,732
Because I…

555
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,303
I brought you here from the forest.

556
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,971
No, it isn't your fault.

557
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,573
I am sorry.

558
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,408
You don't have to apologize for it.

559
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,177
I don't want you to apologize to me.

560
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,778
I apologize. I'm so sorry.

561
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,054
Please give me my punishment.

562
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:20,991
Please…

563
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,161
do what you did to my sister.

564
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,900
You touched her?

565
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,070
Does that happen if you touch me?

566
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,539
In that case, please touch me.

567
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,678
It's okay for me.

568
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,547
Because…

569
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,384
I'm not afraid of dying.

570
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,153
I have Branch Disease and it's incurable.

571
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,859
The blood streams in my head
might be blocked or break anytime.

572
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,665
My mother too had the disease
at 30 years old and died at 34.

573
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,237
I have had it since I was little
and I might die anytime.

574
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,778
So, please touch me.

575
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,679
-No!
-Don't do this!

576
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,082
Mr. Ken Fukashi!

577
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,285
Please…

578
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,356
show me what you really are.

579
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,158
Please don't come here!

580
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,927
Please…

581
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,431
don't come here.

582
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,335
Please.

583
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,172
We won't.

584
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,490
I'll take care of the rest.

585
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,258
I'll keep a close eye on him.

586
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,993
Keep an eye on him?

587
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,330
There are ways to investigate
without using force.

588
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,501
Anyway, just go home.
I'll take care of the rest.

589
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,069
Take care.

590
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,643
Hey!

591
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,347
Can I go there?

592
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,750
Where is Miss Tsugaru?

593
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,653
She's gone.

594
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,147
Can I go there?

595
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,385
You can.

596
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,619
Come on.

597
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,389
Let's return to the house.

598
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,325
House?

599
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,228
Our house.

600
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,031
Miss Tsugaru understands too.

601
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,302
Can I…

602
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,905
Can I continue to stay here?

603
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,874
Of course.

604
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,877
So, you don't have to apologize.

605
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,147
In your life, if you're with someone,

606
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,616
things like that happen.

607
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,785
What do you mean?

608
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,555
Being with someone else…

609
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,824
to humans,

610
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,394
it's already something like a punishment.

611
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,017
Come on.

612
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,386
Let's go.

613
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,253
<i>Is he a monster?</i>

614
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,824
<i>I might kill another person.</i>

615
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,461
Ken, run!

616
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:08,465
Come and live in the human world with me.
