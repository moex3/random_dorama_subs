1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,637
Am I not human?

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,406
I brought you back to life.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>I shouldn't be with you.</i>

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,112
There is no place for you here.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,880
Don't you dare try to show off.

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,550
Take her from me using your own words.

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,154
<i>Please show me who you really are.</i>

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,056
<i>Being with someone else…</i>

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,427
<i>is already something like</i>
<i>a punishment for being human.</i>

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,065
He turned over a new leaf
and came back to work with us again.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,367
Let's welcome Ken Fukashi.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,237
Say, "Welcome home."

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,906
We've worked all day. That's enough.

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:40,874
Idiot.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,745
At the end of the day, workers have beer.

16
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,048
Okay. Welcome home.

17
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,516
-Welcome home.
-Welcome home.

18
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,417
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,851
Hey!

20
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,187
-Should I drink it?
-Not yet.

21
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,757
Listen. Even if you've had a bitter past,

22
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,629
you can be free of it depending on
how you live your life today.

23
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,665
Even if you were a gloomy man in the past,

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,401
don't feel that you still are.

25
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,537
Your beer will go flat if you wait
until he finishes talking.

26
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,407
You have more than
what you had in the past.

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,942
I'll kill you if you run away again.

28
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,811
Just drink up.

29
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,979
I want to say "welcome home"
to the you of tomorrow.

30
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,648
That doesn't mean anything.

31
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,784
Say, "I'm home," as the you of tomorrow.

32
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,554
"I'm home," as the me of tomorrow.

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,755
He is so obedient.

34
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,523
Tell him that he's annoying.

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,859
-I'm used to it.
-Already?

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,760
Cheers.

37
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,933
Boss. Look at her.

38
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,737
When your son is here, Murozono
eats with her mouth closed.

39
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,673
Mikoto, you behave like a girl.

40
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,742
Don't you talk to me like that
or I'll kill you.

41
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>You mean near my university?</i>

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,816
Yes. It was my grandmother.

43
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,419
I mean your great-great-grandmother.

44
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,520
Okay.

45
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,722
She used to live near there.

46
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,093
Her family were landowners
around that area.

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,866
You told me that a younger sister
of Great-great-grandmother

48
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,368
had the same symptoms
as my sister and passed away.

49
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,371
Right. My grandmother's name was Kiku.

50
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,008
Her younger sister's name was Saki.

51
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,878
-Saki?
-Yes.

52
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,313
Saki was lying on the mountain
near the university when she was found.

53
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,917
When did she die?

54
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:36,055
About 120 years ago.

55
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,858
Hundred and twenty years ago?

56
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,162
I didn't know that my university
was there 120 years ago.

57
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,062
No.

58
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,599
The university had not been built
at that time yet.

59
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,703
I heard that there was
some kind of laboratory there.

60
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,809
Try this, Ken. It's tasty.

61
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,612
What is this?

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,381
Don't you know <i>natto</i>?

63
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,116
You must be from the west of Japan.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,250
Try it.

65
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,399
It's delicious.

66
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,868
Do you like <i>natto</i>? That helps.

67
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,973
Don't you have to take care
of your husband, Tamara?

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,442
No. My husband doesn't eat.

69
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,410
Huh?

70
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,146
Tamara married the president
of an architectural office

71
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,647
who is closely related to us.

72
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,682
He is 70 years old.

73
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,184
He fell in love
and got remarried to Tamara.

74
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,819
He is a man of great ability.

75
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,855
Poor guy. He doesn't know that
you married him for his money.

76
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,557
He doesn't eat at all?

77
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,125
He doesn't eat at night.

78
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,461
He's lost ten kilograms
since he married me.

79
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,163
You want him to starve to death.

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,666
He wakes up at 4 a.m.
and he jogs 20 kilometers every day.

81
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,668
You want him to have a heart attack.

82
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,138
He eats a 600-gram steak for breakfast.

83
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,974
And we make love before he goes to work.

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,376
You will kill him.

85
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,280
Why don't you ask Seiya to kill you then?

86
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,686
I'll kill you.

87
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,493
Do you mean to put someone to death
when you say, "I'll kill you"?

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,997
-Huh?
-That is a bad thing to do.

89
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,966
Why do you want to kill someone so easily?

90
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,701
Are you joking?

91
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,771
She is not serious.

92
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,440
She doesn't really mean "kill".

93
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,776
Don't you know the song
by Miyuki Nakajima?

94
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,514
<i>I don't like singing a goodbye song</i>

95
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:46,119
<i>But I just don't know any other songs</i>

96
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,320
I don't get it.

97
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,188
Don't make him confused.

98
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:50,990
Who is this?

99
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,027
Hello.

100
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,662
<i>Mikoto.</i>

101
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,864
<i>Welcome back.</i>

102
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,399
I will kill you!

103
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,506
MONDAY - FRIDAY
13:00-16:00

104
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,840
Here you go.

105
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,878
Ken, will you open the door for me?

106
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,513
Okay.

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,354
Thanks.

108
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,591
Tamara hung out your futon
in the sun. It should feel nice.

109
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,097
Ken.

110
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,067
Did you come back because
you wanted to see Tsugumi?

111
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,002
Yes.

112
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,438
You're so honest, Ken.

113
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,976
You fell in love with her.

114
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,715
I know the word,
but I don't know what it means.

115
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,983
It means you love someone.

116
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,520
It's when you want to be with someone,

117
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,590
no matter what happens.

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,234
Do you need anything else?

119
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,806
How can I talk to the radio?

120
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,775
Talk to the radio?

121
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,679
Amakusa.

122
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,716
Do you want to call in to a radio show?

123
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,784
Yes.

124
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,719
I see.

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,257
Most listeners send messages
by email rather than postcards today.

126
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,425
Can you write?

127
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:33,993
Yes.

128
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,370
Write a letter and I will
send it to the radio.

129
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,776
Wait a moment.

130
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,525
AMAKUSA

131
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,376
Ken.

132
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,512
You can listen to the radio using this.

133
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,981
It'll be good to learn how to use it.

134
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,858
PARADISE HEAVEN

135
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,928
PARADISE

136
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,895
ASK AMAKUSA

137
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,796
You finished already?

138
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,433
You have excellent handwriting.

139
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,003
Are you sure you want to send
this question to Amakusa?

140
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,539
-Yes.
-Then, let's do it.

141
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,510
What about your name?

142
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,314
My name is Ken Fukashi.

143
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,216
No.

144
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,117
People usually don't use their real names

145
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,652
when they send messages to radio stations.

146
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,654
So…

147
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,557
How about "Frankenstein"?

148
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,994
-Frankenstein?
-Yes.

149
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,063
I think it's a good nickname
for this question.

150
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,599
Let's use Frankenstein as your nickname.

151
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,100
RADIO NAME: FRANKENSTEIN

152
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,637
Frankenstein.
Hundred and twenty years old.

153
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,005
AGE: 120

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,711
"Do you think a monster
who is capable of killing humans

155
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:37,650
shouldn't fall in love with a human?"

156
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,353
Send it?

157
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,189
And send.

158
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,691
Okay. I sent it.

159
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,362
Good.

160
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,598
What's this?

161
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,699
MAIN TITLE

162
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,168
Which one?

163
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,204
Did you press it?

164
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,975
Don't press keys when
you don't know how it works.

165
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,876
Okay.

166
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,946
Let me stop this.

167
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,915
-You good?
-It's okay.

168
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,150
-No. It's too high.
-Lower it.

169
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,753
-Make it lower.
-Lower.

170
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,021
-It's fine.
-It's okay.

171
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,822
No. Make it lower.

172
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,891
You have to put it lower.

173
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,709
Wow!

174
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,349
What's the next thing?

175
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,786
<i>Nameko</i> mushrooms today.

176
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,123
-Haruka.
-Hi, Tsugumi.

177
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,026
-What are you doing?
-I'm working.

178
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,029
Since I am in the hospital,
I shouldn't sleep all the time.

179
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,198
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

180
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,434
The doctor was surprised
that I recovered so soon.

181
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,669
I was just tired.

182
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,440
I shouldn't make you worry.

183
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,408
Sorry.

184
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,045
Do you really not remember anything?

185
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,382
-Do you mean how I fainted?
-Yes.

186
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,486
Well…

187
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,055
I think I saw something strange.

188
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,192
-Something strange?
-Yeah.

189
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,528
It was like a ghost.

190
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,307
I think I had a hallucination
because my senses were muddled.

191
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,045
Let's have some tea.

192
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,413
FUGAKU UNIVERSITY
ENTRANCE

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,814
<i>University records?</i>

194
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,217
I want to know about the history
from 120 years ago.

195
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,654
Hundred and twenty years ago?

196
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,422
That's 1897.

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,824
What was around here at that time?

198
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,063
There was an institute
of infectious diseases.

199
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,298
An institute of infectious diseases?

200
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,402
There was an isolation ward
because it was in the middle of nowhere.

201
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,505
Do you know if there are
any documents about that?

202
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,741
It will take some time,
but I can look for you.

203
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,310
-Please do.
-Thank you very much.

204
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,115
-Good morning.
-Morning!

205
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,050
Tsugumi.

206
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,285
Here is a new bacterium.

207
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354
A new bacterium?

208
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,257
It's sticky because of <i>natto</i>.

209
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,658
<i>Natto</i>?

210
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:37,997
It's considered to be changes
in his cells that created bacteria

211
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,300
because he took <i>natto</i> bacteria.

212
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,236
It's <i>natto</i> mushroom. See?

213
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,473
He ate <i>natto</i>.

214
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,242
The next morning, he released
fungal spores that create mucin,

215
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,646
a viscous substance that made
the <i>natto</i> sticky in his bed.

216
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,249
Did you ask him to eat <i>natto</i>
to check that?

217
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,151
I wasn't experimenting on him.

218
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,422
He can't live without taking in
other bacteria

219
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,725
if he lives with humans.

220
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,059
You're right.

221
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,663
There are countless numbers
of bacteria in the air.

222
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,233
It's the same whether he lives
in the forest or in the city.

223
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,771
His body is constantly affected
by invisible bacteria.

224
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,241
The same applies for humans, though.

225
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,746
But humans don't release
fungal spores like mushrooms do.

226
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,483
He releases a bacterium
that can kill humans.

227
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,384
The question is when he releases it.

228
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,220
-Now.
-Professor!

229
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,224
How can he release them
while he is sleeping?

230
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,995
People become defenseless
when they are sleeping.

231
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,299
Maybe he releases them without knowing it.

232
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,568
Professor Tsurumaru.

233
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,072
Do you think that this phenomenon
relates to his mental status?

234
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,673
I don't know yet.

235
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,712
Is he a monster?

236
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,481
There is no phenomenon called a monster.

237
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:15,728
This was the first house I built
when I became boss's pupil.

238
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,831
That was 25 years ago.

239
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,700
You must have been
a small child, like this.

240
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,668
No.

241
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,904
You were nothing

242
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,241
but an ex-high school
baseball player at that time.

243
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:34,280
I can feel the self-growth
while I renovate this same house.

244
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,247
I'm happy.

245
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,852
What does "renovate" mean?

246
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,554
Huh?

247
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,989
He's a good worker,
but he's not very smart.

248
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,357
Idiot!

249
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,494
He is asking the deep meaning of it.

250
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,930
It's a good question, Ken.

251
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,667
To renovate is to follow up on the life
of the person who lives in the home.

252
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,936
Follow up on the life…

253
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,907
Their child was only a baby
when we built this house.

254
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,778
But that child grew up, married,
and had grandchildren.

255
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,682
That's why they asked me
to change the layout.

256
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,718
Do they want to rebuild the house?

257
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,553
Yes.

258
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,725
We rebuild their houses
following up on their lives.

259
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,529
That's our job
as a local building contractor.

260
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,530
That's great, Boss.

261
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,732
Only you can call me "boss" now.

262
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,368
-I will call you boss from today.
-I will too.

263
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,703
Idiots.

264
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,706
Don't copy another person's traditions.

265
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,174
Make your own traditions.

266
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,909
-Yes, President.
-President.

267
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,677
You can call me "master", if you like.

268
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,581
Stop using your mouths, use your hands.

269
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,250
Yes.

270
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,952
Ken.

271
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,422
You can call me master if you like.

272
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,959
Mr.… Master?

273
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,596
Just call me master. Work hard.

274
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,565
Yes.

275
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,100
Ken. Hand me that bag.

276
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,041
What's up, Mikoto? You look blue.

277
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,410
I'm just working without chatting.

278
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,778
I see.

279
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,347
Hello.

280
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,816
-Hi. How are you?
-Good afternoon.

281
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,786
I brought Japanese cakes for you.

282
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,889
Hey, pretty girl. Ken is working hard.

283
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,525
Don't call her that. Her name is Tsugumi.

284
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,494
-Where should I put these?
-Over there.

285
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,099
Hi.

286
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,003
How are you?

287
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,472
Are you all right?

288
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,841
Yes.

289
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,810
I'm fine.

290
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,615
How are you,

291
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,984
Tsugumi?

292
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,821
I'm okay.

293
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,258
Work hard.

294
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,062
Yes.

295
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,797
I'll work hard.

296
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,438
FRANKENSTEIN

297
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,372
120 YEARS OLD

298
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,440
Thank you for waiting.

299
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,243
I want to read this today.

300
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,446
Do you want to change it now?

301
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,948
This email caught my eye.

302
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,551
I feel like I shouldn't ignore it.

303
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,822
Let's ignore it.
It's probably a waste of time.

304
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,759
But this Frankenstein seems
to be really pushed into a corner.

305
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,328
I think this is a serious question.

306
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,300
If you ignore it, do you think
he would really kill someone?

307
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,736
No way.

308
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,805
But it would be interesting.

309
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,340
Huh?

310
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,610
Where do you want to go,
and who do you want to interview?

311
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,953
There's a place I have in mind.

312
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,390
-Let's take a break.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,492
-Let's go.
-Okay.

314
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,793
Let's eat some cake.

315
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,428
-Thanks.
-Thanks

316
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,530
-Here you go.
-I'm going to tuck in.

317
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,932
-Thanks.
-Ken, you can take a break.

318
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,037
Thanks.

319
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,438
Let's sit down and eat.

320
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,341
-<i>I told you before.</i>
-<i>No…</i>

321
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,210
<i>But I heard that Amakusa</i>
<i>is very popular these days.</i>

322
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,845
<i>Is that the time?</i>

323
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm getting bored, though.

324
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,016
Don't say such a thing.
He works on our show.

325
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,719
In the end, I forget what
the listeners have even asked.

326
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,388
-He said he will make it better.
-Really?

327
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,657
He will take a different approach.

328
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,125
He told me so.

329
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,026
That's interesting.

330
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,663
Yes. It's about 3 p.m. now.
Let's call SNACK MAN.

331
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,265
Where is he today?

332
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,274
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

333
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

334
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,214
<i>If you are worried about something</i>

335
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,286
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

336
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,288
Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

337
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,824
Here is an email I received today.

338
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,827
It's from Frankenstein,
who is 120 years old.

339
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,795
<i>"Do you think a monster</i>
<i>who is capable of killing humans</i>

340
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,631
<i>shouldn't fall in love with a human?"</i>

341
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,167
That's a deep question.

342
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,902
I don't know the answer to it.

343
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:30,442
So, I want to ask someone
who I really respect.

344
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,146
-Hello.
-What are you doing?

345
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,516
This is Minoru Tokachi, a man I respect.

346
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,484
Huh?

347
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,655
Oh my God. You didn't tell me this.

348
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,093
What are you doing?

349
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,230
Tokachi. Will you please
answer his question?

350
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,631
Question?

351
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,266
You weren't listening.

352
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,035
I was. Idiot. What was it?

353
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,172
It's from Frankenstein,
who is 120 years old.

354
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,341
"Do you think a monster
who's capable of killing humans

355
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,343
shouldn't fall in love with a human?"

356
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,711
<i>That is the question.</i>

357
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,846
<i>Please tell us what you think.</i>

358
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,916
-No, of course.
-Really?

359
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>This man is making fun of us.</i>

360
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,454
<i>What if this is a serious question?</i>

361
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,358
<i>A person who is serious</i>
<i>would not kill someone.</i>

362
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,461
<i>What if he is really being</i>
<i>pushed into a corner?</i>

363
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,329
What would you say
if you answered him seriously?

364
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,399
Do you think a person who thinks
of himself as a monster

365
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,034
shouldn't fall in love with a human?

366
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,171
First of all, a person who thinks
he might kill people shouldn't live.

367
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,438
It's ridiculous.

368
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,973
Don't get so upset.

369
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,509
This person doesn't say
that he wants to kill anyone.

370
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,645
He is scared that he might kill someone.

371
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,381
<i>Is he a stalker or something?</i>

372
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,350
<i>I can't justify the love of a man</i>
<i>who is a stalker.</i>

373
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,752
He sounds spoiled.

374
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,254
I want to tell him something.

375
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,858
If you think you will kill someone,
don't leave your house.

376
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,959
<i>Don't meet anyone.</i>

377
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
<i>Kill yourself</i>
<i>before you kill someone else!</i>

378
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,262
<i>Tokachi, you are too eccentric.</i>

379
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,997
<i>I don't care. This is my radio show.</i>

380
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,934
<i>A person like him can't read</i>
<i>your mind. So, I'm talking straight.</i>

381
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,137
Here is my serious answer.
Kill yourself. That's it.

382
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,040
Amakusa. Say something.

383
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,943
I…

384
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,914
I think he should love humans
even if he thinks he is a monster.

385
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>He should live with humans.</i>

386
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:25,791
<i>Think hard about how he can live</i>
<i>without killing people.</i>

387
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,960
Will you take responsibility
for what you've just said?

388
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,195
He will learn that
he shouldn't kill people

389
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,731
by loving someone.

390
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,466
He will know it

391
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,770
only when he wants someone to live
from the bottom of his heart.

392
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,475
<i>So, a monster should meet</i>
<i>as many people as possible</i>

393
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,544
<i>and find someone that he truly loves.</i>

394
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,251
That's the only way
to prevent him from killing people.

395
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,887
<i>I'm sure he will find</i>
<i>his true love someday.</i>

396
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,157
<i>Even if you are a monster now,</i>

397
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,561
<i>don't be afraid.</i>

398
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,731
I want you to live
and fall in love with someone.

399
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,702
What's wrong?

400
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,680
You really like

401
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,150
listening to the radio.

402
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:03,989
You…

403
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,760
listened to the radio
in the forest, didn't you?

404
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,797
Yes.

405
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,301
For 120 years.

406
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,505
I didn't have a radio
for such a long time.

407
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:31,750
What should I think of you?

408
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,420
Are you a monster?

409
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,856
Are you Frankenstein?

410
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,092
That was a nickname for the radio.

411
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,530
My name is Ken Fukashi.

412
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,604
The radio said that I could live
and fall in love with humans.

413
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,111
What would you say, Tsugumi?

414
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,479
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,449
I don't know what to say.

416
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,594
Will you come back to work?
They're worried about you.

417
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,463
Yes.

418
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,667
I'm heading back to the university.

419
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,603
Yes.

420
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,472
Work hard.

421
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,792
Great job.

422
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,796
Thank you very much.

423
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,164
Thank you very much.

424
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,733
Did you do this to get payback?

425
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,601
No. It's not payback.

426
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,337
I really wanted to know
how you would answer.

427
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,774
It was fun. So, that's good.

428
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,342
Are you satisfied?

429
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,846
You set up a surprise attack
on the host of a radio show.

430
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,048
Was it fun?

431
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,452
I…

432
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,223
I thought that you came up
with a good answer.

433
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,724
You are fired!

434
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,593
Get out of here.

435
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,230
All right.

436
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,266
Thank you for everything. Excuse me.

437
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,306
I am very sorry.

438
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,312
Well, it was not an accident.

439
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:44,983
It was an accident for Tokachi.

440
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,592
I found an old book on the university

441
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,794
that explains a little
about the research institute.

442
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,832
First, it was a hospital
for tuberculosis patients.

443
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,269
Then they built an institute
of infectious diseases there.

444
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,439
Then it soon became a national university.

445
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,909
The research institute was there
for only a short while.

446
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,579
Thank you very much.

447
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,850
You can't learn it in just a day or two.

448
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,585
Practice every day.

449
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,021
You can't shave it straight so easily.

450
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,156
Well, you are a fast learner.

451
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,422
Excuse me.

452
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,336
Dr. Kentaro Fukashi. Nice to meet you.

453
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,939
Excuse me.

454
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,878
German?

455
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,290
Excuse me.

456
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,901
<i>The radio said that I could live</i>
<i>and fall in love with humans.</i>

457
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,238

458
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,241
BUS STOP MIKUTAKE
TOKAI BUS

459
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,045
President.

460
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,082
Please come.

461
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,350
What's wrong?

462
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,584
This is horrible.

463
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,188
KILL

464
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,856
Who did such a thing?

465
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,424
Cover it up now.

466
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,592
Yes, sir.

467
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,564
Mikoto?

468
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,774
Welcome back, Mikoto.

469
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,514
Did you do that?

470
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,217
Don't talk to me like that.

471
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,418
Go away.

472
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,819
Let's go home together.

473
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,154
I came to pick you up.

474
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,923
I want to live together
just like we did before.

475
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,859
I want nothing to do with you now.

476
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,160
Go away!

477
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,729
It's too late.

478
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,065
Many people need you.

479
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,868
You never know what they will do
if you don't come with me.

480
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,406
You will cause trouble to them as well.

481
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:59,077
Even if I ran away and hid in jail.

482
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,712
You…

483
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,915
What's wrong, Mikoto? Are you all right?

484
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,617
This is none of your business.

485
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,785
Please go away.

486
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,887
What's wrong, Mikoto?

487
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,823
Did you ask for help
from a person like him again?

488
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,692
I'll kill you.

489
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,161
Wait! Let go.

490
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,729
Wait!

491
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,831
-Let go. I'll kill him!
-It's dangerous. It's too dangerous.

492
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,267
-Be careful you're not killed.
-It's too dangerous.

493
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,535
See you again, Mikoto.

494
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,536
Pack and be ready to leave.

495
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,737
I'll kill you!

496
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,005
Mikoto!

497
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,207
Let it go.

498
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,647
What is it?

499
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,650
What happened to Mikoto?

500
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,120
She tried to kill someone.

501
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,322
-Huh?
-Be quiet, Ken.

502
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,060
Mikoto. Explain it to me.

503
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:56,134
If you think you will kill people,

504
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,970
you should fall in love
to keep from killing.

505
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,672
Shut up!

506
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,808
Don't yell. Ken can't read the situation.

507
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:10,281
Mikoto. Explain why you want to leave.

508
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,819
It's not only your problem.

509
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:26,765
He hit on me in the city
and he was my first date.

510
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,268
We broke up because
he started to become violent.

511
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,470
But he began stalking me.

512
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,974
I told him to leave me alone
so many times.

513
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,744
Then he sold me to some
shady people for money.

514
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,915
So, I ran away from him.

515
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,417
<i>While I was running away from him,</i>

516
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,921
<i>you asked me to come to your house.</i>

517
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,825
<i>I just wanted money.</i>

518
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,830
<i>But you told me to work for him</i>
<i>without asking for anything.</i>

519
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,399
That's how I came here.

520
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,137
Then you have no choice.

521
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,006
Just stay here.

522
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,012
But if I stay here,
you never know what he might do.

523
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,382
Then, why don't you come to my place?

524
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,351
Huh?

525
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,155
My husband has many summer houses.

526
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,859
It's easy to provide a place
for you to hide.

527
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,061
That's a good idea.

528
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,431
I will tell him that you left here.

529
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,967
Hide until things settle down.

530
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,073
You guys are crazy.

531
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,441
Didn't you know that?

532
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,077
Boss will go crazy

533
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:51,082
if my pupils learn to grow up.

534
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,925
Oh, well.

535
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,662
-You're acting like a girl finally.
-Shut up.

536
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,601
In short, have you fallen in love
with the boss, Mikoto?

537
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,535
I'll kill you.

538
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,041
REFERENCE ROOM

539
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,678
Eternal…

540
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,349
EXISTENCE, LIFE, LIVELIHOOD

541
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,085
LIFE ETERNAL

542
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,120
Eternal life…

543
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,458
INANIWA CORPORATION

544
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,466
I will drive Mikoto to Tamara's house.

545
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,834
You take care of my home while I'm gone.

546
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,674
Take care of his home?

547
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,780
Professor, please take a look at this.

548
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,016
This is Dr Kentaro Fukashi's
research paper.

549
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,717
Here is the translation.

550
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,953
Who is he?

551
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,056
He was a doctor of medicine.
Ken said that he was his father.

552
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,058
Where did you find this?

553
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,127
I found it in the forest where Ken lived.

554
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,763
I brought the documents here
that were left in the room.

555
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,233
It's written in German.

556
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,270
This explains about the bacteria
that regenerate dead cells.

557
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,074
He successfully cultured
the bacteria that creates eternal life.

558
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:28,079
ETERNAL LIFE

559
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,216
<i>In order to study the bacteria,</i>

560
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:38,323
<i>I built a secret house deep in the forest.</i>

561
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:45,763
<i>And I successfully cultured the bacteria</i>

562
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,399
<i>that may create eternal life.</i>

563
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,773
Kentaro Fukashi collected all kinds
of bacteria from around the world

564
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,242
and brought them all back to Japan.

565
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:06,384
By culturing those bacteria
and making several cell fusions,

566
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,188
he happened to find
this particular bacterium.

567
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,292
Did he create a new bacterium?

568
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,067
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

569
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,403
Are you alone, Ken?

570
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,805
I am taking care of the house.

571
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,042
Good evening.

572
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,846
Who is he?

573
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,281
Where is Mikoto?

574
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,455
Do you think you can play
with my girlfriend?

575
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,926
Ouch.

576
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,228
Run, Ken!

577
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,863
Run away!

578
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,365
Run away!

579
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,202
Darn you.

580
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,741
Don't look at me like that.

581
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,500
<i>I decided to transplant</i>

582
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,637
<i>the bacteria I found into his dead body.</i>

583
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,512
<i>This bacteria will increase power</i>
<i>by conducting electricity.</i>

584
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,166
<i>But the electricity</i>
<i>that humans can generate</i>

585
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,403
<i>was not enough to bring</i>
<i>his consciousness back to life.</i>

586
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:21,018
<i>I had no choice but to ask God.</i>

587
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,356
<i>With the power of God,</i>

588
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,361
<i>his body cells will regenerate completely.</i>

589
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,307
Wait.

590
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,614
Here you go.

591
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,549
Eat this.

592
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,720
How is this?

593
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,222
-It's electricity.
-Electricity?

594
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,425
The bacteria will regenerate
with lightning.

595
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,884
I got it.

596
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,920
Mental status is electricity too.

597
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,589
Mental status?

598
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:12,029
Human feelings are transmitted
through the body via electrical signals.

599
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,737
His body may release bacteria…

600
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,641
using the power of electricity.

601
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,313
When his emotions are running high,

602
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,282
he may release bacteria.

603
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:01,879
Ken.

604
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,416
What are you worrying about?

605
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:09,987
I…

606
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:15,026
I may kill a human again.

607
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,898
I…

608
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,402
I tried to kill him just now.

609
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,139
I think…

610
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,175
I wanted to kill him.

611
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:42,620
I shouldn't live with humans.

612
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,160
You were just trying
to protect me and Mikoto.

613
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,830
We'd feel the same way as you
in a situation like this.

614
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,400
What you felt was natural as a human.

615
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,770
I…

616
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,041
I felt as you did at that time.

617
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,916
-You felt as I did?
-Yes.

618
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,986
If you want to live

619
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,123
with someone and love someone…

620
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,393
you will hate other people
at the same time.

621
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,431
You became closer to being human.

622
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,635
Became closer to being human.

623
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,777
-Yes?
-It's Tsugumi.

624
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,469
Is it okay if I talk now?

625
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,138
Yes.

626
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,044
Can I talk with Fukashi

627
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,313
…alone?

628
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:21,986
Okay.

629
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,863
I'm sorry to disturb you so late at night.

630
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,573
You asked me if you can live
and love humans.

631
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,477
Yes.

632
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,380
I want to answer your question.

633
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,393
This…

634
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,360
TSUGUMI TSUGARU

635
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,563
You made this for me.

636
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,631
Yes.

637
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:16,674
I'm sorry that I took it
from here without asking you.

638
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,214
I made it for you, Tsugumi.

639
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,253
I'm glad

640
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,123
that you took it.

641
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,364
I've seen this mushroom before.

642
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,970
It was when you saved me in the forest.

643
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,444
I always found these mushrooms…

644
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,414
when you were with me.

645
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,453
An <i>akanarikamitake</i> mushroom?

646
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,122
But why?

647
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,960
What is this mushroom?

648
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,033
They fall off of my body.

649
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,644
I've never thought that

650
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:33,884
this mushroom was weird, dirty, or scary.

651
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,788
I've never thought of it in that way.

652
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:45,162
I think this mushroom is very pretty.

653
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,032
To be honest with you,

654
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,536
I like this mushroom.

655
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,981
If this mushroom is your heart,

656
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:08,886
I think

657
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,456
you can fall in love with a human being.

658
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,294
I think

659
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,231
you can live with a human being

660
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:26,604
because you have a heart.

661
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,773
I think

662
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:34,878
you have many problems…

663
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:40,884
but will you

664
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,887
live with me?

665
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:53,664
Come live in the human world
together with me.

666
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,186
<i>I love you, Tsugumi.</i>

667
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,922
You should draw a line
if you want to be loved.

668
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,891
It's not a matter of love.

669
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,228
I can't help it that I fell in love.

670
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,463
I will raise a revolution.

671
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,031
<i>Watch out, Ken!</i>

672
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:08,966
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
