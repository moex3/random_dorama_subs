1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,505
If this mushroom is your heart,

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,140
I think

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,610
you can fall in love with a human being.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,415
I think

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,952
you can live with a human

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,691
because you have a heart.

7
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:27,961
I think

8
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:33,266
you have many problems to solve…

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,039
but why don't you

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,042
live with me?

11
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,513
Live in the human world

12
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,417
together with me.

13
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,306
MAIN TITLE

14
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,998
<i>Where's Ken? He is not in his room.</i>

15
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,802
He went out with Tsugumi.
She came to see him this morning.

16
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,204
With Tsugumi?

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,508
He said he's decided to live
in the human world with Tsugumi

18
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,277
and learn about humans.
What does that mean?

19
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,346
Why didn't you tell me that?

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,649
There was no point.
I didn't want to disturb them.

21
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,717
What?

22
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,154
I won't help you
just because you are my family.

23
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,057
If you're a man, you'll know what to do

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,261
or you will only lower your value.

25
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,963
You've got the wrong idea.

26
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,999
If you feel lonely, ask Mikoto
if she wants to go out with you.

27
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,301
Don't bother asking me.

28
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,871
She is not interested in me.

29
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,040
-That's not…
-That's not true.

30
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,643
Shut up.

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,745
Never mind.

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,115
But Ken likes that girl, right?

33
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,019
For Ken, it's not a matter
of liking or disliking.

34
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,727
There are many people in the park
on Sunday.

35
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,196
What are they all doing?

36
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,633
Nothing particular.
They're just having fun.

37
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,568
Having fun?

38
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,569
They're families.

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,504
Okay!

40
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,306
They're couples.

41
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,275
They're friends.

42
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,077
They're all having fun in their own way.

43
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,314
What we are doing now
is called taking a walk.

44
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,283
-Taking a walk?
-Yes.

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,685
Taking a walk is fun.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,588
Oh.

47
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,990
Is that dog having fun?

48
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,892
Yes, of course.

49
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,161
He is taking a walk as well.

50
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,831
-Do dogs have fun?
-I guess so.

51
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,139
Are they having fun?

52
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,807
Please don't point at people.

53
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,578
I think they are having fun.

54
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,182
What are they doing?

55
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,953
-They're hugging each other.
-Hugging?

56
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,291
When people are in love,
they hug each other.

57
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,632
Do I have to do that?

58
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,769
No, you don't have to. Let's go.

59
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,174
This is a station.

60
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,776
Are they taking a walk in here?

61
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,912
They are going a longer way.

62
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,616
They take trains to go far.

63
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,852
Train? I want to take a train.

64
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,322
You have to decide the destination first.

65
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,292
-Destination?
-The place where you want to go.

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,061
You'll go missing if you don't decide
on a destination first.

67
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,097
-Missing from home?
-Just kidding.

68
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,832
-Just kidding?
-People laugh because it's funny.

69
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,071
-What is he doing?
-Stop it.

70
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,207
No, I didn't mean it.

71
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,044
My jokes are not funny.
Please stop laughing.

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,879
-Okay.
-Right.

73
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,651
This is a shopping mall.

74
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,020
Is this where people take a walk?

75
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,755
No, they come shopping here.

76
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,892
-Shopping?
-Tell me if you need anything.

77
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,897
You work and earn money, which means
you can buy what you want.

78
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,369
If you didn't bring any money,
I can lend you some.

79
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,974
-This suits you best.
-Yes.

80
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,745
Is there anything that you want, Tsugumi?

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,226
Fly agaric!

82
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,962
Is this what you want, Tsugumi?

83
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,731
Yes. Let me try again.

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,937
Look. I got "Destroying Angel".
Let me try again.

85
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,139
Do you like them so much?

86
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,707
King trumpet mushroom.

87
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,377
I want a young mushroom fruit body.

88
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,283
This is the university
that Seiya and I attend.

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,520
-You came here before, remember?
-Yes.

90
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,356
This is where you study about mushrooms.

91
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,159
That's right. You can learn
many other things too.

92
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,396
-A bicycle.
-Right.

93
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,301
I came here when I was a child.

94
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,570
When you were a child?

95
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,407
<i>My mom brought me here.</i>

96
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>It was the year before she died.</i>

97
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:54,180
Join your hands in prayer
in front of jizo.

98
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,131
My mom brought me here because
she was worried about me.

99
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,101
I have the same disease as my mother.

100
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,405
I don't know why I came here

101
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,307
or why there is a jizo statue
in the university.

102
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,145
But I decided to study at this university

103
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,415
because I remembered
that I came here before.

104
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,188
I'm sorry. I don't think
you understand what I'm saying.

105
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,192
It's okay, even if I don't understand.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,163
It's nice to hear you talking, Tsugumi.

107
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,666
I can't talk well like people
on the radio.

108
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,734
You are more interesting than the radio.

109
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,772
That's the first time anyone's said
I'm interesting.

110
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,608
Your jokes are not funny.

111
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,543
Don't worry about it.

112
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,820
I want to know more about
why you are worried.

113
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,155
Worried?

114
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,124
Like Amakusa?

115
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,028
The radio has really influenced you.

116
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,537
My mother's ancestors
used to live around here.

117
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,874
Ancestors for many generations?

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,208
Yes.

119
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:35,448
They lived here about 120 years ago.

120
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,851
Hundred and twenty years ago.

121
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,926
Is it true that you were here
120 years ago?

122
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,995
Yes. I was in the forest.

123
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,733
My dad told me that
there are 365 days in a year.

124
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,305
I counted every year after he died.
So, I'm sure about my age.

125
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,008
This is the 120th year.

126
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,514
I know that you can't tell a lie.

127
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,985
So, I believe you,
even if it sounds unbelievable.

128
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,088
You can believe me.

129
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,659
I envy you a little bit.

130
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,164
When I came here with my mom,

131
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,301
<i>this tree was in full bloom.</i>

132
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:36,175
<i>But I've never seen it flower</i>
<i>since I started studying here.</i>

133
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,844
Maybe it's dead.

134
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,518
So, every time I come here,

135
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,021
I realize that I will die soon.

136
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,360
I have a heart disease and it's incurable.

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,432
The blood vessels in my head
could block or break any time.

138
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:04,470
My mother too got the disease
at 30 years old and died at 34.

139
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,674
I've had it since I was little
and I could die anytime.

140
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,179
Let's go home.

141
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,566
Okay well I guess this is goodbye for now.

142
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:35,701
Bye.

143
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,504
Tsugumi!

144
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,040
Where have you been?

145
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,011
I took him out for a walk
and we just came back.

146
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,818
She looks sad today.

147
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,256
She is suffering.

148
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,658
Why?

149
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,063
Seiya. I want you to do me a favor.

150
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,898
Open it.

151
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,234
PARADISE HEAVEN

Click here when you want to send
a message.

153
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,543
-Good.
-Why do you like Amakusa?

154
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,081
Amakusa is like me.

155
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,118
He worries about many things

156
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,387
and wants to know many things.

157
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,289
It's just his job.

158
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,660
Job?

159
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,096
It's hard to explain.

160
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,598
<i>Amakusa.</i>

161
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,003
-I thought I was fired.
-No.

162
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,671
Did Tokachi forgive me?

163
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,709
No, but the listeners are on your side.

164

00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,949
LISTENER MESSAGE

166
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:57,850
ALL THE BEST TO FRANKENSTEIN!

167
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,287
I am very sorry about what I've done.

168
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:09,428
I know we tried to make the show more fun.

169
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,864
I was a bit childish.

170
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,100
Do you think that a man
who thinks of himself as a monster

171
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,768
shouldn't fall in love with a human?

172
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,570
I want to tell him something.

173
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,407
If you think you will kill someone,
stay at home and don't go out.

174
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,608
Don't see anyone!

175
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,143
Kill yourself before you do something.

176
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:30,216
I think a monster should love humans.

177
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,219
As I said, I'm glad

178
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,989
that you told me
what you thought in your own words.

179
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,292
Thank you very much.

180
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,561
It was very interesting.

181
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,297
It became a big topic
on the Internet as well.

182
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,633
Why don't you keep it up?

183
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,801
Keep it up?

184
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,705
You should find famous people
and ask their opinions

185
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,174
rather than just do interviews
on the street.

186
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,577
I can't agree with you.

187
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,481
I think Amakusa was not fair.

188
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,350
-Not fair?
-That's enough.

189
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:09,421
He set up Tokachi to make him say
offensive things.

190
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,990
No.

191
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm sure you set up the email as well.

192
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,961
What?

193
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,633
There is no Frankenstein.

194
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,336
You set up the email
and played your own work, right?

195
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,339
-Is that true?
-No.

196
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,709
-We really did get an email.
-Can you prove it?

197
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,180
-She's right. Show me the proof.
-Calm down.

198
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,483
We've got a new email from Frankenstein.

199
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,755
He said thanks
and asked us for more advice.

200
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,523
There is no point in setting this up
for Amakusa.

201
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,625
-Are you sure?
-Look.

202
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,767
It says that Frankenstein
has fallen in love.

203
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,769
I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,114
-Tsugumi.
-Hi.

205
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,684
Are you all right?
I haven't seen you for several days.

206
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,855
I was sick and I couldn't
come to the university.

207
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,924
-Are you all right?
-Yes. I'm fine.

208
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,361
Is it because something
happened on Sunday?

209
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,698
Ken was worried about you.

210
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,466
Ken?

211
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,935
He's worried that he upset you.

212
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,938
There're no such things.

213
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,808
I just…

214
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,813
lose my energy sometimes.

215
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,116
I mean energy to live.

216
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,953
I feel sorry for Ken.

217
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,725
So it's not that he did anything wrong.

218
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,726
No.

219
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,329
-How is Ken doing?
-He's doing all right.

220
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
I want to see him.

221
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,002
I have to say sorry. Is he at work?

222
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,605
-I'll come with you.
-Thanks.

223
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,715
Okay.

224
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,350
Get it here.

225
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,819
Here you go.

226
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,588
I'll put it in here.

227
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,959
Thanks.

228
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,566
Guys.

229
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,769
-Let's take a break.
-Okay.

230
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,738
I made churros today.

231
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,874
-Churros?
-Oh, churros!

232
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,909
-What's that?
-Don't you know about churros?

233
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,344
It's not sushi?

234
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,180
She wants to be popular with the men.

235
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,349
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

236
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,019
-Are you the same?
-You are so nice.

237
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,024
You should draw a line if you
want to attract men's attention.

238
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,627
-Is it good?
-Yes.

239
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,296
-They're delicious.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

240
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,532
-You need sugar.
-Right.

241
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,603
I'm sorry about the other day.

242
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,343
I'm glad to see you again, Tsugumi.

243
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,981
You can see me anytime.

244
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:29,521
<i>If you are worried about something</i>

245
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,626
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

246
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,296
Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

247
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,099
I've received another email

248
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,868
<i>from Frankenstein, who is 120 years old.</i>

249
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,703
-Again?
-They're reading it again.

250
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,573
"Thank you very much for answering
my question last week, which was,

251
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,711
'Should a monster who might kill someone
fall in love with a human or not?'

252
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,280
Thanks to you, I've fallen in love."

253
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,783
<i>That's so quick.</i>

254
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,919
<i>"But she is suffering from</i>
<i>an incurable disease.</i>

255
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:05,457
<i>What should I do to save the life</i>
<i>of the girl I love?"</i>

256
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,459
<i>This is tough.</i>

257
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,330
A monster seems to have found
the girl of his destiny.

258
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,733
Today, I'm visiting
Mr. Toshibumi Tsurumaru,

259
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,369
who is the author of the book
"You Can Change Your Destiny"

260
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,506
and a professor of life science
at Fugaku University,

261
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,842
and ask him this question directly.

262
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,912
-You must be joking.
-Professor.

263
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,349
<i>May I come in, Professor Tsurumaru?</i>

264
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,151
<i>Come in.</i>

265
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,787
First, let me ask you a question.

266
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,557
What can a man do to save
the life of his girlfriend

267
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,026
when she has an incurable disease?

268
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,028
Will you tell us what you think?

269
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,566
Work on her DNA.

270
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,369
-Her DNA?
-Yes.

271
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:58,377
DNA is known as life's blueprint or code.

272
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,948
It not only inherits genetic
information from your parents

273
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,285
but also runs the organs in our body,

274
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:11,657
absorbs nutrition,
and transforms it into energy.

275
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:16,495
But most of the potential work of DNA

276
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,832
is still sleeping in our body.

277
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,470
It is said that DNA is the key

278
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,271
to curing disease.

279
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,940
Professor, please make it short.
We don't have time.

280
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,012
It is the sender of the email
who doesn't have time, not you.

281
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,015
Do you think I can make short
of such an important issue?

282
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,718
<i>What's the point in being brief?</i>

283
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,088
Make her happy. Entertain her.

284
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,726
<i>Make her want to live longer,</i>

285
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,462
<i>so that she can bring out the power.</i>

286
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,466
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>is to wish her to live long.</i>

287
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,036
<i>If you wish it, will it come true?</i>
<i>It sounds like a religion.</i>

288
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>To love someone is to wish</i>
<i>for all the best for the one you love.</i>

289
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,845
<i>Try to make her smile and be happy.</i>

290
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,348
<i>Love is to wish for all the best</i>
<i>for the one you love.</i>

291
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,385
<i>That's how you extract the power</i>
<i>of DNA and the power of life.</i>

292
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,754
<i>So, you should love someone.</i>

293
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,125
<i>Miracles that can't be explained</i>
<i>by science do happen.</i>

294
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,963
Unfortunately, we can't explain
the power of love scientifically.

295
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,836
But you can change the strength
of her DNA if you love her.

296
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,107
In short, do you think
love will create a DNA revolution?

297
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,177
To put it briefly, yes. You are right.

298
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,778
I see.

299
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:45,851
Mr. Frankenstein,
try to make her smile and happy.

300
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,655
Start a revolution
by wishing all the best for her.

301
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,223
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

302
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,625
<i>If you're worried about something</i>
<i>at break time…</i>

303
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,495
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

304
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,096
Okay. It's done.

305
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,967
Professor, thank you. I am so moved.

306
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,402
Thank you.

307
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,672
That was the email
you actually received, right?

308
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,876
-Yes. Why do you ask?
-Nothing.

309
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,012
This is not a fake.
We got this email from a listener.

310
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,514
Good.

311
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,554
<i>Next up is the traffic information.</i>

312
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,924
You sent an email to the radio show.

313
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,328
<i>The speed limit is set to be</i>
<i>30 kilometers per hour.</i>

314
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,830
<i>Please be careful…</i>

315
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,368
I like you, Tsugumi.

316
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,207
I am in love with you.

317
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,578
Will you love me?

318
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,684
I will make you happy.

319
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,654
I will make you smile.

320
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,025
Then you will be able to live longer.

321
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,795
Let's go out for a walk together.

322
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,398
Let's have fun.

323
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,934
Let's wish more.

324
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,270
Don't say such things by yourself.

325
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,342
You can't change things by wishing.

326
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,214
You can't love someone
to make something happen.

327
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,551
I can't love anyone.

328
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,822
I can't be your girlfriend.

329
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,825
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,904
Ken, are you all right?
Don't worry too much.

331
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,509
There are many other women
in this world. Look around.

332
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,010
Leave him alone.

333
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,579
It doesn't help when he is lonely.

334
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,048
Ken. Bear with it.

335
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,418
-We are on your side.
-Let's work together.

336
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,920
Don't let your heart be broken
during break time.

337
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,357
Seiya.

338
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,461
What is this?

339
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,931
What is this feeling?

340
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,634
It's a feeling that can't be
explained by science.

341
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,508
He is like a child.

342
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,545
Leave him alone.

343
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,946
Okay.

344
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,986
<i>Do you think that the man</i>
<i>called Frankenstein really exists?</i>

345
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,955
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

346
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,824
There is no man who is 120 years old.

347
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,327
Isn't this man a fantasy
that Amakusa made up?

348
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,263
<i>Don't say such a thing.</i>

349
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,867
I think he set up the email.
If so, it's a fake show.

350
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,769
How can she say such nonsense?

351
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,103
Don't you think so?

352
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,840
It'll be a big problem if he set it up.

353
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,843
It means that he's fooling the listeners.

354
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,713
I'm sure Amakusa knows better than that.

355
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,948
-Why don't we make sure of the truth?
-How?

356
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,085
<i>Let's ask.</i>

357
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,322
<i>Frankenstein, please call us</i>
<i>for Amakusa's honor.</i>

358
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,757
Give me a break!

359
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,261
I hope that he calls us.

360
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,665
<i>Mr. Frankenstein, we will be</i>
<i>waiting for your call.</i>

361
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,475
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

362
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,043
I'm all right.

363
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:17,522
Did you do the interview
because you knew it was him?

364
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,393
I read the email beforehand.

365
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,931
I'd heard of the name Amakusa.

366
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,302
I realized that it was
his favorite radio program.

367
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,638
Then why did you say such a thing?

368
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,607
Such a thing?

369
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,313
You told him to love someone.

370
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,415
Did he fall in love with you?

371
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,785
I thought so.

372
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,286
Then…

373
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,223
Are you annoyed that he loves you?

374
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,393
How can I love him?

375
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,630
We don't even know how to handle him.

376
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,300
Knowing how his body works
doesn't have any relation to love.

377
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,070
No matter how his body works,

378
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,707
his heart is exactly
the same as a human's.

379
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,641
Don't you think so?

380
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,012
We can't control how he feels in his heart

381
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:20,318
unless we erase his existence,
including his body, from this world.

382
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,787
No way.

383
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,157
I'm not asking you to fall in love.

384
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,394
Since we admit his existence,

385
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,631
we can't ignore his heart.

386
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,946
-Professor.
-Yes?

387
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,415
This is too sweet.

388
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,787
Drink some more, Ken.
Drink and forget it all.

389
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,656
That's what people say.

390
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,425
But the more you drink, the harder
it becomes to forget a lost love.

391
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,061
But you are too young to drink alcohol.

392
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,263
I learned it from my mom.

393
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,732
Mature women tend to drown

394
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,602
in love, alcohol, tobacco, cakes,
and religion, in that order.

395
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,837
That's not true for all women.

396
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,610
A mature man doesn't drink
to forget a lost love.

397
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,780
He drinks to tell himself
that he may forget.

398
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,716
That's the pride of manhood.

399
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,718
-Exactly!
-The pride of manhood?

400
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,254
Men are regretful and become crazy
because they have pride.

401
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,656
Swallow your pride and admit
that you are a loser.

402
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,325
I want to

403
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,394
see Tsugumi.

404
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,930
Well said, Ken!

405
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,367
You are getting drunk.
Maintain your pride.

406
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,437
What should I do to make Tsugumi happy?

407
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,405
You should be grateful, Ken.

408
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,742
I quarrel a lot with my wife,

409
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,111
but the best thing is to be grateful
in the end.

410
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,747
You should be grateful that she exists.

411
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,982
Be grateful.

412
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,284
I don't know if she wants a man
she dumped to be grateful.

413
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,087
Even though your wish wasn't granted,

414
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,522
you can still make her happy
if you are grateful.

415
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,492
How can I be grateful?

416
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,828
-Get her a present.
-Weird.

417
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,131
No. Send an email
and tell her that you are grateful.

418
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,367
-It's easier to ignore.
-Do nothing.

419
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,471
Just wish that her wish will come true.

420
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,339
Don't bother her and wish her
all the best in her life.

421
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,742
That's how you show that you are grateful.

422
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,477
Do you speak from experience?

423
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,614
Today we went out to cheer you up.

424
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,418
<i>To love someone is to wish</i>
<i>for all the best for the one you love.</i>

425
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,323
<i>Try to make her smile and be happy.</i>

426
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,959
<i>Love is to wish for all the best</i>
<i>for the one you love.</i>

427
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,665
Ken is not back yet.

428
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,636
Don't worry. He went out with his friends.

429
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,372
I'm not worried about him.

430
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,742
Does Tsugumi have a disease?

431
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,244
Huh?

432
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,848
Is it true she hasn't long to live?

433
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,917
No, she will.

434
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,186
She has a difficult disease,

435
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,022
but it's not incurable.

436
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,829
Do you still regret that your mom died?

437
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,069
Do you wish to save Tsugumi
for the sake of your mother?

438
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,272
I envy you.

439
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,076
-Because I am popular with girls?
-Because you are so simple.

440
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,312
I can't keep up with you.

441
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,818
<i>I can still hear my mom's voice</i>

442
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,458
-It's ready.
-Let me pull it up.

443
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,761
-Ken, are you ready?
-Yes.

444
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,464
Ken!

445
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,200
Hey!

446
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,636
-Are you all right?
-Ken!

447
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,505
-Call an ambulance.
-Hang in there.

448
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,973
Ken!

449
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,541
INCOMING CALL
INANIWA

450
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,244
Hello?

451
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,780
What?

452
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,117
EMERGENCY ROOM

453
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,886
Do you have any pain?

454
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,256
It's strange. How about here?

455
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,792
Here?

456
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,894
What is that scar on your face?

457
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,901
Did he really fall
from such a great height?

458
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,204
He fell from the top of the third floor,
which is seven to eight meters high.

459
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,507
He doesn't have a single scratch
or bruise.

460
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,710
-Take an X-ray and CT just in case.
-Understood.

461
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,716
Seiya!

462
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,852
Professor! I was about to call you.

463
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,187
How is he?

464
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,588
-He is fine.
-Huh?

465
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,925
He fell from a height
but he has no injuries.

466
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,496
-Tsugumi?
-Haruka.

467
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,932
Professor, this is my sister.

468
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,668
This is Professor Tsurumaru.

469
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,403
It's nice to meet you.

470
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,405
I'm glad that you are well.

471
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,207
-He saved my life.
-What do you mean?

472
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,509
-Nothing.
-Excuse me.

473
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,945
What are you doing?

474
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,246
He seems to be okay.

475
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,882
Is he his family?

476
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,485
He is Professor Tsurumaru,
from my university.

477
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,622
Oh, I've heard a lot about you
from my son.

478
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,457
Ah, I heard that you are a carpenter.

479
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,294
Yes. Just like the famous story of Rakugo.

480
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,371
You will stay at the hospital tonight.

481
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,474
You will sleep in here.
They will worry if we go home too soon.

482
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,509
I have to go now.

483
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,777
Thank you.

484
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,951
How did you fall?

485
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,686
I don't know.

486
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,956
I felt like I saw something.

487
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,125
Saw something?

488
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,063
A jizo statue.

489
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,799
The one we saw together?

490
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,574
-Ken, time to take your temperature.
-Okay.

491
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,283
What is he to you, Tsugumi?

492
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,921
He is my friend, who works
at Seiya's company.

493
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,956
He works for my dad.

494
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,626
I think I've met him before.

495
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,828
-What?
-I think I know Ken Fukashi.

496
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,630
Where did you meet him?

497
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:16,734
I don't know, but I've seen him.

498
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,311
-He is a thief!
-No.

499
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,014
Did you bring him in?

500
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,750
-Are the two of you in love?
-No.

501
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,087
-Tsugumi.
-I have to take his temperature.

502
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,825
It's the same as humans.

503
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,960
Right.

504
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:42,860
KEN FUKASHI
BACTERIA GRANTING ETERNAL LIFE

505
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,130
Professor, why didn't Ken get hurt?

506
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,600
I think his speed of cell regeneration

507
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,304
is much faster than humans.

508
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,774
Here is what Tsugumi got.

509
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,944
It's Dr Kentaro Fukashi's
research records.

510
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,912
What?

511
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,015
Kentaro Fukashi?

512
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,151
Is that Ken's father, who was a doctor?

513
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,453
Yes.

514
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,089
According to this record,
he discovered the bacterium

515
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,625
that can produce eternal life

516
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,830
and injected it into Ken's body.

517
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:25,336
He found that the bacterium
helps other cells to regenerate.

518
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:29,240
It's not the direct work
of the bacterium itself

519
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:35,279
but the work of the DNA of the bacterium.

520
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,981
DNA?

521
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,618
The DNA of the bacterium
changed Ken's DNA

522
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,421
and regenerated his cells.

523
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:48,626
As a result, his body
has a special ability.

524
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,697
His father said that
he found the bacterium

525
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,832
that can give us eternal life

526
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,936
because genetics and DNA
had not been discovered at that time.

527
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,841
It was a time when the electron microscope
hadn't been invented.

528
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,811
Will Ken's cells never die?

529
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,448
Well, we know they last
for at least 120 years.

530
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,052
Then he has to watch everyone,

531
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,789
including the ones he loves, die,

532
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,893
and he will be alone.

533
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,063
It must be tough for him.

534
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,399
It means that he is a monster.

535
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,970
Why?

536
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,809
I can't live long.

537
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,846
He will live long and he can't help it.

538
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,781
What's the difference between us?

539
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,787
Please tell me.

540
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,569
Mr. Ken Fukashi.
Let me take your temperature.

541
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,340
Excuse me.

542
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,980
What's this?

543
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,159
Who are you?

544
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,131
I… I am Ken Fukashi.

545
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,066
This is too weird.

546
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,868
Stay away from my sister!

547
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,504
She is sick and weak.

548
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,275
Tsugumi will die if you are with her.

549
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,044
I have to protect her.

550
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,812
Stay away from Tsugumi!

551
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,817
Don't do anything to Tsugumi!

552
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,000
Is this the same mushroom
that grew on me before?

553
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,503
He is so weird.

554
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,542
I think he did something to me
when I fainted the other day.

555
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,043
Haruka.

556
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,348
He did nothing wrong.

557
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,284
<i>He is always worrying.</i>

558
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,754
He is suffering because of his body.

559
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,789
Tsugumi?

560
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,093
He is the same as me.

561
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,762
Tsugumi!

562
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,090
<i>I think I saw something.</i>

563
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,026
<i>Saw something?</i>

564
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,662
<i>A jizo statue.</i>

565
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,486
Ken.

566
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,890
Tsugumi.

567
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,004
I can't touch humans

568
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,775
because I may kill humans.

569
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,347
So, I can't touch you.

570
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,116
I can't do anything.

571
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,819
I can't even hug you.

572
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:22,893
But I'm in love with you.

573
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:24,995
Is that bad?

574
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,300
Is it bad if I am with you?

575
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,673
I don't know

576
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,876
what love is.

577
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:44,315
It is to love someone and wanting
to be with the one you love.

578
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,751
I think love is more than that.

579
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,921
More than that?

580
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,459
Love is thinking about the one you love

581
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,565
and thinking about what you can do
to help them live long.

582
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,138
I think that's also love.

583
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:12,009
But I'm not confident.

584
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,315
You can't see love.

585
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,453
No microscope can find it.

586
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:30,361
I don't want to think about it
and be in trouble.

587
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,499
I can't live long,

588
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,135
but I don't want to think that it's sad.

589
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,109
It's no use loving someone.

590
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,104
I am grateful

591
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,173
that you exist.

592
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,079
I want you to be happy.

593
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:38,455
I want you to smile and live long.

594
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,625
That's my wish.

595
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,266
I will not let you die.

596
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,470
I will

597
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,041
start a revolution.

598
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,078
Yes.

599
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,443
Amakusa, he's here.

600
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,511
This is Seiya Inaniwa,
a graduate student at Fugaku University.

601
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,748
He works
in Professor Tsurumaru's laboratory.

602
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:39,850
Nice to meet you.

603
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,353
Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

604
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,122
I heard that you are
a friend of Frankenstein.

605
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,191
Yes.

606
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,162
Frankenstein lives in my house.

607
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,286
<i>Ken went to Tokyo.</i>

608
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,454
Do you want to be on the radio with me?

609
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,555
Radio?

610
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,625
I am Frankenstein, and I am 120 years old.

611
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,760
Let's launch an attack.

612
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,229
Thank you so much.

613
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,265
I love you.
