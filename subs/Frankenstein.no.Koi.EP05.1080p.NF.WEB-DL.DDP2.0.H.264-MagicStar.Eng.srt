1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,670
Amakusa, he's here.

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,872
His name is Seiya Inaniwa,
a graduate student at Fugaku University.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,842
He belongs to the laboratory
of Professor Tsurumaru.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,179
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,382
I heard that you are
a friend of Frankenstein.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,850
Yes.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,654
Frankenstein lives in my house.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,301
<i>I heard you ask Frankenstein</i>
<i>to contact you on the radio.</i>

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,004
Thank you for coming.

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,375
What kind of person is Frankenstein?

11
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,646
He is honest. He can't tell a lie.

12
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,314
Can't tell a lie?

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,884
What do you mean?

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,954
I mean it laterally. He has a pure heart.

15
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,123
Do you mean he is naive?

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,325
That's also true.

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,961
-Mr. Inaniwa.
-Yes?

18
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,065
Why did you come to see me?

19
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:09,736
You visited me without telling
Frankenstein, didn't you?

20
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,637
Yes.

21
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,907
-I wanted to know your intention.
-Intention?

22
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:18,044
Frankenstein is a big fan of yours.

23
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,847
What you say is very important to him.

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,752
If he knows that
you are trying to find him,

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,887
I'm sure he'll want to see you.

26
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,356
That's what I'm afraid of.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,758
Why is that?

28
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,028
He will accept your advice
with no protest.

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,565
He may do whatever you say.

30
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,636
Before he knows,
I want to ask you something.

31
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,175
If you want to tease him
as a topic of conversation,

32
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,812
please don't ask him
to contact you on the radio.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,949
That's what I wanted to ask you.

34
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,552
It's even more interesting.
I would love to see him.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,722
-Yes?
-I want to see him. Please.

36
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:12,398
He is a real monster.

37
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,766
Huh?

38
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,969
It's dangerous to see him.

39
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,537
What do you mean?

40
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,439
I can't tell.

41
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,080
You told me that you've seen
this jizou statue before.

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,282
Was it a long time ago?

43
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,023
I don't know.

44
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,660
I just thought that I've seen it before.

45
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,835
Now I want to thank jizou

46
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,371
that I can spend time with you.

47
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:01,948
But your sister worries about you.

48
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,822
Will you see her?

49
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,493
I want her not to worry.

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,229
I want her not to worry, too.

51
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,302
So, don't tell her the truth.

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,904
What do you mean?

53
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,607
Don't tell her that you've lived 120 years

54
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,877
or how you were born.

55
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,479
Is that bad?

56
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:41,721
Usually, people would think
that you are lying.

57
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,923
I don't tell lies.

58
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,926
Please tell a lie.

59
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,096
You have to tell a lie

60
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,865
in order to live in a human world.

61
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,838
I should tell a lie so that
people won't think that I am a liar?

62
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,640
That's right.

63
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,443
You shouldn't make normal people confused.

64
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,311
Confused?

65
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,649
You don't want other people
to worry or be annoyed, do you?

66
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,184
No.

67
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,221
Then we should keep it a secret.

68
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,169
It's an important secret.

69
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,538
Secret?

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,375
OK.

71
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,447
I understand.

72
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,675
His name is Ken Fukashi.

73
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,046
Nice to meet you. I am Ken Fukashi.

74
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,782
I am Kanae, Tsugumi's grandmother.

75
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,018
Are you all better now?

76
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,386
Yes.

77
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,955
I heard about you from Haruka.

78
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,592
As she said, you have a unique atmosphere.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,995
I told you that he is weird.

80
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,897
You are too direct.

81
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,832
But it's true.

82
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,935
Please tell a lie.

83
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,936
Huh?

84
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,572
Your grandmother will be confused.

85
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,207
Don't worry about that.

86
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,710
-You are very interesting.
-Right.

87
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,245
Can I call you Ken?

88
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,482
Yes. Ken is the kanji "study".

89
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,217
May I ask you how old you are?

90
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,219
About 30 years old.

91
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,188
You shouldn't say "about".

92
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,889
Am I wrong?

93
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,059
He thinks that he is about 30.

94
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,462
Because he lived in the mountain
for many years,

95
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,830
he has only a vague memory.

96
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,198
In the mountain?

97
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,400
He has lived in the mountain
without seeing anyone

98
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,335
since he was a child for personal reasons.

99
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,438
Had he been raised by wolves or something?

100
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,775
The Japanese wolf
had already become extinct.

101
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,809
That's not my point.

102
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:22,048
But he catches up with most of
the things from books and the radio.

103
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,250
You had a hard time, didn't you?

104
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,352
It's a secret.

105
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,553
You don't have to say that.

106
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,822
No. It's a secret.

107
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,192
I mean you don't have to say,
"It's a secret" every time.

108
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,262
So he can't even understand
a normal conversation.

109
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,598
I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,500
You are a bit strange, too.

111
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,037
Ken may not know much about the world yet,

112
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,173
but he is very sweet.

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,676
I've never seen a person who
is as nice and honest as him before.

114
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,147
I am honest, but I can tell a lie.

115
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,016
-Keep quiet for a while.
-OK.

116
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,052
Does he know about your disease?

117
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,487
Yes.

118
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:08,027
Will you help Tsugumi?

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,168
Why doesn't he say anything?

120
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,603
You don't have to keep quiet now.

121
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,439
OK.

122
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,244
I will protect her.

123
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,447
Thank you.

124
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,550
But Grandma,

125
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:36,055
Ken has some weird problems
related to mushrooms.

126
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,725
-Mushrooms?
-Harumi. Don't worry.

127
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,163
I can take care of myself.

128
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,832
Don't worry about me.

129
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,636
-OK, Tsugumi.
-Grandma!

130
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,772
We should trust Tsugumi.

131
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,975
Thank you.

132
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,179
Thank you for trusting me.

133
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,054
I'm relieved that they trust us.

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,494
We told a lie because
we want them to trust what we trust.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,028
Right.

136
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,433
It's a fraud when it becomes
money-related.

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,567
Fraud?

138
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,469
Never mind.

139
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,006
It's not about you. You will learn it.

140
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,776
Tsugumi.

141
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,083
Do you think I can be a human
if I tell a lie?

142
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,686
When you lie,

143
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,023
you are not trying to make people
think that you are a human.

144
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:50,162
Sometimes you lie of your own volition
not intending to hurt people.

145
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,232
Sometimes you lie
because you care about others.

146
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,503
Care…

147
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,073
What's for dinner?

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,441
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

149
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,978
Really? How nice!

150
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,313
Both of us…

151
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,719
Let's go home.
They will be waiting for you.

152
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,021
Yes.

153
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,327
-Did you get quite well?
-Yes.

154
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,463
My sister helped him
with the hospital discharge.

155
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,932
That's good.

156
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,667
This is for him, Boss.

157
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,202
OK. Here you are.

158
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,606
This is your salary for this month.
Thanks for your hard work.

159
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,308
It's money.

160
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,578
Money? Fraud?

161
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,447
No, it's not. It's your salary.

162
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,249
It's the money you earned.

163
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,585
My money.

164
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,853
SALARY - APRIL 2017 - KEN FUKASHI

165
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,856
Thank you very much.

166
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,859
It's not bad to pay cash in hand.

167
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,597
President Inaniwa,
thank you for taking care of Ken.

168
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,231
OK.

169
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,200
Did you make up with him already?

170
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,069
We didn't get in a fight.

171
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,004
But you started
a break-up conversation during work.

172
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,073
It wasn't a break-up conversation.

173
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,241
Are you still
not getting together with him?

174
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,678
Was it nothing but Ken's
one-sided confession?

175
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,148
You turned him down once,
but you changed your mind?

176
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,018
We were talking about
the radio program at that time.

177
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:19,919
Radio?

178
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,355
It's Ken's favorite radio program.

179
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,923
<i>Ask Amakusa--</i>

180
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,358
I'm not asking him anything!

181
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:31,364
"After rain comes fair weather."

182
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,798
What are you talking about?

183
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,100
Hi, Seiya.

184
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,535
-You were released from the hospital.
-Yes, I was.

185
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,504
I wanted to ask you something.
Let's go to your room.

186
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,974
Hey, eat dinner with us.
You can talk with him here.

187
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,110
It has something to do with Ken's privacy.

188
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,213
Ken is my employee.
He is a member of the Inaniwa family.

189
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,447
Don't go behind my back.

190
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,683
Dinner is getting cold.

191
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,019
-All right, then.
-Are you OK?

192
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,520
It's not something that I should hide.

193
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:58,457
Thank you for working hard
for me today. Let's eat.

194
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,060
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

195
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,896
So, what is your question?

196
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,733
Eat first. Don't be persistent.

197
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,536
I'm not persistent.

198
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,605
Amakusa is trying to find Ken.

199
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,273
-What?
-Amakusa?

200
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,441
Who is Amakusa?

201
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,942
<i>Ask Amakusa--</i>

202
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,378
You just told me that.
You are so persistent!

203
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,312
What do you mean?

204
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,715
He said he wanted to see Ken on the radio.

205
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,750
More precisely, he wanted
to see Frankenstein.

206
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,385
Who is Frankenstein?

207
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,854
I told you that it's private.

208
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,557
Keep quiet if you don't understand
what I'm saying.

209
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,094
OK. I will play a quiet game from now.

210
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,998
Is Amakusa trying to find me?

211
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,701
Yes. So, I went to see him today.

212
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,035
Why did you see him?

213
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,071
I can't just take Ken there.

214
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,072
Did you see him?

215
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,208
Wait. Why did you go see him
instead of Ken?

216
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,845
What if Ken wants to see Amakusa?

217
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,213
I want to see him.

218
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,450
-Look!
-See? That's because you told him.

219
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,819
Stop creating unnecessary conflict.

220
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,886
I'm not starting a quarrel.

221
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,089
Yes, you are. Right?

222
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:03,989
Quiet game.

223
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,927
Ken will decide who to see.
You are so persistent.

224
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,863
You are saying it in the wrong way.

225
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't worry.

226
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,904
Tsugumi.

227
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,275
We should care about others.
I can see him if I care about him.

228
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,580
You are right.

229
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,516
Care about others?

230
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,018
What's that?

231
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,421
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

232
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,791
I just asked about his intention.

233
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,426
His intention?

234
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,129
I told Amakusa not to see Ken
if he wanted to tease him.

235
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,099
You didn't tell him strange things,
did you?

236
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,734
Strange things?

237
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,773
He is a real monster.

238
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,941
It's dangerous to see him.

239
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,410
Of course not.

240
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,945
He won't believe me,
even I told him the truth.

241
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,647
I know.

242
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm worried about you, Tsugumi.

243
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:09,421
It's dangerous to go with him.

244
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,523
Don't you remember?

245
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,793
Yes. That's why I'm worried about him.

246
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,530
It's dangerous for you to have
too much concern with him.

247
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,533
Do you have feelings for him?

248
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,469
I just want to help him.

249
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,237
Same here.

250
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,741
But I want to protect you more than that.

251
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,011
That's how I feel,
and I want you to remember that.

252
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,853
LISTEN TO AMAKUSA

253
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,822
Amakusa, let's ask him
to come to the radio.

254
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,789
What?

255
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,693
It will be a big topic on the Internet
if Frankenstein shows up.

256
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,395
The listeners will get excited
if he shows up.

257
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,798
Or people will think that it's a fake.

258
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,568
But it's not fun if he is not
an interesting person.

259
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,208
MONDAY TO FRIDAY
13:00 - 16:00

260
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,647
-Amakusa?
-I'm Iizuka.

261
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,217
Hi, Iizuka.

262
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,518
Can we talk?

263
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,752
Come in.

264
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,257
-Amakusa is coming.
-Amakusa?

265
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,994
-He is coming to see me.
-I will go home soon.

266
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,732
Ken. I want you to do me a favor.

267
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,234
Favor?

268
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,971
Please lend me some money.

269
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,639
Money?

270
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,408
I want you to lend me some money.

271
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,277
Why?

272
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,446
My mother is ill.

273
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,581
Ill?

274
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,318
She hasn't paid for insurance,
so it costs a lot of money.

275
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,654
Will she get well?

276
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,389
Yes. If she has money.

277
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,325
All right.

278
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,530
Here you are.

279
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,201
Will you lend me everything?

280
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,903
Yes. Please help her get better.

281
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,537
Thank you very much.

282
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,708
Thank you. I promise that
I will pay your money back.

283
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,712
Will you please keep it a secret?

284
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,948
Secret?

285
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,519
Do you want me to tell a lie?

286
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,723
To be straight with you, yes.
Boss will worry if he knows. Please.

287
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,725
All right.

288
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,028
Thank you very much.

289
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,363
I appreciate it.

290
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,266
Thank you.

291
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,941
Iizuka.

292
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,010
-What did you need from Ken?
-No…

293
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,478
I just lent him some comic books.

294
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,449
I have to go back to work.

295
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,090
-Amakusa!
-I'm not Amakusa.

296
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,225
Is it you, Mikoto?

297
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,194
I am your senior.

298
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,395
What's up?

299
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,665
I saw Iizuka just now.
What did he want from you?

300
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,869
Did he lend you some comic books?

301
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,472
No. I didn't get anything from him.

302
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,575
I knew it was a lie.

303
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,544
Iizuka told me a lie.

304
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,546
It was not a lie but a secret.

305
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,047
Whichever.

306
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,618
You lent him money, didn't you?

307
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,121
It's a secret.

308
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,090
I knew it.

309
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,627
Please don't tell anyone
because we don't want Boss to worry.

310
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,101
Hi, Seiya.

311
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,670
I came by myself as I promised.

312
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,738
Hi.

313
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,942
Let's go then.

314
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,980
Hi, Tsugumi.

315
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,784
This is Mr. Amakusa.

316
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,587
Nice to meet you. I'm Junpei Amakusa.

317
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,988
Hi, I am Tsugumi Tsugaru.

318
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,060
Are you Frankenstein's girlfriend?

319
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,731
He just likes her. It's a one-way street.

320
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,000
-Oh, really?
-Well…

321
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,468
He's looking forward to seeing you.

322
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,138
Excuse me.

323
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,406
Just a second.

324
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,416
How are you feeling today?

325
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,917
I'm fine.

326
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,187
I wish that his wish will come true.

327
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:41,126
Why are you interested in him?

328
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,562
I don't know the reason.

329
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,799
When I first saw his email,

330
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,070
he said that he was a monster
and he might kill a human.

331
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,641
I thought that he wasn't serious,
but I couldn't ignore him.

332
00:17:55,707 --> 00:18:00,612
Seiya told me that Frankenstein
can't tell a lie. Is that true?

333
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,614
Mr. Amakusa.

334
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,515
Amakusa!

335
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,450
Oh!

336
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,418
Amakusa!

337
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,820
Hi, Frankenstein.

338
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,255
-It's a nickname for the radio.
-Yes.

339
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,158
My name is Ken Fukashi.

340
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,761
-Ken Fukashi.
-Yes!

341
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,764
I am glad to meet you, Amakusa.

342
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,633
Ken, this is not the radio.
Call him Mr. Amakusa.

343
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,569
It's OK.

344
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,505
Nice to meet you. I am Junpei Amakusa.

345
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,774
Thank you for listening to my program.

346
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:33,378
Thank you for worrying about
many things, Mr. Amakusa.

347
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,417
Do you work here?

348
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,751
Yes.

349
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,222
-How old are you?
-I'm 30.

350
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,624
Come on.
You are 120 years old, aren't you?

351
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,259
No.

352
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,196
I care about others.

353
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,835
It's nothing. He is joking.

354
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,638
I didn't get it.

355
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,174
But I'm glad that you met Tsugumi.

356
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,476
It's all thanks to you.

357
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,213
Would you like to go out for a walk?

358
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,083
Sure. Let's take a walk.

359
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,551
-That's a good idea.
-OK.

360
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,124
MITSUKI

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,835
SALARY - APRIL 2017 - KEN FUKASHI

362
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,608
Wait, Mitsuki. Would you like some beer?

363
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,988
How dare you!

364
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,823
Did you live in that mountain?

365
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,327
Yes. I have been living alone
for a long while.

366
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,531
Did you live in the forest
and think that you were a monster?

367
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,069
Well, I was more like a plant
than a monster.

368
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,904
-A plant?
-Yes.

369
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,707
I see.

370
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,043
Did you think that you might kill people

371
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,612
although you thought that
you were like plant?

372
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,484
I didn't know people until I met Tsugumi.

373
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,855
Did you meet Tsugumi in the forest?

374
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:24,890
Yes.

375
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,461
I go to the forest often
for my research at the university.

376
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:35,033
Tsugumi taught me to live with humans.

377
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,669
And Seiya, too.

378
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,573
You have a very unusual background.

379
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,444
Whitebait sushi is delicious.

380
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,814
It's nice to live by the sea.

381
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,454
Do you like it?

382
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,789
Yes.

383
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,958
This is shrimp.

384
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,961
Shrimp? Is that fish?

385
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,429
It's a kind of shellfish.

386
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,665
Shellfish.

387
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,867
Is this your first time to see fish?

388
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,902
No.

389
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,107
Pacific saury, tuna,
sun-dried horse mackerel.

390
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,242
He eats them at my house.

391
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,679
Mr. Amakusa is asking
if this is your first time

392
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,347
to see live fish, not cooked fish.

393
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,482
Look.

394
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,056
Is that the same as this one?

395
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,859
Did someone kill the fish?

396
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,828
No. That's not how you say it.

397
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,030
Is that a secret?

398
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,701
Don't you want to be his girlfriend,
Tsugumi?

399
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,735
Huh?

400
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,870
Is that a secret?

401
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,672
Let's not talk about that.

402
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,274
That's a different story.

403
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,879
But it was Tsugumi who took
Ken out from the mountain.

404
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,580
Yes.

405
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,986
If Ken had really grown up in a forest
without knowing the world,

406
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,989
you took on a big burden, didn't you?

407
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,959
Or did you take him
out of the forest from curiosity?

408
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,296
I just wanted to save him.

409
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,831
Save him?

410
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,003
What do you think you should do
to save him?

411
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,473
That's what we are figuring out together.

412
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,611
I think Ken just wants to be with you.

413
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,113
What do you say, Tsugumi?

414
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,148
Please stop.

415
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,785
Sorry. I can't help talking
as if it was a radio program.

416
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,655
It's not just that I want to be with her.

417
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,625
I want to make Tsugumi happy.

418
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,797
You told me that it is how
we love people on the radio.

419
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,067
-You are right.
-Yes.

420
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,673
-Thank you for the lunch.
-Thank you for the lunch.

421
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,574
You are welcome.

422
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,509
Thank you.

423
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,813
May I talk with Ken in private?

424
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,115
What?

425
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,351
I want to talk with Ken. Is that not OK?

426
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,986
Well, it's not bad.

427
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,289
Ken will decide what he wants.

428
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,093
Ken, can we talk in private?

429
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,329
-Yes.
-Good.

430
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,869
-OK. Let's go.
-Yes.

431
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:33,979
I don't think Mr. Amakusa
will cause him any trouble.

432
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,351
I think Ken is having fun
to widen his view of the world.

433
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,287
He is with us not just because
he wants to be with me.

434
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,426
He learned how to tell a lie.

435
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,698
He can tell a lie because he is honest.

436
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,901
It's different from how we lie.

437
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,743
Is this your first time to see the sea?

438
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,679
I've never seen it so close.

439
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,615
Why did you decide to leave the mountain

440
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,618
and go to the city with Tsugumi?

441
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,623
She wanted to get to know me.

442
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,194
What did she know about you?

443
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,931
She knew that I know nothing.

444
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,800
How about you?
What did you know about Tsugumi?

445
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,970
About her disease?

446
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,240
You fell in love with her
because she has a tough life?

447
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,876
-No.
-How?

448
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,280
I can only say that it's not how I feel.

449
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,416
You really can't tell a lie.

450
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,684
Yes, I can.

451
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,619
It's OK. You don't have to deny it.

452
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,023
I want to tell you my story.

453
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:59,331
I was brought up in a northern town
by the sea.

454
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,802
I had a friend who was also
brought up in the same town.

455
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,238
A female friend.

456
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,672
Friend?

457
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,276
There was a time that
she was my girlfriend.

458
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,612
Did you fall in love?

459
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:18,216
We moved to Tokyo together
to become musicians.

460
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,818
They make and play music.

461
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,921
<i>It's time for you and I…</i>

462
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,422
That's right.

463
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,559
-We were very serious, the two of us.
-Oh okay.

464
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,095
But we couldn't become popular.

465
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,031
She was always cheerful.

466
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:39,404
I started to doubt
why she was always cheerful.

467
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,906
I started blaming her and thought

468
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,309
that we wouldn't become popular
because of her character.

469
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,081
I started taking apart from her.

470
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,651
She called me many times,

471
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,121
but I ignored her
and thought that it was a bother.

472
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,458
Although I asked her
to come to Tokyo with me,

473
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,396
I left her alone in the end.

474
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,233
Then…

475
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,803
She killed herself because of me.

476
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,638
Do you understand what I'm saying?

477
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,141
Yes.

478
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:22,614
I knew nothing about how she felt.

479
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,285
That's what humans are like.

480
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,989
No matter how much you love her,

481
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,059
you won't understand
what she really thinks…

482
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,062
if you are not doing the right thing.

483
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,833
You know nothing about humans yet.

484
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,803
Neither about Tsugumi.

485
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,306
You are like me.

486
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,315
I quit singing after she died.

487
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,885
I tried hard to get a job
as a radio personality.

488
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,623
So, I wonder every day on the radio.

489
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:10,161
I'm trying so hard to know about humans.

490
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,036
Ken.

491
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,372
Would you like to go on the radio with me?

492
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,476
Let's go on the radio

493
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,747
and try to understand humans.

494
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,290
You have to open your heart wide

495
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,393
to know more about Tsugumi.

496
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,531
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

497
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,101
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

498
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,339
<i>Ask Amakusa if you are worried</i>

499
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,743
<i>About something</i>

500
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,056
Welcome back.

501
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,458
Welcome back.

502
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,193
I'm home.

503
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,562
Ken.

504
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:19,731
Can we talk?

505
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,507
Hi, Ken.

506
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,912
Hey, ask him.

507
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,883
Did you lend Iizuka money?

508
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,023
You asked him to keep it a secret
for Boss's sake.

509
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,257
For my sake?

510
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,625
How much did you lend him?

511
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,297
You can tell us now.

512
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,972
I gave him my salary.

513
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,107
All of it?

514
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:06,311
It happened before
when you started working with us.

515
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,445
You tried to steal the company's money.

516
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,114
Mikoto, it's done.

517
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,483
No! It isn't done.
That's why it happened again.

518
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:17,355
His mother is still taking money from him.

519
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,558
-His mother?
-She has nothing to do with this.

520
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,295
His mother is ill.

521
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,100
She will get well if she has money.

522
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,802
It's a lie.

523
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,540
What does it mean, Iizuka?

524
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,008
Ken.

525
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,911
You were deceived.

526
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,246
Please stop.

527
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,151
I will pay you back. So it's OK, right?

528
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,053
No, it's not.

529
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,459
-Break off relations with your mom.
-Mikoto! That's too much.

530
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,461
He will do the same thing otherwise.

531
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,202
We'll all go and check
if you return the money to Ken.

532
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,312
I feel like we are making a raid.

533
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,782
Yes, we are. Like the movie.

534
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,162
BAR MITSUKI

535
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,997
Hello.

536
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,236
Hey, Mitsuki.

537
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,352
Excuse me.

538
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,989
I want my money back.

539
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,758
Money?

540
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,761
What is that, Mitsuki?

541
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,563
I haven't seen you for a while.

542
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,132
Hello, Boss.

543
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,201
-How are you doing?
-Hello, Boss.

544
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,370
You haven't come to see me recently.

545
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,839
I missed you.

546
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,574
-Hi, there.
-Do you come here often?

547
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,443
I just came to check on his family.

548
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,311
Would you like to sing at karaoke?

549
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,446
-Not today.
-Why not?

550
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,481
I am their boss.

551
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,984
Please have a seat, everyone.

552
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,554
I'm glad to have so many guests.

553
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,822
What would you like to drink?

554
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,423
We just want you to return the money.

555
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,227
Return the money to your son.

556
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,295
Mikoto. Calm down.

557
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,429
What is it?

558
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,166
Your son deceived someone
to bring money to you.

559
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,969
Don't use your son to give money to a man.

560
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,305
Stop it. It's not my mom's fault.

561
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,775
She will never change
if you say such a thing.

562
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,511
She has to depend on men to live.

563
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,413
You are the same as my mom.

564
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,515
I'm not the same.

565
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,751
-Then show us.
-Hey!

566
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,820
-Calm down. Don't cause Iizuka trouble.
-You're causing trouble.

567
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:07,659
Iizuka, you told me that
you had been having a hard time.

568
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,728
It's my mom who is having a hard time.

569
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,631
-Because of me.
-You're the one who broke your back.

570
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,000
You have a good son.

571
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,736
Your patience was rewarded.

572
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,439
Just give him the money.

573
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,007
I will pay him back.

574
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,710
I'm sorry, Ken.
I promise you that I will pay.

575
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,245
Did he borrow money from you?

576
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:32,116
I am not the right person to ask you this,
but please trust him.

577
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,521
He is like my father.

578
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,057
Like your father? He?

579
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,960
Because he taught you how to fight?

580
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,329
You dropped out of high school.

581
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,497
You have been working for him.

582
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,233
What are you? Are you a teacher?

583
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,602
I am his friend.

584
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,772
All of us here are his friends.

585
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,676
You told me that
you wanted to be a carpenter

586
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,646
and live freely without being
involved with anyone.

587
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:07,919
Somehow, I started living freely.
I'm sure you can do it.

588
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,961
You are working hard.
Not give money to this man, is it?

589
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,300
Mitsuki. Come and drink with me.

590
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,470
No. You will drink with us.

591
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,671
Iizuka!

592
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,172
Mitsuki!

593
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,343
Why don't you quit a stupid job like this?

594
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,613
-What did you just say?
-Hey!

595
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,684
Let's get a horse
and you go on a trip with me.

596
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,185
Right?

597
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,295
Ken.

598
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,438
What are you doing? You look strange.

599
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,111
Did you say thank you to Iizuka?

600
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:14,152
He said thank you when
he borrowed money from me.

601
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,588
He said it repeatedly.

602
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,924
It might have been a lie,

603
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,660
but he cares about others.

604
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,430
He cares about me.

605
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,965
Do you care about him?

606
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,768
Did you thank him?

607
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,382
Thank you for your advice.

608
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,688
Aren't you going to thank him?

609
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,426
Thank you very much.

610
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,099
-Please stop!
-Get away from me.

611
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,559
Ken!

612
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,297
No!

613
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,534
No!

614
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,174
I'm OK. Calm down.

615
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,913
I love you.

616
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,516
I love you so much.

617
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,626
It's true.

618
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,897
I love you.

619
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:20,144
So bear with it for my sake.

620
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,848

622
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,971
How dare you!

623
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:55,179
-Stop it, Iizuka!
-You bastard!

624
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,796
You can have it!

625
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,186
I am very sorry.

Thank you very much.

629
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,065
I appreciate it. It's not a lie.

630
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,739
Please let me work with you.

631

Let's work hard together, Iizuka.

632
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:09,920

Let's go and sing together.

00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,504
-You sing first today.
-OK.

639

641
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,357
No worries.

Thank you.

643
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,180

Oh.

I didn't know that there was

It was just before she died.

659
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,504
Do you know why she did that?

660
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,577
I think Saki built this.

661
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,113
Is Saki the woman who passed away
because of white mushrooms?

662
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:55,286
Yes. I told you that there used to be
a laboratory near your university.

663
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,988
There was an institute
for infectious diseases.

664
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:58,923
Yes.

665
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,526
Saki had something to do with it.

666
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:07,064
I heard that she built the jizou
for the patients.

667
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,069
You told me that you've seen
this jizou before, didn't you?

668
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,138
Was it a long time ago?

669
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,340
I don't know.

670
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,543
I just thought that I had seen it.

671
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,480
I think

672
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:28,252
your mom wanted to
ask Saki to take care of you.

673
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,464
It's a rare mushroom.

674
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,872
I wonder what kind of person
Saki really is.

675
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,382
Hi. How are you?

676
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,753
Professor.

677
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,957
Ken might have lived here before.

678
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,626
Here?

679
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:15,733
He might have had an infectious disease
and came here 120 years ago.

680
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,538
This might be where he met
Dr Kentarou Fukashi.

681
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,706
As a patient and a doctor?

682
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,643
Maybe he had gone through
an experiment on a human body.

683
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,047
Tsugumi. I have a problem.

684
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,816
-Ken seems to have gone to Tokyo.
-Tokyo?

685
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,852
Amakusa came to pick him up.

686
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,692
<i>Tsugumi. I have a problem.</i>

687
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,562
-<i>Ken seems to have gone to Tokyo.</i>
-<i>Tokyo?</i>

688
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,932
<i>He told Amakusa that</i>
<i>he wanted to go on the radio.</i>

689
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,442
Hi. My name is Ushiku. I am a director.

690
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,711
I am Ken Fukashi.

691
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,381
You don't have to use
your real name from now on.

692
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,516
Please use your nickname.

693
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,952
OK.

694
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,354
I want to show your watch to everyone.

695
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,222
-Right?
-What do you say?

696
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,191
It's almost three o'clock.

697
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,027
Let's call SNACK MAN.

698
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,462
Where is he today?

699
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,967
Hello. I am here. It's Junpei Amakusa.

700
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,539
PARADISE HEAVEN

701
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,308
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

702
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,112
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

703
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,849
<i>If you are worried about something</i>

704
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:44,421
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

705
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,890
In response to Tokachi
and Ririe's request,

706
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,258
I brought him here today.

707
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,465
Here is Frankenstein.

708
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,400
You must be joking.

709
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:00,104
Are you Frankenstein?

710
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,208
<i>Yes.</i>

711
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,747
I am Frankenstein. I am 120 years old.

712
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,721
My wish is to protect her.

713
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,857
<i>Are you trying</i>
<i>to cause trouble on purpose?</i>

714
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,459
I didn't know what would happen.

715
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,696
<i>He said that everyone calls him a monster.</i>

716
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,899
Go for it! Go for it!
