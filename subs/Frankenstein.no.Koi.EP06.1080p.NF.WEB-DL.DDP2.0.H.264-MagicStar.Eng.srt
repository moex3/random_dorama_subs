1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,638
-<i>Ken went to Tokyo.</i>
-<i>Tokyo?</i>

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,541
<i>He told Amakusa that he wanted to</i>
<i>go on the radio.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,211
It's almost three o'clock.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,482
Let's call SNACK MAN. Where is he today?

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,986
Hello. I am here. I am Junpei Amakusa.

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,558
PARADISE HEAVEN

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,328
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,132
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,902
<i>If you are worried about something</i>

10
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,441
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,877
In response to Tokachi
and Ririe's request,

12
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,378
I brought him here today.

13
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,786
This is Frankenstein.

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,655
You must be joking.

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,426
Are you Frankenstein?

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,265
Yes. I am Frankenstein.
I am 120 years old.

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,467
Ken is now on the radio.

18
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,501
-Wow.
-It's starting.

19
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,337
<i>-Is this the place called radio?</i>
-Finally.

20
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,340
Yes, this is a studio
in the radio station.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,142
You are so cool.

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,546
Frankenstein, you are good-looking.

23
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,348
I'm obsessed with him.

24
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,784
<i>He is good-looking, isn't he?</i>

25
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,953
<i>Come and sit next to me.</i>

26
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,690
<i>So, what are you going to do in here?</i>

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,592
<i>Hey, you asked him to come.</i>

28
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,893
Not me, you did.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,229
Ask him anything.

30
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,197
If you are worried about something,

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,599
-please ask Frankenstein.
-Oh…

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,802
Do you want us to tell him
what we are worried about?

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,803
Yes.

34
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,340
<i>-Ask Frankenstein</i>
-Ask Frankenstein…

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,241
Let's do that today.

36
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,577
Franken… It's a long name.

37
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,279
-Can I call you Franken?
-OK.

38
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:58,718
I want to ask you something.

39
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:03,923
Are you mad at me, Franken?

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,359
No, I'm not.

41
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,328
I said that you should kill yourself

42
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,697
if you think that you are a monster
who will kill someone.

43
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:16,836
First of all, why did you say
that you may kill someone?

44
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,974
Because I am weak.

45
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,542
Weak?

46
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,413
Yes. I have no confidence in myself.

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,583
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>Sometimes I want to kill Tokachi.</i>

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,684
<i>Why?</i>

49
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,820
-<i>I have no confidence in myself either.</i>
-<i>That's because you're mad at me.</i>

50
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,624
What kind of person do you think you are?

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,893
-What kind of person?
-Yes.

52
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,031
I am not human.

53
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,596
<i>I was born in a deep forest.</i>

54
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,497
Stop it, Ken.

55
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,067
<i>I died once.</i>

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,538
<i>My father was a doctor of medicine.</i>

57
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,241
<i>He raised me from the dead 120 years ago.</i>

58
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,910
What is Ken talking about?

59
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,346
He is joking, but it's not fun.

60
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,850
OK.

61
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,321
-You can go now. Thank you.
-Then what happened?

62
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,455
Do you want him to continue?

63
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,658
I left the forest after I met someone.

64
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,961
<i>Did you fall in love with a human?</i>

65
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,097
-<i>Yes.</i>
-<i>You can go now.</i>

66
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,868
<i>What kind of person is she?</i>
<i>You said that she was very sick.</i>

67
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,270
<i>Yes.</i>

68
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,841
<i>She is sick but very strong.</i>

69
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,411
She is strong and kind.

70
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,584
I am the opposite.

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,057
<i>So, I want to be strong and kind like her.</i>

72
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,595
But I can't.

73
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,368
<i>I didn't know anything about humans.</i>
<i>I didn't understand anything.</i>

74
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,271
Although I am 100 years older than her…

75
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,339
I know nothing.

76
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:42,915
So, I want to ask people
who are listening to the radio.

77
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,720
How can I learn about humans?

78
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,224
How can I be strong?

79
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,828
Humans can change
by thinking about what to do.

80
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,197
Amakusa told me so.

81
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:07,473
I am worried about whether
I can protect her or not.

82
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,413
<i>I want to live with her</i>
<i>in the human world.</i>

83
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,584
So, I need to know more about humans.

84
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,855
I want to change more.

85
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,028
<i>Dear listeners.</i>

86
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:33,633
Please tell Frankenstein
how he can be more human.

87
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,034
See you tomorrow.

88
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,437
If you are worrying about
something during snack time…

89
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,907
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

90
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,445
Ken doesn't know who he is.

91
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,282
I wish he could get his memory back.

92
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,551
How can he recover from memory loss?

93
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,819
How about giving him a terrible shock?

94
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,688
Like getting lightning strikes
or slipping?

95
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,090
He slipped and fell, but he was all right.

96
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,660
But not everyone has a happy past.

97
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,329
Who are you?

98
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,366
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

99
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,268
Thank you. It was really good.

100
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,536
Amakusa.

101
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,206
Is this what you want?

102
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,074
I don't know why you brought
this man here.

103
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,811
-Why are you sticking to this topic?
-Don't get too excited.

104
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,781
Actually, you are sticking
to this topic, Tokachi.

105
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,851
It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,486
We've brought it to an end, anyway.

107
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,388
I don't think so.

108
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,623
He made my radio show confused.

109
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,994
Amakusa.
Do you really think that this is fun?

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,431
It is the listeners who decide
if it is fun.

111
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,667
-What did you say?
-It was OK.

112
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,370
Let's wait for the listeners' response.

113
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,078
Let's take a picture
and post it on the website.

114
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,048
I think Franken is good-looking.

115
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,584
-Do you think so?
-Let me take a picture.

116
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,520
Please look here and smile.

117
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,422
Ken, look over there.

118
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,691
OK? Say cheese.

119
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,661
Thank you.

120
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,268
He is very smart.

121
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,971
He knows how the radio works.

122
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,042
He talked on the radio,
not because he couldn't lie

123
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,878
but because he knew
that he didn't have to lie.

124
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,449
Do you think he acted as he planned?

125
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,718
He's got a high social adaptability
in such a short time

126
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,925
because he realized that he loved someone.

127
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,400
Do you think he can live
as a normal human this way?

128
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
I don't know.

129
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,772
The risk is getting higher.

130
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,510
He releases bacteria when he gets excited.

131
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,447
As he gets more complex emotions,

132
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,451
we never know when and how
he will release bacteria.

133
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,825
Hi, Ken.

134
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,397
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

135
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,999
Did you come back by yourself?

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,735
Amakusa told me how to.

137
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,972
-Let's go home.
-Yes.

138
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,775
Did you have fun?

139
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,278
Yes, I did.

140
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,182
Why did you want to go on the radio?

141
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,653
Because I want to know more about Tsugumi.

142
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,024
I have to learn more about humans.

143
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,761
Did someone tell you to do that?

144
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,098
No. I want to do it.

145
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,740
I didn't understand
what you said on the radio,

146
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,843
but I'm glad you did well. Cheers.

147
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,711
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

148
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,614
Thank you very much.

149
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,117
But why did you make up that character?

150
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,752
You said that you were 120 years old.

151
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,620
Frankenstein,
who was raised from the dead.

152
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,822
It's the same character
as His Excellency Demon.

153
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,092
Ken Fukashi and Franken sound similar.

154
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,329
That's why I named him
Frankenstein as a nickname.

155
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,698
-I see.
-That's just like you.

156
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,267
That's how he played that character.

157
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,137
What did you think, Tsugumi?

158
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,206
He confessed his love to you on the radio.

159
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,113
"I left the forest
because I fell in love with a human."

160
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,649
-Are you mimicking Ken?
-Yes.

161
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,952
He is annoying.

162
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,388

-Are you mimicking Tetsuya?
-"I am 100 years older than her,

164
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,595
but I can't be a human.

165
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:00,032
-But I love her."
-Nice.

166
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,903
Shut up. You just like dirty jokes.

167
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,806
Don't talk to me like that.

168
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,342
But you are right, Mikoto.

169
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,077
Tsugumi may be worried about something.

170
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:15,281
Ken wants to cheer her up.
Don't make fun of them.

171
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,083
You should be careful.

172
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,519
Don't worry. I'm fine, as you can see.

173
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,254
Please don't worry about me.

174
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,892
I will protect Tsugumi.

175
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,629
-Oh!
-Oh!

176
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,198
-Shut up!
-Oh!

177
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,667
-You guys are so noisy.
-Let's drink.

178
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,336
I cooked delicious smelt.

179
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,938

182

How long will they
continue this topic for?

183
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,945
I don't know.

184
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,049
If the listeners don't like it,
they will delete this picture soon.

Excuse me.

186
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,896
Hey, look at this.

187
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:08,234
-Ouch…
-It looks so bad.

188
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,168
Hello.

189
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,305
-How was he?
-I didn't see anything strange.

190
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,907
Why did you say that he was dangerous?

191
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,877
He is not dangerous
if you don't make him mad.

192
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,447
It's OK if he doesn't get too excited.

193
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,084
<i>-How is he dangerous?</i>
-Never mind.

194
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,954
Do you still want him to go on
your radio program?

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,758
I can't just quit. We got great feedback.

196
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,594
Is Ken popular?

197
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,763
It's interesting.

198
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,968
Is he around? Can I talk to Ken?

199
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,403
OK.

200
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,450
Ken.

201
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,821
-Mr. Amakusa wants to talk to you.
-Mr. Amakusa?

202
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,823
You can talk to him now.

He's here.

<i>Hi. This is Amakusa.</i>

206
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,362
Hi. This is Ken Fukashi.

207
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,530
Ken.

208
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,300
Everyone is rooting for you.

209
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,436
<i>-Rooting for me?</i>
-Yes.

210
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,274
Many people think that
they are not human, just like you.

211
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:28,380
<i>They feel empathy for you</i>
<i>as you want to know about humans.</i>

212
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:33,652
<i>Will you read their messages on the radio?</i>

213
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,788
Hi. This is Tsugumi.

214
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,523
<i>Good evening, Ms. Tsugaru.</i>

215
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,192
Do you want Ken to go on the radio again?

216
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,230
Ken made this happen.

217
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,700
The listeners want to see
how Ken's love will go.

218
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,838
<i>Ken made contact</i>
<i>with society through the radio.</i>

219
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,240
<i>It was good for you.</i>

220
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,675
OK.

221
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,845
I will go on the radio again.

222
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,449
<i>Great. I will be preparing for it.</i>

223
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,850
<i>I will call you again.</i>

224
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,318
OK.

225
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,755
I heard that Franken
is becoming very popular.

226
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,056
Popular?

227
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,058
People saw his picture on the website

228
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,461
and said that he didn't look like
a 120-year-old man.

229
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,696
I can imagine that.

230
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,398
A project to cheer him up
is about to launch

231
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,934
to help him adjust to the human world.

232
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,602
What is that project?

233
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,807
-They are kind, like me.
-You doubted him first.

234
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,242
But I met him.

235
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,312
-It's almost three o'clock.
-Are you going to introduce him?

236
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,215
-I wonder where Amakusa is today.
-Go on.

237
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,885
Let me call SNACK MAN, Amakusa!

Hello. I am Junpei Amakusa.

244
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,507
It was the second verse
of the Amakusa song.

245
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,010
Today we have a guest here.

246
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,146
It is Frankenstein.

247
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,583
Hi. I am Frankenstein.

248
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,120
<i>Here is a message to Franken.</i>

249
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,424
<i>It's from "Kramer vs. Kramer",</i>
<i>21 years old, Tokyo.</i>

250
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,327
-<i>"Hi, Franken."</i>
-<i>Hello.</i>

251
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,562
<i>"I heard you talk on the radio.</i>

252
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,366
<i>I understand that you said</i>
<i>you were not human yet.</i>

253
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,269
<i>I recommend you to work</i>
<i>at a convenience store</i>

254
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,704
<i>to know more about humans.</i>

255
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,839
<i>I am working at a convenience store.</i>

256
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,677
<i>People don't treat shop assistants</i>
<i>at convenience stores as humans."</i>

257
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:43,015
So, I came to the convenience store
where she works.

258
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,250
MONMART

259
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,353
Hi. Are you "Kramer vs. Kramer",
who sent us a message?

260
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,954
Yes.

261
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,657
Here is Franken.

262
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,159
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

263
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,763
-What do you think?
-I think he is good-looking.

264
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,031
I see.

265
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,134
Franken will work with you today.

266
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,939
We got permission from your manager.
Will you teach him what to do?

267
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,242
-OK.
-Thank you.

268
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,244
You are very welcome.

269
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,480
-Come inside, Franken.
-OK.

270
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,181
Come with me.

271
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,619
Let me get back to you and Ririe
while we wait for them to get ready.

272
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,825
What's going on? Don't get back to us.

273
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,361
I'm excited to see what they will do.

274
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,865
What if nothing happens?
They are just doing a part-time job.

275
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,236
It's OK. Please listen to this song
while we are waiting.

276
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,312
Why is Ken goofing off
and doing another job?

277
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,114
He is trying to get
a lot of experience in life.

278
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,820
I wonder what Amakusa wants to do.

279
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,689
I don't know.

280
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,825
I hope that Ken won't panic.

281
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,127
But it would not be fun
as a radio program.

Hello.

285
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,375
Hi, Tokachi and Ririe. This is Amakusa.

286
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,011
Franken is working hard.

287
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,984
He is the customer who throws money.

288
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,453
<i>Hello.</i>

289
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,661
<i>Franken is scanning the barcode.</i>

290
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,198
<i>He is a fast learner.</i>

291
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,167
Please ask if he wants
to warm up the bento box.

292
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,804
Would you like it warmed up?

293
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,307
<i>Oops.</i>

294
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,776
He is wearing headphones.

295
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,911
He can't hear what Franken says.

296
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,248
Would you like it warmed up?

297
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,419
He said yes.

298
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,822
-OK. Please ring up the item first.
-OK.

299
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,159
<i>This is the second biggest hurdle.</i>
<i>Ring up the item.</i>

300
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,928
767 yen in total, please.

301
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,598
<i>767 yen. What will he do?</i>

302
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,635
<i>He takes a 1,000 yen bill</i>
<i>and… he throws money.</i>

303
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,371
He throws money as if
he is making a money offering.

304
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,475
You have paid 1,000 yen…

305
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,448
<i>233 yen…</i>

306
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,618
Here is your change.

307
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,320
Franken throws money, too.

308
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,657
Hey. What are you doing?

309
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,325
-<i>The customer is getting mad.</i>
-Why are you throwing money?

310
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,027
<i>No wonder he gets mad.</i>

311
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,731
I thought you wanted me
to throw money back to you.

312
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,632
What the hell?!

313
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,035
-Where is my bento box?
-It's in the microwave.

314
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,371
I didn't ask you to heat it up.

315
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,306
-You didn't want this?
-<i>He is so mad.</i>

316
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:58,310
You nodded your head when I asked you.

317
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,513
No, I didn't. I don't want to heat it up.

318
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,749
I want my bento box
at my favorite temperature.

319
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,485
-<i>Let me get a new one.</i>
-<i>Are you sure?</i>

320
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,654
<i>This is the last one.</i>
<i>Go to the factory and get a new one.</i>

321
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,190
He is a typical complainer.

322
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,224
I am very sorry.

323
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,727
<i>She went to the shelf</i>
<i>to get a new one, but there is none.</i>

324
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,429
Hey. Listen.

325
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,165
<i>You didn't ask me if I wanted</i>
<i>to heat it up.</i>

326
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,367
-<i>I did.</i>
-<i>No, you didn't.</i>

327
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,970
Well?

328
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,172
-What is this?
-<i>Franken picked up his headphones</i>

329
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,807
<i>and put them on his head.</i>

330
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,775
<i>It's too noisy.</i>

331
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,878
No wonder you can't hear anything.

332
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,313
<i>He can't hear.</i>

333
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,881
Don't touch my headphones.

334
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,549
Hey!

335
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,553
What happened?

336
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,255
I don't know.

337
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,892
<i>Huh?</i>

338
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,598
I am very sorry.

339
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,768
I didn't know

340
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,139
that the temperature of your bento box
is very important to you.

341
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,510
Thank you for teaching me that.

342
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,645
Shut up.

343
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,982
-<i>Are you making fun of me?</i>
-<i>No.</i>

344
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,851
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

345
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,389
<i>Thank you for teaching me that.</i>

346
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,461
The customer is getting quiet.

347
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,532
It seems that Franken had
settled the situation peacefully.

348
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,699
<i>Darn it.</i>

349
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,935
-<i>Thank you very much.</i>
-<i>Thank you very much.</i>

350
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,837
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

351
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,972
<i>If you are worrying about something</i>
<i>during snack time…</i>

352
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,808
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

353
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,243
It wasn't fun.

354
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,013
What?

355
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,481
I mean as a radio program.

356
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,620
What? Did you say that you
may extend his program?

357
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,223
Do you want to extend Amakusa's program?

358
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,661
I will let him do as he wants
regarding Franken.

359
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,062
Please cheer him up.

360
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,165
I don't understand what he wants to do.

361
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,335
Do you really think that it was fun?

362

ASK AMAKUSA!

363
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,340
It's not up to me to decide
if it's fun or not.

364
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,642
I am counting on you.

00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,998
Hi. I am Frankenstein.

371
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,400
Here is a message.

372
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,537
It's from "Sora Beans",
37 years old, Kanagawa.

373

<i>"The best way to know about humans</i>

375
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,948

376
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,617
What a message!

377
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,552
<i>What a message!</i>

378
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,654
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

379

AOYAMA ICHIBANKAN

381
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,195
Hi. This is Amakusa.

382
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,130
Are you the "Sora Beans" who wrote to us?

383
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:09,001
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Frankenstein.

384
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,036
I am a big fan of yours.

385
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,338
-What's this?
-This is a radio program.

386
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,706
Radio?

387
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,842
You are on the radio, so watch your mouth.

388
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,176
Are you kidding me?

389
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,279
Sorry to disturb you.
My name is Junpei Amakusa.

390
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,813
I'm Frankenstein.

391
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,682
-Who?
-He is a monster

392
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,485
and he wants to know
about human nature, right?

393
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,820
Give me a break.

394
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,423
Do you want to ask them any questions?

395
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,194
Did you get married
because you fell in love?

396
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,598
Right. And the love was over
when we got married.

397
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,968
He started getting other girlfriends.

398
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,770
Other girlfriends?

399
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:49,474
He cheated on me so many times
and treated me like a doormat.

400
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,777
No, I didn't.

401
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,513
I treated you well by drawing
the line between you and them.

402
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,616
Drawing the line?
Do you know what he's saying?

403
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,486
-Not really.
-See?

404
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,056
Every time I found him cheating on me,

405
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,525
he said that he didn't care
if we got divorced

406
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,062
and continued to have an affair.
Then, did you see what happened?

407
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,665
I fell in love with another man
and told him that I wanted to leave him.

408
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,901
Then he said that he never
wanted to divorce me.

409
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,137
He says I betrayed him
and he doesn't want to get divorced.

410
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,174
-Men and women are different.
-How?

411
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,578
Do you think I have no right to have
an affair because you make a living?

412
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,612
In short, that's right.

413
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,682
Here you go. This is the nature of love.

414
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,020
He wants to change my sense of value
on his own circumstances.

415
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,088
Do you understand?

416
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,924
-A little.
-Who do you think is right?

417
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,394
I don't know.

418
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,531
But I can understand that
both of you are sad.

419
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,134
-Sad?
-Yes.

420
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,938
<i>Both of you fell in love</i>
<i>with someone else,</i>

421
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,807
<i>but neither of you look happy.</i>

422
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,278
<i>I am sad because</i>
<i>he doesn't agree to our divorce.</i>

423
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:05,751
The nature of love is sadness,
not happiness?

424
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,388
Right. That's love.

425
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,327
-I am sad, too.
-Franken.

426
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,564
This is not what we call feeling sad.
We feel empty.

427
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,768
What's the difference between
feeling sad and empty?

428
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,838
You feel sad when someone you trust
betrays you.

429
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,975
You feel empty when someone
is not trustworthy.

430
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,443
ASK AMAKUSA

431
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,248
This man fell in love, got married,
had an affair,

432
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,450
but all he did was to make
someone feel empty.

433
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,920
There is a man like that.

434
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:42,954
Right?

435
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,689
Shut up.

436
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,316
I will divorce you.

437
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,092
Amakusa, are you all right?

438
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,160

00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,348
But your radio program
is interesting. I like it.

482
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,284
-Thank you.
-He is right.

483
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,388
People like your character.
You play it longer than I thought.

484
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,123
You never know what you will be.

485
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,859
Demon became a sumo commentator
from a wax figure.

486
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:12,797
I can learn more by going on
the radio than listening to it.

487
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,367
Don't get carried away!

488
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,536
It's for Tsugumi, right?

489
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,305
Yes.

490
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,042
Don't take it wrong.

491
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,380
You are a carpenter, not an entertainer.

492
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,449
Ken decides what to do.

493
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,453
No one can tell him how to live.

494
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,490
-Don't take it the wrong way.
-Calm down.

495
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:43,294
We have no right to keep him
in a small place.

496
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,865
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Okay.

497
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,801
-Let's drink.
-OK.

498
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,172
This is delicious.

499
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,245
Have you ever thought that you feel empty?

500
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,614
-Feel empty?
-Yes.

501
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,891
I'm trying not to feel that way.

502
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,759
Why?

503
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,830
My father got remarried
after my mother died

504
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,765
and had another family.

505
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,103
What do you mean?

506
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,140
Did you feel empty or sad?

507
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,746
I didn't feel empty or sad.

508
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:40,518
I'm glad that my father was happy.

509
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,923
I'm glad that you didn't feel empty.

510
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,963
I have never felt empty about anyone.

511
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,071
I have Branch Disease, and it's incurable.

512
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,877
The blood streams in my head
might get blocked or break anytime.

513
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,746
I might die anytime.

514
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,285
I don't want you to feel empty.

515
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,855
I want you to feel happy.

516
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,093
Thank you very much.

517
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,930
I want you to feel the same.

518
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,643
I will walk you home.

519
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,368
Murozono.

520
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,603
Do you know where Ken went?

521
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,540
-No.
-OK.

522
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,876
Hey.

523
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,612
Huh?

524
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:21,085
Did you encourage Ken to go on
the radio to get away from Tsugumi?

525
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,826
If so, it's not like you.

526
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,829
Murozono.

527
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,766
Don't bother. You don't know anything.

528
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,008
Call me Mikoto.

529
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,013
TOKYO MUSASHI BROADCASTING
AMAKUSA

530
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,152
<i>Hi. This is Amakusa.</i>

531
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,689
Hi, Amakusa.

532
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,896
Will you stop Ken

533
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,066
from going on the radio?

534
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,102
What are you talking about?

535
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,438
Come with him
if you are worried about him.

536
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,774
<i>He seems to be full of life.</i>

537
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,513
It's almost three o'clock.

538
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,549
Let's call SNACK MAN and the monster.

539
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,318
Where are they today?

540
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,453
Hi. I am Junpei Amakusa.

541
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,722
Hi. I am Frankenstein.

542
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,892
We are now visiting a kindergarten.

543
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,728
We got a message from a lady
in here. Let's go.

544
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:11,663
OK.

545
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,299
-Hello.
-Hello.

546
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,168
Did you send him a message?

547
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,670
Yes.

548
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,406
May I ask what message it was?

549
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:27,245
Yes. My son came home from kindergarten

550
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,548
and listened to Franken talk on the radio.

551
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,352
Then he suddenly said that

552
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,823
children call him a monster as well.

553
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,857
A monster?

554
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,128
Do you mean your cute son
is being called monster?

555
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,630
Yes.

556
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,768
He has an artificial leg.

557
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,138
It doesn't mean that he is bullied,

558
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,309
but the other children
just call him a monster.

559
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,979
When he was listening to the radio,

560
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:07,185
he told me that
this monster is working hard, too.

561
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:08,853
I see.

562
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,725
So, I thought that he would try
to run a race

563
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,495
if Franken rooted for him.

564
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,398
My son has never run a race
because he is scared of running.

565
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,035
So, I sent you a message.

566
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,803
I see.

567
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:27,905
What do you think?

568
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,776
What is a race?

569
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:37,215
It's to run with other people
with all your might.

570
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,484
-I see.
-It is to run

571
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,752
as fast as you can to the goal.

572
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,520
I see.

573
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,598
Will you run with me?

574
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,771
I have never run a race.

575
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,607
Won't you try with me?

576
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,145
He nodded his head.

577
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,348
Let's make a race.

578
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,918
I asked the other children to join.

579
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,819
Come on.

580
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,128
OK. Stop here.

581
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,500
Don't push.

582
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:39,377
This boy is going to run a race
for the first time in front of his mom.

583
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,481
Before that, please check out
the traffic information.

584
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,985
<i>Here is the latest traffic info…</i>

585
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:56,127
Hey, do you feel jealous
of the monster or Amakusa?

586
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,496
No.

587
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,036
Hello, again. This is Amakusa.

588
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,371
They are ready to race.

589
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,941
The boy is at the starting line,

590
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,810
so are the other runners.

591
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,314
Now, the boy will race with Franken.

592
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,518
-Are you ready, boy and Franken?
-Yes.

593
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,187
How about you, boy?

594
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,723
Yes.

595
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,692
I'm sure he can do it.

596
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,566
On your marks.

597
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:37,935
Get set. Go!

598
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,876
The children started running.
How about the boy?

599
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,283
Come on!

600
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,028
He started running.

601
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,675
He fell down.

602
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,974
You can do it.

603
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,914
I was alone in the forest.

604
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,652
I lived by myself without seeing anyone.

605
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:08,292
Then I heard a story about monsters
on the radio.

606
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:16,000
I was surprised to find out
there were many monsters in the world.

607
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,838
But it was a sports event broadcast.

608
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:26,711
The man who was called a monster
was a really great player.

609
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:33,251
A monster is a strong human.

610
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,756
People don't call you a monster
if you are not strong.

611
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,394
Please be a monster.

612
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,933
Be a monster and make your mom happy.

613
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,537
I will run with you.

614
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,679
Let's do it together.

615
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,284
Let's make her happy together.

616
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,522
Go for it.

617
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,227
Go for it.

618
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:21,899
Go for it.

619
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,240
Go for it.

620
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,477
Go for it.

621
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,053
Go for it.

622
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,855
Go for it.

623
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,225
Go for it.

624
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,061
Go for it.

625
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,830
Go for it.

626
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,701
Go for it.

627
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,140
Go for it.

628
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,780
Go for it.

629
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,918
Go for it.

630
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,686
Go for it.

631
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,758
Go for it.

632
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,829
Go for it.

633
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,231
Go for it.

634
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,700
Go for it.

635
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,170
Monster!

636
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,307
Go for it!

637
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,345
This is complex.

638
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,217
-Go for it.
-Go for it.

639
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,119
-Go for it.
-Go for it.

640
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,620
-Go for it.
-Hold the tape.

641
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,721
Okay!

642
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,624
You are almost there.

643
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,970
You did it.

644
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,739
I did it.

645
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,674
You did it!

646
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,210
You did it!

647
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,283
You did it.

648
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,886
You did it.

649
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,521
-You did it!
-You did it!

650
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,422
You did it!

651
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,391
-You did it!
-I did it!

652
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,460
You did it.

653
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,429
I did it.

654
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,197
-Yes! You did it.
-Good job!

655
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,398
You did it!

656
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,442
You worked hard today.

657
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,178
It was very touching.

658
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,813
Thank you.

659
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,917
Let's eat. Franken, please eat.

660
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,686
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

661
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:59,190
Everyone did so well. I was so moved.

662
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,294
The boy, Franken, Amakusa,
you all did well.

663
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,868
However, you are not suited
for my radio program.

664
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,171
It doesn't have to be
wonderful and touching.

665
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,508
Radio should reflect
the everyday life of the listeners.

666
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,412
-Everyone has their everyday life.
-I know.

667
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,780
This is what I mean.

668
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,218
If radio gets too extreme,

669
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,354
it will confuse the everyday life
of the listeners.

670
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,860
No matter how tough or sad
life is for the listeners,

671
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,863
the radio should always keep
a plain routine.

672
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,566
It doesn't make you want to stop
what you're doing to listen

673
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,001
but it gives people comfort.

674
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,770
That's what I want for my radio program.

675
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:51,575
But actually, many listeners like to know
about the everyday life of Franken.

676
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,078
That's a fake life.

677
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,580
It's all set up.

678
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,816
You whip up their emotions

679
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:03,254
and do anything, just like TV shows,
to make it fun for the moment.

680
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,791
I will decide if my program is fun or not.

681
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:14,365
What you do makes me feel empty.

682
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,335
I feel so empty.

683
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,704
Hey, you.

684
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,707
Show yourself if you want to go
on the radio.

685
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,809
Franken?

686
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,280
I don't want cheap tricks in my program.

687
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,684
-Please wait.
-What do you want?

688
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,988
Are you looking for attention
by being the girlfriend of a monster?

689
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,523
She doesn't have anything to do with this.

690
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,893
Really? Is she just having fun?

691
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,829
I doubt if she is really sick.

692
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,066
You're rude to her.

693
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,469
You are rude to me!
Say sorry to my listeners.

694
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,339
I have been working hard
to establish my program.

695
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,376
You just want to be popular. Shame on you!

696
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,357
Ken.

697
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,629
What are you doing?
Are you hiding something?

698
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,531
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,887
<i>I am afraid to be with you.</i>

700
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,223
<i>I am your biggest fan.</i>

701
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,958
Don't make any contact with Franken.

702
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,560
I encouraged him to go on the radio
to keep him away from you.

703
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,864
<i>Show who you really are</i>
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

704
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,766
<i>I won't do anything.</i>
