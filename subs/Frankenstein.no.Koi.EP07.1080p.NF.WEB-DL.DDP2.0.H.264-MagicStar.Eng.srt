1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:05,138
You are not suited for my radio program.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,375
It doesn't have to be
wonderful and touching.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,378
I will decide if my program is fun or not.

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,780
What you do

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,951
makes me feel empty.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,921
I feel so empty.

7
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,323
Hey, you.

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,925
Show yourself if you
want to go on the radio.

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,227
Please wait.

10
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,763
I doubt if she is really sick.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:31,664
That's rude to her.

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,199
You are rude to me!

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,502
Say sorry to my listeners.

14
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,804
I have been working hard
to establish my program.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,706
Shame on you!
You are the enemy of the radio.

16
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,347
What are you doing?

17
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,715
Are you hiding something?

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,788
Oh no…

19
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,450
Is this who you really are?

21
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
What trick are you using?

22
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,036
Tokachi?

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,472
What's going on?

24
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,743
Excuse me. Is everything all right?

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,079
One of our friends became sick.

26
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,747
Please call the ambulance.

27
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,849
Okay.

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,257
What are you doing, Seiya?

29
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,527
I need this in order to help him.

30
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,738
-The ECG is ready.
-Okay.

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,339
-Put it here.
-Okay.

32
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,111
Mr. Amakusa.

33
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
How is Tokachi?

34
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,048
He is still unconscious.

35
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,416
Is that the heart or the brain?

36
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,051
I don't know. They are checking right now.

37
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,520
Did he fall suddenly during dinner?

38
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,222
Yes.

39
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,924
Don't tell me that he was having a fight.

40
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,125
No.

41
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,794
-But…
-But?

42
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,199
The monster showed his true colors.

43
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,633
What?

44
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,284
Why did he grow a mushroom
that had never grown on him before?

45
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:45,158
Maybe because Ken had an emotion
that he never had before.

46
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,560
That's possible.

47
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,362
I can't prove it, though.

48
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,232
He…

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,036
He said that what I did
made him feel empty.

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,607
He said that I was an enemy of the radio.

51
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,345
I didn't like that.

52
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,551
Then it happened.

53
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,621
That is called pride.

54
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,125
Every human has pride.

55
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,027
We have to have it.

56
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,098
Everyone gets upset if our pride is hurt.

57
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:40,513
But you shouldn't get upset,
no matter what happens.

58
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,184
You must control yourself.

59
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,222
Don't worry, Ken.

60
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,159
He will be fine. We will save him.

61
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,698
Professor.

62
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,870
What's happening with my body?

63
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,272
Please tell me.

64
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,012
You are a carrier
of a huge number of bacteria.

65
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,947
Bacteria?

66
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:19,385
Even now, you are taking in
bacteria in the world.

67
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,123
Some bacteria are harmful
to human bodies and some are not.

68
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,561
But you can carry all of them.

69
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,531
Your body has a function
to take up bacteria to cells,

70
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,702
make them relate to your feelings,

71
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,705
and discharge when you get excited.

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,475
Dr. Kentaro Fukashi modified your gene

73
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,011
using genes from bacteria
of a mushroom that he discovered.

74
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:54,153
You got this function
from your pride or your vanity.

75
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,357
Your heart will learn
various kinds of feelings,

76
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:03,329
such as pride, jealousy, envy, and hatred.

77
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,032
That's how you live with humans.

78
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:12,038
Those emotions you feel will produce
new responses in your body.

79
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,442
You need to bear it in mind.

80
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,318
Ken, Tokachi will get well soon.

81
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,419
Don't worry.

82
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,721
Please take care of him.

83
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,990
Okay.

84
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,058
Please save him.

85
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,897
INANIWA CORPORATION

86
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,577
Ken.

87
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,814
Are you all right?

88
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,951
Are you all right, Tsugumi?

89
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,489
I'm fine. Don't worry.

90
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,726
I…

91
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,263
I am worried about myself.

92
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,035
I am scared to be with you.

93
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:22,074
I will do the same thing again
if I am with you.

94
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,479
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,732
Did you make the medicine
with Professor Tsurumaru?

96
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,068
Yes.

97
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,704
I can't reveal it to the public, though.

98
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,040
What are you hiding?

99
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,155
I didn't know that you are home.

100
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,691
Do you have to go on radio today?

101
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,593
No.

102
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,496
Everyone starts working now.

103
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,103
I will hang the futon out.

104
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
What are you doing?

105
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,510
This will kill bacteria.

106
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,946
You don't grow mushrooms
in your bed these days, do you?

107
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,282
That's because I use this
anti-bacterial spray every day.

108
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,550
ANTI-BACTERIAL SPRAY

109
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,623
Wait for me outside.

110
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,458
Let's go.

111
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,094
Hurry up.

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,096
Hello? Ah, it's you.

113
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,566
Ken? Wait a minute.

114
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,571
Ken, are you there?

115
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,672
Yes.

116
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,409
He is calling you.

117
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,578
I don't know what happened,

118
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,714
but there is no use feeling down.
Here you go.

119
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,562
Hello?

120
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,729
Ken.

121
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,733
Tokachi was saved from death.

122
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,402
<i>He will be fine.</i>

123
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:31,871
Okay.

124
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,873
I understand.

125
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,276
Thank you.

126
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,919
His body carries harmful bacteria.

127
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,257
Sometimes he discharges them
out of his body.

128
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,827
Why are you hiding such a dangerous thing?

129
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,862
You mean that he is a carrier
of a disease-causing bacteria

130
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,299
and people can be infected.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
Tokachi was infected
with a virus from him.

132
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,537
Tokachi will get well soon.

133
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,607
Are you going to save all the people
if they are infected?

134
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,843
We haven't expected that he would
expand his world so quickly.

135
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,013
Are you blaming me because
I push him to go on the radio?

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,014
No.

137
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,484
I am blaming myself.

138
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,886
It's my fault.

139
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,456
I was with him but I couldn't stop him.

140
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,462
But how could Ken live without problem
although he is a carrier?

141
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,965
Because he died once.

142
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,306
He died and came back to life
120 years ago.

143
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,408
What are you talking about?

144
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,911
What he said on the radio was all true.

145
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,614
No one will believe that.

146
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,356
You must be joking.

147
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,758
No one will believe it.

148
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,960
So, we can't reveal it to the public.

149
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
We never know what kind
of bacteria he will discharge

150
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,600
if he gets the attention of people.

151
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,301
Are you serious?

152
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,571
Yes. It's all true.

153
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,808
But he has a human heart.

154
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,943
He is even more generous than a human.

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,614
He won't do anything
if he doesn't get hurt.

156
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,249
Are you watching him?

157
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,085
Do you think he won't get hurt
if you are with him?

158
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,088
If you are serious,
I think you are an arrogant person.

159
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,957
I am arrogant.

160
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,362
I think that the bacteria
he discharges has a huge possibility.

161
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,498
Is that why you keep it a secret?

162
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:44,236
Some science in this world,
we shouldn't use.

163
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,072
Please give me a break.

164
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,473
I can't follow what you're saying.

165
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,875
You talk on the radio

166
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,045
and you work on the human heart.

167
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,783
I think the human heart
can be explained by science.

168
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,221
Please don't use his heart
for your own self-interest.

169
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,990
Don't make a show of him.

170
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,326
I trust your heart.

171
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,763
This is all what I wish.

172
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,975
-It's a sunny day. Work hard.
-Yes.

173
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,045
-I can't hear you.
-Yes!

174
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,114
How is it going, Ken?

175
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,350
Don't you think it's nicer to work
than talk?

176
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,322
People shouldn't go easy.

177
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,891
I'm sure it's fun to go on the radio.

178
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,460
I wish I could talk on the radio.

179
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,365
But you never know true happiness
if you don't work hard.

180
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,900
Mr. Shishikui.

181
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,105
It's not just fun when I talk.

182
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,875
Why do you want to go on the radio, then?

183
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,543
It's not only the radio.

184
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,846
People have a hard time
talking to each other.

185
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,517
Sometimes we hurt those
who we love by words.

186
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,385
Are you talking about love again?

187
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,889
It's hard to tell when you love someone.

188
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,257
Shut up.

189
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,192
I'm not talking about you.

190
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,696
Why does a man think that
a woman will know that he loves her

191
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,865
without telling her by words?

192
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,202
It's not only a problem of man.
Don't you think so, Murozono?

193
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,171
Yes.

194
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,242
Are you talking about me?

195
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
Wait.

196
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,545
Did you see that?

197
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:37,750
People become lazy if you think
about unnecessary things.

198
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,787
You guys! Work hard!

199
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,322
Look.

200
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,424
Here comes a lazy man.

201
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,927
Rome was not built in a day.

202
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,796
An old woman was not made
in a day, either.

203
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,632
Stop being silly. How is Ken doing?

204
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,267
He is working hard.

205
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,504
A carpenter is not made in a day.
Don't worry.

206
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,941
Ken is working hard.

207
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,879
It seems that he is back to being himself.

208
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:13,419
I hurt his pride.

209
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,054
Huh?

210
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,324
I told him not to get upset,
no matter what happens.

211
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,526
It's like I asked him
to swallow his pride.

212
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,594
You can't help it.

213
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,597
Ken is not a normal human.

214
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,001
I think now you understand.

215
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,143
Come on, guys.
Let's finish the one over there.

216
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,111
Yes, boss.

217
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,313
I'll start this now.

218
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,383
Tell them that we will be done by noon.

219
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,018
Did you have any problems?

220
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,653
-Hey, can I get some help?
-Sure.

221
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,856
I mean, with Seiya and Tsugumi?

222
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,726
No.

223
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,131
Don't think bad of Seiya.

224
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:07,172
I mean, he is a smart man,
but when it comes to love,

225
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,875
he is a bit clumsy.

226
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,348
You love Seiya.

227
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,983
What did you just say?

228
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,554
-You love Seiya.
-Don't repeat it.

229
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,291
-We all know that.
-She loves him.

230
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,294
Shut up. Go back to work.

231
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,431
I don't think bad of him at all.

232
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,235
I appreciate him.

233
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,539
-Do you?
-Yes.

234
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,881
Do you like that wood a lot?

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,882
Huh?

236
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,818
Oh.

237
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,857
Hey.

238
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,493
I want you to do me a favor.

239
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,796
Okay.

240
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:10,536
I want you to be a radio personality
until Tokachi is back.

241
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,570
Huh?

242
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,807
Ririe, please help him host the show.

243
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:20,346
Since Tokachi is still
in the hospital, I have no choice.

244
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,781
It's too sudden.

245
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,818
Cheer up. It's a chance for you.

246
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,786
What chance?

247
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,789
It's a chance for growth.

248
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,192
What about a relay broadcast?

249
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,928
We'll skip it and do
the Q and A at the studio.

250
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,630
-Huh?
-You can make a show as you like.

251
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,932
Let's do our best, Amakusa.

252
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,770
We will do the public broadcasting
on this Friday as we planned,

253
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,506
even if Tokachi is not here.

254
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,942
Bring Franken to the studio.

255
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,043
PARADISE HEAVEN
LIVE PUBLIC BROADCAST

256
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,278
Show him to the listeners.

257
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,247
They will be so excited.

258
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,682
Wait a minute.

259
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,051
I don't know if he is coming.

260
00:16:59,118 --> 00:16:59,985
Why?

261
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,055
After what happened the other day…

262
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,760
What happened?
You didn't explain it enough to us.

263
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:14,400
Don't forget that you can't host
the show without Franken.

264
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,302
The listeners wouldn't be content
if Franken is not coming.

265
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,672
You told us that the monster
showed his true colors.

266
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,975
I think he should show who he
really is to the listeners, too.

267
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,111
Who he really is? I want to see that.

268
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,380
Bring Franken to the show, no matter what.

269
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,884
It's too tight.

270
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,318
Really? This side is loose.

271
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,387
I'll do it again.

272
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,623
Are you working overtime?

273
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,860
-Welcome home, Seiya.
-Hi.

274
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,896
What are you making, Ken?

275
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,799
What am I making?

276
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,735
You are helping me build my study desk.

277
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,936
A study desk?

278
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:51,904
Yes.

279
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,039
I was a lazy student.

280
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,140
Really?

281
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,543
I can teach you anytime.

282
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,645
-Are you sure?
-Anytime.

283
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,451
Good for you, Murozono.

284
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,289
-Work hard. No chatting.
-Understood.

285
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,057
So, you want to study?

286
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,559
Yes.

287
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,828
I want to be a first-class architect.

288
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,728
Thanks.

289
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,698
I don't think I can teach you that.

290
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,266
Come on. You've got a lot of guts.

291
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,203
It's not just about guts.

292
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,640
I think it's great that you want to study.

293
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,178
Ken is trying hard to expand his world.

294
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,746
I have to do what I can do.

295
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,551
Ken is really good with his hands.
He will be a good carpenter.

296
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,523
Why didn't you become like your dad?

297
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,292
A carpenter?

298
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,664
My mom died when I was a child.

299
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,468
I have been wishing that
there was no disease in the world.

300
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,738
You've got a lot of guts.

301
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:02,908
Just kidding.

302
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:09,114
Actually, my dad started bringing
many young strangers to our house

303
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,550
after my mom died.

304
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,487
I studied hard because
I didn't want to be like them.

305
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,958
I'm just kidding.

306
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,327
I'm sorry. That was not a good one.

307
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,032
I envy you.
You didn't stray from being right.

308
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,736
I think you are very smart.

309
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,673
No one had ever told me that.

310
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,875
Most people say that
I am cute but not smart.

311
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,776
I see.

312
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,848
Murozono, it fits right.

313
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,750
Well done.

314
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,718
Good evening.

315
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,721
Mr. Amakusa.

316
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,890
What's wrong?

317
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,028
Will you please go on the radio

318
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,964
this Friday?

319
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,634
What are you saying?

320
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,771
We will do the public broadcasting
this Friday.

321
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,107
Many listeners who are supporting you
will come to see us.

322
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,314
They will be disappointed
if you are not there.

323
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,051
-The timing isn't right.
-Why?

324
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,821
Why are you opposing me now?

325
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,459
You should have known what would happen.

326
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,497
You wanted Ken to do as he wants freely.

327
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,168
That's why Ken could have found
a place where he can be himself.

328
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,569
Don't worry.

329
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,872
I'll be careful so there won't be
an accident on the radio.

330
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,774
An accident?

331
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,611
Nothing.

332
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,548
Ken…

333
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,418
needs to be Franken on the radio.

334
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,788
I think you should keep it up.

335
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,791
Many people are supporting you.

336
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,735
Hello, Ken.

337
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,772
Tsugumi, Ken is coming.

338
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,110
Good evening.

339
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,681
Good evening.

340
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,824
Where is your sister?

341
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,227
She is at work.

342
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,730
She is so noisy when she is here.

343
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,269
She is so worried about Tsugumi
and she wants me to stay here.

344
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,273
-Please have some tea.
-Thank you.

345
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,345
I always listen to your radio program.

346
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,447
Thank you.

347
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,784
How should I say?

348
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,690
I think the song "Ask Amakusa"
is not right.

349
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:09,494
Why don't you make a new song
with Amakusa?

350
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,831
Grandma.
Let's talk about it some other time.

351
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,036
You are right.

352
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:23,308
I have to go to the convenience store.

353
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,677
Sorry.

354
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,683
-Please take your time.
-Okay.

355
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,420
Thanks.

356
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,570
What's wrong?

357
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,776
I'm sorry about what I did.

358
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,711
Huh?

359
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,815
I said something bad to you.

360
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,988
I'm scared to be with you.

361
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,826
I will do the same thing again
if I am with you.

362
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,299
It's okay.

363
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,469
I said something bad to you.

364
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,408
I told you not to get upset,
but it's impossible.

365
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,223
Amakusa asked me to go on the radio again.

366
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,225
Huh?

367
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,562
He said I should keep doing it.

368
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,231
But…

369
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
You haven't decided yet?

370
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:06,144
Do you think it's okay to go on the radio?

371
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,417
I thought you liked radio.

372
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:18,490
Until I met you, all I had was the radio.

373
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,060
I learned that there were many people

374
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,895
who were worried about lots of things
and listened to the radio

375
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,098
because they wanted to get to know people.

376
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,673
I want to cheer them up.

377
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,143
By making people happy,

378
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:43,014
I can feel happiness being with you.

379
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,018
But…

380
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,526
I am scared I might betray you again.

381
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,304
You never betrayed me.

382
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:14,346
You were so nice
when you were on the radio.

383
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:20,719
I thought you were true to yourself.

384
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:28,293
I think I was arrogant to think
that I could do something to you.

385
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,666
You can do anything by yourself.

386
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,105
You have to live by yourself

387
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,841
in order to live with other people.

388
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,311
I forgot about that.

389
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,918
Do you think it's okay to go on the radio?

390
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,956
I think it's okay if you like the radio.

391
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,295
I am supporting you.

392
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:12,537
Please remember that
I am your biggest fan.

393
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,109
I am supporting you more than anyone.

394
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,527
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,099
What was I trying to do?

396
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,971
You were trying to hug me.

397
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,308
What is this feeling?

398
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,013
I should call it a desire.

399
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,285
What is that?

400
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,641
This is it.

401
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,151
So?

402
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,420
What are you trying to tell me?

403
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,057
I want you to keep it a secret.

404
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,796
What are you talking about?

405
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,734
I think you would be in trouble
if people knew

406
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,603
that you brought a strange monster
to the radio.

407
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,305
You put him before the public.

408
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,408
I didn't want him to go on the radio.

409
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,845
Are you threatening me?

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,983
Is that what a baby professor would do?

411
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:07,986
Hey.

412
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,456
What was that?

413
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,698
Was it something within him?

414
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,304
Even if you don't want me to tell anyone,

415
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,540
my job is to talk.

416
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,483
Please.

417
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,091
If you promise me that
you will never disturb my show,

418
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,992
I will think about it.

419
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,131
Thank you very much.

420
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,435
You never know what he would do
if you talk about him on the radio.

421
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,740
He really is not human.

422
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,655
-Which room is Tokachi staying in?
-There.

423
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,900
-Hey.
-Yeah.

424
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,503
-Who did you see just now?
-Never mind.

425
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,672
-This is for you.
-Oh, ouch.

426
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,942
Why did you bring a potted plant?

427
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,512
You don't look too bad.

428
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,613
You look just as bad as you are.

429
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,848
Shut up.

430
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,217
I'm glad that you look fine.

431
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,654
Tell me what happened.

432
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,425
I don't know what happened.

433
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,998
Don't see Franken anymore.

434
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:04,269
I can't. He is very popular now.

435
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,173
Mr. Yugawara is up for it.

436
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,708
Don't get closer to him.

437
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,410
Don't get closer?

438
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,179
There is a public broadcasting.

439
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,146
Stop it.

440
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,652
He is dangerous.

441
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,921
He is not human.

442
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,827
What happened? Tell me.

443
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,236
Ken.

444
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,139
Look at us if it gets hard for you.

445
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,507
Okay.

446
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,143
I will.

447
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,220
Please take a look at the sales booth.

448
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,623
Ririe Ohmiya's photo book,
<i>Victory Against Poison</i>,

449
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,291
now on sale.

450
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,094
Thank you very much.

451
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,435
This is the first photo book
after you left the idol pop group.

452
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,137
You don't have to hide my past.

453
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,406
I think they want to hide it
because this photo book is too sexy.

454
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,876
It's not a nude photo.

455
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,210
I can call it a nude.

456
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,112
It's close but not yet.

457
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,848
How did you decide the title
<i>Victory Against Poison</i>?

458
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,885
I am always fighting against
Tokachi's poison.

459
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,120
He says he is sick today.
He must be lying.

460
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,024
I see. You won't be beat
by Tokachi's sharp tongue.

461
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,126
I don't have a sharp tongue.

462
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,396
Do you know why the subtitle
for this show is "Clash"?

463
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,165
Because they say there's a clash
of personalities between me and Tokachi.

464
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,067
<i>Isn't that so rude?</i>

465
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,403
<i>There is no clash of personalities</i>
<i>between Tokachi and I.</i>

466
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,905
<i>I don't know.</i>

467
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,175
<i>By the way, a monster came from</i>
<i>the forest to buy your photo book.</i>

468
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,579
<i>Is that the famous monster who is in love?</i>

469
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,814
<i>That's right.</i>

470
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,784
-Let's call him.
-Sure.

471
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,622
PARADISE HEAVEN

472
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,693
<i>Everyone is alone at some point</i>

473
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,163
<i>The world is always a pantheon</i>

474
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,067
<i>If you know that, I will be there</i>

475
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,039
<i>Amakusa will be there</i>

476
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,509
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

477
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,812
Thank you very much.

478
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:32,483
It was the third verse of Amakusa's song.

479
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,485
Let's call him.

480
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,656
Here is Frankenstein,
the monster who is in love.

481
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:00,044
Nice to meet you. I am Frankenstein.

482
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,283
I was wondering why there were
so many female fans,

483
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,885
despite this being the launch day
for my photo book.

484
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,721
Please sit here, Franken.

485
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:10,621
Okay.

486
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:15,693
Here is a message for you, Franken.

487
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,963
Mito Washelt, Ibaraki, 23 years old.

488
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,268
"My ear gets itchy
when my boyfriend hugs me.

489
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,906
How do you feel when you hug
your girlfriend, Franken?"

490
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,511
Is the person who sent this message
in here today?

491
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,446
Here! It's me.

492
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,481
Hello.

493
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,750
Wave at her, Franken.

494
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,588
-Hi!
-Hello!

495
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,757
What did you think about this question?

496
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,929
I haven't hugged her. I don't know.

497
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,100
-You haven't hugged her?
-No.

498
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,169
<i>That's like Ken.</i>

499
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,204
<i>It's pure-hearted love.</i>

500
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,639
Right.

501
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,175
Let's move on to the next question.

502
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:08,112
I have a question from Tokachi,
who is in the hospital.

503
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,184
"What have you done to me, Franken?"

504
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,488
Ririe?

505
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,760
<i>What did you do to Tokachi?</i>

506
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,532
I heard that Tokachi lost consciousness

507
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,200
when he had dinner with you.

508
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,737
That's because you did something
to him, right?

509
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,175
Yes.

510
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,213
But I didn't mean to do it.

511
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,651
He said that you spread poison.

512
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,086
Wait, Ririe.

513
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,388
Is that true?

514
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,491
Did you spread poison?

515
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,561
No, I didn't.

516
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,563
Don't push him into a corner.

517
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,600
You didn't do anything to him, then?

518
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,536
Can you swear it in front of everyone?

519
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,109
I…

520
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,551
Did you spread poison because
Tokachi said something to you?

521
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,486
What are you talking about?

522
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,088
I just want to know the truth.

523
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,390
Did you spread poison?

524
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,226
No, I didn't.

525
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,394
You did it, right?

526
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,663
You just said that you did something.

527
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,132
Shut her up.

528
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,700
Amakusa, introduce the song.

529
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,303
I am asking Frankenstein
what the truth is.

530
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,906
Show who you really are
in front of everyone.

531
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,775
It's dangerous.

532
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,185
Amakusa. Don't take it wrong.

533
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,988
I won't do anything.

534
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,123
Never.

535
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,642
Ken! Look at me!

536
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,573
Excuse me.

537
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,448
<i>Here is the traffic information.</i>

538
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,483
What happened?

539
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,555
<i>There is a traffic jam</i>
<i>in the Metropolitan Expressway.</i>

540
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,757
Grandma.

541
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,993
Did you listen to the radio?

542
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,229
Radio? Is it that time?

543
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,697
I heard a scream.

544
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,565
Scream?

545
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,535
Something may have happened
to Ken Fukashi.

546
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,470
Tsugumi is with him now.

547
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,015
What is that?

548
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,175
Are you all right?

549
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,218
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,424
Excuse me.

551
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,961
What happened?

552
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,062
Hit-and-run.

553
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,764
Hit-and-run?

554
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,432
It was actually a man
who was hit and run, not a driver.

555
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,411
What is he doing?

556
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,386
He is sleeping like a child.

557
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,027
What happened on the radio show?

558
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,730
He needs to get some rest now.

559
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,133
Okay.

560
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,235
Dad, hold his feet.

561
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,236
Okay.

562
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,607
INANIWA CORPORATION

563
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:54,785
IS IT TRUE THAT FRANKEN POISONED
MINORU TOKACHI?

564
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,754
I SAW FRANKEN SPREADING
SOMETHING LIKE POWDER

565
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,590
DON'T TELL ME THAT IT'S POISON

566
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,694
MINORU TOKACHI WAS ABOUT
TO BE KILLED BY A MONSTER?

567
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,924
ANTI-BACTERIAL SPRAY

568
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,022
What are you doing?

569
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,791
Ken.

570
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,495
Seiya.

571
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:18,202
I may be able to kill the bacteria
that live in my body if I drink this.

572
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,640
Wait a minute. I don't think so.

573
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,542
Let me try.

574
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,944
Wait! Wait a minute.

575
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,248
What are you doing?

576
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,686
Tsugumi.

577
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,560
Seiya.

578
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,965
I am sorry for what I have done.

579
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,501
You helped me a lot.

580
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,836
You taught me a lot of things.

581
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,073
I'm sorry.

582
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,781
I will kill the bacteria so that
I can live in the human world.

583
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,816
Wait! It's not like that.

584
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,318
Don't take it wrong.

585
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,219
Don't take it wrong.

586
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,257
I put you on the radio.

587
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,694
I encouraged you

588
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,029
to go on the radio.

589
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,068
I wanted to keep you away from Tsugumi.

590
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,504
I thought Tsugumi would come to her senses

591
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,640
if you caused trouble on the radio.

592
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,542
So she wouldn't love you.

593
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,978
She wouldn't fall in love with you.

594
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,248
So, I met Amakusa.

595
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,852
I told him that you are a monster.

596
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,692
I wished that you would cause
trouble like today.

597
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,163
Ken.

598
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,500
I am not…

599
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,703
human.

600
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,984
I will tell the truth to everyone.

601
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,353
<i>We've got so many phone call</i>
<i>complaints to the radio station.</i>

602
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,654
Let's run away from here.

603
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,959
I will always be with you.

604
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,394
<i>Ken, promise me you will be back.</i>

605
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,496
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
