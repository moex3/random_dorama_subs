00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,403
ANTI-BACTERIAL SPRAY

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,418
What are you doing?

3
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,421
Ken.

4
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,559
I may be able to kill the bacteria
that live in my body if I drink this.

5
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,362
Wait a minute. I don't think so.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,499
-Let me try.
-Wait!

7
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:33,566
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,937
What are you doing?

9
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,375
Tsugaru.

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,978
I'm sorry for what I've done.

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,115
I will kill the bacteria
so that I can live in the human world.

12
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,151
Wait!

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,652
That's not what I meant.

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,621
I put you on the radio.

15
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,593
I encouraged you to go on the radio.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,330
I wanted to keep you away from Tsugaru.

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,834
I thought Tsugaru would come to her senses

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,969
if you caused trouble on the radio.

19
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,138
So she wouldn't love you.

20
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,842
That's why I met Amakusa.

21
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,612
I told him that you were a monster.

22
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,649
I wished that

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,453
you would cause trouble like today.

24
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,021
Ken.

25
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,157
It's me…

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,527
who is not human.

27
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,402
I loved Tsugaru before
you fell in love with her.

28
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,739
But…

29
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,276
I always give her a hard time.

30
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,614
Tsugaru is suffering because of me.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,852
This is who I am.

32
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,516
ASK AMAKUSA!

33
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,819
Can't you get hold of the monster yet?

34
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,521
No. He's not answering.

35
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,790
AMAKUSA

36
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,829
At first, I just wanted
to protect Tsugaru.

37
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,535
Then I came to like Ken.

38
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,470
I am not lying.

39
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,174
The more I wanted to help Ken,

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,543
the more I wanted to sully
your pure heart.

41
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,179
I wanted to reveal his true character,
that of a monster.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,218
Every human…

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,988
lives with contradictions.

44
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,957
Contradictions?

45
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,196
We live knowing that
we can't realize what we wish.

46
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,401
I can't live with a pure heart like Ken.

47
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,504
I live with poison
that I can't get rid of.

48
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,907
I envy you, Ken.

49
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,744
You don't have to hate yourself.

50
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,947
You should hate me instead.

51
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,383
I was bad. I put you in a corner.

52
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,624
Please.

53
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,028
You should hate me.

54
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,109
Hello. This is Inaniwa.

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,745
Hello, Mr. Inaniwa.

56
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,715
I am Junpei Amakusa, a radio personality.

57
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,884
Is Ken Fukashi home?

58
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,621
Yes. Just a moment, please.

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,325
Hey.

60
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,427
Amakusa wants to talk to you…

61
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,696
Ken.

62
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,734
-Hang up.
-What?

63
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,045
-It was no use.
-Huh?

64
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,046
He hung up.

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,649
He seems to be home. I'll go see him.

66
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,916
What for?

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,485
I don't know yet.

68
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,554
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

69
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,691
A lot of the people
who came to see the public show

70
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,360
-became sick and went to the hospital.
-What?

71
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,629
We are getting so many phone calls
of complaints now.

72
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,364
Are they having the same symptoms
as Tokachi?

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,632
I don't know.

74
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,670
It looked like he was spreading something.

75
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,607
TOKYO MUSASHI BROADCASTING

76
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,513
Oh no.

77
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,986
What happened during the radio show?

78
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,389
Everyone is worried about Ken.

79
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,291
Nothing.

80
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,478
Thanks to Seiya, I came to my senses.

81
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,784
Let me tell you the truth.

82
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,588
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,759
It's not only humans
who live with contradictions.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,697
I, a monster,
also live with contradictions.

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,236
I wanted people to understand me,

86
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,974
although I was hiding who I really was.

87
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,782
Seiya told us the truth.

88
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,187
So, I shall tell you the truth.

89
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,001
I am a monster.

90
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,006
Hey, Ken. What are you talking about
since this morning?

91
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,944
What I said on the radio was all true.

92
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,446
True?

93
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,550
I died 120 years ago

94
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,852
and my father,
who was a doctor of medicine,

95
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,020
raised me from the dead.

96
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,755
Huh?

97
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,526
Amakusa, what are you talking about?

98
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,463
What he said on the radio was all true.

99
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,198
True?

100
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,935
He was raised from the dead 120 years ago

101
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,471
and had lived alone in the forest
since then.

102
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,039
It's true.

103
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,940
Boss.

104
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:21,841
THE ZERO-ZERO CHALLENGE

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,543
Is he serious?

106
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,779
Ken is serious.

107
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,848
It's true.

108
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,584
He is telling the truth.

109
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,822
Now is not a good time to joke around.

110
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,524
I didn't believe him in the beginning.

111
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,827
Are you serious?

112
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,829
Professor Tsurumaru guarantees it.

113
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,065
Is he really a monster?

114
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,000
Monster?

115
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,537
Is he really spreading poison?

116
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,273
It's not poison. He releases bacteria.

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,142
What is bacteria?

118
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,611
Is that something like Bifidobacterium?

119
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,314
Tsugaru.

120
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,749
Will you explain to them?

121
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,986
Please.

122
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,290
Ken's body carries some kinds of bacteria.

123
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,693
Some bacteria

124
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,630
are harmful to humans and can kill us.

125
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:24,003
So, I put him on the radio
and tried to show it in public.

126
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,373
I wanted it to happen.

127
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,411
That's why Ken went on the radio
and released bacteria.

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,453
Was I infected by his virus?

129
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,688
-Yes.
-That's disgusting.

130
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,223
Don't run away.

131
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,159
But I was cured, right?

132
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,929
The doctor said I recovered.

133
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,932
Professor Tsurumaru
made a specific medicine

134
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,535
-and I gave it to you secretly.
-Secretly?

135
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,404
Why didn't Professor tell anyone?

136
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,373
Because no one would believe him.

137
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Are you kidding me?

138
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,112
We could have been infected by his virus.

139
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,348
It's possible. I will check.

140
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,416
Wait.

141
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,985
We should call the police first.

142
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,056
Tokachi had been infected.
The police will work on that.

143
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,660
We should tell the police
that we knew nothing.

144
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,229
-Please wait.
-Amakusa,

145
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,131
can you be responsible for this?

146
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,036
Look at this picture.

147
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:30,937
SPORES COMING OUT OF FRANKEN?
THIS IS CRAZY

148
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,173
Is this when you released bacteria?

149
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,975
Yes.

150
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,046
I shouldn't touch people.

151
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,285
I shouldn't get upset or sad.

152
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,791
If I do, I will release bad bacteria.

153
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,531
I'm sorry for not telling you this.

154
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,401
I am a monster.

155
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,439
What did you think?

156
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,677
-Say something.
-Be quiet.

157
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,512
Don't you think it's creepy?

158
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,849
Are you scared to be close to Ken?

159
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,084
Shut up.

160
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,952
-I don't think so.
-Huh?

161
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,587
I don't want to think that way.

162
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,659
Such half-hearted attitude
put Ken into a corner.

163
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,628
You should be honest about your feelings.

164
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,130
Do you think it's okay to hurt Ken?

165
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,066
Is that how you become honest?

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,537
You told Ken to do as he wanted,
but actually, you disturbed him.

167
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,642
-That's right.
-I went on the radio,

168
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,244
not because Seiya told me to.

169
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,880
I did it because I wanted to.

170
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,850
-You don't have to say that.
-I thought…

171
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,452
no one would think that I was a monster

172
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,957
if I said it on the radio.

173
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,860
So, I pretended to be a monster.

174
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,495
That's enough.

175
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,631
-You don't have to make up a lie.
-It's not a lie.

176
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,038
Seiya.

177
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,242
I am like you.

178
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,146
I would do anything

179
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,948
if it meant I could be with Tsugaru.

180
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,988
That's who I really am.

181
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,664
Give me a break.

182
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,035
Give me a break.

183
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,539
Why don't you get mad at me?

184
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,543
Why don't you get mad at me?

185
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,945
Hate me like a human being.

186
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,781
If you are a monster,
get mad at me like a monster.

187
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,983
I can't.

188
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,853
I can't.

189
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,156
I also have a contradiction.

190
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,561
Even if you think I should get mad at you,

191
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,362
I can't.

192
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,435
Even if you think I should hate you,

193
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,337
I can't.

194
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,439
I…

195
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,710
I like you so much.

196
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,750
I appreciate what you did.

197
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,694
This is why…

198
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,598
you are bad.

199
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,703
This is what I don't like about you.

200
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,264
Okay. Let's get to work.

201
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,132
Are we going to work?

202
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,834
Yes, of course.

203
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,905
Ken. Let's get to work.

204
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,374
Me?

205
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,209
Yes, of course.

206
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,712
-Let's work.
-Okay.

207
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,116
Don't worry about Seiya.

208
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:49,995
Are you all right?

209
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,999
You should leave me alone
in a situation like this.

210
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,502
I'm like your father.

211
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,405
Just like you.

212
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,476
-I'm not like him.
-Yes, you are.

213
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,949
Boss picked me up in town

214
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,351
and brought me here.

215
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,122
I saw you and Boss didn't get along well.

216
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,993
It made it easier for me to stay.

217
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,564
That wasn't for you.

218
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,634
Even so,

219
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,606
that's how nice you are to people.

220
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,911
You unconsciously showed me

221
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:44,116
I could do as I wanted.

222
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,987
You were nice to me.

223
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,626
I know…

224
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,795
that's how you are.

225
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,736
I know you are not perfect.

226
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,173
You are awkward when it comes to love.

227
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,179
You don't have a good eye for women.

228
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,488
Murozono.

229
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,591
Call me Mikoto.

230
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,263
Do you think…

231
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,034
you can have the same attitude with Ken
as before?

232
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,275
Will you be the same with him?

233
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,314
Yes. If you ask me to be.

234
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,618
Please.

235
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,220
Okay.

236
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,123
You can count on me.

237
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:16,041
<i>It's hard to guess what he thinks</i>
<i>since he was a child.</i>

238
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,044
When he was small,

239
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,314
his mother went to hospital
because of a heart disease.

240
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,720
He went to the hospital every day
and made her smile.

241
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:35,594
But he stole candy at the shop
in the neighborhood

242
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,929
and brought them to his mom.

243
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,201
He thought that his mom would be back
from the hospital sooner

244
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,204
if she found out and worried about him.

245
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,373
His mom cried

246
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,077
and he apologized
when she found out what he had done.

247
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,585
But she didn't come back.

248
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,421
No.

249
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,724
<i>He got depressed so much.</i>

250
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,862
<i>He blamed himself although he was a child.</i>

251
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,098
<i>It would have been better if he could cry.</i>

252
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,670
<i>But I cried slovenly at her funeral.</i>

253
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,973
<i>So, he couldn't cry.</i>

254
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,143
I think…

255
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,013
he was worrying about you, seriously.

256
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,252
I know.

257
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,321
I know that.

258
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,725
So…

259
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,530
I feel sorry for him.

260
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,707
I put Seiya in a corner.

261
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,510
I think…

262
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,515
I didn't try to understand Ken.

263
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,820
I tried to see
only what I liked about him.

264
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,327
I think Seiya is great.

265
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,864
He brought Ken here.

266
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,769
He tried to accept Ken as he really was.

267
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,338
It's wonderful.

268
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,875
I…

269
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,246
I am ashamed of myself.

270
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,817
Thanks.

271
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,889
But don't blame yourself.

272
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,393
Have some tea.

273
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,695
Thank you.

274
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,465
It's not anyone's fault.

275
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,603
It's hard to understand people.

276
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,075
This is an even harder situation.

277
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,156
Tsugaru. You didn't sleep at all.

278
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,159
Get some rest.

279
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,561
Thank you.

280
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,098
How is the radio show?

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,536
I guess people are making a big fuss.

282
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,413
FUGAKU UNIVERSITY

283
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,715
-Let's prepare more samples.
-Okay.

284
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,285
Come in.

285
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,553
MAY, JUNE

286
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,433
He is not here.

287
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,570
I need your help.

288
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,872
Yes?

289
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,707
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,510
I am responsible
for what's happening right now.

291
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,080
Is there anyone who was infected?

292
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,551
The company decided
to report it to the police.

293
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,022
-Please wait.
-Amakusa.

294
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,225
Can you be responsible for this?

295
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,364
Who is responsible for the radio?

296
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,899
For the radio?

297
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,302
This happened on our radio show.
Are you going to leave it to the police?

298
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,805
It's a crime spreading poison.

299
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,840
It's not poison, it's bacteria.

300
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,909
-It's the same.
-No, it's not.

301
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,879
If he released bacteria, it's a big issue.

302
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,815
It's a big fact.

303
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,283
What are you trying to say?

304
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,354
Don't you think that
we should verify it on the radio?

305
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,155
Verify?

306
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:02,194
Many listeners want to know
what had happened on the show.

307
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,431
Don't you think that
we should reply to them?

308
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,835
What do you want me to do?

309
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,137
I need your help.

310
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,340
I want to let the public know
the facts about Ken on the radio.

311
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,110
Huh?

312
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,178
-Put it here.
-Okay.

313
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,384
What happened?

314
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,518
Are you all right, Ken?

315
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,419
Don't worry.

316
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,954
Don't get upset.

317
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,324
I'm okay. I don't get upset.

318
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,627
Idiot! Calm down.

319
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,497
Boss, you got upset the most.

320
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,166
-Help him tidy up.
-Give me a hand.

321
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,567
-Sure.
-Hold this.

322
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,103
It's all right.

323
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,004
I got a fright.

324
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,580
Ken.

325
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,889
Professor Tsurumaru wants to see you.

326
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,927
Okay.

327
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,597
-Can we go?
-Okay.

328
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,280
Is that Franken?

329
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,353
MOLD

330
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,323
Amakusa!

331
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,126
What is this all about?

332
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,229
He wants to talk to you.

333
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,936
I am responsible for what had happened.

334
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,238
I put Ken in a corner.

335
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,140
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,610
No. It's not your fault.

337
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,649
Some of the people
who attended the live show

338
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,720
became sick and went to the hospital.

339
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,458
They are not in serious condition.

340
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,929
I confirmed that all of them
went home without any problem.

341
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,099
Please don't worry.

342
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,301
But…

343
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,972
they think you are suspicious.

344
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,310
The radio station
is going to report it to the police.

345
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,445
What?

346
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,980
I won't let them do such a thing.

347
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:41,753
Will you go on the radio
and tell us the truth instead?

348
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,555
Do you want him to go on the radio again?

349
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,291
It's for Ken.
I think it's better than to hide.

350
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,426
What's good about it?

351
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,995
The media will chase you
if you try to hide.

352
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,364
You did do something to Tokachi.

353
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:57,402
If you don't explain anything,
they will regard everything as fact.

354
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,641
I want Ken to tell what he thinks is true

355
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,309
on the radio.

356
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,711
I think

357
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:12,017
that's the only way
if you want to live with humans.

358
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:15,887
Ken.

359
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,926
I want you to trust me one more time.

360
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,930
If we know that he is a monster
and let him talk on the show,

361
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,899
the listeners may think that
we are an accomplice.

362
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,836
-We already are an accomplice.
-What?

363
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,072
-That makes sense.
-What?

364
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,475
Let him explain what had happened

365
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,578
so that we can say that
we didn't know anything.

366
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,047
We didn't believe that
he was a real monster.

367
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,483
We had no idea
that he was such a strange man.

368
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,185
We had never imagined
that he would spread poison.

369
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,555
We should emphasize that
we were deceived by him.

370
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,792
I'm not trying to do such a thing.

371
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,527
But it's true.

372
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,729
You didn't believe what he said.

373
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,630
PARADISE HEAVEN

374
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,031
-Okay. Go for it.
-Huh?

375
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:03,001
It will be newsworthy
and will have a high listener rating.

376
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,105
I will never go on the show
with such a man.

377
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,974
You do it by yourself, Amakusa.

378
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,777
Amakusa. Find the monster
and drag him to the show.

379
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,782
You can't fool me.

380
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:25,190
You want him to go on the show
just for yourself.

381
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,061
Ken. He is like me.

382
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,566
People who want to help others
actually want to help themselves.

383
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,169
He wants you to go on the radio
for his own convenience.

384
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,707
Seiya.

385
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,412
I will go on the radio and tell the truth.

386
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:49,948
Ken.

387
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,122
Professor.

388
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,992
I am trying to help him,

389
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,662
no matter what he chooses in life.

390
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,233
I believe his heart

391
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,868
more than his body.

392
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,406
Why do you say that?

393
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,777
Because Dr. Kentaro Fukashi chose him.

394
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,447
He raised you

395
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,151
<i>because he wanted</i>
<i>to save your heart and life,</i>

396
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,485
<i>no matter what.</i>

397
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,155
It had been the same
after you were reborn.

398
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,726
He believed that
your heart didn't have any harm.

399
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,497
I respect Dr. Kentaro Fukashi.

400
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,500
So, I believe in your heart.

401
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,442
Try to get over the hardship

402
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,844
with your heart.

403
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,281
Yes, I will.

404
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,325
It's Tsugaru!

405
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,850
Please stop.

406
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:33,885
Please.

407
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,588
No. Please don't take him.

408
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,657
Don't take him to the radio station.

409
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,959
Hey!

410
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,194
Please do as she says.

411
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,497
Please.

412
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:57,942
Tsugaru.

413
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,578
What's wrong with you?

414
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,151
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,686
What?

416
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,491
Please stop.

417
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:16,828
Why?

418
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,732
I don't want you

419
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,136
to get hurt anymore.

420
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,609
I'm sorry for being selfish.

421
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,280
But…

422
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,451
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

423
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:49,494
I don't care about the truth.

424
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,576
I can go anywhere.

425
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,981
Let's run away.

426
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,653
I…

427
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,091
I will protect you.

428
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,294
I will make you smile.

429
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,669
I will be your radio.

430
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,250
<i>It's time for you and I</i>

431
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,523
<i>Evolutionary theory for you and I</i>

432
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,160
<i>If you are worried about something</i>

433
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,297
-<i>Ask Amakusa</i>
-<i>Ask Tsugaru</i>

434
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,472
<i>Ask Tsugaru</i>

435
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,847
Let's go back to the forest together.

436
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:22,921
I…

437
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,693
I will be with you forever.

438
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,223
I promise you.

439
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,033
I promise you that

440
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,503
I will be with you forever.

441
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,473
I promise you.

442
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,313
Saki.

443
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:23,848
What?

444
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,318
How?

445
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,054
How did you know that name?

446
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,859
It's the name…

447
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,930
of my ancestor.

448
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,609
Ah…

449
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,214
Tsugaru?

450
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,696
Tsugaru?

451
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,298
Tsugaru?

452
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,367
Tsugaru? Tsugaru?

453
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,337
Tsugumi Tsugaru, 22 years old.

454
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,940
Hello, Tsugumi. Are you all right?
How are you? Are you okay?

455
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,442
-It's me, your sister, Haruka.
-Can you hear me?

456
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:37,021
Your sister had a brain hemorrhage
from here

457
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,356
because of Branch Disease.

458
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,558
Because her brainstem

459
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,261
has a congenital defect,

460
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,899
the operation is too dangerous.
All we can do is to watch and wait.

461
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,201
It's the same as my mom.

462
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:55,540
My mom had a brain hemorrhage
from the brainstem in the end,

463
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,475
soon before she died.

464
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,756
How is Tsugaru?

465
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,792
She is sleeping.
She is not allowed to have visitors.

466
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,565
Please don't hurt her anymore.

467
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,468
I'm begging you.

468
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,527
Seiya.

469
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,434
I have been living with contradictions.

470
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,103
Contradictions?

471
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,808
I believed my dad

472
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,577
and I also doubted him.

473
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:41,979
Huh?

474
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,748
Why did he raise me?

475
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,518
Why was I born?

476
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,191
Seiya.

477
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,628
Please take care of Tsugaru.

478
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,131
What do you mean?

479
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,700
I have to go.

480
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,469
-Where?
-To the forest.

481
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,671
Why?

482
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,173
Please go home.

483
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,615
Ken.

484
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,718
Please come back.

485
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,159
Whoops.

486
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:29,861
Look.

487
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:34,599
Someone tweeted that Franken
is working for Inaniwa Corporation.

488
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,500
Really?

489
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,467
Don't tell Ken.

490
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,703
Boss, should we leave this?

491
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,638
Never mind. It's good publicity.

492
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,106
This is not good.

493
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,107
Hi, Seiya.

494
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,009
-Hi.
-Hi.

495
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,444
-Thanks.
-Oh that's enough. That's enough.

496
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,579
Where is Ken?

497
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,414
We were waiting for him.

498
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,816
He may not come back.

499
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,917
Huh?

500
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,322
Tsugaru came down with sickness.

501
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,790
-Huh?
-What?

502
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,288

514
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,335
<i>I killed her</i>

515
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,104
<i>because of the bacteria as a monster.</i>

516

Amakusa. You know what to do, right?

What?

535
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,474
Don't feel empathy for him.

536
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,544
Deny him if he says something strange.

537

to Mr. Tokachi,
a personality of this radio program.

555
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,749

There was a cholera epidemic in my village

and many people were killed.

565
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,746
<i>I also lost my family</i>

566
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,416
<i>because of that infectious disease.</i>

567

Is there anything I can do?

573
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,382
Will you pray with me that

574
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,084
<i>there will be no infectious disease</i>
<i>in the world?</i>
