1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:05,739
First, please introduce your true self.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:10,810
My real name is Koroku Yamabe.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,446
Grandma.

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,548
Ken is on the radio show.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,718
Really?

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,122
I am hoping that Tsugumi
will respond to Ken's voice.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,990
<i>I have worked hard since I was a child.</i>

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,625
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,160
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,732
I'm talking about myself
before I became a monster.

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,369
He got his old memory back.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,971
-Is that before he became Ken?
-Right.

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,775
<i>Why was I born?</i>

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,011
<i>Why did Dr. Fukashi raise me?</i>

15
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,648
<i>I have been thinking about that.</i>

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:54,587
<i>Sometimes I hold grudges against him</i>

17
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,858
and the power of science
that he had developed.

18
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,431
But I finally understood why I was born.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,839
I would like to talk about that
to someone who is precious to me

20
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,208
and is trying so hard to live right now.

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:20,280
It's a love story from 120 years ago.

22
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>Hundred and twenty years ago,</i>

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,622
<i>I had a big dream.</i>

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,760
There it is!

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,733
<i>I visited someone</i>
<i>to make my dream come true.</i>

26
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,627
Hello.

27
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,165
Is anyone here?

28
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,399
Hello?

29
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,567
Yes…

30
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,503
Who is it?

31
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,772
I am Koroku Yamabe. I came from Tokyo.

32
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,974
From Tokyo?

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,076
Yes. I am a doctor.

34
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
My name is Shimizu,

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,414
and I'm in charge of the administrative
work of this Institution.

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,216
I see.

37
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,152
-How can I help you?
-Oh, yes.

38
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,321
I would like to see Dr. Kentaro Fukashi.

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,158
I have a recommendation letter
from Mr. Ohgaki,

40
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,859
the president of the hospital
that I was working for.

41
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,530
I heard that President Ohgaki
was a classmate of Dr. Fukashi.

42
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,131
Please tell him
that I would like to see him.

43
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,902
-Okay. Please wait here.
-Sure.

44
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,513
Dr. Fukashi is in this laboratory.

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,151
He is busy and has no time to see
a volunteer like you.

46
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,853
I admire his attitude.

47
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,156
You have no right to say such a thing.

48
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,158
-You are completely correct.
-What?

49
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,197
Excuse me.

50
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,572
Hello. I am Koroku Yamabe.

51
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,276
I would like to see Dr. Kentaro Fukashi.

52
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,111
Are you a believer of the academic clique?

53
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,246
Yes?

54
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,649
You must be an alumnus of Teidai.
That's why you worked for Ohgaki.

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,719
Do you want to work for me
and add luster to your career?

56
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,289
I am only a high school graduate.

57
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,494
But I really wanted to work for you,

58
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,233
so I asked President Ohgaki
to write a recommendation letter.

59
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,467
How did you become a doctor?

60
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,804
My family is farmers in Toyama.

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,807
Many people, including my family
and teachers, supported me

62
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,142
to graduate high school.

63
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,513
I wanted to become a doctor
to repay their kindness.

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,682
So, I became a student
of a doctor in my town.

65
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,186
I studied until I turned 20,
when I went to Tokyo.

66
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,057
Thanks to the support of so many people,

67
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,327
I passed the Examination
for Medical Practitioners.

68
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,563
Did you study by yourself?

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,967
Yes. I appreciate
all the people's kindness.

70
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,404
You studied hard to become a doctor.
Why did you come to the institution?

71
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,373
Yes.

72
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,109
After I became a doctor, I realized that

73
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,479
there were so many diseases
that a doctor couldn't cure.

74
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:46,052
My grandmother, my brothers, and sisters
died of cholera when I was a child.

75
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,757
Doctors can cure only
a limited number of diseases.

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,527
But I heard of your achievements.

77
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,232
You delivered outstanding academic results
in Germany, the UK, and the US

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,402
and opened the Institute
of Infectious Diseases in Japan.

79
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,438
I was so excited when I learned about it.

80
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,341
I want to study bacteriology under you

81
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,710
and specify the root cause of diseases.

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,816
You seem to be very good at
receiving favors from many people.

83
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm a bit embarrassed.

84
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,956
I want to be good at returning the favor.

85
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,692
I will study hard.

86
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,964
Dr. Fukashi hired me
as a contact point for patients.

87
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,167
-A contact point?
-Yes.

88
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,271
<i>He was not good at interacting</i>
<i>with people.</i>

89
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,773
<i>He wanted me to look after the patients</i>

90
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,309
<i>so that he could concentrate</i>
<i>on his studies.</i>

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,212
Your pulse is getting stable.

92
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,880
Really?

93
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,818
-Are you all right?
-<i>Since I loved interacting with people,</i>

94
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,153
<i>I was happy to take care of the patients.</i>

95
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,288
Here is lunch.

96
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,957
Soup again?

97
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:03,830
<i>I decided that I wanted</i>
<i>to help the patients more.</i>

98
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,566
<i>Do you want to grow vegetables?</i>

99
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,069
There is agricultural land around
the institution that is not in use.

100
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,004
We should make use of it.

101
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,975
We can grow fresh vegetables
and feed them every day.

102
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,144
-Who will grow them?
-Me.

103
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,445
I am good at farming.

104
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,613
Hey!

105
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,649
People here are alumni of Teidai.

106
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,352
They hate people who meddle.

107
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,222
You are an apprentice student.

108
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,960
People will look down on you
if you work like a servant

109
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,329
and you will feel uneasy to work here.

110
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,664
-Mr. Shimizu!
-Yes?

111
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:44,337
Which do you think is important,
the patients or me?

112
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:50,009
<i>I visited a landlord to rent the farmland.</i>

113
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,347
<i>That's where I met Saki.</i>

114
00:06:54,881 --> 00:07:00,753
She is an ancestor of the lady
whom I'm in love with now.

115
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,954
Is that Tsugumi?

116
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,391
Is that her grandmother?

117
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,893
That's too young.

118
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,628
Is that her grand-grandmother?

119
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,696
I guess so. It was 120 years ago.

120
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,865
I saw her picture.
She looked so much like Tsugumi.

121
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,267
Show me the picture.

122
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,168
I don't have it.

123
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,903
-Why?
-Do you really not have it?

124
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,171
No way.

125
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,275
<i>Saki was the daughter of the landlord.</i>

126
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,676
Oh my gosh.

127
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,649
Saki and Ken were in love?

128
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,452
Are you following his story?

129
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,654
Yes, of course.

130
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,989
Excuse me.

131
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,360
Hello?

132
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,829
Yes.

133
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,898
Hello.

134
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,500
Hello.

135
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,338
Is this the landlord's house?

136
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,706
Yes.

137
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,808
May I ask who you are?

138
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,879
I am an apprentice student
of the Institute of Infectious Diseases

139
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,781
and I am a doctor.
My name is Koroku Yamabe.

140
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,015
And you are?

141
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,385
I am Saki. I'm his daughter.

142
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,854
I see.

143
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,089
I would like to see your father.

144
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,124
May I ask you why?

145
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,229
I would like to rent agricultural land
around the institution

146
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,296
that is not in use now.

147
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,364
Agricultural land?

148
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,366
Yes. I want to grow vegetables

149
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,269
so that I can feed fresh vegetables
to my patients.

150
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,572
But you said that you are a doctor.

151
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,109
Yes, but I am good at farm work.

152
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,678
I don't think it will work.

153
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,880
Huh?

154
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:38,050
My father was against
the Institute of Infectious Diseases.

155
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:38,951
Against?

156
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,820
He was the leader
of the opposition movement

157
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,789
before it was constructed.

158
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,826
I see.

159
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,297
My father doesn't allow anyone
to use the land around there.

160
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,168
People are scared of the institute
and won't go close.

161
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,803
They are worried about the land pollution.

162
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,072
Please don't worry about it.

163
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,909
Diseases won't infect land or vegetables.

164
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,711
I just want to grow vegetables
and feed patients.

165
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,381
Will that be okay with your father?

166
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,715
I don't think so.

167
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,218
He is still against the institution.

168
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,953
If he lends you the land,

169
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,289
people will think that he accepts it.

170
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,260
But there are patients who try
to fight against disease.

171
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,796
They need fresh vegetables to live.

172
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,666
I just want to save their lives.

173
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,308
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,078
I don't mean to offend you.

175
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,418
I also think that my father is wrong.

177
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,086
What?

178
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:52,058
As you can see, he gets
overly influenced by Western culture.

179
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,860
He isn't consistent with himself
to go against medical advancements.

180
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,663
Don't you think so?

181
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,605
All right. Let me ask him.

182
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,939
Excuse me.

183
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,541
But please be careful.

184
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,477
My father fired at the institution
using his hunting rifle before.

185
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,612
Let's go.

186
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,512
Excuse me…

187
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,185
You will be fine. I am with you.

188
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,557
Where are you going?

189
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,559
My father is at my uncle's home.

190
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,094
Okay.

191
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,767
Thank you.

192
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,603
A bicycle.

193
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,138
Yes.

194
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,807
I want to ride it.

195
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,010
May I?

196
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,181
Sure.

197
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,716
Excuse me.

198
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,817
Please wait.

199
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,553
Put your foot on the pedal.

200
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,488
Okay.

201
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,989
Excuse me.

202
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,827
Slowly step on the pedal.

203
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,930
-Okay.
-Okay.

204
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,900
You are good.

205
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,104
What are you doing?

206
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,175
You can let go.

207
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,244
Can I?

208
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,080
I want to ride it by myself.

209
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,684
Okay.

210
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,892
You are so good.

211
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,861
Oh, wait.

212
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,440
Are you all right?

213
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,747
-I'm sorry.
-It's no problem.

214
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,217
Did you get hurt?

215
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,487
<i>Now I know that…</i>

216
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,357
<i>I fell in love with her at that moment.</i>

217
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,395
Hi, Koroku!

218
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,531
Hi, Saki. What's wrong?

219
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,768
It's a lot of work for one person.
Let me help you.

220
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,269
I can't let you do that.

221
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,270
I can do it.

222
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,271
No… wait.

223
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,511
Please let me do it.

224
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,047
It's dangerous.

225
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,950
I wanted to do it since I was a child.

226
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,152
You told me that before.

227
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,020
Please teach me.

228
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:38,958
Okay.

229
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,526
Here.

230
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,329
Be careful.

231
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,663
Try slowly.

232
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,832
Here you go.

233
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,969
The sun will set
by the time you finish it.

234
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,637
Hey, wait!

235
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,306
Here you go.

236
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,311
We're getting there.

237
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,846
Saki! Saki!

238
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,481
What are you doing?

239
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,250
Hi.

240
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,451
Stop it.

241
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,120
Dad will kill you
if he knows what you are doing.

242
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,260
Why don't you join us?

243
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,095
It's fun.

244
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,531
-Let's go.
-Hey, what are you doing?

245
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:23,202
<i>Saki came to help me every day.</i>

246
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,574
Are you all right, Saki?

247
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,013
Look at your face.

248
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,284
-Here you go.
-Okay!

249
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,098
Grow well.

250
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,334
Here you go.

251
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,744
Thanks to you, I finished
planting the seeds

252
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,779
earlier than planned.

253
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,848
Thank you.

254
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,517
I can't wait to harvest them.

255
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,418
Right.

256
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,054
Are you all right?

257
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,424
Yes. See?

258
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,658
Good.

259
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,162
I wish I could take you home,

260
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,665
but I have to go back.
My patients are waiting for me.

261
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,902
-I envy you.
-Huh?

262
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,239
I can't live like you.

263
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,474
Why?

264
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,178
All I know is I will marry someone

265
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,747
someday that my parents will choose.

266
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm the same.

267
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:52,124
There's someone I want to marry,
but I can't, no matter what.

268
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,060
Yes.

269
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,338
Is there anything that I can do…

270
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,908
with you?

271
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,110
You mean to marry?

272
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,384
I mean to help the institution.

273
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,054
Yes. Sure, of course.

274
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:28,961
But there is nothing…

275
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,896
I can't help with anything.

276
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,937
I hope that the patients will get well

277
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,607
and there will be no infectious diseases.

278
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,076
Will you hope for that with me?

279
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Yes.

280
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,381
I will hope for that with you.

281
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,850
Good.

282
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:59,525
<i>Saki built a statue of Jizou</i>
<i>near the Institution.</i>

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,901
Professor.

284
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,240
This is Dr. Kentaro Fukashi.

285
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,109
-You talked about him before.
-Yes.

286
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,413
This is Saki.
She is the daughter of the landlord.

287
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,785
She is the one who built
a statue of Jizou for the patients.

288
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,654
Praying to God, huh?

289
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,189
Yes?

290
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,324
-Koroku.
-Yes.

291
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,793
Take care of the patients.

292
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,996
Yes, I will.

293
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:45,237
<i>Dr. Fukashi had another laboratory</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

294
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,273
<i>It's somewhere deep in the forest.</i>
<i>No one knows about it.</i>

295
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,148
I found it.

296
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,453
<i>Later, I found out that</i>
<i>he was studying the bacteria</i>

297
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,990
<i>that was not the cause of a disease.</i>

298
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,396
<i>He collected bacteria</i>
<i>from all over the world</i>

299
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,730
<i>and brought them to Japan.</i>

300
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,502
<i>He was trying to create new bacteria</i>
<i>in that small laboratory.</i>

301
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:21,807
<i>He was absorbed in a study</i>
<i>of eternal life.</i>

302
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,543
-<i>Eternal life?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

303
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,747
Do you mean a life that
is immortal and forever young?

304
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,782
Yes.

305
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,355
He believed that some bacteria
could keep human cells alive forever.

306
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,391
<i>He never could have imagined</i>

307
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:45,731
<i>that he would raise a monster in the end.</i>

308
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,276
Hello.

309
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,886
Now, I can feed fresh vegetables
to the patients.

310
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,290
-Thank you, Saki.
-My pleasure.

311
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,326
I'm happy to help you.

312
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,196
Huh?

313
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,031
What's this mushroom?

314
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,366
Mushroom?

315
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,603
Dr. Fukashi thinks that mushrooms
have infinite possibilities.

316
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,071
Infinite possibilities?

317
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,539
The possibilities to cure diseases.

318
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,242
That's why he goes
to the forest very often.

319
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,711
All I think about when I see mushrooms

320
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,748
is it looks delicious
or it may be poisonous.

321
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,585
Dr. Fukashi is a great person.

322
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,187
Compared to him, I am nothing.

323
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,295
You may not go ahead of others,

324
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,066
but you are a doctor
who backs up and walks with people.

325
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,567
Oh…

326
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,903
I…

327
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,275
I like you a lot.

328
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,447
You work hard for the patients,
even if you're covered in mud.

329
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,482
I wish I could support you.

330
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,659
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>Saki and I were in love.</i>

332
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,286
Hello.

333
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,720
Mr. Shimizu.

334
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>Saki helped the institution a lot.</i>

335
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,294
<i>Mr. Shimizu came to appreciate her.</i>

336
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,729
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

337
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,798
Now!

338
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,168
Don't move.

339
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,039
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

340
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,743
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

341
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,779
Doctor, this is delicious.

342
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,414
That's good.

343
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,919
Excuse me.

344
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,793
Dr. Fukashi, I brought
some vegetable stew for you.

345
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,029
We cooked it using fresh vegetables.

346
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,565
Please eat it before it gets cold.

347
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,772
I heard that you like mushrooms,
so I added some mushrooms.

348
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,475
Tell Koroku that no one is allowed
to enter here.

349
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,212
Why are you keeping others at a distance?

350
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,119
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,255
I am just curious.

352
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,329
Sorry for disturbing you.

353
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,031
Excuse me.

354
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,433
Emotion bothers me.

355
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,705
Emotion bothers you?

356
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,509
Wherever I go,

357
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,111
there are always people
who criticize me emotionally

358
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,813
when I get good results.

359
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,716
Many people admire you.

360
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,251
When you get close to others,

361
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:30,188
what they will ask in return
is beyond our abilities.

362
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,725
That's when you start being miserable.

363
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,263
It's the same for men and women.

364
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,732
The same?

365
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,804
When you start talking with emotion,
it disrupts your studies eventually.

366
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,743
To avoid that, I must get rid
of all human relationships.

367
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,247
Do you despise me?

368
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,015
No.

369
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,084
I respect you more.

370
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,987
You are a great person.

371
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:06,992
Invisible great power
must drive you to work.

372
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,364
I think that power gives you freedom.

373
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,935
I think you are wonderful
just the way you are.

374
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,572
I'm sorry to disturb you.

375
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,040
Excuse me.

376
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,486
After I got my old memory back…

377
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:13,525
I went to my house in the forest,
where I lived for 120 years…

378
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:19,464
<i>because I remembered</i>
<i>that he wrote something</i>

379
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,333
<i>just before his death.</i>

380
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,278
<i>It was about his studies and nothing more.</i>

381
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,249
<i>I looked everywhere.</i>

382
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,589
<i>And I found something.</i>

383
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,099
1897

384
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,976
<i>If Koroku regains his memory someday,</i>

385
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,145
<i>there's something I have to confess.</i>

386
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:14,586
<i>I started liking Saki,</i>
<i>who was your girlfriend.</i>

387
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,156
<i>The world is full of envy and ambition,</i>

388
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,360
<i>but I thought I got a fair evaluation</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

389
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,795
How about this one?

390
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,200
Doctor, I brought some stew for you.

391
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,171
<i>I started to have a desire</i>
<i>to get her to admire me.</i>

392
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,640
Would you like to eat with me?

393
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,309
Yes?

394
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,513
And Koroku?

395
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,650
Sure. My pleasure.

396
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,923
It's delicious.

397
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,399
Are you going to marry her?

398
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,010
Are you planning on marrying someone?

399
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,350
You like mushrooms
more than ladies, don't you?

400
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,889
Some mushrooms…

401
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:29,628
take nourishment
by breaking down and spoiling trees.

402
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,399
Others share nourishment with
the roots of trees and live with them.

403
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,303
Both are necessary to nature.

404
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,342
I think the same can be said about humans.

405
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,014
Marriage is not a natural thing.

406
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,553
Don't you love someone?

407
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,188
I'm sure you have fallen in love before.

408
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,861
I can't say never.

409
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,597
What was she like?

410
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,368
I'm sure she was a wonderful lady.

411
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,737
I wish I could meet her.

412
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:26,318
My father is rushing
to arrange my marriage.

413
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,591
Doctor.

414
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,362
Do you think I should get married?

415
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,967
Or should I keep loving someone?

416
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,237
I'm sorry to say, but…

417
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,141
not many people can become happy
by loving someone in this country.

418
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,348
I'm sure it's not easy.

419
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,722
But I think you two can make it.

420
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,327
Thank you, Doctor.

421
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,533
<i>When you got a new kind</i>
<i>of infectious disease,</i>

422
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:21,906
<i>I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>that I could take Saki from you.</i>

423
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,509
Doctor? Someone help!

424
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:30,815
<i>I have the most unrespectable</i>
<i>human emotion in my mind.</i>

425
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,122
Dr. Fukashi.

426
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,866
Saki.

427
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,068
You shouldn't come here.

428
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,136
Don't worry.

429
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:56,041
Dr. Fukashi told me that
he would cure your disease

430
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,176
by making a new medicine.

431
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:09,087
I will always be with you.

432
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,725
I promise you.

433
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,208
<i>Dr. Fukashi tried so hard</i>
<i>to cure my disease.</i>

434
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,676
<i>However…</i>

435
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,449
<i>he couldn't get a new serum ready in time.</i>

436
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,317
Koroku?

437
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,029
Koroku.

438
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,190
<i>I knew nothing about humans.</i>

439
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,227
<i>I didn't understand Saki at all.</i>

440
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:28,433
<i>I was wrong to leave her with him</i>
<i>as long as she wanted.</i>

441
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,177
Saki! Saki!

442
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:44,449
<i>She took poison and tried</i>
<i>to kill herself to be with him.</i>

443
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,253
<i>She might have escaped death.</i>

444
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,190
<i>But no one could guarantee</i>
<i>that she could live without him.</i>

445
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,128
<i>I wanted to save her from despair.</i>

446
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,804
<i>I couldn't have thought of anything</i>
<i>but to take the last resort…</i>

447
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,343
<i>which was to raise you</i>
<i>from death to see her again.</i>

448
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:32,964
<i>I decided to inject the bacteria</i>
<i>into your dead body.</i>

449
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:37,068
GERMAN: ETERNAL LIFE

450
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,271
Eternal life.

451
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,440
I found it.

452
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:49,480
<i>I wasn't jealous of you at that time.</i>

453
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,087
<i>It wasn't even for Saki.</i>

454
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,523
<i>I just wanted to save you.</i>

455
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,669
<i>I was overjoyed at your recovery</i>
<i>from death.</i>

456
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,606
<i>However…</i>

457
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,410
<i>you knew what had happened.</i>

458
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,850
<i>I sent you back to Saki</i>
<i>after I raised you from death.</i>

459
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,457
<i>I didn't expect your change.</i>

460
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,295
<i>It was my fault.</i>

461
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,832
<i>I shouldn't have let you do that.</i>

462
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,637
<i>You became a horrible monster</i>
<i>because of me.</i>

463
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,177
<i>Koroku.</i>

464
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,748
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

465
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,056
I see.

466
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,099
There was something
that I finally realized.

467
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,567
Yes?

468
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,672
I was born because
Dr. Fukashi was in love.

469
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,477
I was raised from his feelings for her.

470
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,717
It was not hatred, anger,
ambition, or desire of humans

471
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,488
but love of humans that gave life to me.

472
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:45,997
<i>That's why I could love humans.</i>

473
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:55,840
<i>That's why I fell in love with you.</i>

474
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,617
<i>My body can discharge the bacteria</i>
<i>that kills humans,</i>

475
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,589
<i>but I don't want to hurt anyone.</i>

476
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,325
<i>I don't want to kill anyone.</i>

477
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:21,099
<i>I want to help someone if I can.</i>

478
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,804
<i>I want to help people,</i>
<i>just like Dr. Fukashi did.</i>

479
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,607
This is my honest feeling.

480
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,813
This is my truth.

481
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,488
<i>What are you doing, Amakusa?</i>

482
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,089
<i>You should talk back to him.</i>

483
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,827
<i>Tell him that it must all be fake.</i>

484
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,365
<i>Say that you don't believe</i>
<i>what he just said.</i>

485
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,002
You should say that for the sake
of the show and yourself.

486
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,538
<i>Amakusa!</i>

487
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,873
<i>Deny him!</i>

488
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,207
<i>Amakusa!</i>

489
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,208
<i>Hey.</i>

490
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,377
<i>Amakusa, keep going.</i>

491
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,580
<i>This is my show.</i>

492
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,390
Thank you very much
for telling us the truth.

493
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,797
You didn't know anything.

494
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:33,438
You've been bearing the anxiety
and loneliness for 120 years

495
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,641
as a monster who can't die.

496
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,709
Yes.

497
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:45,349
Do you still want to live with humans…

498
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,653
even if you have a dangerous bacteria?

499
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:55,159
Because I am a monster
who has a dangerous bacteria,

500
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,596
I fell in love with humans

501
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,967
and I learned how wonderful they are,
more than anyone else.

502
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,239
By coming on the radio show,

503
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,976
I had fun for the first time in 120 years.

504
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,084
I also had fun seeing you, Franken.

505
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,054
Amakusa.

506
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:30,361
I am glad that I believed what you said.

507
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,335
I am glad that I believed in you.

508
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,175
What are you going to do from now on?

509
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:52,049
I hope that she will get well soon.

510
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,088
That's all I care about.

511
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,096
Franken.

512
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,067
Thank you very much.

513
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,105
Amakusa.

514
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,408
I thank you so much.

515
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,249
All right.

516
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,654
I hope to see you again.

517
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,760
When you worry about something
at snack time…

518
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,565
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

519
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,705
Thank you.

520
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,440
Thank you.

521
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,813
Tsugumi will get well soon.

522
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,986
I'm sure she understood what you said

523
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,121
and what is in your heart.

524
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,059
Yes.

525
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,561
I have to go.

526
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,180
Mr. Tokachi.

527
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,050
I am very sorry.

528
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,186
Okay.

529
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,154
You worked hard.

530
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,457
See you again.

531
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,126
Yes.

532
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,964
Thank you very much.

533
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,623
ETERNAL LIFE

534
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,104
HOSPITAL RECEPTION OF WARD VISITORS

535
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,507
Welcome back.

536
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,642
Hi, Ken.

537
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,678
Seiya.

538
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,482
Tsugumi was listening
to your radio appearance.

539
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,352
-Then she--
-No.

540
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,221
She is still sleeping.

541
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,661
Let's go see her.

542
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,498
Yes.

543
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,608
-Welcome back.
-Hello.

544
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,212
I think Tsugumi wants to see you.

545
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,116
Ken. Please see her.

546
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,553
Thank you.

547
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,312
Ken.

548
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,816
I went to the forest…

549
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,987
to look for the house you used to live in.

550
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,123
Why?

551
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:57,228
I wanted to know about the bacteria
that Dr. Fukashi had discovered

552
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,197
that can make human life immortal.

553
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,367
I wanted to find a clue.

554
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,238
And I found it.

555
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:12,610
This is the sample he had used
120 years ago.

556
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,846
I studied this bacteria
and found something interesting.

557
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,649
Something interesting?

558
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,287
It is very similar to the red mushroom
that you grow.

559
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:29,059
You always grow red mushrooms
when you are with Tsugaru.

560
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:35,032
If this mushroom is your heart…

561
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,038
<i>I think you can love humans.</i>

562
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:48,345
The red mushroom you grow may be
the evolutionary form of this.

563
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:54,685
It means that the bacteria you have
will work on human DNA

564
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,823
and regenerate human cells.

565
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,459
Only you can create this bacteria.

566
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,661
Isn't it great?

567
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,663
I found out one more thing.

568
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,631
It's not poisonous.

569
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,534
Not poisonous?

570
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,702
Yes.

571
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,038
It was confirmed that
the red mushroom you grow

572
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,707
cannot harm humans.

573
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,645
When you are in the mental situation
where you grow red mushrooms,

574
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,614
you can touch humans.

575
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:30,154
Ken, you can touch Tsugumi.

576
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,810
Tsugumi.

577
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:39,903
NEXT TIME

578
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,506
<i>Is there a person called Frankenstein?</i>

579
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,141
-Let him go!
-Stop this!

580
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,944
<i>Ken, you should live as you want.</i>

581
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:52,783
-<i>I want to keep Tsugumi happy. Goodbye.</i>
-Where are you, Ken?

582
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,951
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
