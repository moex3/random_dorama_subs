1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,973
Ken, you can touch Tsugumi.

2
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,842
Tsugumi.

3
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,730
Tsugumi woke up.

4
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,302
Tsugumi!

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,372
Tsugumi!

6
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,576
I will call a doctor.

7
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:17,911
Okay.

8
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,948
AFTER THE PUBLIC BROADCAST
OF THE RADIO SHOW WENT OFF THE AIR

9
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,283
THE MAN APPEARED AGAIN

10
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,018
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,753
-Boss.
-Huh?

12
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,655
Didn't Ken come home last night?

13
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,857
No. He must be with my son.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,759
So, I think he will be okay.

15
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,095
Do you think he will come back here?

16
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,729
I don't know.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,064
Boss.

18
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,799
It's your cell phone.

19
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,701
It's from Seiya.

20
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,707
Hello?

21
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,845
What?

22
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,314
Tsugumi regained consciousness?

23
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,615
Really?

24
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,783
Is she all right?

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,751
Ken saved her.

26
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:04,390
He awakened Tsugumi's DNA.
This may be too difficult for you.

27
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,292
Anyway, you are with Ken, right?

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,328
Tell him that we are waiting
for him to come home.

29
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,763
We are waiting for him.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,165
Okay.

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
Dad.

32
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:17,770
Thank you.

33
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,107
INANIWA CORPORATION

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,376
Stop spacing out.

35
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,111
What happened to Tsugumi?

36
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,247
It's a miracle.

37
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:28,581
Miracle?

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,385
My son said thank you.

39
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,221
I didn't ask you that.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,057
It's time to work.

41
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,833
I don't know why,

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,636
but her brainstem hemorrhage is gone.

43
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,571
Did she get well?

44
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,341
I can only say
that her recovery was a miracle.

45
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,878
I haven't seen or heard of any case
like this before.

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,815
This was because Ken held her hand.

47
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,652
Huh?

48
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:11,958
Ken cured her and woke her up.

49
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,862
I think so too.

50
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,932
Haruka.

51
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,303
You did a good job too.

52
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,706
Grandma.

53
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,546
My memories before I became
a monster came back.

54
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,148
What?

55
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,586
I talked all about it on the radio.

56
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,421
SPECIAL CARE UNIT

57
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,258
My name is Koroku Yamabe.

58
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,828
I was an assistant to Dr. Fukashi

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,331
at the Infectious Disease
Research Institute.

60
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:57,437
That's when I met Saki
and fell in love with her.

61
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,775
Dr. Fukashi also fell in love with Saki.

62
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,447
He raised me from the dead after
I died from a contagious disease

63
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,718
for the sake of Saki.

64
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,587
I…

65
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,257
I was reborn because he fell in love.

66
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,863
But after I became a monster,

67
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,168
I killed Saki 120 years ago.

68
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,506
My sin won't fade away.

69
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,711
But you saved Tsugumi.

70
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,749
You saved her because you carry bacteria.

71
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,918
Did he save me?

72
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,856
Scientifically, it's not proven yet.

73
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,699
Ken.

74
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,335
Thank you.

75
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,140
Seiya helped me.

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,375
I didn't do anything.

77
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,177
Seiya.

78
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,113
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,350
Congratulations.

80
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,021
<i>What did the listeners say?</i>

81
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,024
Most of them didn't really get it.

82
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,194
He talked about a story from
120 years ago all of a sudden.

83
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,930
"Bacteria is disgusting."

84
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,465
"He killed his girlfriend."

85
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,868
"It's bad that the radio station
used such a dangerous guy."

86
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,070
Something like that.

87
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,740
There are some people who believe
and support Franken too.

88
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,277
Amakusa. I told you to deny
that he was a monster.

89
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,779
You should have said
that we didn't believe him.

90
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,549
What are you talking about?

91
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,086
Amakusa talked about himself honestly.
That's all.

92
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,420
Huh?

93
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:59,158
It's true that
you used Amakusa and Franken.

94
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,829
I don't think you could have
finished this topic

95
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,630
with a great rating from the listeners.

96
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,899
Are you taking his side now?

97
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,002
I think Amakusa was brave.

98
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,137
I was moved.

99
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,038
Shut up.

100
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,607
That guy wouldn't have come to the radio

101
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,477
if he didn't agree with what Amakusa said.

102
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,981
Amakusa wanted to be true to him
in the end.

103
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,118
Well said.

104
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,354
The producer should be responsible
for the rest of it.

105
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,289
I am responsible for it too.

106
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,192
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,629
Tokachi, Ririe.

108
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:42,602
It's no doubt that I used
the monster in my favor.

109
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,206
I asked him to come to the radio.

110
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,012
But I liked him in the end.

111
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,582
And I am relieved that I liked him.

112
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,484
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,123
It's all my fault.

114
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,966
It's from Seiya.

115
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,837
Hello. This is Amakusa.

116
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,405
Hi, Amakusa.

117
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,575
Tsugumi recovered from her illness.

118
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,544
Did Tsugaru recover?

119
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:30,716
The bacteria he produced
might've worked on Tsugaru's DNA.

120
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,921
Ken can touch Tsugumi now.

121
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,399
I won't take that kind of interview.

122
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,604
It's none of your business,
even if I am put in a bad situation.

123
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,606
Anyway, tell them that I won't see them.

124
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,341
Thanks.

125
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,311
Darn it.

126
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,582
Shut up.

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,651
How's this?

128
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,222
Excuse me.

129
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,791
Hello.

130
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,327
Hey.

131
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,897
Thank you for worrying about me.

132
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,067
I won't be surprised at a thing like this.

133
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,037
After 120 years,

134
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,375
you finally saved the life
of your girlfriend.

135
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,743
Yes.

136
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,545
Well…

137
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,283
I should say that Dr. Fukashi
saved you and your girlfriend.

138
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,552
That's right.

139
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,554
That's great.

140
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,291
Thank you, Professor Tsurumaru.

141
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,262
It's nice to hear that from my senior.

142
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,732
Do you think Tsugumi's recovery
has something to do

143
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,301
with the story 120 years ago?

144
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,988
<i>I don't know if Saki and Tsugumi</i>
<i>has any causal relationship.</i>

145
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,791
<i>Maybe after Saki was infected</i>
<i>with bacteria,</i>

146
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:23,930
<i>it was hidden in her DNA</i>
<i>and inherited by Tsugumi.</i>

147
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,103
In any case, it was DNA that carried it.

148
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,740
The DNA of the bacteria that you produced

149
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,277
awakened the DNA of Tsugumi.

150
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:44,317
Both of you raised a revolution of DNA.

151
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,288
I am worried
that we are causing you trouble.

152
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:50,957
No worries.

153
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,060
I am fine.

154
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:02,201
How are you going to live?

155
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,904
That's the problem.

156
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,075
I am ready to do anything.

157
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,648
We will have a party to celebrate
her recovery from illness tonight.

158
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,849
Would you like to join us?

159
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,854
No. I am celebrating
her recovery by myself.

160
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,123
Got it.

161
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,860
Tsugumi.

162
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,299
I am fine, no matter
what happens in the future.

163
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,802
I decided that I will do what I can do.

164
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,678
I appreciate you.

165
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,884
You are Koroku Yamabe
and also Ken Fukashi.

166
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,720
Yes.

167
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,756
I…

168
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,560
I am Tsugumi Tsugaru and also Saki.

169
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,399
I love you.

170
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,403
I have loved you since 120 years ago.

171
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,658
Is that delicious?

172
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,528
Yes, I love this.

173
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,934
It's so delicious.

174
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,438
Are you ready?

175
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,973
Say cheese.

176
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,675
Here you go.

177
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,777
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

178
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,586
Congratulations on your recovery, Tsugumi.

179
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,087
Thank you.

180
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,425
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

181
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,965
It's nice to have beer and sing
at a restaurant once in a while.

182
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,233
You don't have to sing.

183
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,536
What if Tsugumi becomes sick again
by hearing your song?

184
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,171
I'm fine.

185
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,173
If you are fine, why don't you
go out, just the two of you?

186
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,408
You are always too extreme.

187
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,744
The boss's singing voice is really bad.

188
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,679
You love his voice anyway.

189
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,214
Do you want me to kill you?

190
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,250
Murozono.

191
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,985
No.

192
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,955
It sounds like Ken talks with dignity.

193
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,057
It's because he's lived
for over 120 years.

194
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:17,062
There is a sake called
"One Hundred Years of Solitude".

195
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,433
The boss is such a light-hearted character
compared to Ken.

196
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,035
It's the name of a novel.

197
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,372
<i>Fight, it's a song</i>
<i>For you who is fighting…</i>

198
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,907
I told you not to sing.

199
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,709
Anyway, it all went well for everyone.

200
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,112
Tsugumi recovered.

201
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,481
Now Ken can work with us
without worrying about anything.

202
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,615
Yes.

203
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:42,655
By the way, can I call you Ken
just as before?

204
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,090
Why do you ask?

205
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,625
Because you remembered your real name.

206
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,161
Don't worry about such a thing.

207
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,132
Is it okay for you to work with us
as a carpenter?

208
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
You used to be a doctor.

209
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,337
What are you talking about, Shishikui?

210
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:03,509
The medical knowledge I learnt
is of no use today.

211
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,012
Do you still want to study medicine?

212
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,148
What are you trying to say?

213
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,650
Nothing in particular.

214
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,186
I just want to know what Ken is thinking.

215
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:19,225
I want to work as a carpenter
if it's okay for you.

216
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,094
Good.

217
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,396
Sure, of course.

218
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,232
He got used to our job these days.

219
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,067
He should make use of what he's got.

220
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,335
But…

221
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,239
you may not be able to work
with us anymore.

222
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,376
Shishikui! Let's not talk about that.

223
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,578
What do you mean?

224
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,616
Our clients started canceling
our projects.

225
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,952
Even the contract where
we haven't started the design phase.

226
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,554
Why?

227
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,123
I don't know, but they know
that Ken lives with us.

228
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,893
They are kind of scared.

229
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,829
Don't worry.

230
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,332
That's not what I'm saying.

231
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,202
But, Boss, we should see the reality.

232
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,271
You can leave if you are not happy.

233
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,578
Shishikui, Yonago, Iizuka, Mikoto.

234
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,247
You can work anywhere.

235
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,517
I will find your new employer.

236
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,319
I won't go anywhere.

237
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,487
Me neither.

238
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,222
But we have no job.

239
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,524
I have to earn money for my family.

240
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,861
I am sorry.

241
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,263
Boss.

242
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,300
I will move out soon.

243
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,635
That's not what I want.

244
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,603
Listen, Ken.

245
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:42,274
There is a job that you can say
is your lifework.

246
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,977
You shouldn't be swayed
by those around you.

247
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,580
If I let you go,

248
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,883
I may be able to pull
my company together again

249
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,453
but I will lose our relationship.

250
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,122
I can't stand it.

251
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,324
If I do such a thing,

252
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,460
I will deny my life,
my philosophy, my job…

253
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,663
and everything.

254
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,667
I'm just being selfish. Please forgive me.

255
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,204
Boss.

256
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,908
-I feel the same.
-Me too.

257
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,880
I love this work as well as Ken
no matter what happens.

258
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,384
I can say so because my husband is rich.

259
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,255
Well, there is always hope in reality.

260
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,291
There is always a job in human society.

261
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,228
You can't build a house
if you can't support a man.

262
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,466
-Boss!
-Boss!

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,901
He is annoying!

264
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,938
He is annoying!

265
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,273
You will be fine.

266
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,645
Just as people in your company
have accepted you,

267
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,116
other people will understand you soon.

268
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,352
You will be busy soon.

269
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,455
I hope so.

270
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,227
I wish everyone happiness.

271
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,230
I wish you happiness too.

272
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,278
I want you to study hard at university.

273
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,582
Okay.

274
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,687
I want you to be happy.

275
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,864
I am happy.

276
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,278
INANIWA CORPORATION

277
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,349
Boss.

278
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,653
-Are you Mr. Inaniwa?
-Yes.

279
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,888
I'm Inaniwa,
and I'm the company president.

280
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,990
We are from the public health center.

281
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,559
The public health center?

282
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,360
What's wrong?

283
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,930
We came because we had
many calls from your neighbors.

284
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,167
I'm sure there is a man
named Koroku Yamabe.

285
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,203
Why are the police here?

286
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,439
We just want to avoid confusion.

287
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,342
We want to hear from him as well.

288
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,078
There is no such man.

289
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,983
Then how about a man
called Frankenstein on the radio?

290
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,319
I'm sure he lives here.

291
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,787
Then what?

292
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,124
We came because we received
a request from the neighbors.

293
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,261
He carries bacteria
that is not identified.

294
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,930
We can't just overlook it.

295
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,000
The neighbors are very scared.

296
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,635
What do you want me to do?

297
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:02,040
We would like to examine him
to see if it's true.

298
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,109
Ken won't hurt anyone.

299
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,878
I am responsible for him.

300
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,948
He can come home
once he is identified as a human.

301
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,916
Boss.

302
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,090
I will go with them.

303
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,625
Ken.

304
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,662
I knew this would happen
once I went on the radio.

305
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,265
I will accept any punishment.

306
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,102
I don't want to cause trouble to anyone.

307
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,837
Wait, Ken.

308
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,472
Seiya.

309
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,042
I am fine. I can go anywhere.

310
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,044
I am not alone.

311
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,913
How about Tsugumi?

312
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,383
If you go, you won't be able to come back.

313
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,754
Wherever I go, I am with Tsugumi.

314
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,310
I always wish you happiness.

315
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,712
Thank you.

316
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,449
Thank you for everything.

317
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,220
-Ken!
-Ken!

318
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,522
Let's go.

319
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,411
Wait, Ken!

320
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,182
Don't go.

321
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,351
You don't have to go.

322
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,121
You don't have to get pushed around
at the whim of humans.

323
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,693
You should live as you like.

324
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,035
Who do you think is harmful?

325
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,340
Run! Go, Ken!

326
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,443
Run! Mikoto!

327
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,279
Yes!

328
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,785
Hey!

329
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,920
-Ken!
-Ken!

330
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,522
-Run.
-Go quickly.

331
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,423
Run!

332
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,093
-Go, Ken!
-Run!

333
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,461
-Hurry up.
-Go Ken.

334
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,963
Ken! Go!

335
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,231
-Go!
-Run!

336
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,066
-Run.
-Escape.

337
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,808

-Run!

Are you going without seeing Tsugumi?

343
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,460
What should I tell her?

344
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,030
Please tell her nothing.

345
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,465
Huh?

346
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,903
I want Tsugumi to live her own life.

347
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,310
But I feel so sorry for Tsugumi.

348
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,514
I want to protect her happiness.

349
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,586
I know.

350
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,322
But…

351
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,392
But I'll miss you.

353
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,770
Thank you very much.

Call me Mikoto.

355
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,946
I'm sure you are happy
that Seiya called you Mikoto.

356
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,883
You don't have to tell me that.

357
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,719
I…

358
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,523
I was happy to see you, Mikoto.

359
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,935
You are our friend.

360
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,271
Yes.

361
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,477
Come back anytime.

362
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,980
They will forget about you soon.

363
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,217
Come back and see Tsugumi.

364
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,854
Promise me?

365
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,492
Mikoto.

366
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,428
Take care of yourself.

367
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:37,976
Take care of yourself too.

368
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,050
Goodbye.

Where is Ken?

00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,309
-He went back to the forest.
-To the forest?

373
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,980
He told me not to tell Tsugumi.

374
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:16,915
Huh?

375
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,987
Ken doesn't want
to disturb Tsugumi's life.

376
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,357
It's cruel to her.

377
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,993
But…

378
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,532
That's true love.

00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:37,836

Let's go home.

382
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,312
Mikoto.

383
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,248
Yeah.

384
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,686
How should I call you?

385
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,288
Young master?

386
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,356
Do you want me to kill you?

387
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,592
Not like that, like this?
Do you want me to kill you?

388
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,127
Isn't that the same?

389
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,135
Tsugumi.

390
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,807
Where is Ken?

391
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,510
Ken…

392
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,880
We tried.

393
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,582
He went back to the forest, didn't he?

394
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,552
Yes.

395
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,589
He said he wanted
to protect your happiness.

396
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,459
Tsugumi.

397

Tsugumi.

398
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,601
Tsugumi!

399
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,146
Hello.

400
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,150
The police and the media
are trying to find Franken.

401
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,885
He hasn't been found yet.

402
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,588
You don't have to call him
Franken anymore.

403
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,357
Everyone knows the facts.

404
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,627
Our radio show is going to be cut
by the end of this month.

405
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,264
We made a bet and it's out of control.

406
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,300
We had no choice.

407
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,334
I am very sorry.

408
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,503
I told you that it wasn't your fault.

409
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,674
We will keep the show until
the next program is ready.

410
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,812
But Amakusa's Corner is already canceled.

411
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,448
-Sorry.
-No.

412
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,684
I understand.

413
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:42,127
Thank you very much for everything.

416

You won't be called
for any program for a while.

417
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,149
But I won't give up.

I…

420
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,358
I didn't want a monster
to come to our show.

421
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,629
I just wanted to make a show
like a monster.

422
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,834
I won't give up my dream.

423
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,302
So…

424
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,673
please be prepared, Amakusa.

425
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,943
Okay.

426
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,879
Thank you.

427
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,517
It was a mystery.

428
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,220
He was a monster.

429
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,356
But he was like poison to someone
and medicine to the other.

430
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,491
Well,

431
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,828
we used our hearts

432
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,396
to create a monster and a radio show.

433
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,498
You are scary…

434
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,334
but funny.

435
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,539
See you. Take care.

436
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,142

He will come back to the radio someday.

of the Department of Agriculture

484
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,272
They announced that they found
Akanarikamitake mushrooms.

485
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,208
It's only supposed to grow
in a primeval coniferous forest,

486
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,411
but they said they found it.

487
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:30,081
This must be Akanarikamitake-modoki.

505
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,101
Ken.

506
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,270
I want to show you something.

507
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,605
Let's go together.

508
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,306
Okay.

509
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,348
Look.

510
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,984
We bought this for fieldwork.

511
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,153
Fieldwork?

512
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,022
We can culture bacteria here.

513
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,426
Let's get in.

514
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,508
We cultured bacteria here

515
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,777
and brought it to the university
to examine.

516
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,281
I can go to any forest in Japan
by driving this car.

517
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,618
I will take turns with Tsugumi
to be with you

518
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,720
and culture bacteria.

519
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,290
I'm sure we can put your bacteria to use.

520
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,493
This is not for you, it's all for us.

521
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,862
It's the ego of a scientist.

522
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,666
I would like you to study with us.

523
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,534
Study?

524
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:47,038
You will become a doctor of yourself.

525
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,174
A doctor of myself?

526
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:55,913
You never know what kind of bacteria
you will discharge.

527
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,685
I want you to create many bacteria
that are nice to humans if possible.

528
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:05,056
And you will study about
the bacteria that you create

529
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:09,160
as a member of our team, of course.

530
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,297
We want to cure incurable diseases.

531
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,470
This is to pass the baton of life
from you.

532
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,973
It's my dream.

533
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,978
Let's make a revolution together.

534
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,549
I…

535
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,487
Can I help humans?

536
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,224
We will prove it with you from now on.

537
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,898
I promise you that we will prove it.

538
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,934
Ken.

539
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,639
Yes.

540
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,042
I understand.

541
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,973
<i>Love poison of devils and angels</i>

542
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,143
<i>The future is always a story of idealism</i>

543
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,913
<i>If you are worried about something…</i>

544
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,218
<i>Ask Amakusa</i>

545
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,788
<i>Hi. This is Junpei Amakusa.</i>

546
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,323
<i>I will answer the phone</i>
<i>to solve the problem</i>

547
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,525
<i>that you are worrying about.</i>

548
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,393
-<i>Hello.</i>
-<i>Hello.</i>

549
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,262
<i>Hi. This is Junpei Amakusa.</i>

550
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,465
<i>Please tell me what you are worried about.</i>

551
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,766
<i>Yes.</i>

552
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,204
<i>I'm worried whether people</i>
<i>don't like me these days.</i>

553
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,307
<i>I can't go out</i>
<i>because I'm scared of people.</i>

554
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,276
-<i>I see.</i>
-This is incredible.

555
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,777
<i>Let's do this.</i>

556
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,214
<i>Don't think that there is a town outside.</i>

557
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,584
<i>Just think that it's a forest</i>
<i>when you go out.</i>

558
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,186
<i>A forest?</i>

559
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,089
<i>You don't have to interact with others.</i>

560
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,857
<i>When you see someone,</i>

561
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,660
<i>don't worry about</i>
<i>what others think of you.</i>

562
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,498
<i>Imagine that others may think</i>
<i>the same way as you think.</i>

563
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,134
<i>Maybe they are scared of people as well.</i>

564
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:36,374
<i>Then imagine what you would say to them.</i>

565
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,742
I passed the exam.

566
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:42,113
<i>You are scared of people because</i>
<i>you can imagine what others think.</i>

567
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,349
<i>When you want to tell people</i>
<i>that they don't have to be scared,</i>

568
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,387
<i>then you will be able</i>
<i>to love someone naturally.</i>

569
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:02,600
KEN FUKASHI

570
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,920
Tsugumi.

571
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,024
This is a very nice tree.

572
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,460
It's full of vital energy.

573
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,229
I'm sure I can produce
good bacteria from it.

574
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,266
-Will you try?
-Sure.

575
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,629
Let's go.

576
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,131
Okay.

577
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,089
A FEW DECADES LATER

578
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,879
-Hi.
-Hello.

579
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,751
Here is a new bacteria and its record.

580
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,786
Thank you.

581
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,025
How are Seiya and Mikoto doing?

582
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:48,926
Good.

583
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,529
Grandpa and Grandma always
want to see you, Ken.

584
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,132
I will come visit them soon.

585
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,769
Ken.

586
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,972
It's been a year
since Tsugumi passed away.

587
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,540
Are you going to stay here?

588
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,543
People in the world are grateful for you.

589
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,314
This is where I feel at home the most.

590
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,884
I will stay here, with Tsugumi.

591
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,921
Tsugumi must be happy.

592
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,858
Let me bring them back.

593
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,928
I promise you that we will develop
a great medicine again.

594
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,665
I bet so.

595
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,992
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
