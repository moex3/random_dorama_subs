NO STYROFOAM ALLOWED

6
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,548
What do you want to talk about?

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,600
How far are we going?

8
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,319
ENTRANCE - TSUKIJI UOICHIBA

9
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,445
Who the hell are you?

10
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,494
Public Safety Bureau?

11
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,147
[stranger] I'll start
with what you already know.

12
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:23,579
A few months ago,
an office worker paid off someone

13
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:28,547
who blackmailed him with pictures

14
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,133
of him and a woman entering a love hotel.

15
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,980
That woman is a friend of yours.

16
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,030
Do you have proof it was me?

17
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,788
Then just arrest me.

18
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:48,294
[stranger] I'm neither a detective
or an officer of the Bureau.

19
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,135
Nor am I from the syndicate.

20
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,223
[worker] Then we are done here.

21
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,601
[stranger] Sit down!

22
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:08,459
This is the blackmail letter
Secretary-General Takeuchi received.

23
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,213
CONTAINS SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS
SECRETARY-GENERAL SO TAKEUCHI

24
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,056
It demands money

25
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,939
in exchange
for not reporting his son to the police

26
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,444
for his involvement in a bar fight.

27
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,876
That is what I know.

28
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,055
Your eyes--

29
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,061
You must be…

30
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:42,654
…that man.

31
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,745
The one who sees everything.

32
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,420
The man who controls all money and power.

33
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:58,936
You are…

34
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,819
…the Owl.

35
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,452
[Owl] There is no such man.

36
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,884
-[slams into door]
-Shit.

[chuckles]

44

ONLY SON
OF SECRETARY-GENERAL SO TAKEUCHI

45
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,902
PASSED AWAY

46
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,572
WAS HE INVOLVED IN A BRAWL?

47
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:40,884
To lose your only son like that.

48
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:46,395
Mrs. Takeuchi must be devastated.

49
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:53,075
Manabu was friends with Ryu
when they were in kindergarten.

50
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,038
Don't you remember?

51
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,750
Will Ryu be coming tonight?

52
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,505
I let him know his father

53
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,181
is having a birthday party for once.

54
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:06,185
What did he say?

55
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:10,944
We haven't talked since he called

56
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,324
to say he came back from America.

57
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,125
I wonder who he takes after.

58
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,758
Please don't mind me.

59
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,891
What time should I leave for the funeral?

60
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:29,899
I'll send a car for you later.

61
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,487
He was so young.

62
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,957
It's too cruel.

63
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,461
Everything…

64
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,637
happens…

65
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,935
…for a reason.

66
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:54,030

68
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,465
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

69
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,764
-Sorry about that.
-[groans]

70
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,017
[in English] It's broken.

71
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,731
I'm so sorry. It's totally my fault.

72
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:13,360
It's an accident. You speak English?

73
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,906
Yeah, from my time in the US.

74
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,491
Oh, where in the States?

75
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,828
Boston, mostly. Um…

76
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,632
So, I don't have enough cash
on me right now and I gotta go.

77
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:27,347
Can I meet you later
so I can pay you to get your phone fixed?

78
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,184
Oh, sure. Thanks.

79
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,648
Um, how can I, uh--

80
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,733
Oh, uh--

81
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,660
Sarah. What's your name?

82
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,582
Ryu, Ryu Ogami. Thank you.

83
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,214
I don't have a card on me,
but I'll call you later.

84
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,928
All right. You promise?

85
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,013
I promise.

-[in Japanese] Morning.
-Morning.

89
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,268
I'm going to be late.

90
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,024
What about today?

91
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,036
You have work again.

92
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,082
[person] What about you?

93
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,461
[person 2] Audition.

94
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,340
I'm meeting a producer.

95
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,054
[person] And tonight?

96
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,520
My dad's birthday party.

97
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,026
Ryutaro Ogami's 70th birthday.

98
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,990
I've never had a birthday party
for my old man.

99
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,372
Want to come?

100
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,338
I've got work to catch up on.

101
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,056
-I knew it.
-[chuckles]

102
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,275
But you have to meet him one day.

103
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,076
Will he like me?

104
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,084
Absolutely not.

105
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,963
I thought so.

106
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,969
He doesn't like anybody.

107
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,766
Especially if they're my boyfriend.

108
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,398
People change eventually, you know.

109
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,989
Not my dad.

110
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,094
Honey…

111
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:56,521
what do you think?

112
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,027
-For tonight?
-Yes.

113
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:02,574
It's your father's birthday party.

114
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,331
Do you want him to think…

115
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,672
I married a hostess?

116
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,097
I thought you'd like it.

117
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,395
Do you have any idea
what kind of family we Ogamis are?

118
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:21,278
It's always like this.

119
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:22,906
What is?

120
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,035
Don't you hate everything I do?

121
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,127
Take a good look at yourself.

122
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:31,381
You're the wife of the eldest Ogami.

123
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,055
Then why don't you go alone?

124
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,686
What are you saying? Just dress properly.

125
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,155
[child giggles]

126
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,328
-Make sure you have everything.
-Okay.

127
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,625
[student] Yeah, they'll figure it out.

128
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,169
[parent] All done.

129
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,964
Papa's not here yet.

130
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,635
We'll be late.

131
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,262
You're right. Shall we go?

132
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,682
Let's go without him.

133
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,354
All right. Let's go.

134
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:01,776
Let's go.

135
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,238
-He's here.
-Sorry I took so long.

136
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,911
Hey! Okay, let's go.

137
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,425
You didn't forget about tonight?
My father's birthday party.

138
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:18,100
I have an important meeting tonight.

139
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:22,108
You know this is important too.

140
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:23,986
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,284
This isn't your average birthday party.

142
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,372
I can't do anything about it. It's work.

143
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,420
Your father will understand.

144
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,967
His generation gave up their holidays
to work.

145
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:36,679
Right, Shin?

146
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,933
Yep.

147
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,701
Good morning.

148
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,468
METROPOLITAN POLICE

149
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:59,098
There are no witnesses at this time.

150
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,689
I'll have the police report

151
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:06,279
<i>and autopsy results later today.</i>

152
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:08,618
The drug test?

153
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,705
I've taken care of it.

154
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,838
The police will report he tested negative.

155
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,428
But there is one thing.

156
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,646
<i>There are rumors of a pesky reporter</i>

157
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:29,367
questioning if Manabu was a perpetrator
instead of a victim.

158
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,289
The reporter's name?

159
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:34,460
I'll inform you as soon as I know.

160
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,137
-Are you on your way to the funeral?
- <i>Yes.</i>

161
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,438
For someone like that
to ask for your help…

162
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,071
The line separating enemies and allies

163
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,535
is never straight.

I am sorry for your loss.

Thank you for attending today.

As the son of the secretary-general

he had a strong sense of justice

He prioritized creating a better society.

His passion for public service

179
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:38,041
led him
to actively help clean public spaces

and volunteer in care facilities.

[Owl] <i>That's the story
you believe is the truth.</i>

341
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:47,002
There is no need for you

342
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:50,134
to make this story public.

343
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,114
BANK STATEMENT

344
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:05,748
Can you tell me why you received

345
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,592
such large sums of money?

346
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:16,771
You're not the one

347
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:22,114
who decides which stories to publish.

348
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:24,661
I do.

349
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:32,802
Manabu Takeuchi unfortunately died

350
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,683
while trying to stop a brawl.

351
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,944
That is the entire story.

352
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,007
[assistant]
I will keep my eyes on him for now.

353
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:53,134
Good.

354
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:56,015
[assistant]
Was Mr. Saijo really behind it?

355
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:57,936
There is no doubt.

356
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:03,614
[in English] Well, I'm glad you came,

357
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:05,660
and this is for you.

358
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:07,998
Wow, thank you.

359
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,214
Japanese people are so nice.

360
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:15,304
If this was New York, my phone would be
on sale at a corner pawnshop,

361
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,557
and you'd be long gone.

362
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,688
It's the right thing to do.
It's not because I'm Japanese.

363
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:22,234
You mean you're not Japanese?

364
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:27,328
Well, I am Japanese. Although,
sometimes I do feel like I'm a foreigner.

365
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:29,248
Oh, I know. I do.

366
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,336
That's because you are a foreigner.

367
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,887
No, I… [chuckles] …I mean sometimes
in America I felt like a foreigner.

368
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:38,726
I guess that's one of the reasons
why I came here.

369
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:41,857
What do you do?

370
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:46,449
I just got back from the States.
I'm working at an NPO right now.

371
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,495
Are you saving the whales?

372
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:51,292
Sorta. Saving people.

373
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,463
Which is even harder.

374
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:57,806
The NPO helps the elderly
with housing and assisted care,

375
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,768
especially in rural areas,

376
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:04,110
and create balanced life programs
in urban areas.

377
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,575
Part of implementing agricultural reforms.

378
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,120
That's nice of you.

379
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:12,376
And you're a journalist.

380
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:17,302
Yup. Um-- Japan,
but some reporting on Asia too.

381
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:20,100
That's interesting.

382
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,028
So you're just a nice, good-looking,
rich guy who likes to take morning jogs?

383
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,281
[chuckles]

384
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,955
I'm none of those. Well, perhaps nice.

385
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,003
Well your family's got to be rich
to send you to school in America.

386
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,715
I actually got a scholarship.

387
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,554
I didn't think they give those anymore.

388
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,267
[scoffs] They only take your money
these days.

389
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:44,858
That's one of the reasons
why I feel like I need to give back.

390
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:51,830
[person, in Japanese]
What will happen to the suspect?

391
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,920
[Owl] That depends on you.

392
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:57,967
[person] What's the best option?

393
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:04,438
[Owl] I can end his life
in the holding cell.

394
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,966
He killed my son.

395
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,472
He deserves to be punished.

396
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:24,646
I'm the one

397
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,863
who made Manabu the way he is.

398
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:31,242
The fault lies with Manabu.

399
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,537
You're wrong.

400
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,002
I'd feel better if I believed that,

401
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:40,427
but I was the one who raised my son.

402
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,601
No.

403
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,567
We made him that way.

404
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:49,738
Mr. Ogami.

405
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:54,831
We both thought only about our country.

406
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,381
Paying no attention to our children.

407
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,595
Didn't we?

408
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,980
I don't want you to suffer as I have.

409
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,823
Manabu was truly a kind child.

410
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:19,088
He used to stay up late
waiting for me every night.

411
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:25,308
But I never came home.

412
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,567
You are not responsible for his death.

413
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,534
I turned a blind eye

414
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:37,542
to everything he did.

415
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,265
Aren't you the same, Mr. Ogami?

416
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,562
Am I wrong?

417
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:51,778
My children are all grown-up.

418
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:53,991
No, they're not.

419
00:31:56,412 --> 00:32:01,255
They will always be our children.

420
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:07,309
I've had it. I'll just marry someone else.

421
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,610
[sobbing] I'm already past my prime.

I can't wait anymore.

Nami!

00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:31,942
Will you take me to your father's party?

[footsteps approaching]

429
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,606
I can't write the article.

430
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,236
Why?

431
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,952
[Tanaka] That man is too powerful.

432
00:32:58,452 --> 00:32:59,454
That man?

433
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:01,626
You already know.

434
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:05,634
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

435
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,270
My husband is also

436
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,067
responsible for my son's death.

437
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,407
Isn't this enough?

438
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:19,871
The killer will be punished.

439
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:24,589
You and your husband will receive
the public's sympathy.

440
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:27,637
I don't need their sympathy.

441
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,561
I want my son back.

442
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:36,028
[sobbing] I want to see my son
alive again.

I discovered something unexpected.

You don't need to come tonight, Saho.

449
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:18,530
What do you mean?

450
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:20,241
It's a family event.

451
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,580
I'm family too.

452
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,501
Direct family.

453
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,548
Blood relations only.

454
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,384
Go see your friends.

455
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:31,931
What?

456
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:35,814
You complained about my dress
this morning, and now you're saying this?

457
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:37,610
I don't mean anything.

458
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,488
But you can't come.

459
00:34:39,572 --> 00:34:40,574

[dog yelps]

00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:57,817
Please get in.

462
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,337
[Mrs. Takeuchi]
You already know everything.

463
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:15,393
Why destroy everything you built
with your husband?

464
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,236
He did it all himself.

465
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,700
It has nothing to do with me.

466
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,165
You are husband and wife.

467
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,503
A family.

468
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,883
What family?

469
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:36,393
You're no different from him.

470
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:50,213
My husband drove my son to his death.

471
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:55,473
I was powerless to stop him.

472
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:03,907
Manabu often played with your Ryu
when they were young.

473
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,794
Would you be just as calm

474
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,552
if it was Ryu who died?

475
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,979
-I apologize--
-I don't understand.

476
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:24,364
Why would you want the world to know?

477
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,707
If you make it all disappear…

478
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:39,144
If you make it all disappear,

479
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:46,074
the people will know nothing
and make So the next prime minister.

480
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:49,497
Is that the right thing to do?

481
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,378
Nothing can be changed now.

482
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:57,096
The killer will receive his sentence.

483
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:02,023
Manabu will be remembered

484
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:05,697
as a hero who sacrificed his life.

485
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:09,287
And So?

486
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,214
That will depend on you.

487
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:16,928
However,

488
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:22,940
it all depends on God.

489
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,240
God.

490
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,716
You mean you, Mr. Ogami?

-Happy birthday, Grandfather.

Is the prime minister really coming?

502
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,393
Yes. Mr. Ogami is why she got that seat.

503
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:25,189
[guest 2] Happy birthday, Mr. Ogami.

504
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:27,485
[guest 3] Happy birthday.

505
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:28,822
Thank you.

506
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:32,328
[announcer] We will now give a toast.

I ask everyone to stand.

508
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:37,548

Happy birthday, Mr. Ogami.

514
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:22,930
Japan and the world
have changed so much in these 70 years.

515
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:28,524
You have always stood behind
this country's development, providing

516
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:34,452
your support for the prosperity
of the nation and its citizens.

517
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:38,126
I thank you and your wonderful family

518
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:43,470
from the bottom of my heart.

519

[announcer]
Please have your glasses ready.

520
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:56,204
I truly wish you a happy birthday.

521
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:57,289
Cheers!

522

[all] Cheers.

The rumors were true.

524
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,194
The nation owes a debt to Ryutaro Ogami.

525
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:17,622
Thank you, Prime Minister.

RYU OGAMI

527
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:32,611
Where's Ryu?

528
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:34,405
[guest 4] This is good.

529
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,537
I don't know. He hasn't said anything.

530
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:40,794
What a horrible son.

531
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:43,048
Not attending his father's
70th birthday party.

532
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:44,802
The next time I see him…

533
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:46,847
Stop it. How embarrassing.

534
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,812
Who are you to talk?

535
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,816
This is a party for Father.

536
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:06,762
-Kyoko.
-Yes?

537
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:09,100
Where's Ichiro's wife?

538
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:14,193
Not sure. He never talks about her.

539
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,283
[Ichiro] Did you want some champagne?

540
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:18,995
[Nami] I'm fine.

541
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:24,130
Father. Sorry, I haven't introduced her.

542
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:26,259
This is Nami Kawabata.

543
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,514
She's my assistant.

544
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:31,269
She is my guest tonight.

545
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:34,902
Thank you for helping Ichiro in his work.

546
00:41:34,985 --> 00:41:36,780
[chuckles] It's my pleasure.

547
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:40,078
Happy birthday.

548
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:41,247
Can I speak with you?

549
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,501
Yes.

550
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:49,305
-[grandchild 1] I'll go get some juice.
-[grandchild 2] I'll go with you.

551
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,071
It's always the same thing.

552
00:42:00,077 --> 00:42:01,412
What is?

553
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:03,291
Never mind.

554
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,254
You won't understand it yet.

555
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:09,220
Don't treat me like a kid.

556
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:10,598
I'm not.

557
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,854
Acting like you know everything.

558
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:15,900
Why are you saying that?

559
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:24,668
It's impossible for me
to live a perfect life like you.

560
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:35,940
Where's Saho?

561
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:39,906
She didn't feel well. I'm sorry.

562
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:41,577
Is that why

563
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:47,630
you brought your mistress to this party?

564
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,676
She's not my mistress.

565
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:51,387
She's my assistant.

566
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:55,020
Does your father look like someone

567
00:42:56,022 --> 00:43:01,282
who can't see past your flimsy lies?

568
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:04,038
No.

569
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:16,522
You can't even think about
what people will say of you

570
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:20,362
when you do something like this?

571
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:37,605
[guests chattering]

572
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:45,370
[Ryu] Father.

573
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:54,681
Happy birthday.

574
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,729
And what else?

575
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:03,532
Sorry. I'm back home.

576
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:05,786
Good to have you back.

577
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:09,961
Ryu. Where have you been all this time?

578
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,051
Long time no see.

579
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:15,222
Yeah.

580
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:19,188
Now the entire family is here.

581
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,735
Let's take a family photo.

582
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:25,242
[photographer] Get ready. Smile.

583
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:35,680
You didn't need to come all this way.

584
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:37,850
It's only natural.

585
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,648
I should do this much.

586
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:47,244
It's too risky to meet you in public.

587
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:51,335
I'm really indebted to you.

588
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:56,429
Truthfully, there is one more reason.

589
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:03,652
I have a favor to ask of you.

590

[classical music playing]

591
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:15,635
The drug test was clean.

592
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:22,272
Did you tell Mrs. Takeuchi
about the drugs?

593
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:23,358
No.

594
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:27,199
It is not a truth a mother should know.

595
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,883
I'm glad you were able to finally see Ryu.

596
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:36,969
Yeah.

597
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:43,064
But I was surprised he came.

598
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,945
People can change.

599
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,536
They don't change so easily.

600
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:51,998
Only the situation changes.

601
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,510
Ryu is very intelligent.

602
00:45:57,593 --> 00:46:00,641
And very naive.

Cleaning up this country's problems.
