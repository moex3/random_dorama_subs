Good evening, Nami.

00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,469
Doesn't look like anyone followed you.

9
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,099
That's right.

10
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,619
Thank you.

11
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,748
Were there any problems?

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,877
Problems?

13
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:50,465
Naturally, I'm asking about

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,177
our mutual friend.

15
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,518

18
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,084
Well done.

19
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:17,311
Hey, you could just go after his father.

20
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,356
Why involve his family?

21
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:24,576
[stranger] Mr. Ogami's power
lies in his connections.

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,291
He can even connect

23
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,719
this country's richest billionaires
with the poorest of the poor.

24
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,727
He's one of the few people

25
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,484
trusted by both the exploiters
and the exploited.

26
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:46,787
That's why he keeps himself hidden.

27
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:51,462
He lurks in people's shadows,

28
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:53,926
and rarely shows his face.

29
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,391
And Ichiro?

30
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:03,152
A dim light.

31
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:08,956
A dim, foolish light that shines
on all the ugliness.

32
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,139
Mr. Ogami's only weakness is his excessive
devotion to his children, his family,

33
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:20,019
and this country.

34
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,527
History makes it very clear.

35
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,950
The empire will always fall

36
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,371
when power is passed to the descendants.

37
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:33,463
Even Mr. Ogami wouldn't be an exception.

38
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:40,644
I have one more question for you.

39
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,316
What?

40
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,696
You're not in love with him, are you?

41
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:47,282
[scoffs]

42
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:48,409
Of course not.

43
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
[stranger] That's fine, then.

44
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,885
This is not the time to get emotional.

45
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:00,308
Only when everything is put back in place.

46
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,901
You can do whatever you wish
when all the wrongs are made right.

47
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:10,955
I pray you'll find a beautiful love.

48

WHERE THERE IS A WILL
THERE IS A WAY

49
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:22,687
PRIME MINISTER YOZOU WATANABE

50
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,758
Sosuke Saijo is basically a child.

51
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,394
He wants power like a child wants a toy.

52
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,574
I feel so relieved you chose So Takeuchi.

53
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:54,333
He'll at least steer the country
towards the right path.

54
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:00,846
I'm confident
you'll give him your support.

55
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,482
The Global Bill.

56
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,616
Officially, it's a government-initiated,

57
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,916
comprehensive bill
to revive Japan with foreign investments.

58
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,299
A bill my late father

59
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,890
tried to pass ten years ago
with your help, but failed.

60
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,019
Yes.

61
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,694
Next week, I will announce

62
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:32,200
a 50 trillion fiscal reform plan.

63
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,876
As long as the Bank of Japan
has its hands tied,

64
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,634
a difficult political decision
must be made.

65
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,602
[Ogami] It's not the policy I believe in…

66
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:51,948
but you, yourself.

67
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:55,706
That is fine with me.

68
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:02,302
My approval rating is the lowest
it's ever been since I took office.

69
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,389
I have lost the party's support.

70
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,481
Before the bill gets passed,

71
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,361
they'll take my head if nothing changes.

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,455
Saijo will pretend he doesn't know
anything and take me down himself.

73
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,633
But this is something I have to do
for the future of Japan.

74
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,141
I'll give So Takeuchi

75
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:30,901
the prime minister's seat
after I pass the bill.

76
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,495
To do that,

77
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,550
I need that intangible power of yours.

78
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,394

Secretary Matsumoto,

80
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:54,364
and a cabinet meeting at 8:16 a.m.

81
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:55,993
[Watanabe] All right.

82
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,126
Cooperation within the party is important.

83
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:03,132
I'll hold the press conference
in a few days,

84
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,469
so have everything ready by then.

85
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:06,931
I will, Prime Minister.

86
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,269
You'll have no issues with my faction.

87
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:10,981
And Mr. Maruyama?

The prime minister's

SO TAKEUCHI - SECRETARY-GENERAL

<i>as well as with the public.</i>

Thank you.

213

Have you spoken with Mr. Ogami?

214
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,248
Yes, of course.

215
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,545
I begged him for help

216
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,383
to get this bill passed.

217
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,063
Those who want my head are
already sharpening their knives,

218

but I will surely get this bill passed.

219
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:41,835
I believe Mr. Ogami will do everything
in his power to make that happen.

220
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,923
You need to be careful as well.

221
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,052
I will.

222
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,974
But that Saijo.

He's just dying to sit in this chair.

224

Yes, he is.

225
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,577
I'll be counting on you,

226
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,583

I wonder if you can.

[Ben's mother] I divorced

And ever since…

00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:36,737
Ben has been my whole world.

235
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,041
I only want to say this.

236
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,715
He would never, ever

237
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:50,347
kill someone.

238
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:55,941
The police said it was your son.

239
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:03,039
I admit Ben couldn't be thought of
as a great man.

240
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,420
I have no money

241

and struggle every day to get by.

242
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:12,558
We live in a different world from you.

243
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,144
But still, Ben…

244
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,821
did not kill your son.

245
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:22,411
I swear to God.

246
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,208
He didn't kill himself either.

247
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:29,216
How do you know?

248
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:30,886
I just know.

249
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,307
I'm his mother.

250
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,986
Why did you agree to meet me?

251
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:45,165
Because at least I understand
the pain of losing your child.

Yes.

301
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,619
What a wonderful idea.

302
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:33,125
Why don't I ask Yumiko
when they can make time?

303
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,419
Okay.

304

Risako's birthday is tomorrow.

305
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,264
Did you forget?

306
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,187
I remember,

307
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,235
but I haven't decided what to do.

308
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,405
How about a present?

309

I'm having lunch
with Risako and Yumiko tomorrow.

Why don't you join us?

Wouldn't I just be in the way?

312
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,804
Have you ever once

313
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:03,310
acted like a father to Risako?

314
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:06,901
You were even more indifferent to her
than to Yumiko.

315
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,657
She's too young for me.

I'm fast, right?

What's up?

428
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:46,779
I reviewed the application
for the elderly housing subsidy program.

429
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:50,536
And I think there's a more efficient way
of providing the subsidies.

430
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,622
How?

431
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:56,632
Our current application window is
only until April. That's just two months.

432
00:29:56,715 --> 00:30:00,138
Right now, before they can even apply
at the federal level,

433
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:03,311
they need to get accepted
at their local municipal level first.

434
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:05,398
But that's only a month.

435
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:08,112
We help them with the application,

436
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:11,703
but if the waiting period for the
results is extended to six months,

437
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:14,500
we can quickly distribute the subsidies.

438
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:17,130
I see. That's a good idea.

439
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:21,305
But only 23% were approved last year.

440
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:26,567
And those 23% were only approved
after multiple applications.

441
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,698
That was an issue
we struggled with in the past.

This system was created to prevent
fraud and double payments.

That's true.

00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:42,875
Look at that price!

491
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,754
But it's so cute.

492
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,386
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

493
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:52,728
If it's not too rude,
may I ask how old your daughter is?

494
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:56,485
Well, she's in her 20s.

495
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,201
Does she have any preferences?

496
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:03,917
For example, does she prefer
cute or cool styles?

497
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:09,386
Do you have anything you recommend?

498
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:13,436
Yes. This one is quite popular recently.

499
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,786
This is a piece
from the Wish Upon a Star Diamond series.

500
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,045
It symbolizes your wish
for her dreams and hopes to come true.

501
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:29,719
It's a good gift for someone you love.

502
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,263
[Ogami] I will take this.

503
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:33,351
Thank you. It's a wonderful gift.

504
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:35,438
Shall I wrap it up for you?

505
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:36,775
Please.

506
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,653
Well--

507
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:40,156
Yes?

508
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,785
What is it?

509
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:45,793
It's a necklace.

510
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,462
I see.

511
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:52,180
I will go wrap this for you.

512
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:54,267
-Thank you.
-Please wait a moment.

513
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:01,407
[Kageyama] You almost did it.

514
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,160
[children] Rock, paper, scissors.

515
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,419
[Kageyama laughing] I couldn't help you.

516
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:10,174
-You need to hurry.
-[Shin] Help me, Sis.

517
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:11,970
[Kageyama] Oops!

518
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:13,389
[Shin] Got you!

519
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:17,021
Darn. You got me.

520
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:20,779
-Okay, time out. I'm pooped. Time out.
-[Shin] Why?

521
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:22,616
[Kageyama] Come on, go play on the swings.

522
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,910
-[Shin] Okay.
-[Riko] Okay.

523
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:25,706
[sighs]

524
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,018
I got a call from the credit card company.

525
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:39,107
They said
they couldn't make the withdrawal

526
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:41,905
because our bank account
didn't have enough money.

527
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,744
You keep looking at that. What is it?

528
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:47,081
Work.

529
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:49,754
Did you hear me?

530
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,298
Oh, right.

531
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,929
I transferred some money into our stocks.

532
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:56,643
I should've been more careful.

533
00:35:57,185 --> 00:35:58,270
Everything's fine now.

534
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:01,694
It was embarrassing
to not have enough in the bank.

535
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:05,744
Don't worry about it.
It was just bad timing.

536
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:08,499
I keep a minimum amount in the bank

537
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,671
and put the rest into stocks.

538
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,175
Okay.

539
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,265
But be more careful next time.

540
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,475
Okay.

541
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,064
CHART - BITCOIN

542
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:21,860
[footsteps approaching]

543
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,451
Oh, you are--

544
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:30,961
This is the man who saved Shin.

545
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:33,382
That was you?

546
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:34,677
Thank you so much.

547
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:37,181
You saved my son's life.

548
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:41,398
Protecting the children
is our responsibility as adults.

549
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:44,362
They are our future, after all.

550
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:46,826
Yes, you're right.

551
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:50,959
Are you here with your child?

552
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,088
No, I'm single.

553
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,804
But I'd like to have a family one day.

554
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:58,892
A daughter and a son,

555
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,856
like your amazing family.

556
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,818
I'm really so jealous of you.

557
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,365
We're far from amazing.

558
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:07,534
It's a perfect family.

559
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:10,749
But every light has its shadow.

560
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,174
You should take extra caution
in times like these.

561
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:24,527
I meant be careful of cars and
other things that can harm the children.

562
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:28,367
Please be careful of those as well.

563
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:30,914
Of course.

564
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:39,515
-[Riko] Papa.
-[Shin] Papa.

565
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,351
-[Riko] Time out's over.
-[Shin] Hurry up.

566
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:43,355
-[Riko] Let's go play.
-[Shin] Come on.

567
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,900
Faster, faster.

[announcer] <i>Let's start the game.</i>

570
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:51,998
[Shin] I got it.

00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,254
-Bull's-eye.

<i>Aim for the robot's red--</i>

573
00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:00,599
-Do your best.
-[Shin] I'll try.

574
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:03,772
Here we go. Whoops.

575
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:07,529
I can't believe you got that doll, Shin.

576
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:08,782
It's all mine.

577
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:10,409
I want to eat a hot dog.

578
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:12,246
-Me too.
-[Ogami] Hot dog?

579
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,958
-Where?
-[Riko] Are there any?

580
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,252
[vendor] Here you are.

00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:18,635
[Shin] Hurry up, Grandpa.

582
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:19,804
[Ogami] Where to next?

583
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,183
Merry-go-round!

584
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,686
Wait for me, Shin!

585
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,534
Grandpa, hurry up.

586
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:31,744
Hurry.

587
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,169
Oh my.

588
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,850
I'll ride this one.

589
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,185
Then I'll ride this.

590
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:54,247
Sir, are you all right? Let me help you.

591
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:57,754
Sorry.

592
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:00,092
-Be careful.
-[Riko] Hope it's fun.

Yeah.

594

[Riko] Shin, what do you think that is?
Doesn't it look yummy?

00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,158
[Shin] Yeah.
