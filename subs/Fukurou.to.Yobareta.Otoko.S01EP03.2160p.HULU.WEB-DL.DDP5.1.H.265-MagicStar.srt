1
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,074
[owl chirps]

2
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:25,384
[owl hoots]

3
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,693
[rat squeals]

4
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:38,493
[tapping]

5
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:12,014
[phone ringing]

6
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:18,611
[grunts]

7
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:20,113
[grunts]

8
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,205
Pulled an all-nighter?

9
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,668
[Ryu] Yeah.

10
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:32,764
The world won't end
just because you went home and showered.

11
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,270
Why don't you go get some fresh air?

12
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,074
I just have my own way of doing things.

13
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:47,836
Then your way isn't very efficient, is it?

14
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,384
Collaborating with the team
is also part of your job.

15
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:57,522
Looks like you forgot the Japanese spirit
of cooperation after your time abroad.

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,613
That's not what I meant.

17
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,913
You should go home, take the day off.

18
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:10,756
[Ryu sighs] But I've still got so much
left to do.

19
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,138
I'm so sorry.

20
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,396
Uh, no, it's my fault.

21
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:43,572
Here.

22
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:51,045
Uh, I'm Ryu Ogami.

23
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,180
Sorry for bumping into you.

24
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:11,419
[in English] That's all we have?
A phone call from a conspiracy theorist?

25
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:12,588
His name is Max.

26
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,636
And Max is this guy
who stays up late in the dark

27
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,057
and posts mysterious things
going on in Japan.

28
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,353
Kind of. He seems like a pretty legit guy,

29
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:22,608
just a bit crazy sounding.

30
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, I think there's a story there.

31
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:28,579
Oh, come on. Just give me a chance.
I think it might be worth investigating.

32
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:29,748
There's no proof, evidence, nothing.

33
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,793
Yeah, but in a country
where everything's kept a secret,

34
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:33,756
where else am I going to get my leaks?

35
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,636
[sighs] So this is the same guy

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,433
who told you
about the mysterious fixer character guy?

37
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:41,103
The Owl? That you're interested in?

38
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,355
Same guy.

39
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,028
And apparently, that guy fixed
this thing too, according to Max.

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,702
Seems like a busy guy, this Owl.

41
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:51,750
Yeah, seems so.

42
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,088
All right,
that's a more interesting story.

43
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,929
Mysterious fixer in Japan who pulls
the strings of the politicians.

44
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:02,020
Didn't you say
you were going to talk to the son?

45
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,316
Yeah, um, that didn't go anywhere.

46
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,877
[Ryu] There it is.

47
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,423
Oh, wow.

48
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,116
What a beautiful night.

49
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,625
[Ryu] Tokyo Tower was modeled after
the Eiffel Tower.

50
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,673
And then <i>Godzilla</i> made it famous.

51
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,428
Got a bit of its own charm.

52
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:45,440
All those French giving away
the Statue of Liberty, Tokyo Tower.

53
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:48,154
What are we Americans giving?

54
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,705
Freedom, democracy, liberty,

55
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,128
values most people in the world
don't enjoy.

56
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,257
Japan has them.

57
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:03,059
Don't be fooled.
Japan isn't as free as you think.

58
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:05,063
Don't kid yourself about America either.

59
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:09,656
We're not that free. Especially with some
of the clowns that have run our country.

60
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:13,371
America is full of dreamers,
and dreamers create change.

61
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,626
And you can't make changes here?

62
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:18,799
Nothing changes here.

63
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:23,474
It's not a bed of roses in America,
you know.

64
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:28,735
College tuition is basically unaffordable,

65
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,031
medical insurance is insane,

66
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:33,327
the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer.

67
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:38,337
Re: elections? Don't even get me started.

68
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,133
But you have free speech.

69
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,224
And that's where it all starts.
No one speaks up in Japan.

70
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:49,192
Everyone conforms while a small group
of men tell us what to do and not.

71
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:55,079
But in America,
you have journalists like you

72
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,626
who work to keep the politicians honest,

73
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,632
report about corruption and scandals.

74
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:05,517
You bring justice to America.
That doesn't happen here.

75
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,523
Maybe it does, you just don't see it.

76
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,318
Or maybe it doesn't, so I don't see it.

77
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,280
Or maybe someone needs glasses.

78
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,825
[both chuckle]

79
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,248
Let's take a picture.

80
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,340
LIBERAL FRONTIER PARTY

81
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,016
[Saijo, in Japanese]
Thank you for your time.

82
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,689
[onlooker] Mr. Saijo!

83
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,818
[onlookers giggling]

84
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,283
I got a visit from that man.

85
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:59,040
Ryutaro? He's always moving
behind the scenes for the prime minister.

86
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,754
Therefore,
he'll definitely be backing So Takeuchi.

87
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:06,681
[assistant] Manabu Takeuchi's death
only made him more popular.

88
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,396
What do you plan to do?

89
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:12,651
Bide my time.

90
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,156
I'll wait until they make their next move.

91
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:17,160
Something is bound to happen.

92
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,080
That's how things work.

93
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,003
That's when we make our move.

94
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,220
And Hiroshi Maruyama?

95
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:28,850
He has the swing votes.

96
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:32,315
He's your typical opportunist.

97
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:37,826
Give him a little push,
and he'll do whatever we want.

98
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,544
Let's go to lunch.

99
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:44,297
Yes.

100
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,264
[sighs]

101
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:54,694
The majority of my supporters
will vote against the bill.

102
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:56,864
I know.

103
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,248
That's why I'm speaking directly with you.

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,174
[chuckles] But that will end
my political career.

105
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:11,184
We'll back the prime minister
until the very end.

106
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:19,577
Then that person
will owe us a lifelong debt.

107
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,459
But it's all over
for Prime Minister Watanabe.

108
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,177
The Bill has nothing to do with that.

109
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,645
And that's even more of a reason
to stand with her.

110
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,784
So I can't remain neutral.

111
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,205
In that case…

112
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,506
I'll need to consider a few things.

113
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,643
If you join our side,

114
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,278
you'll be guaranteed a brilliant career.

115
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,998
Now, have another glass.

116
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:18,570
[sighs]

117
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:34,935
-Hi.
-Hey.

118
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,953
How are you?

119
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,208
Good. You?

120
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:48,378
Good.

121
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,717
Did something happen?

122
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,305
Suddenly taking me out to lunch.

123
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,478
I should, every so often.

124
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,777
I'm happy you asked me to lunch.

125
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,787
But I was surprised
since you almost never do.

126
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:11,216
It's your present.

127
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:14,598
What is it?

128
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:17,019
Just something small.

129
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,484
Thanks.

130
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:23,616
You're not opening it?

131
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,706
I was going to open it later.

132
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:30,964
But I'll do it now.

133
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:43,656
I like it.

134
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,994
Do you know what it is?

135
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,581
Isn't it a necklace?

136
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,964
But I still think this isn't like you.

137
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,595
[Ogami] What isn't?

138
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:00,481
Taking me to lunch, giving me a present,

139
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,195
remembering my birthday,

140
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:05,992
even though it passed.

141
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:10,752
Is there something you want to ask me?

142
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:13,382
Right.

143
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,098
I wonder what your hopes and dreams are,

144
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,812
what you want to do?

145
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,907
I want to be a singer.

146
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:27,786
Singer?

147
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,124
I'll tell you since you're asking.

148
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,300
I've always wanted to be a singer.

149
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,140
I see.

150
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,481
The entertainment industry
is a dangerous place.

151
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,197
It's not as dangerous as boxing.

152
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,368
We're not beating each other up.

153
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,997
No.

154
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:52,168
It's even more dangerous.

155
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,679
You'll be hounded by fear.

156
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,233
[Kyoko] How was your lunch with Risako?

157
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,783
She said she wants to be a singer.

158
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,665
Yes. She's quite talented.

159
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,212
But you probably didn't know.

160
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,263
Risako is all grown up.

161
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,478
She can take care of herself.

162
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:26,361
You know she has a boyfriend, right?

163
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:28,825
No, I didn't.

164
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,912
How old is he?

165
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,291
Go and ask her yourself.

166
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,882
She seems to really like him.

167
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,513
I see.

168
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,656
For someone who knows everything,

169
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:52,789
you don't even know
who your daughter is in love with.

170
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,375
Love?

171
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:59,218
It's something that happens
every so often when you're young.

172
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:09,113
You can be really old-fashioned sometimes.

173
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,746
I plan on going to the villa.

174
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:15,752
Would you like to join me?

175
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,131
[instructor] Asami,
you're moving too fast.

176
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:19,050
Okay.

177
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:21,387
[producer] What about Risako's account?

178
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,561
[assistant] We already combed through it.
I'll email you the details.

179
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:26,857
Things are going to get busier.

180
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:32,242
[producer] It went well.

181
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,042
[Risako] "Well"? What did they say
about my singing?

182
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,671
[producer] That it was amazing.

183
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,633
-However--
-However?

184
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,012
You're a little too old for a debut.

185
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:46,354
[scoffs] I'm only 25. That's too old?

186
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,274
-For an idol.
-[scoffs]

187
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,197
It's so dated to be picky about age--

188
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,330
That's why we're considering
the talented diva angle.

189
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,304
For real?

190
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,269
Yeah. Isn't it a good start for you?

191
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:07,354
[sighs]

192
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,275
And?

193
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:14,118
You'll work with Ken, that composer
you met. He wants to write a song for you.

194
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,168
You'll get signed
and record your own song.

195
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,592
Wow.

196
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:23,721
This is amazing.

197
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,309
-But wait a minute.
-What?

198
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:30,025
I also write my own songs.

199
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,697
I've got a few that I wrote, so maybe--

200
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:35,160
A hotshot composer is going to
write your songs.

201
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,041
-Don't do anything unnecessary.
-[sighs]

202
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:42,091
Your private life is more important.

203
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,136
What?

204
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:46,390
Is there anyone you're seeing?

205
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,562
Why are you asking?

206
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,273
If there is, break up right now.

207
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:54,783
I don't understand.

208
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:13,529
[producer] There's no way you went
to all these fancy dinners

209
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,033
and resorts alone, right?

210
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:18,496
Look.

211
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,793
Men are a dime a dozen,

212
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:24,300
but you only get one chance
at your career.

213
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,769
The agency will be managing
your social media account.

214
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,567
No more dating.
Don't go out in public alone.

215
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,111
And don't do anything stupid.

216
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,453
[sighs] That's

217
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,710
how you'll become a star.

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,383

-No.

[assistant] Yes,

this is an orchid.

Yumiko! It's been so long! How are you?

00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,635
I'm so busy with the kids and the house,

232

but I'm doing great.

-[customer 2] I have a question.

-[assistant] Sorry.
-No.

Give me one second.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

This plant here? Okay.

238
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:06,045
You seem even busier than me.

239
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,926
It's that time of year.
It'll get even busier soon.

00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,763
You should hire somebody.

You're right,

Of course we do. Do you have it with you?

Yes.

Yes.

How much can I get?

269
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,205
I'll examine it.

270
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:55,096

He's determined to remain neutral.

That is not possible.

But if he were to choose a side,

he would probably stand with Mr. Saijo.

You didn't ask your father for any help?

495
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,521
I truly apologize for everything.

496
00:34:58,192 --> 00:35:01,198
I'll become a son you can be proud of.

497
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:05,081
Please forgive me!

498
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:08,337
Lift your head.

499
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,103
You chose to run from your duties
as a husband?

500
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:19,192
Be a decent human being!

501
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,244
I'm sorry.

[thunder rumbles]

505
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:37,688
Prime Minister, what do you mean?

506
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,942
You want this country
to be a slave to others?

507
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:42,071
-[politicians] Exactly!
-[speaker] Silence.

508
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:45,161
Please quiet down!

509
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:49,670
This bill will pave the way
for Japan's future.

510
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:52,718
It will make us
internationally competitive,

511
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,722
remove barriers,

512
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,475
revitalize and stimulate the economy,

513
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,774
and take this country into the new era.

514
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,611
[politician] What country
are you talking about?

515
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:03,322
[politicians jeering]
Stop lying, Prime Minister!

516
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,078
[politician 2] Be quiet.

517
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:07,623
[politician 3] You shut up! Let them talk!

518
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:09,961
-[politician 4] You ignoring me?
-[politician 5] Prime Minister--

519
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,342
[speaker] Minister of Finance,
Sosuke Saijo.

520
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,265
[applause]

521
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:26,410
To add to the prime minister's arguments,

522
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:31,295
this bill will indeed benefit
some of our citizens.

523
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:36,681
However, there is a possibility
it will negatively impact everyone else.

524
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:38,977
[politicians murmur]

525
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,108
She spoke of our competitiveness,

526
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:49,039
but that will only enrich
the small number of billionaires.

527
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,005
Will they then help

528
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,969
-this nation's farmers and fishermen?
-[snoring]

529
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,725
-[Saijo] No.
-Wake up.

530
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:01,981
[Saijo] Loosening the policies
will force them into dire straits.

531
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:07,325
It will take away our true national power.

532
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,830
[politicians clamoring]
Exactly. Well said.

533
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:12,503
It is extremely risky

534
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:18,138
to pass this bill
without properly debating these issues.

535
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:20,519
-[politicians] Yes. Exactly.
-[applause]

536
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:21,688
That's right.

537
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:23,482
I agree.

Let's have another toast.

To the upcoming election.

We're the police!
Everybody stay where you are!

Don't touch anything! Don't move!

Get it together!

Nobody touch anything.

559
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:20,842
Right. Exactly.

Thanks.
