Masashi Maruyama, state your occupation.

7
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,375
Did I do anything wrong?

8
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,006
The music at your party was too loud.

9
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,135
Complaints were made.

10
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:12,557
All that fuss just for that?

11
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,525
You made it seem like
I murdered somebody or something.

12
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,113
We were only doing our job.

13
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:23,788
Once again, Mr. Maruyama.
What is your occupation?

14
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,171
CEO of Maruyama Construction Corporation.

15
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:30,050
Your place and date of birth?

16
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,639
I was born in Fukui.

17
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,855
October 2, 1967.

18
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,901
How many employees do you have?

19
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,949
About 200.

20
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:44,036
Who did you attend the party with?

21
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,004
My friends and clients.

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,225
Why would a reputable man like yourself
party with young women so late at night?

23
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,145
They are all hostesses.

24
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:02,030
I was trying to show
my friends a good time.

25
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:03,868
I see.

26
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:07,332
What exactly are my charges?

27
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,754
Help me understand.

28
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,469
What do you want?

29
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,731
I wonder if it's true
that everyone was having fun?

30
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,737
Was there anything…

31
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,786

00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:04,531
The reporters are also staying quiet
about Mr. Maruyama's brother.

35
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,242
I see.

36
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,289
<i>Who called the police?</i>

37
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,462
[Ogami] It was not a coincidence.

38
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:16,972
Arresting his brother is
a trap for Mr. Maruyama.

39
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:19,226
<i>Do you think it was Mr. Saijo?</i>

40

We don't know yet.

41
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:25,363
Don't jump to conclusions.

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

43
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:31,167
There's one more thing you should know.

44
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,716
Max Murata is becoming a problem.

<i>posting online that it was a setup.</i>

47
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,068
No one will pay him any attention.

48
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:48,493
It seems he's been in contact
with a foreign reporter.

49
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,790
Look into it.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960

55
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:29,951
Then what's wrong?

56
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:34,794
[Yumiko] Masahiro keeps saying
everything is okay whenever I ask.

57
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,176
But I need to do something.

[Kyoko] The times have sure changed.

Meaning?

60
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,902
In the old days,

61
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:51,953
it was unheard of
for women to walk ahead of men.

62
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:55,502
My father was so scary,
I couldn't even go near him.

63
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:58,675
Japanese women were expected
to only serve tea.

64
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,303
But not anymore.

65
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:03,392
[chuckles] You've never made
a pot of tea in your life.

66
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,233
But I've never taken a sip
before your father did.

67
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:12,870
The world has changed.

68
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,836
Men are not like that anymore,
and neither are women.

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,886
Sort of.

71
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,694
Both you and Ryu were such smart children.

72
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,452
And you were much better than Ryu
at handling yourself.

73
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,837
Your father and I thought
you were a genius.

74
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,803
Especially at math.

75
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,892
That was when I was young.

76
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:50,403
You're still quite young.

77
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,081
You need my help for the holidays?

00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:15,369
<i>Really?</i>

84
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:20,088
But will your husband mind you working?

85
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,925
Not at all.

86
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,808
In fact, he's supportive of me working.

87
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,943
Then I'll see you this afternoon.

88
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,863
<i>Yeah, I'll be waiting.</i>

89

[Ichiro] Where should I start?

90
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,967
Have we been seeing
each other for a year already?

91
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:46,348
Six months.

92
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,352
It's been six months?

93
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,108
Oh, okay.

94
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,326
Would you like more mineral water?

95
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,289
We also have sparkling water.

96
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,959
Mineral is fine.

97
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,808
These six months have been my happiest.

98
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:09,394
I mean it.

99
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,446
Thanks.

100
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,454
[sighs]

101
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,293
I love you. And I always will.

102
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:29,100
But this is where you say the usual
"I can't leave my wife" line, right?

103
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:34,361
No. She's not the reason why.

104
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:36,323
Then what is?

105
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,124
My responsibility to my family,
to the Ogami name.

106
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:44,464
Right.

107
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,474
Nami, forgive me.

108
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,023
Sure.

109
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,278
Goodbye.

110
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,700
Wait. Let's talk, okay?

111
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:59,537
Talk? About what?

112
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,081
Do you have more to say?

113
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,250
I do!

114
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,586
Please, I beg you.

115
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,843
You've already told me your answer.

116
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:10,976
I don't want to hurt you.

117
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,732
-You made your decision. So I will too.
-What?

118
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,819
How I'll live my life without you.

119
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,447
No, wait a minute.

120
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,537
Don't say that. We can meet up anytime.

121
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,457
As friends.

122
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,589
Why do I need to be friends with you?

123
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,137
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,222
Are you an idiot?

125
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,483
Nami.

126
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,661
[Maruyama] Why are you telling me this?

127
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:46,631
[Saijo] Your brother is
one of the four in police custody.

128
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:49,678
[Maruyama]
He was only partying with some hostesses.

129
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,645
But four smart, seasoned men

130
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,651
got out of control drinking
with young hostesses

131
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,280
and got themselves into quite the mess.

132
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,875
Apparently, they were more wild
than anyone imagined.

133
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,631
What of it? It's his life.

134
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,762
I'll do what I can as his brother.

135
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,265
Go ahead.

136
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:17,860
But of course
he should be tried for his crimes

137
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,989
if he spent his days breaking the law.

138
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,578
A very admirable stance.

139
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:25,166
-It was like a speech for the Diet.
-[laughs]

140
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,502
What are you saying?

141
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,466
I only want to get to the truth.

142
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,432
The truth is always beneficial
to the country.

143
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,689
It is my brother's problem. Not mine.

144
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,820
Unfortunately, it is yours.

145
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:44,120
Your brother, your family,
they are all tied to you.

146
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:49,047
What would they find
if there was a full investigation?

147
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,598
I am innocent.

148
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,983
I am privy to a lot of information.

149
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:04,954
Because I have faith in you,
we should hold each other's hands.

150
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,833
As politicians.

151
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,212

You think so? I don't think he will.

He's a very weak-minded man.

Keep your distance for now.

162

But he doesn't tell lies.

163
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,921
It's the same for you, right?

164

Are you all right?

Absolutely.

00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,243
I'll leave that up to you.

168
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,388
MINISTER MARUYAMA ASLEEP
OPPOSITION DEMANDS PUNISHMENT

169
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:01,771
<i>The opposition party has filed a motion</i>

170
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:06,029
<i>demanding disciplinary action against
Minister Hiroshi Maruyama</i>

171
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:11,081
<i>for attending the recent debate
on Prime Minister Watanabe's Global Bill</i>

172
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,632
<i>while hungover,
causing him to snore and fall asleep.</i>

173
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:19,472
<i>Even more are questioning
Prime Minister Watanabe's leadership</i>

174
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:23,815
<i>as her approval ratings have dropped
to a new low.</i>

175
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:31,246
They dare to criticize my leadership

176
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,126
by playing the video of Maruyama snoring
all over the news?

177
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,420
PRIME MINISTER
SHIORI WATANABE

178
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,509
They need to stop taking me for a fool.

179
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,888
Exactly as you said.

180
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,729
I agree.

181
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:49,616
Why was Maruyama's brother arrested?

182
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,954
I've only just heard about it.

183
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:53,791
I don't have any details yet.

184
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,383
I also. I'm just as clueless.

185
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:01,222
This is no time for games!

186
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,022
They could dig up
all kinds of dirt on him.

187
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:11,535
Since the press is having a field day
with Maruyama's snoring,

188
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,000
I assume his brother's arrest
hasn't been leaked yet?

189
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:17,964
-Yes.
-I believe so.

190
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:23,768
Don't you dare use this incident

191
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:26,815
to attack each other
to gain a political advantage.

192
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,571
-Do you understand?
-Of course.

193
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:32,786
Yes.

194
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,082
That is all.

195
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,601
Get me Maruyama right away.

196
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:56,457
I promise that
it will never happen again, Prime--

197
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:57,752
[clears throat]

198
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,223
-[door opens]
-It's me.

199
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,520
[door closes]

200
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:15,621
I apologize for this incident,
Prime Minister.

201
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:16,999
[inhales sharply]

202
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,800
I promise that it will never happen again.

203
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:27,562
The camera happened to be on me
when I was nodding off for only a moment.

204
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,315
-I'm very sorry--
-That's enough.

205
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:33,824
That's not why I asked for you.

206
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:34,910
I see.

207
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:43,636
What kind of mess
did your brother get himself into?

208
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,517
Even I'm not sure.

209
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:49,564
Have you spoken with him?

210
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,444
Yes. He said he didn't do anything wrong.

211
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,829
Has anyone reached out to you?

212
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:58,666
No.

213
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,015
Come over here.

214
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,240
Look me straight in the eye.

215
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:24,466
Can you swear you and your brother
have done nothing wrong?

216
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,553
Yes, of course.

217
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,101
I mean, yes for myself.

218
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,984
But truthfully,
I don't know what my brother has done

219
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,155
or what he's involved in.

220
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,621
So you're saying you're innocent?

221
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:41,334
I've done nothing to be guilty of.

222
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,925
All right. I'll trust what you say.

223
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,344
[Maruyama sighs]

224
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,853
Well, can you--

225
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:54,611
I mean, is it possible
to put a stop to the police investigation?

226
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:00,247
It's true what they say.

227
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,048
You really are stupid.

228
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,641
Forget I asked. I was a bit flustered.

229
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:14,818
The debate on the Global Bill
will continue.

230
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,577
It will soon be your turn
to state your position.

231
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,080
Yes.

232
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:30,348
You'll be supporting the bill. Right?

233
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:32,979
Well…

234
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,368
Make your decision.

235
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:46,130
I will. I'll support you.

236
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,412
-Thank you for your purchase.
-[customer] Thank you.

237
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:05,001
-Please come again.
-Thank you.

238
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,464
[assistant] Thank you.

239
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:09,134
[customer 2] Excuse me,
can I get some help?

240
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,763
Sure. Yumiko, can you?

241
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,725
Okay, I'll be right over.

242
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,236
Thank you for waiting.

243
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:24,415
-[customer 2 chuckles]
-Oh, hasn't it been a while?

244
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:27,505
You're right. It's been so long.

245
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,884
-Have you been well?
-Yes. And you, Yuki?

246
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:31,722
Same as well, thank you.

247
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:35,228
Thank you for always helping my husband
with his work.

248
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,734
[chuckles] No, it's not a problem.

249
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,906
He's such a workaholic.
It's all he thinks about.

250
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:46,793
But he has made it this far thanks to you.

251
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,339
[chuckles] Thanks.

252
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,302
Which one did you want?

253
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:55,978
Let's see. How much is this one?

254
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,147
This is…

255
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:06,750
Do you work here?

256
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,798
Yes, but only part-time.

257
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,516
I'm helping my friend with her shop.

258
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:18,231
It's quite refreshing
to get out of the house.

259
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,026
That's true.

260
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,119
And how is he?

261
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:28,334
Is Masahiro doing fine?

262
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,506
Of course he is.

263
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,010
I'll tell him we ran into each other.

264
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,973
I'm glad to hear that.

265
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,854
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

266
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,536
Are these to congratulate someone?

267
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:51,005
I believed Masahiro would get
back on his feet in no time.

268
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,094
Did he already find a new job?

269
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,098
A new job?

270
00:19:57,183 --> 00:20:01,108
The flowers are for
Masahiro's replacement, my new manager.

271
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:06,118
It's been six months since he quit, right?

272
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:08,749
[gasps]

273
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,834
Yes.

274
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,130
Time sure flies.

275
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:15,638
He's taking some time off

276
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,144
before looking for a new job.

277
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:21,608
I'm glad to hear that.

278
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:26,868
He was so kind, the best manager I've had.

279
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,456
I really miss working with him.

280
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,590
He was really sorry about it too.

281
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,468
How is it?

282
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,472
Really good.

283
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,313
I want to spend more time with you.

284
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,278
-And you?
-What's going on?

285
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,616
I finally realized something.

286
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:12,167
In order to do great work,
first, I need to be a great son.

287
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,922
And a good husband.

288
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,640
And one day, a good father.

289
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:22,938
Having a wonderful wife…

290
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,780
will make it all possible.

291
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,996
Let's go to your favorite
sushi place in Ginza.

292
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,877
And take a trip to the hot springs.

293
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,256
Come here.

294
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:41,768
I also want you to know more
about my new restaurant.

295
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:45,274
-Right now, I'm--
-[gasps] Sorry!

296
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,653
What's gotten into you?

297
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,118
[sighs]

298
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,040
I want to make up for my past.

299
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:55,629
I want

300
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,094
to rekindle our relationship
as husband and wife.

301
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:04,271
Something doesn't feel right.

302
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:06,150
This isn't like you.

303
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,070
[sighs]

304
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,366
What's so strange about it?

[sighs]

312
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:31,278
Looks like you're investing
a lot into that Risako girl.

313
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:34,577
She's got a good voice.

314
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:38,417
She'll be a star in no time
with a few of my songs.

315
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,342
Well, I haven't had any hits for ages.

316
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:46,183
Let's not go there right now.

317
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,397
I remember you said
the same thing about me.

318
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,738
You said my voice was the best.

319
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:56,078
That you'd make me a star.

320
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,915
And you did.

321
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,421
You became a great star. You still are.

322

00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:06,641
I'm sorry.

Put your hand right here.

325
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,945
Spread your fingers.

326
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,336
Don't you trust me?

327
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,802
[chuckles] My hand moved on its own.

328

[both chuckle]

329
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,697
