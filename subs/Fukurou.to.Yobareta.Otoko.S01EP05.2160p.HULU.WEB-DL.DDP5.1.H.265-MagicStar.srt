1
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,728
Welcome to our bar.

2
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,651
How are you?

3
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,286
Why?

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,795
Was there a reason you had to do that?

5
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:12,139
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,105
Why did you lie to me?

7
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,652
ONE YEAR AGO

8
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:20,030
[laughing] Drink whatever you like.

9
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:21,491
Thank you.

10
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,453
The way to make even more money is to

11
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:26,083
go all in if there's a chance
to make a fortune.

12
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,461
Then you want cryptocurrency.

13
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,089
-Bitcoin?
-Yes.

14
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:30,801
Your money will double in a week.

15
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,805
But it's too risky.

16
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,643
It's the same as investing in stocks.

17
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:38,734
Except you can make a ton in no time
because of the extreme price fluctuations.

18
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:40,696
And lose a ton in an instant.

19
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,199
But you can hedge the risks, right?

20
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:45,038
No, our company doesn't deal with crypto.

21
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,294
Isn't it possible if you do it externally?

22
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,008
Externally?

23
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:55,601
Bitcoin just passed $5,000.

24
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,772
How much do you think I just made?

25
00:02:58,983 --> 00:02:59,985
500 million?

26
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,239
It'll keep going up, you know.

27
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,243
500 million isn't enough?

28
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,372
Look, all this is someone else's money.

29
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,546
Shouldn't you start
making some for yourself?

30
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,967
[laughs] So I should bet my own money?

31
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,766
You're in currency trading
at a trading company.

32
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,187
I sit in the deal room of a mega bank.

33
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,949
I'll make an account
for the payouts at the bank.

34
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,287
And use that money to
invest in crypto assets.

35
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,669
No one will find out
if you put the principal back.

36
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,548
But isn't that…

37
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,802
Illegal?

38
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:36,933
Isn't it?

39
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,522
No one will know if you return the money.

40
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,777
That's skirting the law.

41
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,414
[associate] <i>It fell 50% this week.</i>

42
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,293
Yeah.

43
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,341
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

44
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:54,803
It'll go up again.

45
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:56,682
[associate] <i>It's at $6,000 now.</i>

46
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,813
It'll go up to $20,000.
It'll be fine if I double the bid.

47
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,232
<i>How do you know it will increase?</i>

48
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,277
Because that's my job.

49
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,582
[reporter] <i>After Bitcoin reached
a record high of $19,783 a year ago,</i>

50
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,962
<i>data from Coin Research released today</i>

51
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,133

52
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,218

00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:18,307
<i>…fallen 37% this month.</i>

54
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,646
<i>This is its biggest crash since</i>

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,361
<i>prices fell 39% in August 2011.</i>

56
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:28,161
We won't press charges
if you resign immediately.

57
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,708
I'd take this deal if I were you.

58
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,503
Since I wouldn't want to go to jail.

59
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:36,177
Please forgive me!

60
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:39,934
[Yumiko] Why did you lie to me?

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,189
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,069
I didn't want to hurt you.

63
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,324
Or make you worry.

64
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,209
Don't worry.

65
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,129
I'll make the money back.

66
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,262

[in Japanese] That was good.

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,621
For your first song.

74
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,165
Thank you.

75
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,380
Okay, let's resume recording.

76
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,386
-Once more from the top.
-Okay.

77
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,471
-Got it.
-Okay.

78
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,132
That was the best song I've heard
from this studio in the last ten years.

79
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,850
Why won't you make
these kinds of songs for me?

80
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:04,729
What do you mean?

81
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:06,983
You haven't written

82
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,658
a hit song for me in years.

83
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,120
That was something Risako wrote.

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,047
I see.

85
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,178
I get it.

86
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,543
It's not my place to interfere,

87
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,509
but you should let her sing her own song.

88
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,220
Eventually.

89
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:43,890
We need to make her famous first.

90
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,020
And what did she say?

91
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:58,169
Do you want to be famous?

92
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:01,968
Or a true artist?

93
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:06,018
It's okay.

94
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,397
Tell me what you really want.

95
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:11,821
Can't I wish

96
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,535
to be both?

97
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:15,621
[laughs]

98
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,710
You're so young.

99
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,298
You'll find out one day,

100
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,429
but that's impossible in this industry.

101
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,020
You can only choose one.

102
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,705
Sorry I'm late.

103
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,106
Something unbelievable happened.

104
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,616
You made me wait 30 minutes.

105
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,995
That's what I find unbelievable.

106
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,208
Sorry.

107
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:25,761
Sheena came to the studio
while I was recording.

108
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,224
-The singer?
-Yeah.

109
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,061
That Sheena.

110
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,190
And?

111
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,779
She heard my song.

112
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,701
She told me it was really good.

113
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:40,999
[sighing] Okay.

114
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,757
Aren't you happy for me?

115
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,926
[sighs]

116
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:49,224
Be careful of anyone in show business.

117
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:53,942
Even Sheena. You don't know
how vicious she could be.

118
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,783
She seems like a good person to me.

119
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,331
She said she'd help me.

120
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,129
That she'd give me a hand.

121
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,763
Why would she take on that responsibility?

122
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,563
Because she said I have talent.

123
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,447
And you really believe her?

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,202
Is it weird?

125
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,417
I'm not sure.

126
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,797
But it's suspicious.

127
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,764
What did the producer say?

128
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,310
He liked my song too.

129
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,320
Stay focused on what you need to do.

130
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:38,990
Don't get carried away like a kid.

131
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:42,998
[Ogami] I see.

132
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:49,887
[assistant] The police aren't saying
anything about Masashi Maruyama.

133
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,774
One of the hostesses at the party is
accusing him of sexual assault.

134
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,445
That's all they'll say.

135
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:02,871
There are too many
overlapping coincidences.

136
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,713
If the police raided the place, then…

137
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,298
Was it really Sosuke Saijo?

138
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,802
No.

139
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:13,350
Mr. Saijo is probably
still investigating the details.

140
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,897
However, he will certainly

141
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,532
use this incident to his advantage.

142
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,036
Should I have a chat
with Hiroshi Maruyama?

143
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:26,042
No, let's wait a little longer.

144
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,138
We'll make our move
only when Mr. Saijo approaches

145
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,769
Hiroshi Maruyama again.

146
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:37,440
And right now?

147
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:42,910
Masashi Maruyama and that hostess.

148
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,414
I want their information.

149
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,628
Understood.

150
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:57,523
And I looked into
that American journalist.

151
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,693
Yeah.

152
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,574
She hasn't been in Japan for very long.

153
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:06,039
She's in the API's Asia bureau.

154
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,047
Do we have contacts with that news agency?

155
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,132
Yes.

156
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,598
But it's not a very good one.

157
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:17,436
All right.

158
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:22,531
There is a problem.

159
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,409
What is it?

160
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:27,290
It appears she and Ryu are dating.

161
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,712
Oh, I see.

162
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:31,507
Has Ryu said anything?

163
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,385
No, he hasn't.

164
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:39,732
API is still investigating
Manabu Takeuchi's death.

165
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,781
Keep your eyes on that reporter.

166
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:45,827
I will.

167
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,541
What will you do about Ryu?

168
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,587
I'll speak with him.

169
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,508
IN PAYMENT

170
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:16,973
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

171
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:22,693
How many years?
Since we've been out together?

172
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:23,986
[chuckles]

173
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,506
[Chef] Welcome.

174
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:35,467
Long time no see, Chef.

175
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,346
-Long time no see.
-Well.

176
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,933
[server] Hello, welcome.

177
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,245
Do you want to order sake?

178
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,128
Are you listening?

179
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,923
Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,259
What would you like?

181
00:12:57,219 --> 00:13:00,434
[stammers] Champagne.

182
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,687
Certainly.

183
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,902
[Shigeo, Nami laughing]

184
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,532
Oh, dear.

185
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:09,202
Where's your wine?

186
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,122
-Hi, excuse me.
-Yes?

187
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:15,172
Since it's wine o'clock,
can I get a glass?

188
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:16,424
A glass of wine?

189
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,470
The most expensive one you have.

190
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,729
Only the best of the best for

191
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:24,482
my beautiful girlfriend.

192
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:25,819
I'll bring it right out.

193
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,323
I'm sorry. You can just ignore his jokes.

194
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,870
What do you mean?

195
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:34,168
Is that how you tease little ole me?

196
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:35,713
I was just joking around.

197
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,557
So when did I become your girlfriend?

198
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:42,811
You will soon.

199
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,815
It's just a matter of time.

200
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,867
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

[indistinct dialogue]

202
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,081
[Nami] No way!

[indistinct dialogue]

204
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,379
[Nami laughs]

205
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:57,924
[Saho] I met your mother the other day.

206
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,972
She said you've turned over a new leaf.

207
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,855
-A lady.
-A lady? Oh, that's you.

208
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:07,318
-Are you listening to me?
-[Shigeo, Nami chattering, laughing]

209
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:10,825
Sorry. I'm listening.

210
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,004
What are you looking at?

211
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,216
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

212
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:23,475
Those people are so loud.

213
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,772
I wish they'd tone it down.

214
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,651
And look at that man.

215
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,447
Flirting with someone
much younger than him.

216
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,867
How embarrassing.

217
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,246
Yeah.

218
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,209
Right?

219
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,310
Can we go?

220
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:47,774
But your wine o'clock isn't here yet.

221
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,736
I'm not feeling very good.

222
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,074
Can we cancel the wine?

223
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,911
I'm so full.

224
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:55,497
Of course.

225
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,713
I want to go somewhere else.

226
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:00,883
Sure.

227
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,219
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

228
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,056
Please cancel the wine.

229
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,021
She's not feeling well. Sorry about that.

230
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,233
Was it not to your taste?

231
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,822
No, the sushi was very good.

232
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:13,868
Thank you.

233
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,005
-It wasn't a big deal.
-Thank you.

234
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,886
-You're right.
-Hey.

235
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:24,931
Have we met before?

236
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,939
I think you're mistaken.

237
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,653
[Shigeo]
<i>I've definitely seen you somewhere.</i>

238
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:33,824
I don't remember meeting you.

239
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,494
Sorry. Let's go.

240
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,456
-I don't feel good.
-Right, let's go.

241
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:41,089
My apologies. Looks like I was wrong.
Enjoy your meal.

242
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,717
[footsteps depart]

243
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,398
Someone you know?

244
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,739
Didn't he say it was a mistake?

245
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,829
Sounds like you're avoiding the question.

246
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,081
Of course not.

247
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,837
Let's order. Excuse me.

248
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,880
Yes?

249
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:39,915
What's wrong?

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,712
It's probably the stress

251
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,217
from working too much.

252
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,473
I can't do it.

253
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,024
You look tired. Let's go to sleep early.

254
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,076
Sorry.

255
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:00,080
It's okay.

256
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,792
I'll go take a shower.

257
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:25,965
I'm really sorry.

258
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:27,635
It's okay.

UNREAD MESSAGES BELOW

I STILL HAVE THESE AT MY PLACE.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THEM?

[sighs]

264
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,918
You never show your face
around here anymore.

265
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,797
I missed you.

266
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:29,884
I've gotten older.

267
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,890
Everyone ages just as equally.

268
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,145
That is not an excuse.

269
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:39,904
I have a favor to ask of you.

270
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:45,039
What a pretty girl.

271
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,208
Who is it?

272
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,171
Ichiro's mistress.

273
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,511
Ichiro hasn't changed one bit.

274
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,726
Did he get himself into trouble?

275
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,857
Ichiro is trouble itself.

276
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,986
[laughs]

277
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,827
He's carrying a burden
that is too heavy for his shoulders.

278
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,209
He's carrying a great responsibility.

279
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:13,722
However, he doesn't realize it himself.

280
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:20,360
Enjoy.

281
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:29,294
If only he could just live
within his capabilities.

282
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:36,183
I'll look into this girl for you.

283
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:42,947
[colleague]
I'll head over there before going home.

-Good night.

00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,265
Hello, good work today.

287
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:02,612
My name is Mayu Shimizu.

288
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,949
Nice to meet you, Mayu.

289
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,832
Are you going home?

290
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,836
Yes.

291
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,840
Which department are you in?

292
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:15,470
Accounting.

293
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,511
I'll give you a ride.

294
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,466
I hear you're dating someone
from a news agency.

295
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,015
Why didn't you tell me?

296
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,771
You had me followed.

297
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,109
I was watching over you.

298
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:05,988
Since I'm your father.

299
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:09,453
Normally, I wouldn't stop you.

300
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,292
But she's a reporter.

301
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,381
What do you want me to do?

302
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,682
Think about why she approached you.

303
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,399
You really don't trust anybody.

304
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,405
I choose who to place my trust in.

305
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,286
You should do the same.

306
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:32,583
I'll make my own decisions
about who I see.

307
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,052
Are you sure you're not misjudging people?

308
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,479
What about you?

309
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:49,784
Are you someone who can be trusted?

310
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:53,457
I don't hold any lies

311
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,506
in my heart.

312
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,595
Then tell me.

313
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,269
What?

314
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,400
About Manabu.

315
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:23,894
You don't trust me?

316
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:34,832
He got involved in a brawl and died.

317
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:40,719
However, traces of drugs were
found in his system.

318
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:44,434
The forces hostile to
Secretary-General Takeuchi

319
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,106
tried to leak it to the press.

320
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:53,077
I rewrote the truth.

321
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,503
There was no reason to

322
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,970
bring down the Secretary-General
and destroy his career.

323
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:08,692
What happened to the man who was
suspected of killing Manabu?

324
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:14,452
What needed to be done was done.

325
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,835
I…

326
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:21,884
do not trust this country's…

327
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,600
or your justice.

328
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,859
Here he is.

329
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,135
And how much more additional funds
will you be needing?

330
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,348
100 million.

331
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,439
[sighs loudly, sucks teeth]

332
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:13,028
We'll need another collateral
for the additional loan.

333
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,076
This is a high-risk investment for us.

334
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,042
The restaurant is
guaranteed to be a success.

335
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,255
There is no doubt about it.

336
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,386
Doubts can be beneficial for oneself.

337
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,390
I don't need something like that.

338
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,816
A bold attitude is
what's important in doing business.

339
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:36,868
How about using your home

340
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,623
as collateral for the sum of your loan?

341
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,336
My home?

342
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,424
Do you have anything else to use
as collateral?

343
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,056
No.

344
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:51,438
Since it is a large amount…

345
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh, my.

346
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:03,378
Your face is telling me
you are doubting yourself.

347
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:06,384
Of course, I'm not.

348
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,351
Okay, let's do it.

349
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:13,232
Okay. We'll draw up the contract.

350
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,488
Please prepare everything
impeccably for Mr. Ogami.

351
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:17,824
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

352
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:19,327
Thank you.

353
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,412
Our pleasure.

354
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:24,880
Ichiro.

355
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:28,513
Aren't we already the same as brothers?

356
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,866
[footsteps]

357
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,049
[Sarah, in English]
What are you thinking about?

358
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:52,101
Sorry. I've been a bit distracted.

359
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:55,316
What's wrong?

360
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:57,738
I'm fine.

361
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:00,744
Family issues?

362
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,498
Why would you ask that?

363
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:10,471
Well typically it's family, work,
relationships, or friends.

364
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,149
I said family figuring that there was
a 25% chance I'd be right.

365
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,155
I see.

366
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,252
[Sarah] Do you know why I came to Tokyo?

367
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:30,804
When I was, um, six,

368
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:35,020
my father left
my mom and I in rural Oregon.

369
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,110
He just got up and left.

370
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:42,786
No goodbye, no note. Nothing.

371
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:48,673
And then when my mom realized
what was going on, she was a mess.

372
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:53,014
I'm… I'm sorry.

373
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:57,941
I remember her laying
on the kitchen floor screaming,

374
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:01,322
"You fucking asshole."

375
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:04,913
"Son of bitch."

376
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,927
And I just went to my room,
I curled up in bed and I thought,

377
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:16,854
where is the furthest place
in the world I can escape to?

378
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,321
That was Japan.

379
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,080
That's why I'm here.

380
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,965
Why did you go to America?

381
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,731
[Ryu]
The Japanese don't confront you directly.

382
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,862
Instead, they whisper.

383
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:48,166
So eventually you hear them
from others and not from the source.

384
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:54,680
America was an escape
from the dark whispers circling my family.

385
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:04,240
So, um, how's work going? Better? I hope.

386
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:05,325
At the NPO?

387
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:06,244
Well, yeah,

388
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:10,043
unless you're doing some secret undercover
work you're not telling me about.

389
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:19,478
Well actually, there was something strange
that happened the other day.

390
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:20,898
What?

391
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,613
A farmer came in protesting,

392
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:27,621
but he was bloody,
like he'd been beaten up or something.

393
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:29,833
What was he protesting?

394
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,964
I didn't understand his complaint.

395
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:36,513
But farming is
a protected industry in Japan.

396
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:41,356
The government works with various
agricultural associations to protect them.

397
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,318
Do they have subsidies
from the government?

398
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:44,403
Yeah, they do.

399
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,533
Then why was he disgruntled?

400
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,539
That's what I couldn't figure out.

401
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:55,968
Well as they say,
where there's smoke, there's fire.

402
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,891
Yeah. Maybe.

403
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:03,901
We should look into this further.

404
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,163
But it will give me purpose,
and I need a story.

405
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,969
[in Japanese]
Is who he decides to date that concerning?

406
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:20,016
He might be in the right, you know.

407
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,146
She's a reporter.

408
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,233
And a foreigner.

409
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:26,404
And that's why you don't trust her?

410
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:27,741
That's not it.

411
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:30,538
You just don't like
the idea of them dating.

412
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,713
It's better to keep
a safe distance from her.

413
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:37,677
Your beliefs are outdated.

414
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:40,098
The times have changed
since we were young.

415
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:43,606
There are no annoying boundaries
in today's world.

416
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:47,321
It's still better to be safe.

417
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:52,331
Please leave Ryu alone.

418
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:01,098
He's young. And isn't he in love?

419
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,480
You need to let him go.

420
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:07,194
They are all adults now.

421
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:11,369
You can't protect them forever.

422
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:21,932
[driver] Thank you.

423
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,561
[driver] Thanks.

424
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:29,948
-Nami.
-Oh, my God!

425
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:31,535
What are you doing?

426
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:33,581
-I want to talk.
-There's nothing to say.

427
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,918
Please. I'm so lonely.

428
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:38,339
'Cause you can't have sex?

429
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:39,801
Because I miss you.

430
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,722
This talk is pointless.

431
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,314
Can't we start over?

432
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,527
-Let me go!
-I beg you!

433
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:52,451
Don't you already have someone at home?
