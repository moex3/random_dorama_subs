-Next is at 4 p.m.?
-Yes.

00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,421
No comment.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,263
Mr. Maruyama. Mr. Maruyama!

6
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,350
I might be able to help you.

7
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,279
What is it?

8
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,997
[panting on phone]

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,675
[Tanaka] This is the hostess accusing
your brother of sexual assault.

10
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,887
By the way, is this your brother?

11
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,311
-Isn't this Masashi Maruyama?
-Where did you get it?

12
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:53,774
I'm a veteran reporter, so…

13
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:54,985
Turn it off.

14
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,788
What does this have to do with me?

15
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:02,458
Everything.

16
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,796
It has everything to do with you.

17
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,011
Oh, really?

18
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:13,146
If I take this to the police, they will
continue investigating your brother,

19
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,693
and sooner or later,
he'll be found guilty.

20
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:21,580
After that, they will thoroughly
investigate all related parties.

21
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,168
Like his family

22
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,172
and you, his brother.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,894
How much do you want?

24
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:35,357
It's not about the money.

25
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:39,950
You're telling me to side with Saijo?

26
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,324
[farmer] It was originally
3.2 hectares wide.

27
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:05,913
-[Saijo] Okay.
-[farmer] And there is

28
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:08,001
a total of 375 paddy fields here.

29
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,713
-Wow. All of this?
-Yes.

30
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:13,052
And since they are on a slope…

31
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:17,144
Those people are only concerned
about their own profits.

32
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,156
They don't understand
that our agriculture is

33
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:28,751
Japan's heart, spirit, and its future.

34
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,761
I may be a member of the Watanabe Cabinet,

35
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,642
but I absolutely must say this one thing.

36
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:41,610
This country will never truly rise again

37
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:45,492
if we don't protect the people
supporting our agricultural industry.

38
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,707
[reporter on radio]
<i>When asked by reporters,</i>

39
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,172
<i>Finance Minister Sosuke Saijo
made it clear he is against</i>

40
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:56,932
<i>the Global Comprehensive Bill
currently in debate in parliament.</i>

41
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:59,896
<i>He stated the Bill will only lead</i>

42
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,236
<i>to the destruction
of Japan's primary economy.</i>

43
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,280
Can't we do this over the phone?

44
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,206
Tanaka from the <i>Daishin Times</i> came to me.

45
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,924
He showed me a video of you with
a hostess. A video I never wanted to see.

46
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:37,597
[panting on phone]

47
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,682
What?

48
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,770
[gasps]

49
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,648
What the hell is this?

50
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,988
-She tricked me.
-[panting stops]

51
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:52,877
But why didn't she give this video
to the police as evidence?

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,088
For money.

53
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,260
If she wanted money,
she would've gone directly to you.

54
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,597
Why involve someone else?

55
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,895
She wouldn't get a cent
if the cops got their hands on this.

56
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,609
It would be extortion
if she sent it to me.

57
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,909
You mean she's indirectly threatening you
by using Tanaka?

58
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:12,917
Tanaka's a dirty reporter.
Everyone knows he's in bed with Saijo.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,550
That dumb hostess wouldn't even think
of doing something like this.

60
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,265
What if it wasn't her? But Takeuchi?

61
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,060
Takeuchi?

62
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:28,574
[inhales sharply] Wait, didn't you say
you hold the party's swing vote?

63
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:30,326
It's not about me.

64
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:34,627
Someone's using me to pressure you.

65
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:39,094
Isn't all of this your problem?

66
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:42,977
If you hadn't done something stupid,
this would never have happened.

67
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,776
[Masashi] It'll get worse
if they keep investigating.

68
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,780
Then it'll be all over for you.

69
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,116
Stop it.

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,164
We're both in the same boat.
Don't forget that.

71
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,209
This isn't my problem.

72
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,675
Aren't they targeting you
and your swing vote?

73
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,969
It doesn't matter how.

74
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,017
Just fix it.

75
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:14,958
[server] Have a seat here.

00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,045

He's looking this way.

79
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:30,781
Who?

80
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:35,123
[chuckles] The man you saw
at the sushi place.

81
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,301
Yeah, he is.

82
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,851
Want to kiss?

83
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,272

Do you like him?

Nami!

00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,416
Are you a stalker?

[laughs] Why?

00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,263
Did you sleep with him?
That dirty old man?

100
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:08,184
Are you an idiot?

101
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,396
It has nothing to do with you!

102
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,570
Because you're a married man.

[Ogami scoffs]

The modern phone knows more
about its owner

112
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,479
than even his friends or lover do.

113
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:19,154
-[chuckles]
-[informant] Yes. That's true.

114
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:24,080
Carrying all your information with you
everywhere is too careless, isn't it?

115
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,917
[both chuckle]

116
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:31,804
The girl you mentioned
the other day, Ichiro's mistress.

117
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:33,558
[Ogami] Yeah.

118
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,192
[informant] She's from Fukuoka.
She came to Tokyo six years ago.

119
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,329
She's always been alone,
barely dating anyone.

120
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:52,638
That's why everyone was so surprised
when she suddenly started seeing Ichiro.

121
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:54,349
Really?

122
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:59,860
And her father killed himself
when she was young.

123
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:03,075
Her mother passed away
a few years later from cancer.

124
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,668
She was living with her grandmother
and brother before coming to Tokyo.

125
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,055
Her father's name was Kentaro Kawabata.

126
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,940
He was a government official in Fukuoka.

127
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,918
Are you sure his name was Kawabata?

128
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,262
Was he someone you knew?

129
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,310
Only a faint memory.

130
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,359
Kawabata was the name

131
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:45,702
of the official who committed suicide
during the bubble era.

132
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,678
His subordinate was arrested for taking
bribes from a major securities firm.

133
00:11:55,471 --> 00:12:00,941
The police were investigating his office.

134
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,988
Mr. Kawabata

135
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,497
took his own life

136
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:13,465
before the police could question him.

137
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,141
Anything else you'd like to know?

138
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,070
This is enough for now.

139
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,199
Thank you.

140
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:30,082
Only a "thank you"?

141
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,546
I'll be grateful…

142
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,806

I've got another job for you
if you want it.

Please don't post that video anywhere.

No need to worry.

157
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,511
There's no more use for it.

158
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,347
It won't be leaked.

Yes. He's a stubborn one.

163

Do you think he's in love with her?

164

00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,700
Hello, Kenichi.

167
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,869
Madam.

168
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,248
You forgot this.

169
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,008
I'll be away for a few days.

170
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:22,807
[grunts] I see. I had no idea.

171
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,772
This is more important than work.

172
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,990
Call me if anything happens.

173
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:32,911
I will.

174
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,248
Have a good trip.

175
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,601
[footsteps approaching]

176
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,836
I'm not sure about you working.

177
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,342
[sighs] Isn't it better to have
some income? No matter how small?

178
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,265
[chuckles] To be working at a flower shop…

179
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,562
I also have a plan, you know.

180
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:09,776
Soon, I'll have a talk with Hide
about starting a new business.

181
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:11,613
Oh, really?

182
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,661
Then what will we do in the meantime?

183
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,251
Don't you hate asking my father for money?

184
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,057
I'll be at the flower shop all afternoon.
So be sure to pick up the kids.

185
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,366
[Sarah, in English]
So, I read somewhere that Japan had

186
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,747
the second highest adoption rate
in the world.

187
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,208
Second behind the US.

188
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,673
Well, I don't know
anyone who's been adopted.

189
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,384
Right, 'cause here's the catch.

190
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:47,769
Ninety-five percent of Japanese
adoptions are adult adoptions.

191
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,652
So Japan has one of the lowest
adoption of children,

192
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,448
but one of the highest
in adoption of adults.

193
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,119
Okay. You mean <i>mukoyoshi</i>.

194
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,498
-Yeah, that. <i>Mukoyoshi</i>, yeah.
-Yeah.

195
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:05,345
Japanese do it to pass along lineage
and business successions.

196
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,563
-So, <i>muku</i> -- <i>Mukoyoshi</i>.
-Yeah.

197
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:13,988
It's only with men, right? Like,
I can't expect Japan to <i>mukoyoshi</i> a woman.

198
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,073
Right.

199
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:20,710
Actually, some of the biggest companies
in Japan have been run by adopted sons.

200
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,591
Even if they have biological sons?

201
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,177
-Yeah, some.
-What?

202
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:30,855
If they find out
their biological sons are incapable.

203
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:33,109
Wow.

204
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:34,905
That must suck.

205
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:38,328
Imagine your dad is like,
"Uh, son, you suck, so…

206
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,209
[inhales sharply] …I'm gonna adopt
this guy who's better than you

207
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,505
to run our company and be our new son."

208
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,764
Japanese are sometimes
practical about things.

209
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,272
Blood matters. Until it's about money.

210
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,215
Here we are.

211
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,987
[in Japanese] Anyone home?

212
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:18,491
[person] Yes?

213
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,455
I'll be right there.

214
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,719
Who are you?

215
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,641
Nice to meet you. My name is Ryu Ogami.

216
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,649
I work at the NPO, JCIAA, in Tokyo.

217
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:41,037
I am very sorry for what my husband did.

218
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,170
-But I have nothing more to say.
-[stutters] No.

219
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,719
That's not why we're here.

220
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,100
I can't help you.

221
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,188
Please leave.

222
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,045
[protestor] I've lived here my whole life.

223
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:09,678
Working the land.

224
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,226
Before me it was my father, grandfather.

225
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,694
All my ancestors farmed this land.

226
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:21,325
But

227
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,920
there is no one to take over
after all my children left for Tokyo.

228
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,509
Even so,

229
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,015
I must protect this land

230
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,606
that's been in my family for generations.

231
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,369
All I have is this land, and now
they are trying to take it away from me.

232
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:47,252
There should be something we can do.

233
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:50,759
That Global Bill.

234
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:55,226
If it passes,
it will be the end of farming.

235
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,778
Greedy politicians and businesses
will swoop in to take the land.

236
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:03,619
They'll take everything.

237
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:09,046
He's been struggling all alone.

238
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,718
Please forgive him.

239
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,473
I don't care what happens to me.

240
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,561
But

241
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:21,153
don't force me off my land

242
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,201
and make me die elsewhere.

243
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,913
I'd like to help you.

244
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,255
Who wants to buy your land?

245
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:34,889
They aren't nice enough to just "buy" it.

246
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,479
It's practically robbery.

247
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:42,863
They offered a good price for it.

248
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,243
It's not about the money!

249
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,957
I will

250
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:54,136
never sell this land. No matter the price.

251
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,142
I don't think there is a need to sell it.

252
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:59,271
You're protected by the law.

253
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:01,275
As if the law is on my side.

254
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,404
They've been

255
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:09,751
destroying this land to make it unusable.

256
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,965
To force me to leave.

257
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,677
What do you mean?

258
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,824
Can you see that construction site?

259
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,047
It will be a chemical factory.

260
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:37,848
If they dump their waste here,

261
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,982
it will pollute the land
and make it impossible to grow anything.

262
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:48,411
When that happens,
I'll be forced to sell this land.

263
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,375
That's what they want.

264
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,089
Who?

265
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:56,553
Who's the one doing that?

266
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,894
The NPO you work for.

[in English] You good?

00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,308
I thought I was doing some good.

276
00:22:03,562 --> 00:22:05,314
Maybe he wasn't telling the truth.

277
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,154
Doesn't have a reason to lie.

278
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:13,915
The farmer was alleging fraud.
It's not something we can leave alone.

279
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,925
Well you're an insider now.
You have access to information at the NPO.

280
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,182
Hey.

281
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,019
We can do this together.

282
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,444
No. You should keep clear of this.

283
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:31,491
What do you mean?

284
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,582
You're not from here.
You could get into trouble.

285
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:36,961
And that doesn't apply to you?

286
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:38,673
I'll have people to protect me.

287
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,844
Like your family?

288
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,975
And others.

You know what I despise the most?

290
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:52,952
Chauvinism disguised as chivalry.

291
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,039
I didn't mean it like that.

292
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,670
Then what did you mean?

328
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,862
-Oh, wait-- Hold on, hold on.
- <i>Right? Trust me?</i>

329
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:38,448
What?

330
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:42,583
As I mentioned before,
the Japanese reporters are not safe.

331
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,168
Do not trust them.

332
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:48,385
All righty, I gotcha.
What do you have for me now?

333
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,141
And that murder of Takeuchi's son,

334
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:54,732
that did not go down
like everything was reported.

335
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,405
The mother of the guy was saying
he didn't commit suicide.

336
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:02,163
I mean, committing suicide?
That's a fucking joke. He was murdered.

337
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:04,125
How do you know this?

338
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,046
<i>Everyone knows this!</i>

339
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:09,720
Not everyone, come on. I need evidence.

340
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,724
[laughs]

341
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:14,020
No one in Japan is going to talk to you.

342
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,483
So how am I meant to write
a story about this?

343
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,988
<i>Expose the man behind everything.</i>

344
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,706
The man who makes the orders. The Owl.

345
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,555
-[Sheena, in Japanese] Red.
-[Risako] Red.

346
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,605
[Sheena] Hmm.

347
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,149
Not red.

348
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:41,534
Wouldn't a simple design like this work?

349
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,412
Guess not.

350
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,418
[chuckles]

351
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,633
[giggling]

352
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:53,223
Don't we have anything else?

353
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:56,354
-[assistant] Well, what about this?
-Hmm?

354
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,404
That might work.

355
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,707
Hmm. Gorgeous.

356
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,295
What do you think?

357
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,382
It's gorgeous.

358
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,261
You like it?

359
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:13,514
Of course.

360
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:16,394
-Take it.
-[Risako gasps]

361
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:18,482
But isn't this really expensive?

362
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,864
You need to wear good clothes
since you'll be in the spotlight.

363
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:25,622
-But this is still--
-Don't think so hard about it.

364
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:28,126
Just trust me.

365
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,182
This way please.

366
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:08,791
Fashion is just like men.

367
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:13,008
Choose the one that fits you the best.

368
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,345
Not the other way around.

369
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,186
Even Ken?

370
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:22,234
[chuckles] That's even simpler.

371
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:25,324
I'm not dating his musical sense.

372
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,996
I think he's a great songwriter.

373
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,668
So they say.

374
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:39,728
But he's better in bed than in the studio.

375
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:47,535
[chuckles] Look, I'm already at this age.

376
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:53,171
It will take some time
for you to get your freedom.

377
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:58,473
[chuckles] Okay. This is yours too.

378
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:02,607
You really look good in it.

379
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:17,887
[door closes]

380
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,432
[lock beeps]

381
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,602
LIBERAL FRONTIER PARTY
HIROSHI MARUYAMA

382
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:52,957
Do you have an appointment?

383
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:58,594
[no audible dialogue]

384
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,977
-[contact] We'll talk later.
-Okay.

385
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:10,283
I'm Tamaki.

386
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:14,083
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Kenichi Mashima.

387
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,460
Nice to meet you.

388
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,301
Is there a place
where we can speak privately?

389
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:21,932
This way.

390
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:36,377
What did our CEO do?

391
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,314
Have a seat.

392
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,121
He's in trouble, isn't he?

393
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:57,962
Or someone like you wouldn't be here.

394
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:12,115
He hasn't come to the office
in the past few days.

395
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:18,461
Everyone here suspects
he's in some sort of trouble.

396
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,266
I'm investigating Mr. Maruyama
and his case.

397
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,352
I see.

398
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,941
How's the company doing?

399
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,070
Operationally?

400
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:33,324
[sighs]

401
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:40,631
Masashi's been spending money
like we're the most profitable in Japan.

402
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:42,217
And in reality?

403
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,179
[chuckles, inhales sharply]

404
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:48,438
There was a time we couldn't pay
the employees.

405
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:51,444
Which forced us to downsize the business.

406
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:53,782
Then I was told we were doing well,

407
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,874
but half the employees were
suddenly let go last week.

408
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:04,178
And your government contracts?

409
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,223
[stutters]

410
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,309
Construction projects?

411
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,396
Uh--

412
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:15,283
Even indirectly, all our projects are
government projects.

413
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:20,753
Was Hiroshi Maruyama involved
in those contracts?

414
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:24,218
No, but he frequently visited our office.

415
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,809
Were they involved in anything?

416
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,396
Well-- [chuckles, inhales sharply]

417
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,113
Neither of them are that stupid.

418
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:40,208
But Masashi is always bragging about
having a brother who's a great politician.

419
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,299
Saying he can get anything
if he asks his brother.

420
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:45,385
"Get anything"?

421
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:48,725
-Like what?
-Anything he asks for.

422
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:52,399
He was telling everyone to call him
if they run into any problems,

423
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:56,741
ordering Miyazaki beef at company parties,

424
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:59,956
and giving expensive gifts
and trips overseas.

425
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,089
But the company was deep in the red.

426
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:05,634
It's a complete mess.

427
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:07,179
I see.

428
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:16,948
[door opens]

429
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:20,288
[door closes]

430
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,342
[footsteps approaching]

431
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,022
[stranger] Mr. Maruyama?

432
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:35,443
[Masashi] Yeah.

433
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:37,907
Who are you?

434
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,623
[stranger]
Were you expecting someone different?

435
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,671
No, I wasn't really.

436
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:47,927
[stranger] Don't worry.

437
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:51,810
I know exactly why you're here.

438
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:54,106
What do you mean?

439
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:59,659
You want to do something about that woman
accusing you of assault, right?

440
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,340
So, should I just shut her up?

441
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:12,350
Or make her want nothing to do with you?
What will it be?

442
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:15,607
I only want her to withdraw
her accusation.

443
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,112
[stranger, in English] Okay.

444
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:20,743
[in Japanese] That's easy to do.

445
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:21,828
Hey.

446
00:34:29,844 --> 00:34:31,598
[in English] You must be kidding me.

447
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:35,898
What do you mean
you can't print the story?

448
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,987
-[sighs] Look. There's no story…
-[scoffs]

449
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:40,699
-For fuck's sake.
-…okay. It's just speculation!

450
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,369
You have no proof it wasn't a suicide!

451
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:43,789
So it just disappears?

452
00:34:43,872 --> 00:34:44,874
[sighs]

453
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,507
Who said disappeared? There was
nothing there in the first place.

454
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,430
Okay. Story about the cover-up.

455
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,230
I don't know. Was there a cover-up?

456
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:58,610
In Watergate, the cover-up was bigger
than the actual crime.

457
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,656
A story about the cover-ups in Japan.

458
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:04,622
You're just speculating now.
There's no story. There's no cover-up.

459
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:09,757
The informant told me the government is
eager not to have anything--

460
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,137
And I mean anything,
rise up as a scandal right now.

461
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,476
They have people keeping everyone quiet
on these kind of things.

462
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:20,988
Well, if you have anything more than
an unconfirmed informant

463
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:23,535
about the government cover-up,
yes, we can print that.

464
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:25,622
But you don't have anything!

465
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,348
[in Japanese] Where were you?

466
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,060
Working.

467
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,941
Dinner with the investors. I texted you.

468
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:22,903
Guess you didn't see it.

469
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:24,657
[inhales deeply]

470
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,378
Were you drinking?

471
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:41,231
At least shower before coming home
after you've had sex with another woman.

472
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,778
I-- [chuckles]

473
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:45,866
[laughing]

474
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,247
What?

475
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:52,630
[sniffs] I'm a real idiot, aren't I?

476
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,178
I really believed you had
a change of heart.

477
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:00,227
Who is she?

478
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:02,858
You're very drunk.

479
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,444
I'm going to bed.

480
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,035
[glass smashes]

481
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:09,371
[shouting] Who is she?

482
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:11,208
[Ichiro sighs]

483
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,049
I think I have a right to know.

484
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:19,474
Hey. Who are you having an affair with?

485
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:21,854
Tell me! Who is she?

486
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,273
Say it!

487
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:27,031
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

488
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:29,494
Tell me! Who is she?

489

Hey!

00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,668
[panting]

491
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:37,385
You're not half as good as your father.

492
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:40,349
You don't even deserve
to call him "Father."

493
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:43,732
[gasps]

494

[breathing shakily]

496
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:07,988
Saho?

497
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:11,746
[gasps]

498
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,201
[phone ringing]

RECEIVING
ICHIRO OGAMI

501
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:43,935
What's wrong?

502
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,022
[Ichiro] <i>Father.</i>

503
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,655
What happened?

504
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,705
Saho,

505
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,794
I think I killed her.
