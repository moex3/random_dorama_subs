00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,597
I surrender.

00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,647
This makes you a member
of the Five Winds. Got it?

7
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:33,483
Yeah.

00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,738
Then get up.

00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,844
We'll fight together

[Younger Ryu] Yeah.

I changed my mind. I'm not joining you.

12

I'm going to fight you!

Get ready! Manabu.

[doctor] I'll go back now.

How is she?

46
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,250
Well,

47
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:57,469
she hasn't regained consciousness yet
but she is not in a coma.

48
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,684
We stopped her bleeding,
and she is stable.

49
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,354
For now, she's doing fine.

50
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,573
However, since it is a head injury,

51
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:12,415
we will need to keep a close watch on
her tests and vitals for the time being.

52
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:19,931
Are you her family?

53
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:23,437
We're her in-laws.

54
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,443
I see.

55
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,615
I don't think there is anything
you can do right now.

56
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:33,124
It will be good to stay
by her side tonight.

57
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,463
Please excuse me.

about your patient.

[doctor] Sure. Let's talk over there.

65
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,375
[Ogami] What did you say to the police?

66
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,964
[Ichiro] I said it was an accident.

67
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,057
It's all my fault.

68
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:28,025
You took your wife's kindness for granted.

69

He said Saho will be fine.

Thank goodness.

We were lucky.

72
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,431
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,813
It really was an accident.

74
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:51,321
I'll contact everyone

75
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,036
and tell them she had an accident,
but she's doing fine.

76
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,581
That is not necessary.

77
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,632
You really don't change, do you?

78
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,262
We will keep this between us.

79
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,016
We are a family.

80
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,064
We shouldn't keep secrets from each other.

81

There will always be secrets
between family.

It's my pleasure.

Plus I got to meet your boyfriend.

It's really hard to make good friends
working in this industry.

This is the first time Sheena's
given a newbie so much attention.

00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:06,221
That's because she's so talented.
I can tell.

Let me tell you.
Your girlfriend is a true genius.

Thank you.

Well,

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,967
it was at a boring business party.

98
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:29,309
I don't really know why Risako was there.

99
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,942
But I couldn't take my eyes off of her.

100
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,532
So you made the first move?

101
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:41,041
No. She approached me first.

102
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:46,385
I felt something special from him.

103
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,432
It's hard to put into words.

104
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,648
What about you two?

-[chuckles]
-[giggles]

106
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:02,166
Sorry. He's not familiar with
the music business so he didn't know.

107
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,089
It's refreshing. I like it.

108
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:08,888
So there was someone who hasn't been
poisoned by the gossip rags.

109
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,061
I apologize if my question was rude.

110
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,732
[Sheena] Not at all.

111
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,153
No need for apologies.
It's all in the past.

Have some more, Koji.

Ken was a married man.

114
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:42,330
I met Sheena
when my marriage was falling apart.

[Sheena sighs]

116
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,923
To put it simply,

117
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:50,555
he had a disgustingly messy divorce.

118
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,603
Talking about it like this

119
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:55,941
makes it seem like
it was such a long time ago.

120
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,116
I'm sorry I didn't know.

121
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,709
Not at all.
I'm happily in love with Sheena now.

122
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,382
Still, I'm so sorry.

123
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,471
He doesn't know anything
about show business.

124
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,603
[whispers] That's why I apologized.

125
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,481
More importantly…

126
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,949
who would like more wine?

127
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:25,584
It's a Château Haut-Brion.
From the 2009 vintage.

128
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,172
To a shining future

129
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,344
and a happy ending.

130
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:33,850
Cheers.

131
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,229
[all] Cheers.

132
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:43,953
[Koji] It's an honor to meet you both.

133
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,374
Same here.

134
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:53,890
Why does it matter?
The two of them didn't seem to care.

135
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:57,689
You knew about the huge scandal
with Ken and his ex-wife, didn't you?

136
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,027
I didn't know the other woman was Sheena.

137
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,323
Yeah, right. That's no excuse.

138
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:04,870
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,456
Didn't you do it on purpose?

140
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,085
Of course not.

141
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:12,678
I don't know why, but you wanted to
make them feel bad.

142
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:14,097
Why would I?

143
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,850
Because you felt inferior?

144
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,984
What?

145
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,488
Inferior to them? 'Cause they are famous?

146
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,200
Is there any other reason?

147
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,706
Because I don't want you
to turn out like them!

148
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,043
Stop being so jealous. It's so stupid.

149
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,057
-Excuse me.
-[driver] Yes?

150
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,769
Stop the car here. I'm getting off.

00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,314

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,733
I need to review it some more.

168
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:28,323
It's doubtful whether
it really is beneficial for our nation.

169
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:31,412
-Are you changing your stance?
-No comment.

170
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:32,999
Will you oppose the prime minister?

171
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,168
No comment.

172
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,005
-Please say something.
-No comment.

173
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,216
Please.

174
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,557
I know you're trying to get me
to say a few words.

175
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,019
But it won't work. [chuckles]

176
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,668
Do you remember Kaori?

177
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,091
The hostess.

178
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,178
<i>The girl who was really into you.</i>

179
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,355
Welcome to our bar. How are you?

180
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:11,827
Good. I'd be surprised
if you didn't remember her.

181
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:14,791
-What about her?
-Did you sleep with her?

182
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,294
What? Of course not.

183
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,298
Be honest. No need to be embarrassed.

184
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:19,885
It's the truth.

185
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:22,056
But it's not like
the opportunity didn't come up.

186
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,493
Do you remember she had
a peacock tattoo on her back?

187
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:34,873
Yeah.

188
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,627
And Tetsu?

189
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,175
Wasn't he Kaori's friend?
The one making money online.

190
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:44,559
Yeah. A yakuza who allegedly
makes his money online.

191
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,855
He's really obsessed with tattoos.

192
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,274
What are you trying to say?

193
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,485
Listen to the end.

194
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:54,245
Tetsu's been investing
in Bitcoin since the beginning.

195
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,084
He was also giving them out
to the hostesses like candy.

196
00:14:57,794 --> 00:15:00,883
And his favorite girl was Kaori.

197
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,971
Okay.

198
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:09,400
I heard that he tattooed
his Bitcoin password onto Kaori.

199
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,404
[chuckles]

200
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,741
Is that true?

201
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,623
I don't get why he would tattoo
his password onto a hostess.

202
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,211
There's no special reason. He was drunk.

203
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,144
Apparently he has
1,000 Bitcoins in that account.

204
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,862
It was only worth 300,000 yen at the time,

205
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:34,743
but today, a single Bitcoin is
worth over 1.5 million.

206
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,124
1.5 million times 1,000 is…

207
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,253
-1.5 billion yen.
-[scoffs]

208
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:44,136
Kaori has no idea she has
a tattoo worth 1.5 billion on her body.

209
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,265
So?

210
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:50,315
Why don't you go find and copy
that password from her body?

211
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:53,781
That's crazy.

212
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,787
Don't you need money? So do I.

213
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,043
-That's a crime.
-She doesn't even know she has it.

214
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:05,596
If I steal the password and take
his money, what will that yakuza do?

215
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,561
It's a crypto asset. No one will find out.

216
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,023
You just need the password.

217
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:15,616
[sighs]

218
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,294
How will we split it?

219
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,310
It seems Mr. Maruyama
will side with Mr. Saijo.

220
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:31,732
What will you do?

221
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:36,533
[Ogami] It is now our turn to make a move.

222
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,173
INNOVATION - SHIORI WATANABE

223
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,383
[Watanabe] Yes.

224
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,639
All right.

225
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,143
I understand.

226
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,857
PRIME MINISTER
SHIORI WATANABE

227
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,201
The Bill will fail if Maruyama's faction

228
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,374
votes against it.

229
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:05,841
And I will go down with it.

230
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,804
That's right.

231
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,183
We cannot afford to lose.

232
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:15,151
How much do you trust Mr. Ogami?

233
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,034
He has my complete trust.

234
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:22,750
Why do you ask?

235
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,927
He won't betray me.

236
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,434
But is he as powerful now

237
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,064
as he was in the past?

238
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,943
His former strength?

239
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,118
Yes. He's too pure-hearted.

240
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,086
There is no one

241
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,468
who believes in this country

242
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,307
as much as he does.

243
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:01,745
And that is Mr. Ogami's weakness?

244
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:03,498
I'm not sure.

245
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:09,009
But his end will come one day.

246
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,932
Isn't that right?

247
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,628
[Takeuchi] <i>The prime minister is furious.</i>

248
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:30,301
The man you promised to convince,
Maruyama,

249
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,765
has switched sides.

250
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:36,313
And the situation has become
something we never expected.

251
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:38,652
It is not over yet.

252
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:42,075
I can make Mr. Maruyama change his mind.

253
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,083
Are you sure?

254
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,676
He is a man
who easily flipped his position

255
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,642
after once giving his support to the Bill.

256
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:57,565
We can simply give his arm a twist.

257
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,694
[Takeuchi] However,

258
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:03,326
he already made a public declaration.

259
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:05,998
Even if it's Maruyama,

260
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,670
he can't reverse his position again.

261
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,215
No.

262
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,302
It is not impossible.

263
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,120

00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,227
-Sorry.
-Check on that.

270
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:25,479
Got it.

271
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,279
[grunts]

272
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,784
Where were you?

273
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,370
We have a ton of work to do.

274
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,003
Sorry. There was a family issue.

275
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:40,636
I'm sorry for not informing you first.

276
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:44,644
It will take you a lot of time
to go through all these applications.

277
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,106
Finish them by the deadline.

278
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,989
Okay. Even if I have to do overtime,
I'll get it all done.

279
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,202
I'm counting on you.

280
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:02,721
Is everything okay?

281
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:06,019
Yes. Why?

282
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:07,313
Nothing.

283
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,531
You just seem a little different.

284
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:23,805
I took photos and retrieved one
of the gift certificate booklets.

285
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,270
I have yet to look into the others.

286
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,024
All right.

287
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:34,284
<i>The real names of businesses
and public officials were in the ledger.</i>

288
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:39,754
Surely you can get
a few of them to testify.

289
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:42,718
I have everything we need.

290
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,346
Good.

291
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:48,395
<i>However, that hostess, Miki.</i>

292
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:54,324
As of last month, her credit card debt is
thirteen million yen.

293
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:57,163
<i>It seems she met a man
at the club she works at</i>

294
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:03,843
<i>who told her how to make extra money
by filming Mr. Maruyama for blackmail.</i>

295
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,306
Who was it?

296
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,352
<i>She</i>

297
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:11,066
<i>doesn't know.</i>

298
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,407
[staff member] I will delete
the questionable posts.

299
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:18,540
And give suggestions for future posts.

300
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,090
Like frequently reacting to
current news, and books

301
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:25,887
and products released
by other celebrities.

302
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:30,522
We'll mix posts about your work
and your private life

303
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:35,156
to increase your viewer
and follower count.

304
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,580
Your opinion on the posts will
always be respected.

305
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:44,382
It may be annoying, but in the end,
it's the easiest and safest method.

306
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,138
Trust me.

307
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:50,812
You'll be trolled
if you do it on your own.

308
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,066
Just hold on.

309
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,741
You told me to stop posting.
Now you're telling me to post more?

310
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:59,914
I'm saying the risks are too high
when you post on your own.

311
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,007
Your official social media account
will be managed by the company.

312
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,930
Then how do I stay in touch
with my friends?

313
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,434
Like normal.

314
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:14,944
However, you'll need to
go through us first.

315
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,198
They might take a screenshot of it.

316
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,204
My friends won't do that.

317
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:24,087
Never forget there are people
who will do anything for money.

318
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,636
From now on,

319
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,519
don't recklessly post about
where you've been or what you ate.

320
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,773
Are you still dating that guy?

321
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:37,363
-Yes.
-Break up. Don't make me say it twice.

322
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,496
Hey. You only get one shot
at becoming a star.

323
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,503
Remember, we're all in this together.

324
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,507
Bear with it.

325
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:49,012
Don't you want to be a star?

326
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:52,728
Yes.

327
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:02,038
[in English] You mentioned the other day

328
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,459
that you've got people
who can protect you.

329

-Welcome.
-[in English] Thank you.

334
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:23,288
Sarah, there are things in this country
that are not open.

335
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,256
Everything from the outside looks nice,
polite and orderly, but--

336
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,388
that's not what really happens here.

337
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:34,102
Okay, would you like to share?

[waiter, in Japanese] I'll be back
to take your order.

341
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,376
A coffee and black tea, please.

342
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,461
[waiter] Coming right up.

343
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,392
[in English] You need to
play straight with me.

very strong. Powerful.

346
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,470
This is the moment where you tell me
your family is yakuza, right?

347
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:15,810
No.

348
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,273
My father, he's…

349
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,616
He's what we Japanese call a <i>kuromaku</i>.

350
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,582
He's the power behind the power.

351
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,086
They stay hidden from the spotlight.

352
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:34,096
Very few things happen in Japan without
the approval of these power brokers.

353
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,100
It's been like this for centuries.

354
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:40,359
No one ever talks about
what my father does,

355
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:42,781
not even his family.

356
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,329
But the prime minister showed up
at his birthday party.

357
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,545
That says everything you need to know.

358
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:53,218
And you?

359
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,686
I'm just someone who's trying to
figure things out.

360
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:01,860
And you need to be careful.

361
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,286
You're a journalist. And my father is
at odds with the media.

362
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:10,002
Especially the foreign media.
