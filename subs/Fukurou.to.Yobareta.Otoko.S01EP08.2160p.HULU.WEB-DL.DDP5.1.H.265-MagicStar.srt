00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:03,496
[Mashima, in Japanese] I can go with you
if you need me.

2
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,296
It is just a visit to an old friend.

3
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,260
-All right.

4
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:13,224
I want to phone
Hiroshi and Masashi Maruyama today.

5
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:16,773
Please make the arrangements.

6
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,652
Understood.

7
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,740
Anything else?

8
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,702
Looks like it will rain.

9
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,127
How troublesome.

10
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,165
Please come again.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,169
Thank you.

12
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,716
Thank you.

13
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,657
Sorry, can I take a break?

14
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,201
Yes, of course.

15
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:16,142
[gasps] Sorry.

16
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:17,896
Ms. Ogami?

17
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:22,780
It's Kageyama.
I changed my name when I got married.

18
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,331
It's nice to see you again, Mr. Nakamura.

19
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,880
We haven't met since you quit, right?

20
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:33,134
How are your children?

21
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,430
-They are well. Thank you for asking.
-[chuckles]

22
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,892
And your husband?

23
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:38,269
He's fine too.

24
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:42,862
Are you working here?

25
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:46,202
[sighs] Only for a little bit.

26
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,247
It's better than staying home all day.

27
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,501
I see.

28
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,138
You still look the same.

29
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,602
I'm glad you're doing well.

30
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:00,648
You too.

31
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,407
How is everyone at the office?

32
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,910
[chuckles]

33
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,539
Same as always.

34
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,254
But they are all doing well.

35
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:18,015
It was really tough after you quit.

36
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:23,777
You were the only one who could
keep the numbers organized.

37
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,908
[chuckling] That's all in the past.

38
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,413
Yeah.

39
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,811
Let's keep in touch.

40
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,234
Call me here at any time.

42
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,619

Minister Maruyama's brother?

54
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,814
If this is a prank, I'm hanging up.

00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:46,943
[Ogami] <i>I will keep it short.</i>

<i>This is about your brother
and the charges against you.</i>

57
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,126
Wait a minute.

58
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,504
Hey.

59
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:58,800
I'll go back to work.

60
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:06,858
And?

61
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,202
A hostess is accusing you of assault,
isn't she?

62
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:17,087
That is your personal indiscretion.

63
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:21,721
<i>On the other hand, despite the difficult
circumstances of your company,</i>

<i>handing out lavish gifts wherever you go.</i>

The recipients exchange your gifts

67
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,297
place their votes for your brother.

68
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:43,807
<i>It is a scheme to maintain

Who the hell are you? That's all bullshit.

74
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:05,809
You already know

75
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:09,149
that this is the truth.

76
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:13,199
<i>Which story should
be revealed to the public?</i>

77

<i>Whether or not you can protect

It is very simple.

89

<i>It won't be a heavy charge.</i>

<i>And we can keep your vote buying
between us.</i>

It's still too early.

I wonder how the Owl will react?

98
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:49,182
Who cares? It's no longer an era
where the government moves just because

99
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,395
he's scampering about.

100
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:01,206
You are unfortunate.

I apologize for not speaking with you

<i>I'm not in Tokyo right now due to my work.</i>

104
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:13,690
I completely understand.

105
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:15,610
But…

106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,575
<i>You will only continue to be unhappy</i>

107
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,413
if you stay with Ichiro.

108
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:27,968
Why don't you go back to your parents'?

109
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:31,768
<i>Wouldn't that be your best choice?</i>

110
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,066
Have you told this to Ichiro?

111
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,362
<i>I will call him after this.</i>

112
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,786
In other words…

113
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:43,248
Divorce is the only answer.

114
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:54,437
I'm not sure. I need to think about this.

115
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:55,649
<i>Sure.</i>

116
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,072
I have added extra funds to your account.

117
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,663
It was just an accident.

118
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,546
Everything was kept private.

119
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,927
If anyone asks,

120
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:14,269
tell them you and your husband were
not a good match.

121
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,233
<i>Will that do?</i>

122
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:20,741
Yes.

[chuckles]

124
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,761
[in English] Are you sure it's here?

125
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:57,773
Not a place you would think
a chemical company would be headquartered.

126
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,277
So we're looking at it.

127
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,660
That's the registered address.

There are several companies that
keep coming up on NPO's accounting files.

132
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,403
One of the vendors
is a company called Five Winds.

133
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,575
So they're pre-vetted by the government?

134
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:46,077
Yes, as subcontractors.

135
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,332
And Five Winds?

136
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,296
They received almost 500 million yen
in one year.

137
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,300
500 million yen?

138
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,513
An NPO with that kind of money?

139
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:58,603
And next to the chemical company
the farmer talked about.

140
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:04,990
Thank you.

141
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,203
And there's more.

142
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,040
What do you mean?

143
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,925
It was also the name of the gang that
my childhood friend and I made up as kids.

144
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,181
Okay. So what?

145
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,435
The politician, Takeuchi,

146
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,149
his son was killed recently.

147
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,947
My family was close to theirs.

148
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,412
The son, Manabu,
we were childhood friends.

149
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,296
And I made up the name of the gang.
We called it Five Winds.

150
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:35,844
You think it's related?

151
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,306
That it's his company?

152
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:42,941
Maybe.

153
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,448
All right.
There's a lot of news around that.

154
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,082
He tried to break up a fight at a club.

155
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,629
Got killed in the brawl.

156
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:58,346
Then his killer committed suicide
while waiting for his trial.

157
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,058
And no one investigated?

158
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,023
No, nothing happened.

159
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,272
[Nakamura, in Japanese] Mrs. Kageyama.

160
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:48,573
Sorry.

161
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,369
I was just in the area.

162
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:53,541
Wait.

163
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:02,099
Please forget everything
that happened in the past.

164
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,103
I know.

165
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,525
It was my fault.

166
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,785
I've changed since then, you know.

167
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,549
I have a husband now.

168
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,469
I know that too.

169
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:26,815
When I said you can come back anytime,
of course it meant working here.

170
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:31,867
I mean it. If you want to,
I'll happily help you.

173

Because of my children.

174
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,425
You were really good at your job.

00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:45,102
-You didn't have to quit.
-No. I did.

176
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,897
Just to get married?

177
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,859
That's not how you felt.

00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:58,546
Think about it.

182
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,100
My husband will not like it
if I went back to my old company.

183
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,776
And if you'll be my manager again,

184
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,031
he'll hate it even more.

185
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,035
You're right.

186
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,586
I'll ask them to place you
in a different department.

187
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:23,888
Aren't you working part-time?

188
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:27,478
I can tell it's not just to pass the time.

189
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,657
It's temporary. Until my husband
gets back on his feet--

190
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,243
You should come back.

191
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,961
Japan's society has changed.

Your brother will plead guilty
to sexual assault.

214
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,243
And that will be the end of it.

215
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,163
And then?

216
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,877
<i>You know very well</i>

217
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:09,557
your faction has the prime minister's fate
in their hands.

218
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,981
So what do you want me to do?

219
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:18,742
Think about what benefits you.
Then act on it.

220
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,540
In other words,

221
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,048

Shin, let's clean up.

225
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,511
Yeah.

226
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:23,539
[Riko] Let's go play upstairs.

227
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:24,666
Okay.

228
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,347
I'm thinking of going back to work.

229
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,439
What do you think?

230
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,739
Only temporarily,

231
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,327
until things settle down.

232
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,169
Working in finance isn't as easy
as you think.

233
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,300
Shouldn't you be happy?

234
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:51,803
Well,

235
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,851
I'd be happy if it's just for you.

236
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:58,107
But I'm the one who is responsible
for this family.

237
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,238
What will I become if you start working?

238
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:05,956
You-- Then how much longer do you need?

239
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:08,921
A few days.

240
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,050
Everything will be resolved in a week.

241
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,310

So which company were you thinking about?

245
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,121
My old one.

00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,502
[chuckles] You can't.

247
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,546
Why?

248
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:33,219
There was a reason you quit.
That's why you can't go back.

249
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,975
I quit because I was marrying you.

250
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,352
No.

251
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,273
Your boss was sexually harassing you.

252
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,901
How can you even bring that up now?

253
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,199
I'm going back to work for this family.

254
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,707

I'm responsible for this family!

Vice-Minister Hiroshi Maruyama is

We weren't like this
when we were in office.

Did I owe you any favors?

267
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:29,577
For you to come this far to see me.

268
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,429
I will have Saho divorce.

It is for her future.

What happened?

274
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:08,320
My son is not good enough
for your daughter.

275
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:10,826
An affair?

276
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,671
A man will have one or two affairs.

277
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:20,971
Saho only needs to grin and bear it.

You are wrong.

279
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:28,695
She has a right to live a happy life.

280
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:35,458
Saho will divorce my son
and return to this house.

Even if she becomes an abandoned divorcée?

This is the best solution.

283
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:51,239
She will only bring shame to this family
if she returns after a second divorce.

284
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,206
It is her life.

285
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,128
She should decide for herself.

286
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:02,846
Divorce is nothing special in these times.

287
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,566
It is different from when we were young.

288
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,827
You should stop thinking
everything will go your way.

00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,918
You are a politician.

290

So?

295
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:47,268
It will only hurt you and your family
if she stays in this marriage.

Ending it quickly is for Saho's sake.

Look, I don't want
to fight with you over this.

334
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:11,932
Go and sing.

335
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,477
I'll stay home.

336
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,655
I don't want to get involved
in these petty things.

337

But I want you to be there.

338

You don't have a choice, do you?

No.

340
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,645
I make my own decisions.

341
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:38,945
Okay.

342
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,086
I need to finish my makeup.

343
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:51,052
And send my manager that petty photo.

-Okay.

348

Pardon me.

349
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:28,920
This is our newest singer, Risako Ogami.

350
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,339
I'm Risako Ogami.

Long time no see, Mr. Sato.

-Thank you for coming today.
-Not at all.

364
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:03,154
This is Risako Ogami.

365
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:06,620
She's making her debut soon.
She's going to be a big hit.

366
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:07,872
Nice to meet you.

367
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:13,133
Mr. Sato is the vice president of
Muse Music. He's a legend in the industry.

368
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,304
No, you're exaggerating.

369
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,431
Don't be so humble.

How long has it been?
I'm so happy to see you.

374
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,920
Good to see you're well.

375
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,258
You too, Mr. Sato. I'll talk to you later.

376
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,228
I'm happy to see you too.

377
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:42,609
Honey, you look gorgeous.

378
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,698
Didn't I say that dress is perfect?

379
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:48,161
Yes, thank you so much.

380
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:52,211
You surprised me.
I didn't know you were coming.

381
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,177
I can't miss such an important day.

382
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,516
And? What will you sing?

383
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:02,607
The song Ken wrote for me.
We're debuting it here.

384
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,569
Really?

385
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,282
Even though you could sing your own song?

386
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,667
Ken is the one who chooses the song.

387
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,683
Don't you want to sing the song you wrote?

388
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,108
Of course I do.

389
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:26,655
If it's okay with Ken.

390
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:28,491
Okay.

391
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:31,330
I'll try to talk to him.

392
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:37,594
CONGRATULATIONS
RISAKO OGAMI - SHEENA

393
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,350
Risako, did you hear you're

394
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:44,273
-…singing your song?
-Really?

395
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:45,818
That's what I was told.

396
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:47,488
What happened?

397
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:50,745
Sheena did it.

398
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:51,872
[laughs]

399
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,130
Will you be okay?

00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,803
Yes.

[person 2] It's taking too long.

00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,272
Sheena.

404
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,444
Why did you do that?

405
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:33,998
It's a good song.
This will be good for her.

406
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:36,127
But it's not her debut song.

407
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:50,698
There's no need to be scared
even if she is more talented than you.

408
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:53,662
It could just be beginner's luck.

409
00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:58,881
I don't get it.

410
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:01,845
It's fine.

411
00:31:03,682 --> 00:31:07,565
Be sure to give your new singer
a good introduction.

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,998
<i>Send a message to Ichiro.</i>

497
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:01,297
<i>A sweet message.</i>

498
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,308
<i>Tell him you're worried about his wife.</i>

499
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,067
<i>It will be a perfect scenario.</i>

500
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:15,660
<i>Just like the one you've dreamed of.</i>

501
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:22,507
<i>Then ask if you can see him.</i>

502
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:26,515
<i>At his favorite place.</i>

503
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:30,982
<i>Your makeup that day should look special.</i>

504
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:37,788
<i>Be sure to make yourself look
especially beautiful and enchanting.</i>

505
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:46,471
<i>Go early and wait for him.</i>

506
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:52,108
<i>At a place where he can see you.</i>

507
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:58,579
<i>When he arrives, take his hand</i>

508
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,961
<i>and tell him how much you've missed him.</i>

509
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,098
<i>Then say, "Let's take a walk."</i>

510
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:12,440
<i>Talk about your memories
of when you first met.</i>

511
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:18,368
<i>And the troubles you overcame together.</i>

512
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,130
<i>Then turn around</i>

513
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,556
<i>and tell him you have
something important to tell him.</i>

514
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:34,568
<i>Say, "I pray that our relationship will
never change."</i>

515
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:40,037
<i>And finally…</i>

516
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,049
I'm pregnant.
