1
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:46,630
Plagued by low approval ratings,
the Watanabe Cabinet is

2
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:48,383
now facing a crisis.

3
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,684
<i>The Democratic Constitutional Party</i>

4
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,230
<i>submitted a motion of no confidence
yesterday,</i>

5
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:58,946
<i>accusing the Watanabe Cabinet
of ignoring the opinions of its citizens.</i>

6
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:03,329
<i>A no-confidence motion was expected
to be submitted during this session…</i>

7
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,916
NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION SUBMITTED

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,006
<i>…but the timing of it,
right before this weekend's final vote</i>

9
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:10,761
<i>on the Global Bill,
has left many politicians stunned.</i>

10
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,397
<i>The Prime Minister's Cabinet responded
with a detailed--</i>

11
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:19,696
What are you thinking?

12
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,660
There is something odd about this.

13
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:30,300
The opposing camp would not do
something like this, unless…

14
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,893
they made some sort of deal with someone.

15
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:36,772
Is it Saijo?

16
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,943
Don't jump to conclusions.

17
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:47,836
However, something is happening
out of my sight.

18
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,173
What should we do?

19
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:01,237
I'll have a talk
with Secretary-General Takeuchi.

20
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,999
Do you think he knew about this?

21
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,420
He must have.

22
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,301
However…

23
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:16,935
he did not say a word to me.

24
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,703
Prime Minister Watanabe will resign,
and the Global Bill will fail.

25
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:39,939
I'm pregnant.

26
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:43,989
I'm carrying your child.

27
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,874
Really?

28
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,838
I'm really happy.

29
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,103
Really, really happy.

30
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:01,733
Me too.

31
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,948
I was afraid of what you'd say.

32
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,537
-Why would you be?
-[chuckles]

33
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,584
Doesn't it complicate things?

34
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,423
I know it will.

35
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,970
Actually, it's the opposite.

36
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,815
Will you divorce your wife?

37
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,401
Yeah.

38
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:27,242
I don't love her. I'll get a divorce.

39
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:32,127
Does that mean
we can get married right away?

40
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,507
No.

41
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,559
You're not ready to?

42
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,646
I am.

43
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,403
I just need to figure things out.

44
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:50,581
[Nami] But you're scared because
you don't know how your family will react.

45
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,215
What era are we living in?

46
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:57,887
I know.

47
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,643
I know in my head.

48
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:09,243
I don't want this child to grow up
looking at a father he can't respect.

49
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,052
What happened?

50
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,685
Well… [chuckles]
…I'm not exactly sure myself.

51
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:27,362
[Ogami] <i>You kept
the motion of no confidence a secret.</i>

52
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:31,036
I never knew about it. Believe me.

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,798
Are you telling me to believe
you weren't the one

54
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:38,886
<i>who convinced them to submit it?</i>

55
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:42,852
You must believe me.

56
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:48,780
So, who will be the next prime minister?

57
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,536
I can't say for certain.

58
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:55,126
It's a complicated
and confusing situation.

59
00:05:56,378 --> 00:06:00,094
Prime Minister Watanabe has
lost her power,

60
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:02,015
<i>and I cannot predict what will come next.</i>

61
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:07,067
What will your faction do?

62
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:11,367
Formally, they will

63
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,331
vote for me.

64
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,337
[Ogami laughs]

65
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,844
Yes, they will.

66
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,265
[chuckles]

67
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:43,097
[door closes]

68
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:51,030
[breathes deeply] Wow, that looks amazing.

69
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,327
It was yesterday's dinner.

70
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,413
[sighs]

71
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,167
I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:03,012
But, I really need to get
right back to work. Sorry.

73
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,433
Work?

74
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,437
Yeah.

75
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:09,859
There's a lot going on.
It's an important time.

76
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,161
I really need to go now.

77
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,296
I really have a lot to think about
these days.

78
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,806
But everything will be
finished by this weekend.

79
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,437
Okay.

80
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:32,153
[Kageyama] I'll get going now.

81
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:33,615
Wait.

82
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:36,328
What?

83
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,712
Never mind.

84
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,259
It's nothing.

85
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:44,846
[sighs]

86
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,731
On top of Maruyama's dumb antics,

87
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:34,319
Saijo has been lurking around
like a hyena.

88
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,283
There is no one I can trust anymore.

89
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,416
-[sighs]
-[Ogami] Was it Secretary-General Takeuchi

90
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,678
who gave the opposing party the suggestion
to submit the motion of no confidence?

91
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,305
I don't know.

92
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:52,146
Saijo could have made a deal with them.

93
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,242
Isn't this the first time
you were completely in the dark?

94
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,373
This is not a problem with me,

95
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,170
but with you.

96
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,383
Do you really think so?

97
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:11,268
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

98
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:16,738
You should take the time
to look in the mirror.

99
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,533
And you?

100
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,579
Me?

101
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,457
I always do

102
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:26,549
what I think is right.

103
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:38,405
[clicks tongue, sighs]

104
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,669
So, how much trust can you give Takeuchi?

105
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,090
Why ask now?

106
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,847
I'm thinking about who would
benefit the most from this.

107
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,235
[sighs]

108
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,471
Listen. It all depends on you.

109
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,352
On me?

110
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,231
What do you mean?

111
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:20,239
In any case, you think I'm the problem.

112
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:25,542
That's why… [whispering]
…that man created a way out for you.

113
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,301
Not for me. For you.

114
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:37,356
Hey, this is a problem you made.

115
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,570
Partying with women at your age.

116
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,323
Not thinking about your position.

117
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,828
What else would it be but reckless?

118
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,794
This would never have happened
if you weren't so stupid.

119
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,759
[Masashi sighs]

120
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,432
It's not like I'm always partying.

121
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,566
Everyone has to let loose sometimes.

122
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,658
And you say I'm stupid?

123
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,622
Then what about you?

124
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,966
Look in my eyes and say
your integrity is spotless.

125
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,719
[skateboard clatters, echoes]

126
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:18,815
You'll vote just as that man told you to.

127
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:23,575
Your first election was a scam.

128
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:28,000
But the world will never know
anything, will it?

129
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:34,304
Except that Hiroshi Maruyama's brother
went to jail for assaulting a hostess.

130
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,318
[child, in English] Wait for me.

131
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,030
-[child 2] Hey!
-[child 3] Loser.

132
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,365
[child 1] No. No.

133
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,791
[speaking indistinctly]

134
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
Hey, do you have business with that guy?

135
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,222
-Uh, yeah, we're just--
-Oh, okay.

136
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,143
[child 1, child 2] Hey.

137
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,688
[child 3] Three, two, one.

138
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:02,026
-[children exclaiming]
-[Murata] Shut up!

139
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,865
[children jeering, chattering]

140
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,411
-Run. Run, run.
-[laughing]

141
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,248
Trust me.

142
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,679
[Murata] You guys better leave me alone or
I'm gonna go out there and kick your ass!

143
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,473
[gasps]

144
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,394
-Hey.
-Sarah?

145
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,231
-Can we talk?
-[sighs]

146
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,485
Who is that?

147
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,826
[Sarah] This is Ryu Ogami.

148
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,663
-[scoffs]
-Oh, Max. Come on.

149
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,544
[Murata] You brought an Ogami
to my office?

150
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,005
[Sarah] He's a friend.

151
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,512
-Max, please. This is important.
-[Murata sighs]

152
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:38,766
This is so fucked up.

153
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,816
You both are fucked up.
I mean, we're all fucked up.

154
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:46,197
-That's right.
-Show me more a bit more excitement?

155
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,959
[Murata] Mmm. Mmm!

156
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,299
[grunts] You guys are something.

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,094
It's not gonna end well for you.

158
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:01,019
Double homicide.
Double suicide for you two. You know?

159
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:05,194
I'm just joking, but, you know,
just you guys dating says something.

160
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,156
Does your dad know?

161
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:08,743
Yeah.

162
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:10,287
[Murata] Wow.

163
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,751
-And you guys are still dating?
-Okay.

164
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,632
-And you're still alive? [laughs]
-[Sarah] Not important.

165
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:20,057
You guys are dating.
Okay, well, you should have some.

166
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:21,811
All yours.

167
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,902
These are the best burgers
since Georgetown.

168
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,614
So you went to Georgetown?

169
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,787
Yeah, why? What else do you know about me?

170
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,375
Okay, calm down.
We all have the same goal.

171
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,672
Bring down the government?

172
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:38,845
No. To get to the truth.

173
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:41,266
[Murata] Hmm.

174
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,107
Okay.

175
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:46,902
What do you wanna know?

176
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:49,323
Manabu Takeuchi.

177
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:53,081
All I know about that Manabu--
That thing stunk so bad.

178
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,799
It was like all the fish of Tsukiji's fish
going bad all at once.

179
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:02,726
Then the guy arrested gets whacked?

180
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:06,316
What, he committed suicide?
That's bullshit, man.

181
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:08,654
That guy got whacked.

182
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:10,240
You have evidence?

183
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:12,954
Evidence? Did you just get off the plane?

184
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,877
You're in Japan.
There is no evidence here.

185
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,423
Ninety-nine percent conviction rate.

186
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:21,220
They don't even present evidence in court.

187
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:22,849
All they get is confessions.

188
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,228
Hey, we think you did it.

189
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:29,195
Now, put your John Hancock here,
and everything is solved.

190
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,871
Everyone, everyone, everyone
gets to save time and money,

191
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,585
crime rates are low,
everybody looks the other way,

192
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,380
and life goes on.

193
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,635
Okay, can we go back to Manabu?

194
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,768
What do you know about Five Winds?

195
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,398
[Murata] What's that?
Should I know something?

196
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,989
Five Winds is a company that was
registered under Manabu Takeuchi.

197
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:52,074
[Murata] Yeah, so?

198
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,913
Doesn't exist.

199
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,332
We went to the offices.

200
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,921
There was nothing there, didn't exist.
Just a sign on the front door.

201
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,007
Nothing else.

202
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:05,183
And my NPO has been sending money to Five
Winds, a company that doesn't even exist.

203
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:10,027
Oh, so Manabu and Takeuchi set up
a company, and there's no company.

204
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:15,747
And a governmental NPO sends money
to a nonexistent company.

205
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,001
And then Manabu gets killed
in a bar fight,

206
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,755
and the murder suspect commits suicide.

207
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:23,637
So, someone had Manabu killed,
and to cover it up,

208
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,309
someone had the suspect killed.

209
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,814
But there's no way somebody's gonna
get killed in a bar fight.

210
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:31,402
Or commit suicide in fucking prison.

211
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:33,824
You think it's something
to do with the drugs?

212
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:36,789
Rumor was Manabu was
involved with a drug trade.

213
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,918
Drugs? Manabu?

214
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,007
I mean he partied hard and, generally,
he was an asshole,

215
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,594
but he stayed away from drugs.

216
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:46,224
No, no, no. Manabu? No way.

217
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:48,144
[inhales deeply]

218
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:50,775
So, Manabu didn't do drugs?

219
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,444
[Murata] No, he didn't.

220
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:58,206
There are rumors that they swept
Manabu's drug use under the rug…

221
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,212
[inhales sharply]
…to protect Takeuchi's reputation.

222
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:05,638
Who's they? Takeuchi and your father?

223
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:11,984
So, Takeuchi asked your father to fix
Manabu's drug issues.

224
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:14,739
And Manabu doesn't even do drugs.

225
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,875
Holy shit.

226
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:21,587
[Sarah] What?

227
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,736
Takeuchi had his son whacked.

228
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,998
He had his own fucking son whacked.

229
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:48,097
Manabu was gonna blow the whistle
on the Five Winds slush fund.

230
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:51,897
Takeuchi whacked him.

231
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,070
In order to cover it up,

232
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:58,451
he killed some poor bystander.

233
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,336
And your father

234
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,175
helped him get away with it all.

235
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,603
Mmm… [chewing] …these are really good.

236
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:13,231
You guys sure you don't want any?

237
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,463
[person, in Japanese] Did you read
the e-mail I sent the other day?

238
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:28,512
[person 2] Yes, well…

239
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:36,903
Hello.

240
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,291
This is Mr. Nakagawa.

241
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:47,341
He's the head of the investment strategy
department that manages prop trading.

242
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,094
Nice to meet you.

243
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:52,602
Nice to meet you. I'm Yumiko Kageyama.

244
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:56,735
You were working here
until you got married?

245
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:59,783
Yes, that was ten years ago.

246
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:03,081
As I've reported, she was
a very talented colleague.

247
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,757
I've had a hard time hiring
new, young employees who can work hard.

248
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,385
Especially women.

249
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:10,930
Is that so?

250
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,940
My department needs to
aggressively hire more women.

251
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,739
After all, it is a part
of the company's strategy.

252
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,706
It's part of the CEO's
business reformation plan.

253
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,429
I was told this company made approximately
1.2 billion yen in profits last year.

254
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:38,777
Prop trading usually makes up
ten to 15% of a company's profits.

255
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,407
Therefore, this team was responsible

256
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:47,127
for making profits of
120 to 180 million yen a year.

257
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,885
Mr. Nakagawa, I will be frank.

258
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,724
Your team does not have
a top-class trader.

259
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:58,357
Your investment strategy is too
conservative and shows little experience.

260
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:03,911
What would someone who hasn't been
in the business for ten years know?

261
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,502
My husband works in finance.

262
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:11,676
Was there anything wrong with what I said?

263
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:15,391
What are you trying to say?

264
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,111
If you hire me,

265
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:25,245
I will do everything in my power to
increase your department's profits.

266
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:30,506
Saying and doing are two different things.

267
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:36,016
I'm sure Mr. Nakamura has told you
of my track record when I worked here.

268
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,062
Yes.

269
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,072
Past achievements do not guarantee
future success.

270
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:47,707
Isn't that what you
always tell your clients?

271
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,213
But when it comes to actually making
those transactions,

272
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,342
in what do we place our trust?

273
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,473
If you don't learn from your past,

274
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,354
it is impossible to achieve
any future success.

275
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:07,203
[chuckles]

276
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:11,170
All right. Let's work together.

277
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,512
As they say, bearing children is
easier than worrying.

278
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,265
[chuckles]

279
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,190
Giving birth is much more difficult
than making money.

280
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:26,283
Thanks to that, I've learned a lot
while taking care of my family.

281
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,331
[Ichiro] What a wonderful restaurant.

282
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,168
It's all going smoothly.

283
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:34,842
That is good. It's truly an honor
to be a part of this.

284
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:38,015
All that's left is to do my best.

285
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,313
[Taka] So everything is done.

286
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:45,698
City planning, food hygiene,
you've met all the regulations.

287
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,702
Are your employment policies in order?

288
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:53,045
Of course. You will be able
to quickly recover your investment.

289
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,214
Yes.

290
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:57,262
Because I only choose winning investments.

291
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:58,724
[both laugh]

292
00:20:58,807 --> 00:20:59,809
[Ichiro] Thank you.

293
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,799

298
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,824
You think this is a joke?
Quit screwing around, Maruyama!

299
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,076
[detective] Hey! You bastard!

300
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,871
-Take him away!
-[exclaims]

301
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:54,084

[Kaori] You like my body?

307
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:48,777
Of course.

308
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,075
It's so beautiful.

309
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,204
[chuckles] Right?

310
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,134
Did this tattoo hurt?

311
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:04,474
[Kaori] Very.

312
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:07,773
But it was worth it.

313
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,618
Why a peacock?

314
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:17,960
Because I'm not your average woman.

315
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,801
-[Kageyama] That's true.
-[laughs]

316
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:26,059
Isn't it amazing?

317
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,523
The peacock is a symbol

318
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,573
of hope, pride and respect.

319
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:37,750
Males use their beautiful feathers
to woo females.

320
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,883
That's how it should be.

321
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,682
I also

322
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,815
like beautiful men.

323
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,152

HIDE

329
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,431
You're calling me this late at night?

330
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,811
This is important.

331
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,358
So, how did it go?

332
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:18,655
Good.

333
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,535
<i>You got it, right? The password.</i>

334
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:24,833
-Yeah.
-[laughing] Yes!

335
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,171
Great! That's great!

336
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,010
1.5 billion is in our hands. [laughs]

337
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,933
<i>You're truly amazing, Masahiro.</i>

<i>What? Did something happen?</i>

340
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,453
No, everything's fine.

341
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,501
You got the pictures, right?
Can you send them to me?

342
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,338
I'll check it with the public code.

343
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:52,471
Can we meet in person?
Let's input the code together.

344
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:54,977
Of course.

345
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,939
Let's meet up tomorrow to do it.

346
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,705
[chuckles, exclaims]

347
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,430
[sighs]

348
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,645
-Excuse me. Another round.
-[bartender] Coming right up.

349
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,618
I can't see you anymore.

350
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,001
I really like you as a friend.

351
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:32,092
But I've found someone I'm serious about.

352
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:35,808
That's fine.

353
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,775
Is it that guy we ran into?

354
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,570
That weak sissy?

355
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:44,283
Yes, it is.

356
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,580
But he's a good person.

357
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:50,087
He's working hard to succeed
with his own strengths.

358
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:53,886
I got it. [sighs]

359
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,307
But I'll still see you at the club?

360
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,438
I'm going to quit.

361
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,319
Because he asked me to.

362
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:08,874
Then this is the last time
we'll see each other like this?

363
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,505
Yes.

364
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:15,345
[sighs, chuckles]

365
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,660
-[Shigeo] Thank you.
-[Nami] You don't have to see me off.

366
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,795
-[Shigeo] Keep the change.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

367
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:35,010
I want to do this.

368
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,097
I live here together with him.

369
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,435
-I don't care!
-Go home.

370
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:45,447
Hold on. You know I love you, right?

371
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,493
-You know that, right?
-[Nami] Please. Please.

372
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:49,205
-I beg you.
-Leave.

373
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,958
-You bastard!

[Ichiro] I'll never give Nami to you!
You bastard!

376
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,072
[Shigeo] You--

381

What's wrong with you two?

382
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,897
Sorry… [pants] … for making a scene.

383
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,024
[coughs]

384
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:25,110
But I…

385
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,909
need to do this

386
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,044
-for my honor.
-[passerby] That's enough. Get up.

[grunts]

388
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:39,096
Nami.

389
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,898
I will definitely…

390
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,947
become a father my son can respect.

391
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,582
And I want to be a man…

392
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,301
who is also respected by my son's mother.

393
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:02,644
-Don't do this here.
-I mean it!

394
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:06,610
I love you.

395
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:18,174
Will you

396
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,264
marry me?

397
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,470
Thanks for waiting.

398
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,561
[Kageyama sighs]

399
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:49,571
Shall we start?

400
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:51,240
[grunts]

401
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,487
The passcode?

402
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,569
Okay?

403
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,705
I'm going to click it.

404
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,836
For our future.

405
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,406
Did you lie to me?

406
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,201
What? No.

407
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,414
I don't know what happened either.

408
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,001
Damn it.

409
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,921
What the hell is this? Tell me!

410
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,592
-Hold on.

[Kaori] Oh, you're awake?

[TV continues in background]

422
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:48,892
I'm sorry for doing this to you.

423
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:54,027
-[grunts]
-But you know why I had to.

424
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:56,825
[panting] What is this?

425
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:01,250
Since you tried to take my money.

426
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,089
Why are you here?

427
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:07,597
Even though I told them to go easy on you.

428
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:10,393
Who were those guys?

429
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,523
Where's Hide?

430
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,028
-[Kaori laughing]
-Huh?

431
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:19,954
You never thought a woman like me

432
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:22,585
would be friends with thugs like them?

433
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:29,389
Hide is that salaryman trash of a guy?

434
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:33,523
They'll probably take care of him
on their own.

435
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,169
Did you think you were the first
to come after my crypto account?

436
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:46,340
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:48,427
It's my fault. I was wrong.

438
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,933
But I didn't take your money.

439
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:53,855
I'm telling the truth. There was no money.

440
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:57,070
Attempted robbery and robbery are
the same thing.

441
00:33:57,153 --> 00:33:58,155
You know that, right?

442
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,784
What should I do?

443
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:02,080
It's simple.

444
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,255
You were someone
I couldn't get my hands on.

445
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,597
And you really loved your wife and kids.

446
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,150
You would never leave
your family for me. Right?

447
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:20,158
But not anymore.

448
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,707
We are accomplices.

449
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,049
You tried to rob me.

450
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,267
So I'll rob you too.

451
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:35,898
What are you saying?

452
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:38,444
What I want…

453
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,454
is your heart.

454
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,544
[chuckles]

455
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:06,125
Where are we?

456
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,503
I'm sorry.

457
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,425
I was told to bring you here.

458
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,303
What the hell?

459
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,117
[grunts] I'm getting out. Open the door.

460
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,509
We've been waiting. This way.

461
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:42,740
Do you plan to vote
for Secretary-General Takeuchi?

462
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,708
[Maruyama] No one will vote for him.

463
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,629
Not even himself.

464
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:52,217
What do you mean?

465
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,441
You're not the only one

466
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:03,865
pulling the strings.

467

-[ice rattles]
-[breathes deeply]

468
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,633
Saijo?

469
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,929
He's just a coward.

470
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,687
And Takeuchi? He's more scared than Saijo.

471
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:21,108
So what about me?

472
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,447
I'm the weakest of us three.

473
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,923
There is a man.

474
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:34,719
He wants

475
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:37,516
to see you

476
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:39,979
at your hideout.

477
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:43,778
Where you keep your owls.

478
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:48,120
At your villa filled with secrets.

479
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:54,424
You'll probably learn the truth there.

480
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,349
The fixer is

481
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,436
always

482
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,150
looking to make things right.

483
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:11,208
Masahiro hasn't come home.

484
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:16,259
He's not answering his phone,
or responding to my texts.

485
00:37:18,097 --> 00:37:19,642
I'm so worried.

486
00:37:21,604 --> 00:37:23,775
Should I call the police?

487
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,323
Let's leave that as a last resort.

488
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:33,001
But I'm uncomfortable
with asking Father for help.

489
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,507
Why?

490
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,137
He's more trustworthy than the police.

491
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,811
[sighs]

492
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:43,982
What should I do?

493
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,821
[sighs]

494
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,286
Let's wait.

495
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:53,752
Won't we be able
to learn something if we wait?

496
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:03,688

[Ken] Risako. The response is amazing.

498
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,537
Congratulations.

499
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:13,081
Thank you.

500
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,506
I'm sorry I didn't sing "Aurora."

501
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,553
Forget it.
I'll release it at a better time.

502
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,229
Do you have plans after this?
Want to have lunch with me?

503
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,734
I have plans with my mother.

504
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:30,157
But you need to eat. I know a good place.

505
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,996
Sorry, I have to go.

506
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:35,669
Okay.

507
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:40,595
-Look at the numbers go up.
-Refresh it. Look, it went up.

508
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,056
Bye. Thank you, everyone.

509
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,475
Good job today. Bye.

510
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:04,309
[Mashima] How was your talk
with Mr. Maruyama?

511
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:10,530
There were a few surprises, but
otherwise, there were no problems.

512
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:18,504
Actually, he called me
to ask if he can see you one more time.

513
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,510
Did he?

514
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:23,765
Shall I go?

515
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:25,017
Yeah.

516
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,650
Find out what he really wants.

517
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:32,741
I'll be at the villa.

518
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,860
[Taka] The owl is dead.

519
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:26,927
The fixer is always looking
to make things right.

520
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:30,810
That is why I gave you a problem to fix.

521
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:33,190
Who are you?

522
00:41:36,947 --> 00:41:38,450
Your child.

523
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,501
A child you created.

524
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,888
A miserable child who swore to get revenge

525
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:51,184
for your terrible sins.

526
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:52,687
What are you saying?

527
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,359
Who exactly are you?

528
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,533
Does a man like you, who knows everything,

529
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,830
also know what it feels like
to abhor one's own father?

530
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:05,713
My father

531
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,844
abused my sister and I.

532
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:11,266
But one day,

533
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:14,773
he miraculously disappeared.

534
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:17,696
He died after getting involved
in a scandal.

535
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:22,329
The world believed he committed suicide,

536
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:25,002
but even I, young as I was,
knew it wasn't a suicide.

537
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,843
My father would never
choose to take his own life.

538
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,224
He was killed.

539
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:37,819
And I learned this later,

540
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,242
but the man who had him killed…

541
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:47,881
was called the Owl.

542
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:55,813
The Owl has no weaknesses!

543
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:57,650
He knew everything!

544
00:42:57,734 --> 00:43:00,447
Including all the different methods
of getting what he wants.

545
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:04,497
Is that why you swore to get

546
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,794
-your revenge on me?
-[Taka chuckles]

547
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:12,514
Life is a complicated thing. More so
than something as simple as revenge.

548
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:17,690
I was really happy when my dad died.

549
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,871
But my father was still my father.

550
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:27,334
[inhales sharply] He was my family,

551
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:32,302
so why was the one who killed him…
[shouting] …beyond reproach?

552
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:34,766
[laughs]

553
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,812
That's what I couldn't forgive.

554
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:39,734
Then I discovered

555
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,913
that all-powerful Owl's
one, single weakness.

556
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,299
I've bugged the phones
of everyone in your family.

557
00:43:51,382 --> 00:43:53,888
And by peeking into
all of their online activities,

558
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:57,102
I was able to learn more
about your family than you ever could.

559
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:00,400
Like what they wanted and when.

560
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,667
Your family told me everything
I wanted to know.

561
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:15,848
But you still stubbornly stuck
to your old ways of gathering information,

562
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:19,146
believing no one would dare lie to you.

563
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:22,737
Are you going

564
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:26,285
to kill me here?

565
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,381
I never thought of killing you.

566
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:36,974
I wanted to be you. I looked up to you!

567
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:39,771
I only wanted to try

568
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:42,401
manipulating your family.

569
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,202
So,

570
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:51,545
I found the only method
to make my dreams come true.

571
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:55,886
You'll commit suicide,

572
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,393
and I will become you.

573
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:02,984
[assailant grunts]

574
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:06,157
[grunts]

575
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:10,290
[exclaims]

576
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,960
[choking]

577
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:32,417
This is your will.

578
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,344
At the bottom of the hearts
of the Japanese

579
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:43,106
lies a deep connection
with patriotism and the artistic beauty

580
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:45,569
of taking one's own life.

581
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:49,034
I have dedicated my all

582
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:54,546
to my family, my country, and my soul.

583
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,885
My greatest desire

584
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:02,937
will be fulfilled if this world becomes

585
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:05,735
a better place with my death.

586
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,144
Doesn't it sound familiar?

587
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,168
You know, don't you?

588
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:42,600
It is the exact same thing
you wrote when my father

589
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:45,230
left this world.

590
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:59,174
[breathes deeply]

591
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,170
