This area is a business zone--

Sarah was asking you about my dad?

Yeah, I mean,
that's why it freaked me out, you know?

I mean, you guys are now dating, right?
It's crazy shit. It's insane.

101

The girl you're dating is trying
to dig up a story on your dad.

What do you mean digging up
a story on him?

103
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,720
When she reached out to me, she asked
a bunch of questions about you too.

104
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:52,100
So I thought she was
investigating you as well.

105
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:53,978
When was this?

106
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,358
I don't know. A few months ago.

107
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:00,199
I mean, she was asking me
how she can meet you and shit.

How to meet me? That doesn't seem right.

Yeah, so I said no,
why don't you just bump into the guy?

00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:07,589
I thought that was kind of funny,
you know?

Nothing special.

She said it's fine as long as
she can become your mistress.

She will give you a call when

You will go back to your family

00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:27,697
I confirmed your purchase contract
when I invested into your restaurant.

166
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:31,622
It was written that any zoning changes
are your responsibility.

167
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:32,749
[sighs]

168
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,045
It's my responsibility?

169
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:39,638
The recent zoning changes
were clearly written right here.

170
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:44,063
It needs to be rezoned
back to a business zone.

171
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,739
I don't have the time to
push back the opening date!

172
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:50,743
Oh, my.

173
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,081
Isn't there something I can do?

174
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,335
That's right.

175
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,091
Doesn't your father have
that kind of power?

176
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,597
How about going to him for help?

177
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,724
No.

178
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,563
I won't borrow his power.

179
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,484
But you need to do something!

180
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:10,073
You have loans to repay!

181
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:14,498
I hope you won't default on your loan.

182
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:16,670
No.

183
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:18,591
That will never happen.

184
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,720
It's written in the contract

185
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:27,525
that your assets can be seized
if you default on your loan.

186
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,863
You won't be able to avoid this!

187
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,294
What the hell.

188
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,340
[Taka] What?

189
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:43,808
You didn't have your lawyer look it over?

190
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,018
[elevator dings]

191
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:49,026
Can't we do something?

192
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,875
I will help you.

193
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,430
My sister is here.

194
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,352
She is my business partner.

195
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:07,772
Let me introduce you.

196
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,699
Nami?

197
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:16,582
Oh, why are my brother
and fiancé here together?

198
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,295
Brother?

199
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:22,844
Yes. Didn't I introduce him to you
when you were looking for a loan?

200
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,059
He's your brother?

201
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,190
Yes, he is. Didn't I tell you?

202
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:34,366
You'll get more and more confused
when exciting things occur all at once.

203
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:39,376
It seems Ichiro is having a few problems.

204
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,386
But don't worry.
Since we will soon be a family.

205
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,515
Nami.

206
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:49,480
You never told me. Right?

207
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:51,819
Would anything change if I did?

208
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,283
I don't know.

209
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,956
Actually, it wouldn't.

210
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,920
This is now a family problem.

211
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:04,468
Ichiro, let's solve this together.

212
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:11,775
Of course.

213
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,751
[waiter] Enjoy your drinks.

214
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,383
[in English] Okay, so I did
some more digging on Manabu

215
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,012
and I think there's
more to it than we know.

216
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,097
But Max was right.

217
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:30,145
His dad set up a company
and was funneling millions into it.

218
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,525
It was a huge Takeuchi slush fund.

219
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,905
I want you to stop your investigation.

220
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:38,244
What do you mean stop?

221
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,958
-This is huge.
-Please.

222
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,298
It could expose the corruption, bring
down the government, it's what we wanted.

223
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:45,718
Just stop.

224
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,933
What's wrong with you?

225
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,487
Do you know something
you're not telling me?

226
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,207
Do you want me to believe
that everything just happened by chance?

227
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,629
What are you talking about?

228
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:06,300
You bumping into me at the park.
That was an accident?

229
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:09,849
I mean, I…

230
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:14,651
No.

231
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,072
You're interested in my family.

232
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:19,953
Everything just fell into your lap,
how convenient.

233
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,169
You were going to get your story one way
or another using the son of the <i>kuromaku</i>.

234
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,380
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,177
-But that's not--
-Not what?

236
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,729
I didn't mean to hurt you, or your family.

237
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,442
But you lied to me.

238
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,374
What's between you and me is not a lie.

239
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,380
Yes, I'll admit.

240
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,677
I wanted to meet you
at first to write a story.

241
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,432
And yes,
I set up that encounter in the park,

242
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:54,396
but everything after that was
real and honest.

243
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,691
Honest?

244
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,196
How can a relationship begin with a lie?

245
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,490
[sighs]

246
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:00,785
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:06,505
I wanted to tell you,
I just didn't know how or when.

248
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,884
This is not your country, Sarah.

249
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,850
I told you Japan can be a dangerous place.

250
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,648
You're in over your head.

251
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,196
I suggest you go.

252
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,496
What do you mean, "go"?

253
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,293
I mean stop the investigation.
Go back to America.

254
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:28,549
I'm not going to be there
when someone comes after you.

255
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:32,139
Okay.

256
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,107
And us?

257
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:41,198
There is no "us."

258
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:18,481
[phone vibrates]

259
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:20,945
[in Japanese] Hello?

260
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:24,117
[Kyoko] <i>Yumiko? Your father…</i>

261
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:27,123
What?

<i>…was found</i>

00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,048
<i>dead.</i>

What do you mean?

<i>Just please come over as soon as possible.</i>

00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:46,245
[Masahiro] What happened?

268
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:49,418
She said my father…

269
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:53,217
is dead.

270
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:08,957
Suicide?

271
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,963
He would never do that.

272
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:13,675
Yes.

273
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:18,059
But there are more than
a few people who hated your father.

274
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,146
The will?

275
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,400
Probably a fake written by someone.

276
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,198
And the police?

277
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,287
[Kyoko] They won't be of any help.

278
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,375
[Risako] I can't believe this.

279
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,180
[Ryu] Who found him?

280
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:40,979
[Kyoko] Kenichi.

281
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:49,413
What was he doing

282
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,419
when Father was

283
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,968
killed?

284
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:00,519
When did he find the body?

285
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,357
Two days after he died.

286
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,286
Normally, that would be suspicious.

287
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,252
Didn't Father tell you anything?

288
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:19,347
Of course Kenichi and I
were worried about him.

289
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,063
[knocks]

290
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,036
Madam, Mr. Mashima has arrived.

291
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:32,625
Let him in.

292
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,352
And the current situation is?

293
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:47,237
An autopsy is being conducted
to determine the cause of death.

294
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,449
We know how he died.

295
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:52,790
I thought it was best to be sure.

296
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,961
To be sure.

297
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,514
Why didn't you come here first?

298
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:04,104
I determined the autopsy
took first priority.

299
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:08,613
Why did you go to the villa?

300
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:12,453
I was worried
because Mr. Ogami never contacted me.

301
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:14,499
How did you know where he was?

302
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,003
Instinct.

303
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,592
Then who did you first call
when you found his body?

304
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,512
The Madam. Immediately.

305
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,516
-That was yesterday?
-Yes, that's correct.

306
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:24,645
Ryu.

307
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,612
I will do what you ask of me.

308
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:32,368
Please. Thank you.

309
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:39,508
[Tanaka] There's a rumor
that Ryutaro Ogami is dead.

310
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,222
What?

311
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,975
That's impossible.

312
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:48,735
Rumor has it,
his body was found hanging in his villa.

313
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,580
He would never hang himself.

314
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,085
Someone must have set him up.

315
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,507
One of his own people?

316
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,053
One of his own?

317
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,566
Or it could be Takeuchi.

318
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:14,327
Weren't Takeuchi and Ogami
working together?

319
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:19,797
Ogami was going to make
Takeuchi the next prime minister.

320
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:21,926
Yeah.

321
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,389
That's why no one would suspect him.

322
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,692
In that case,

323
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:32,656
the one who could be

324
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,121
under suspicion would be…

325
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,712
you, Ogami's enemy.

326
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:49,648
Have a drink.

327
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,036
Who was behind it?

328
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:57,831
What do you know?

329
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,252
There are no clues.

330
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,720
Everyone's in shock and aren't speaking.

331
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:08,435
Will our family be in danger?

332
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,314
I hope not.

333
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,657
I don't know why

334
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:17,078
this happened.

335
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,167
Most likely for power.

336
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,681
You should be careful.

337
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:32,651
The killer might go after you next.

338
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:36,659
I am already a dead man.

339
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:40,082
A dead man cannot be killed.

340
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:43,756
I will definitely

341
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:46,971
avenge his death.

342
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,935
That is why you're the one
in the greatest danger.

343
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,495
This is not the end.

344
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,376
This is only

345
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,548
the beginning.

346
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:11,646
[sighs]

347
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:16,154
This isn't politics, but war.

348
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:20,830
Have you heard anything?

349
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,628
No, not a thing.

350
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,385
Was it Saijo?

351
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:33,313
Saijo, Maruyama.

352
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,698
And even you were rumored
to be the killer.

353
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,704
[sighs]

354
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,464
There are too many groundless rumors.

355
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:48,761
We need to uncover

356
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,057
the truth.

357
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,484
We will probably never find the truth
without Mr. Ogami.

358
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,615
We don't know that yet.

359
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:04,752
Saijo has stepped over the line.

360
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,758
[Takeuchi] There should have been

361
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:11,139
a way to take Saijo down.

362
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:14,062
It may take time,

363
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,364
but it was possible with his power
and influence.

364
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,040
But it's all too late now.

365
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:28,925
What an ending this is.

366
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,141
There's nothing you can do now.

367
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,402
Didn't you also know Mr. Ogami
for many years?

368
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:40,239
[sighs]

369
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,838
To think there is someone
who would do such a horrible thing.

370
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:56,438
I will take my leave now.

371
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,629
In just four days…

372
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,432
the no-confidence vote, Mr. Ogami…

373
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:20,987
Like a vulture, the enemy strikes
in an instant, doesn't it?

374
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:23,951
[Takeuchi] No matter who,

375
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:28,878
a person's true purpose will be revealed
when the time comes.

376
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:43,574
[door closes]

377
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:45,537
[sighs]

378
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:03,531
[Ryu] You were the one who
found my father's body.

379
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,535
Yes.

380
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:08,206
Do you think he really did it?

381
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,837
Commit suicide?

382
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:12,841
No.

383
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,180
I will definitely…

384
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:20,022
make them pay for this sin.

385
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,028
Be careful.

386
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,914
There were many who lent
their strengths to your father.

387
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,922
But since he is now dead,

388
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:35,511
most of his allies have
turned into enemies.

389
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:39,519
What about Father's closest ally?

390
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:46,992
I can only tell you
to believe what you see.

391
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,627
I have always been loyal to your father.

392
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:55,050
And I will continue to be.

393
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:59,016
Whether he is alive or not.

394
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,155
You are not family.

395
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:10,288
And you will never be family.

396
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:22,647
You didn't know anything about me

397
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:26,070
or your father. Am I right?

398
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,215
[door closes]

399
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,727
What are you saying?

400
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:44,733
[Ryu] There is no doubt
this is about politics.

401
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,452
But it could only be done with the help
of someone close to him.

402
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:52,080
So what?

403
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,546
Kenichi found Father's body.

404
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:58,636
Two days after he disappeared.

405
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,019
All of his actions are suspicious.

406
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:04,898
Kenichi

407
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:08,656
was more loyal to your father
than anyone else.

408
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:13,039
He would never do something like this.

409
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,252
Even loyalty

410
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,007
has its limits.

411
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:23,351
[Takeuchi] Have you gotten
your faction behind you?

412
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:24,563
[Maruyama] Yes.

413
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:28,319
They will vote for you, Mr. Takeuchi.

414
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:34,415
And that thing Mr. Ogami found out about?

415
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,425
As promised,

416
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:42,849
it will be completely buried.

417
00:30:44,184 --> 00:30:45,270
[sighs]

418
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:48,736
What will happen to my brother?

419
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,075
I'll make arrangements
to have him released soon.

420
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:55,457
-That easily?
-[Takeuchi] Right.

421
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,252
And Saijo?

422
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,135
What about him?

423
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:04,559
What will you do about Saijo?

424
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,322
He is already

425
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,621
out of my sight.

426
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,421
Who are you bastards?

427
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,808
Who the fuck are you?

428
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:28,816
I wanted to tell you a story.

429
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:32,072
[Saijo] Do you think
you'll get away with this?

430
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,951
Do you know who I am?

431
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:37,207
Yes, of course I do.

432
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,796
Former Minister of Finance, Sosuke Saijo.

433
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,217
You bought votes
using Masashi Maruyama's company.

434
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,641
And embezzled billions of public funds.

435
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,606
You've achieved both fortune and power.

436
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,818
What are you talking about? I don't know--

437
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:16,077
Before the truth came out,
you unfortunately chose to end your life.

438
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,791
That is the official story.

439
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:24,761
You will be the one who killed the Owl,
Ryutaro Ogami.

440
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,854
You started the war.

441
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:33,194
Mr. Ogami's allies
will never leave you alone.

442
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,699
Three days after you killed
Mr. Ogami by hanging him,

443
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,831
you jumped off a building
leaving behind a letter.

444
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,668
This will cleanly end it all,

445
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,966
leaving behind two murders
no one will investigate.

446
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,139
That is the unofficial story.

447
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:49,351
[panting]

448
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:53,025
So what will the citizens be told?

449
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:56,616
Two men took their own lives,

450
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,624
protecting everyone
from shame and dishonor.

451
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:03,922
Move! [grunts]

452
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,511
Stop! You won't get away with this!

453
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:07,638
Stop!

454
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,932
DEATH OF MINISTER SAIJO

455
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:14,151
<i>One of the candidates for prime minister,
Minister of Finance Sosuke Saijo</i>

456
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:17,867
<i>of the Liberal Frontier Party, was found
dead after falling from his hotel.</i>

457
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,290
<i>The police are investigating
his death as a suicide.</i>

458
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,754
<i>The sudden death of Minister Saijo</i>

459
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,760
<i>has thrown the LFP's race for
the next prime minister into turmoil…</i>

460
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:30,475
[in English] First the Owl's found dead,
now Saijo?

461
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:33,523
This is some fucking crazy shit.

462
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,072
What the hell is going on?

463
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:41,247
It's Takeuchi.

464
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,417
It has to be.

465
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:46,758
He found a new <i>kuromaku</i>.

466
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:52,018
Or more accurately,
another <i>kuromaku</i> has found Takeuchi.

467
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:54,147
Is Ryu in danger?

468
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:57,279
That whole family's fucking in danger.

469
00:33:57,362 --> 00:34:00,995
<i>…the political world was
shocked by his death.</i>

470
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:02,122
Shit.

471
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:12,643
[in Japanese] Madam,
I must tell you something.

472
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:13,729
What is it?

473
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:18,697
I had said I didn't drive
Mr. Ogami to the villa.

474
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,408
Yes.

475
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:22,747
The truth is,

476
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,506
I don't remember anything
about the day he died.

477
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,677
When I woke up, I was in Mr. Ogami's bar.

478
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:33,309
I think I took him to the villa but…

479
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:35,313
You don't remember if you actually did?

480
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:37,025
I am very sorry.

481
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,321
I can't remember clearly.

482
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,285
Have you told this to anyone?

483
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,580
Yes.

484
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,628
Kenichi was there when I woke up.

485
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:49,884
Kenichi?

486
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,011
Yes.

487
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,321
[in English] Hey.

488
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:04,454
-So sorry for your loss, Ryu.
-Save your condolences.

489
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,210
I never wanted to harm you
or your family. Please believe me.

490
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:08,713
I thought you were leaving Japan.

491
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,260
Just hear me out and I'll leave you alone.

492
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,729
It was Takeuchi and a new <i>kuromaku</i>.

493
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:20,612
He killed your dad, he killed Saijo.
Made it look like suicides to cover it up.

494
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,744
Now you have your story.

495
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:24,912
No.

496
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,169
I'm telling you this because I think
you and your family are in danger.

497
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,135
The Ogamis have been around
since the founding of Japan,

498
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:33,722
we can take care of ourselves.

499
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,061
I care about you.

500
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,363
You should take care of yourself.

501
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:46,623
Ryu.

502
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,605
Please hold it carefully from the bottom.

503
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,905
Please take the photo.

504
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,348
My condolences for your loss.

505
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:18,102
Thank you.

506
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,237
Let's go.

507
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:30,501
OGAMI FAMILY

508
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,019
[Kyoko] Come in.

509
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:23,440
Is there anything you need from me?

510
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,361
[Kyoko] Yes.

511
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:32,208
Let's take a walk.

512
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:45,569
You were like one of the family.

513
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:50,746
You were probably even more like family
than our real family members.

514
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,585
Yes.

515
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:58,302
But I don't know what is happening.

516
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,099
Or who to trust.

517
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:03,813
I will definitely

518
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:07,403
uncover the truth of what happened.

519
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:11,453
[sighs]

520
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,794
Ryutaro was killed.

521
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,800
Saijo was also killed.

522
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:22,141
Everyone is saying it was for revenge,

523
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,901
but only one person could have done it.

524
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,078
You!

525
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,002
I swear.

526
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,175
It wasn't me.

527
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:42,975
I have told you all I know, Madam.

528
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:46,649
Then why did you lie?

529
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,740
You found his body.

530
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:54,623
You also met the driver
who took him to the villa.

531
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,209
Why did you tell the driver

532
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,048
not to say anything?

533
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:05,185
And then, his biggest enemy,
Saijo, has also died.

534
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,989
Can you say you weren't involved at all?

535
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:22,136
Why did you…

536
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,102
lie to me?

537
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:29,317
Tell me why you lied to our family.

538
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:32,950
Or else.

539
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:34,912
Tell me.

540
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:37,416
Tell me!

541
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,888
Because that is what Mr. Ogami ordered.

542
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,228
[Ogami] Kyoko.

543
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:16,119
I'm sorry for putting you
through such a difficult experience.

544
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,587
Will you listen to my story?

545
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:26,766
What?

546
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,357
Is it you?

547
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,284
Are you really

548
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:39,499
alive?

549
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:43,340
Yeah. I'm still alive.

550
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:51,481
<i>I was ambushed by some men at the villa.</i>

551
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:57,243
<i>They tried to kill me by hanging me.</i>

552
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,048
<i>When I thought</i>

553
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:08,473
<i>this was how it will all end,</i>

554
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:13,066
<i>my life flashed before my eyes.</i>

555
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,864
<i>My marriage.</i>

556
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:19,078
<i>The children's birth.</i>

557
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,001
<i>This country's growth.</i>

558
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:28,973
<i>My life should have ended
along with those memories.</i>

559
00:41:30,894 --> 00:41:32,354
-[grunts]
- <i>But…</i>

560
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,987
[strains]

561
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:59,660
<i>No matter how weak,
a connection is still a bond.</i>

562
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,420
<i>Those bonds will</i>

563
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,805
<i>be the strength of this family.</i>

564
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:14,606
If anyone knew I was alive,

565
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:17,696
my enemies would have come
to take everything away.

566
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:20,577
Including our family.

567
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,339
If you aren't dead yet…

568
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,686
then I can kill you myself.

569
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:37,192
Pretending I was dead

570
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:40,658
was the only way to find

571
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:45,668
the person pulling the strings.

572
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:49,467
All of this

573
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:52,056
was the work of Takeuchi

574
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,228
and Kawabata.

575
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:04,748
[cries] That's too…

576
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,587
Forgive me.

577
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:14,350
Is it really…

578
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:17,732
truly

579
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:19,986
you?

580
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,975
Let's get our revenge.

581
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,288
