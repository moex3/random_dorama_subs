00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,940
This production features
inappropriate dialogue and smoking scenes.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,475
<i>Hey! Wake up, ugly!</i>

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,909
<i>You female gorilla in heat!</i>

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,177
<i>I got it, okay?</i>

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,879
<i>You sleep too much for someone ugly!</i>

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,247
<i>Shut up, you stupid geezer.</i>

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,416
What did you say?! Say that again!

8
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,218
Shut up, stupid shorty!

9
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,819
Quit making a ruckus so early!

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,454
I've got low blood pressure!

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,423
Damn…

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,324
MASAHIKO KONDO

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:32,198
WINTER OF 1986

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,666
Hey…

15
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,169
Good morning!

16
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,572
You may be my daughter,
but your sleeping face is ugly.

17
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,408
Cut it out. You're wasting it!

18
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,643
Did you lose it? Junko Angry Pants!

19
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,211
Huh?

20
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,479
You were smoking again!

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,015
I splashed it with water
and put it out, okay?!

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,231
Old man, when are you coming home today?

23
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,132
Who?

24
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,100
You, baldy.

25
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,601
I dare you to say that again!

26
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,238
You, baldy, the short old man
with thinning hair who's stirring natto!

27
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,777
When someone dares you to repeat yourself,
you go and say the exact same thing!

28
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,380
You don't add extra stuff each time.

29
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,514
It's so hurtful.

30
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,850
Thinning hair? Where?

31
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,052
<i>The dedicated platforms
for the Saikyo Line,</i>

32
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,190
<i>constructed on the easternmost side,
will be the new Platforms 1 and 2.</i>

33
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,225
Time to eat.

34
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:39,532
<i>Starting March 3rd, the Saikyo Line
will be operating on this new platform…</i>

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,700
It's a guy, isn't it?

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,001
What?

37
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,104
Don't “what” me. It's glaringly obvious.

38
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,340
You're curling your hair.
It's like something from <i>Tsumiki Kuzushi</i>.

39
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,175
You want some hanky-panky with a guy, huh?

40
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,543
No way.

41
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,480
Listen.

42
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,416
Guys who are 16 or 17
are basically all apes.

43
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,518
Once they've had a taste, it's over.

44
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,787
They'll be chasing a female's ass
for the rest of their lives.

45
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,490
Just tell me. When are you coming home?

46
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,390
Five o'clock? Six?

47
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,558
None o'clock.

48
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,759
Lame.

49
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:10,864
Junko.

50
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,265
Say goodbye to your mom.

51
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,473
See you.

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,742
<i>You're so full of energy.
Shall we go somewhere?</i>

53
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,745
-<i>Then let's go see Grandpa.</i>
-Cash, please.

54
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,615
<i>You're such a good girl.</i>

55
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,117
<i>Honoring your ancestors is very important.</i>

56
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,087
<i>And don't forget to get ice cream.</i>

57
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,054
Here.

58
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,258
<i>She's sneaky, but a good girl.</i>

59
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,800
KATSUSHIKA WARD
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 6

60
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,003
Junko used to be so cute, though.

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,405
Seriously, she's like a nutcase.

62
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,608
Well, kids these days
are precocious, after all.

63
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,411
When I inspected their belongings,
look what I found.

64
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,248
Outrageous.

65
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,449
PORN PARADISE

66
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,350
Outrageous.

67
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,585
F*CK TO THE TEACHER

68
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,857
It's a cause for concern,
isn't it, Mr. Ogawa?

69
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,360
Well, Ms. Oversized Tits,
when was your first time?

70
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,429
It's Mai Takasugi!

71
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,264
That's good. That's a good one.

72
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,334
I'm hungry.

73
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,536
Me too. Let's go get something to eat.

74
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,871
I'm craving something sweet.

75
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,707
Well then,
how about we go to Baskin-Robbins?

76
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,675
I like that.

77
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,237
It's you, Mutchy!

78
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,806
Mutchy, that's me!

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,642
I was thinking, "Who's this cute chick?"
and it's you, Junko.

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,711
Did you buy yourself a motorcycle, Mutchy?

81
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,350
It's a CBX.
The one Matchy rode in <i>Highteen Boogie.</i>

82
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,518
Let me guess.

83
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,055
"I'll park by the beach and spend a moment
making serious love to you"?

84
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,391
-So cool!
-So cool!

85
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,759
Hey, take a photo.

86
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,893
Okay.

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,262
Yay.

88
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,264
Say cheese!

89
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,800
Hey, give me a ride, Mutchy!

90
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,168
Don't be stupid!

91
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,437
It's my policy
not to give rides to virgins.

92
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,046
Ugh, don't make fun of me!

93
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:41,748
Shortstop!

94
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,149
Shortstop!

95
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,820
Start!

96
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,723
What?

97
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,725
Stop it with your body, idiot!

98
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,761
If you focus, it won't hurt you, moron!

99
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,695
Yes, sir!

100
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,963
Your stance is too high!

101
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,598
Do bunny hops around the ground!

102
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,499
Yes, sir!

103
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,100
What?!

104
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,636
You, four-eyes!

105
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,671
Sir?

106
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,806
-No drinking water during practice.
-Yes, sir.

107
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,207
Drinking water wears you out.

108
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,208
Yes, sir.

109
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,511
You're all getting spanked
with a baseball bat!

110
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,180
Collective responsibility!

111
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,149
Thank you, sir!

112
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,817
Thank you, sir!

113
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,319
Thank you, sir!

114
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,853
Thank you, sir!

115
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,455
Thank you, sir!

116
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,828
TOEI BUS, SCHOOL-6-URA
BOUND FOR KODAI SEIMON-MAE

117
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,619
<i>The bus is departing. Please be careful.</i>

118
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,171
<i>The next stop is Bunri Yonchome.</i>

119
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>We are stopping at Hanemaki.</i>

120
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,884
<i>The bus is departing. Please be careful.</i>

121
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,192
Hey, miss.

122
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,165
Udon noodles.
Udon noodles are hanging from your ears.

123
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,585
<i>We are stopping at Bunri Yonchome.</i>

124
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,308
<i>The bus is departing. Please be careful.</i>

125
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,310
What? What is it?

126
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,346
You want me to open the window?

127
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,551
<i>The next stop is Shiga Icchome.</i>

128
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,253
What is it?

129
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,922
You people are way weirder than I am.

130
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,159
Udon noodles are hanging from your ears.

131
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,028
And you got seaweed
dangling from your ears.

132
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,763
Don't ignore me!

133
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,734
Secondhand smoking!

134
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,437
-What?
-Secondhand smoking!

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,438
Hey, mister!

136
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,439
Secondhand smoking?

137
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,242
Don't provoke him.
What if he's got a knife?

138
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,211
If I get sick from secondhand smoke,
it's going to be your fault.

139
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,014
-Secondhand smoke?
-Stop it. What if he stabs you?

140
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,150
You got a problem?
There's an ashtray here.

141
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,386
And there's no sign saying
no smoking anywhere.

142
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,356
Come on, this situation is weird.

143
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,157
You're the dangerous one.

144
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,861
Udon noodles are hanging from your ears,
and your panties are almost showing.

145
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,497
-It's like you're asking to be groped.
-What?!

146
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,798
You can't complain if that happens.

147
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,866
How outrageous!

148
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,735
That's sexual harassment! Unbelievable!

149
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,670
What? Did I say something wrong?

150
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,172
Run!

151
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,675
I'm getting off!

152
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,510
Huh? I'm getting off too.

153
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,611
I'm getting off!

154
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,314
Uh-huh.

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,082
Six o'clock, right?

156
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,751
I can totally make it. Yeah.

157
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,164
Very Berry Strawberry, hands down.

158
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,565
It's yummy, isn't it?

159
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,499
Let me have a bite.

160
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,070
Watch it!
Pay attention to where you're going!

161
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,905
Take your earplugs out.

162
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,175
Sorry.

163
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,943
Pay for her chocolate mint ice cream.

164
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,846
I don't have any cash with me right now.

165

Oh, damn! Junko's going
to have hanky-panky!

How much is a hi-lite?

Right. I don't think I do.

321
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:00,799
Say that again.

322

Her looks and figure.

00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,284
On erotic photo books
or in no-panties cafes!

330
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,653
Shut up, stupid shorty!
And you call yourself my dad?

331
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,788
Just wear your panties!

332
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:23,922
I already am!

333
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,424
Are you? Show me!

334
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,992
Like hell I'll show you, moron!

335
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:35,033
ESSAY
"YOUR FUTURE DREAM"

336
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,004
<i>Damn it. I still feel upset.</i>

337
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,308
<i>Even though she's at an age to be horny,
I can't let my guard down at all.</i>

338
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,714
<i>But what exactly happened the other day?</i>

339
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,515
<i>Was it a dream?</i>

340
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,502
<i>It must've been a dream.</i>

341
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,107
<i>After all, I'd hate a future like that.</i>

342
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,377
SMOKING RAISES THE RISK OF CANCER

343
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,645
<i>Wait.</i>

344
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:22,781
<i>It wasn't a dream.</i>

345
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,885
<i>I think I traveled to the future
on a route bus.</i>

346
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,090
Mr. Ogawa, thank you for supervising them.

347
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:32,991
No problem.

348
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,861
All right. Set your pencils down
and pay attention.

349
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,065
I'll be introducing a transfer student.

350
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,133
All right, come on in.

351
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,171
All right, quiet down.

352
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,209
Because of his mother's business,
he'll be in this class for a while.

353
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,979
Introduce yourself.

354
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,449
I'm Kiyoshi Sakisaka.
Nice to meet you all.

355
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,851
That over there is Mr. Ichiro Ogawa,

356
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,720
the head of year
and assistant homeroom teacher.

357
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,922
He'll be instructing you
in P.E. and welfare.

358
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:05,924
Okay…

359
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,460
Nice to meet you, Kiyoshi.

360
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,730
This here is your seat.

361
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,765
I warmed it for you.

362
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,269
-Go ahead, take him up on his offer.
-Come.

363
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,472
Come.

364
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,442
Come.

365
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,478
Eek!

366
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,848
"Eek"? What a cute reaction. Oh, you!

367
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,052
You're done for, Kiyoshi.

368
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,221
Your youth is over.

369
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,191
Because you've met Ogawa in hell.

370
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,060
Sakisaka, have you decided
on a club activity?

371
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,562
Baseball club, right?

372
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,730
Say baseball club.

373
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,831
Baseball club.

374
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,402
Don't dodge, ape!

375
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,037
You ape!

376
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,674
Hey!

377
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,510
You sorry excuse for a man.
You're like a namby-pamby girl.

378
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,946
You bean sprout!

379
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,117
Hey, do you even have balls?

380
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,987
Hey!

381
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,756
Get up, you ape!

382
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,624
You want to have rumpy-pumpy?

383
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,759
Huh?

384
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,262
You want to have rumpy-pumpy?

385
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,131
Yes.

386
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,499
How dare you! Shave your head!

387
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,267
Shave your head by tomorrow!

388
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,982
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

389
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,252
Oh! Well, well.

390
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,955
I wasn't expecting to be able to talk
to your parent this soon.

391
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,024
So you're Ogawa,
the power harassment teacher.

392
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,225
S-Sour embarrassment?

393
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,728
Power harassment.
You don't know that term, do you?

394
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,664
In other words,
it's abuse or bullying by a teacher.

395
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,799
There, there, Mrs. Sakisaka.

396
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,400
-Mr. Ogawa, take a seat.
-Right.

397
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,935
-Let's hear her out.
-Right.

398
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,541
He began shaving his head
with hair clippers.

399
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,976
I was so surprised. When I asked him why--

400
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:05,911
You're smoking?!

401
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,987
I heard you called him
a sorry excuse for a man.

402
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,255
I did.

403
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,057
To be exact, I said,
"You sorry excuse for a man."

404
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,860
"You're like a namby-pamby girl.
You bean sprout. Do you even have balls?"

405
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,128
Unbelievable!

406
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,096
Believe it or not, that's what I said.

407
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,264
It's tough love, right?

408
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,632
Of course.

409
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,734
I thought I'd whip him into shape.

410
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,903
Huh? Why are you nodding?

411
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,873
Do you think he can say anything
in the name of tough love?

412
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,943
Okay, fine. You're so fussy.
Next time, I'll punch him in silence.

413
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,211
You punched him?

414
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,612
Not anywhere important.

415
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,648
I know that much.
I'm a professional teacher, after all.

416
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,716
Tough love, right?

417
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,051
Please shut up!

418
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,752
Why are you in a tizzy?

419
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,921
Is it menopause? Sexual frustration?

420
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,623
Is your husband neglecting you?

421
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,227
This bad, huh?

422
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,097
I didn't anticipate the education scene
in Showa to be this dismal.

423
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,766
At this stage, it's actually
more fascinating than infuriating.

424
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,937
Mrs. Sakisaka,
you're a sociologist, right?

425
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,273
Oh, a highbrow.
That's why you're so irritable.

426
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,682
This is getting interesting,
so let me record this.

427
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,388
Do you realize what was inappropriate
about Mr. Ogawa's comments?

428
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,957
Yes. Um…

429
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,162
-"You're like a namby-pamby girl."
-And also, "You sorry excuse for a man."

430
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,065
Stating that men or women
should conform to certain stereotypes

431
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,002
is an unjust and discriminatory expression
that harms young individuals.

432
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:37,903
What else?

433
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,571
The rest was…

434
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,242
"You bean sprout" wasn't nice either.

435
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,245
-It harms bean sprout farmers…
-What is this?

436
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,680
-Huh?
-This thing.

437
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,781
This sleek thing.

438
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,783
What is it? Where do they sell them?

439
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,652
Hey! Stop that!

440
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,089
Anyway, please understand
that my son has a sensitive heart.

441
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:58,990
Let's go.

442
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,961
I was only intending
to enroll him here temporarily.

443
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,563
But I can't leave my precious son

444
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,499
at a school with such a violent teacher,
not even for a day.

445
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,567
Hurry up!

446
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,069
-I'll find another junior high--
-You can go first.

447
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,271
I have club activities, so I'll be late.

448
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,241
Kiyoshi, wait.

449
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,979
-Kiyoshi! Wait.
-Mrs. Sakisaka.

450
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,914
-Please come back.
-Kiyoshi, wait!

451
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,149
-Mrs. Sakisaka!
-Mrs. Sakisaka!

452
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,525
<i>I want to know what that sleek gadget is!</i>

453
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,632
<i>If it's a new product, it should be shown
on </i>11 PM <i>or</i> Tonight.

454
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,135
Old man, when are you going to bed?

455
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,637
You…

456
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,873
Are you only interested
in when I come home and go to sleep?

457
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,108
What do you take me for?

458
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,110
A shabby piggy bank.

459
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,482
You weren't this way before, Junko.

460
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,351
Back when your mom was still with us.

461
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,752
How about watching a video?

462
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,688
It's of you at ten, singing
a Pink Lady song after a bath.

463
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,591
Watch this and remember your past self.

464
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,293
Like hell I'll watch it.

465
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,161
Anyway, did you get a cassette for me?

466
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,430
Yeah. Right there.

467
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,903
What is this?

468
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,440
You wanted it, didn't you?
What was it called again?

469
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,043
It's the outfit the Onyanko girls wear,
with the sailor.

470
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,812
The Sailors? No way!

471
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,414
The Sailors sweatshirt, right?

472
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,782
I found it so I bought one.

473
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,019
Are you serious?
You're not all bad, after all!

474
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,320
I splurged.

475
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,790
You handled the cleaning and
took out the trash for me this month.

476
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,561
This is a normal tape!

477
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,629
What?

478
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,465
I told you to get AXIA's
chrome or metal tape, didn't I?

479
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,301
I'm giving this to a senior student,
so I need the recording to sound good.

480
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,437
I don't want a normal tape.
Get it replaced!

481
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,872
Who cares about the sound?

482
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,440
It's a Shibugakitai song, anyway.

483
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,676
Anyway, try the Sailors shirt on.

484
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,451
Where did you get this?

485
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,686
Kinshicho.

486
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,720
What?

487
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,357
They only sell Sailors shirts in Shibuya.

488
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,027
They don't have them in Kinshicho.
Look carefully, geezer!

489
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,033
"Sayers"?

490
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,301
It says "Sayers." Damn it.

491
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,070
It's a fake. They got me.

492
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,604
I don't want it. Go return it.

493
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,406
No, it's cool.

494
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,141
I mean, it's saying <i>Seiya</i>!

495
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,143
No one else is wearing
something like this.

496
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:37,682
This is Ogawa.

497
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,852
Hello?

498
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,954
Who is this?

499
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,589
Junko took a crap and went to bed.

500
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,523
Hey!

501
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,392
It's time for kids to go to bed! Moron!

502
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,527
Take a crap
and go to bed yourself, geezer!

503
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,518
Hey!

504
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,187
Who's that scruffy punk
resembling a female mantis?

505
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,823
He's nothing like Kiyoshi from Yonchome!

506
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,892
So, you're cool with anyone
for rumpy-pumpy?

507
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,826
Hey!

508
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,296
Junko.

509
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,031
Sorry about earlier.

510
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,835
I'll get you a proper Sailors shirt, okay?

511
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,940
Junko dear?

512
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,643
Are you asleep?

513
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,284
She's asleep.

514
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,661
JUNKO 1978 PINK LADY

515
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,571
F*CK TO THE TEACHER
RURU AIDA

516
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,782
Damn!

517
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,787
<i>I apologize for the late call.</i>

518
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,457
<i>I'm a member
of the Miss Magazine selection committee.</i>

519
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,693
<i>Miss Junko has been selected as--</i>

520
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,961
You're Kiyoshi from Yonchome.

521
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,297
<i>It's so obvious.</i>

522
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,500
<i>You still have energy left
after all those bunny hops this afternoon?</i>

523
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,435
<i>Tomorrow, I'll have you do twice as many.</i>

524
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,604
You're still awake?

525
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,638
Sorry.

526
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,575
Just unbelievable.

527
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,777
They're showing boobs on terrestrial TV!

528
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,313
Go to bed now.
We're heading home tomorrow.

529
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,448
Tomorrow?

530
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,283
The earlier, the better, right?

531
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,919
This era is too tough for you.

532
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,388
Come on. Turn the light off already.

533
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,490
Goodnight.

534
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,296
"My future dream is to become
a globally recognized scientist."

535
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,933
-"In the past, many scientists have…"
-He probably transferred again.

536
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,102
What, really? That's so sudden.

537
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,605
"YOUR FUTURE DREAM"
PRESENTATION

538
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,410
<i>That sleek thing wasn't shown
on</i> 11 PM <i>or</i> Tonight.

539
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,947
<i>Which means, maybe</i>

540
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,149
<i>it really was a dream.</i>

541
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,052
<i>That day,</i>

542
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,623
<i>when I stepped off the bus
after my club activities, it was…</i>

543
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,995
I just heard that.

544
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,296
Say cheese.

545
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,270
<i>And there, I met her.</i>

546
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,705
<i>That was one good woman.</i>

547
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,110
<i>But for some reason, she seemed unhappy.</i>

548
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,980
Can't a mother with a baby
enjoy even a single glass of beer?

549
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,615
<i>I'm curious about her</i>

550
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,852
<i>but I can't see her again.</i>

551
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,722
"Are you familiar with the movie
<i>Back to the Future</i>?"

552
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,358
"I've seen it 18 times."

553
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,260
<i>I want to see her.</i>

554
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,932
<i>I can't believe
I didn't at least ask for her number.</i>

555
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,835
"The protagonist uses a time machine to
travel to a world 30 years in the past."

556
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,205
"The time machine, constructed by Doc,

557
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,576
is a dimension transfer device
installed in a DeLorean DMC-12 car and--"

558
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,912
-You're not making any sense, nerd!
-Shut up!

559
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,649
Hey, four-eyes.
Can a time machine be built?

560
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,684
My name is Inoue.

561
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,687
In theory, it's considered not impossible.

562
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,855
Einstein proposed that

563
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,757
the third-dimensional space
is linked with time.

564
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,361
-Which functions as the fourth--
-Forget it. I won't understand anyway.

565
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,029
Just tell me if it's possible.

566
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,367
I believe it is.

567
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,636
If you work hard enough.

568
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,342
Work hard, Inoue. You can do it.

569
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,044
-Right!
-Right.

570
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,414
My dream is to become a scientist,
invent a time machine,

571
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:09,320
and journey back 30 years into the past
to revisit Class B, Grade 2 at School 6.

572
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,126
<i>Was the bus I took that day
a time machine?</i>

573
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,664
<i>So, by taking the same bus,
I can travel to the future.</i>

574
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:21,833
<i>Right?</i>

575
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,534
<i>Two buses within an hour.</i>

576
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,169
<i>Which one did I board?</i>

577
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,607
<i>Three, three-thirty…</i>

578
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,770
Are you scared, Junko?

579
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,571
No. Let's go!

580
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,278
Kiyoshi, let's go.

581
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:26,697
<i>Is it this bus?</i>

582
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,158
We're getting on!

583
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,128
We're getting on!

584
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,475
How?

585
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,310
Hey, Kiyoshi!

586
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,946
Kiyoshi, wait! Kiyoshi!

587
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,348
Mrs. Sakisaka, you dropped this!

588
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,083
Kiyoshi!

589
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,289
Stop, Kiyoshi!

590
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,958
Stop!

591
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,094
Wait, we're getting on!

592
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,964
-Stop the bus! Some people want to board!
-We're getting on!

593
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,434
I said stop the bus! Hey!

594
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,377
Stop!

595
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,647
-No, Mrs. Sakisaka, it won't stop!
-Stop!

596
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,716
The driver is a mannequin!

597
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,752
No, it won't stop! No!

598
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,988
Stop!

599
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,976
I've fallen in love.

600
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,979
What?!

601
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,614
So,

602
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,050
I want to stay here longer.

603
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,452
Sorry.

604
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,189
Stop right there. Kiyoshi!

605
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,723
-Let go of me.
-Who is this person?

606
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,692
-Where is this person from?
-Let go of me, old biddy!

607
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,162
I don't want to go back to Reiwa!
I like the Showa era!

608
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,463
Why?

609
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,966
What's to like about this era?

610
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,236
It's rough and full of discrimination
and adults with no taste.

611
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,104
You get to see boobs on TV!

612
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,640
What happened to you?

613
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,275
I want to see boobs on TV!

614
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,512
I want to see boobs on terrestrial TV!

615
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,280
I want to see them!

616
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,850
I beg your pardon.

617
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,186
I know.

618
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,454
Something's wrong with me.

619
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,990
So just leave me alone.

620
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,633
I went too far
by calling you an old biddy.

621
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,734
I'm sorry.

622
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,815
DRINKS

623
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,252
<i>Here is your Broiled</i> Shime Saba.

624
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,388
Should I get you the same drink?

625
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,522
I'll order one myself.

626
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,659
Anyway, are you sure you have no clue?

627
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,094
No.

628
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,529
I admired Kaga, after all.

629
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,499
She's working toward having the case
seen as power harassment.

630
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,401
Did she really say that?

631
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,404
That she had a mental…

632
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,939
That she had a mental breakdown.

633
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,707
That's undeniable.

634
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,943
She's taking
a month-long leave of absence.

635
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,979
<i>Here is your Broiled</i> Shime Saba.

636
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,882
Shall we practice
for the personnel department interview?

637
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,119
"He put pressure on me
just before my presentation."

638
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,421
Does that ring any bells?

639
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,492
It's soon, isn't it, Kaga?
I expect a lot from you, so work hard!

640
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,394
Right.

641
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,463
Wait. Can't I even offer encouragement?

642
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,733
It can cause some people
to have a breakdown.

643
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,737
That will be seen as power harassment.
Say that it was a thoughtless remark.

644
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,705
What's next?

645
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,041
Well then, Kaga,
take care of the support tasks.

646
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:30,941
Right.

647
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,112
You're so fast.

648
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,048
Leave it to Generation Z.

649
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,115
I did say that.

650
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,651
She really is fast at flick input, though.

651
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,988
What? I can't say that?

652
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,625
Labeling someone based on their generation
falls under age harassment.

653
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,727
<i>Here is your Broiled</i> Shime Saba.

654
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,330
Broiled <i>Shime Saba</i> is really popular, huh?

655
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,597
Shall we order a plate?

656
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,800
And what else?

657
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,736
It seems you've even made
a sexual harassment remark, Akitsu.

658
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,971
No, that's impossible. There's no way.

659
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,941
You had a barbecue with members
of the sales department, right?

660
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,644
Here you go.

661
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,312
Thanks.

662
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,016
Any guy who gets you as a wife is lucky.

663
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,221
<i>She felt awkward</i>

664
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,591
<i>as it sounded you were labeling
the other females as inconsiderate.</i>

665
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,992
I didn't intend it that way.

666
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,627
Regardless of the intent,

667
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,597
if it made the other person uncomfortable,
it's harassment.

668
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,835
In these times, even compliments
need to be given with caution.

669
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:32,603
What kind of times?

670
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,374
Pardon?

671
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,677
You're the fourth person
I've heard say "in these times."

672
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,645
And I've been drinking here
since this place opened.

673
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,581
<i>Here is your Broiled</i> Shime Saba.

674
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,450
No way. I've only had one glass so far.

675
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,321
I've been trying to get
another glass of lemon sour,

676
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,457
but all I'm getting is Broiled <i>Shime Saba</i>.
What did I do, huh?

677
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,559
Can I help?

678
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,461
I'd appreciate that.

679
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,198
I can tell that
the economy isn't doing great.

680
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,467
The part-timers' hourly wages
haven't improved.

681
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,703
You've ordered 200 plates
of Broiled <i>Shime Saba</i>.

682
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,439
Just kill me already.

683
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,009
So, what kind of times are these?

684
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,413
It's an era of diversity.

685
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,316
Having a happy life
isn't just about getting married.

686
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,387
And it's an era where
if someone tells you to work hard,

687
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,122
you can take a month off from work?

688
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,391
No offense, but please don't mind us.

689
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,194
We've met before.

690
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,230
What?

691
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,875
This one.

692
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,110
Thanks.

693
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,379
The sound really is different.

694
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,615
Nothing beats metal tapes.

695
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,691
Hey, Mutchy.

696
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,760
Don't you notice anything?

697
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,628
What?

698
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,132
Come on, look again.

699
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,202
I don't get it.

700
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:12,870
My bangs.

701
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,106
I styled them after Akina
on the jacket of "Desire."

702
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,344
More than Akina, I totally…

703
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,614
like Miyuki Imori better.

704
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,250
Did you want the milk tea?

705
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,852
This isn't bitter.

706
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,657
Junko,

707
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,926
do you want kids?

708
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,561
What?

709
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,931
I don't know.
I haven't thought of that yet.

710
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,168
If I have a son,

711
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,238
I'll raise him to be a fearless kid
who never loses in a fight.

712
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,640
That'd be…

713
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:52,643
awesome.

714
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,113
If you want, I'll stop being a punk.

715
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,150
So Junko,

716
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,587
won't you give me your future?

717
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,372
Kiyoshi?

718
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:22,773
D…

719
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,777
Don't touch my woman.

720
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,512
Who the hell are you?

721
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,181
Junko and I…

722
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,986
have a very fine relationship.

723
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,626
Bring it on!

724
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,530
What?

725
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,166
What?

726
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,844
The dishes are brought by a robot,
but it's a human who broils them.

727
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,747
I canceled the remaining
<i>Shime Saba</i> for you.

728
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,016
-And you want a lemon sour, right?
-Yeah.

729
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,321
The one who takes a break from work
after being encouraged gains sympathy,

730
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,457
but this guy who offered
the encouragement gets criticized.

731
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,625
It sounds messed up.

732
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,128
What was he supposed to say, then?

733
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,698
He shouldn't have said anything.

734
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,268
He should've silently watched over her.

735
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,369
After it went well,

736
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,405
he could've complimented her in a way
that wouldn't make her feel pressured.

737
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,407
He should never criticize a mistake.

738
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,844
If he had empathized with her and
helped identify the cause of the mistake,

739
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,679
she wouldn't have had a breakdown.

740
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,514
Revolting.

741
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,449
Pardon?

742
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,151
What do you mean by empathize?
As if you're Mutsugoro.

743
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,022
This is why hourly wages don't improve
and the economy is struggling.

744
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,124
Plus, jobs are being taken over by robots.

745
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,727
<i>Here is your Broiled Bacon.</i>

746
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,795
Robots don't have breakdowns,

747
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,131
even if they make a mistake, after all.

748
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,232
Sorry.

749
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,233
That's weird.

750
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,235
Give me a break!

751
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,738
We weren't working so hard

752
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,441
to bring about this future or these times.

753
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,880
You have expectations of people,
and you meet their expectations.

754
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,817
You receive criticism and encouragement,
and you work hard.

755
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,887
That's how you become stronger.
That's the essence of being human.

756
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,155
That idea is outdated.

757
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,723
Mental something or whatever.

758
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,126
If receiving encouragement gets you down,

759
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,527
you won't last long anyway.

760
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,463
That kind of remark
is exactly what's problematic right now!

761
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,866
"That kind of remark
is exactly what's problematic right now!"

762
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,901
But it's fine to end the conversation
by yelling hysterically?

763
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,737
Doesn't that qualify
as some form of harassment?

764
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,508
What would you do?

765
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,243
Don't engage him.

766
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,378
If someone makes a mistake? Let's see.

767
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,813
I'd spank them with a bat.

768
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,381
And if they do well?

769
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,416
Toss them in the air.

770
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,951
I like that.

771
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,119
Let's leave.

772
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,355
Let's continue this conversation.

773
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,525
Talking with someone like him
won't lead to anything.

774
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,730
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

775
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:04,702
<i>Even if we can't understand each other…</i>

776
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,403
Hey. What's gotten into you?

777
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,541
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

778
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:15,846
<i>Especially with an old guy like him</i>

779
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>Unlike robots, it's something we can do</i>

780
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,521
<i>We can have a conversation</i>

781
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,091
What is it? What's gotten into you?

782
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:30,027
A junior colleague, whom I treated
with care to avoid power harassment,

783
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,562
left the company last year.

784
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,964
He said he was going
to a convenience store,

785
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,432
and he ended up a YouTuber.

786
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,568
Screw him.

787
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,470
Screw him.

788
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,740
Screw him, that bastard!

789
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,476
Was that Hitoshi Ueki? No?
What's up with you?

790
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,546
<i>No guidance from above</i>

791
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,482
<i>But beneath, eggshells</i>

792
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:52,950
<i>Tread carefully</i>

793
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>In my seventh year with the company</i>

794
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,891
<i>My mental health has reached its limit</i>

795
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:06,430
<i>So let's have a conversation</i>

796
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:13,270
<i>It's time!</i>

797
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,243
<i>So let's have a conversation</i>

798
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,011
<i>Broiled</i> Shime Saba

799
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,913
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

800
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,683
<i>Let's have a conversation today</i>

801
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,385
<i>Broiled</i> Shime Saba

<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:36,026
<i>True, you're right about everything</i>

00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,761
What, you too?

805
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:43,500
<i>But what's right isn't always right</i>

806
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,135
<i>That's organizations for you</i>

807

<i>Any justice if brandished
Turns into oppression</i>

808
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,543
<i>That's organizations for you</i>

809
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,313
<i>So don't assert yourself</i>

810
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,783
<i>Or have expectations</i>

811
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,120
<i>In my 13th year with the company</i>

812
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:08,659
<i>My mental health is long gone</i>

813
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,928
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

814
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,496
<i>Broiled</i> Shime Saba

815
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,565
<i>I won't talk with you</i>

816
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,402
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

817
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,803
<i>Broiled</i> Shime Saba

818
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,139
<i>I won't talk with you</i>

819
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,341
<i>That's organizations for you</i>

820
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,452
<i>If you won't exchange words</i>

821
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,023
<i>Why not exchange blows?</i>

822
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,561
<i>Fist against fist</i>

823
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:48,498
<i>Let them speak for you!</i>

824
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,079
Oh…

825
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:30,974
Give up.

826
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,113
Mutchy!

827
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,153
Not bad.

828
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,798
You said, "Having a happy life
isn't just about getting married."

829
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:59,002
But does that mean you can't say,
"I'm happy I got married"?

830
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,540
I was happy when I married my missus.

831
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,110
When my daughter was born,
I was so happy I wanted to shout.

832
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,280
<i>Why hold yourself back?</i>

833
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,116
<i>A society where you can't express
Your happiness</i>

834
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,386
<i>Isn't something wrong with that?</i>

835
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,656
<i>That's diversity for you</i>

836
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,426
A society that embraces
diverse perspectives.

837
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:27,130
So, accept my perspective too,
and let me declare my happiness.

838
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:34,805
<i>That's real diversity</i>

839
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,075
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

840
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,943
<i>Fist against fist</i>

841
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,145
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

842
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,181
<i>Fist against fist</i>

843
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,318
<i>Even if we can't understand each other</i>

844
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:55,392
<i>There will be a record of us having talked</i>

845
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:09,506
If a conversation won't lead us anywhere,
singing won't be of any help either.

846
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,008
Isn't it late to say that?

847
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,744
Are you satisfied now?

848
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,179
Well then, good luck
with the interview tomorrow.

849
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:22,285
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

850
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,224
<i>Let's have a conversation</i>

851
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:33,597
Kaga?

852
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,736
I'm sorry, Mr. Akitsu. I…

853
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,071
What is it?

854
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:48,178
<i>I wanted you to scold me</i>

855
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:53,617
You were known for being strict
with the other employees.

856
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,952
But when it came to me,
you said, "Work hard,"

857
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,387
"I have expectations for you,"

858
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,089
and other ambiguous things.

859
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,126
So I thought you didn't see me
as a part of the team from the start.

860
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,928
That's not true.

861
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,733
<i>Because I'm a woman</i>

862
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,637
<i>I thought you had given up on me</i>

863
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,872
<i>That's not true</i>

864
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,674
<i>It is true</i>

865
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,244
<i>It's because you're outstanding</i>

866
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,914
<i>To be scolded</i>

867
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,248
I've never experienced that.

868
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,217
<i>Not once</i>

869
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,852
<i>Not even by my parents</i>

870
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:34,157
<i>Not by anyone</i>

871
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,626
If we were to scold you,
it would be power harassment.

872
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,230
Regardless of the reason.
That's why we're too scared to scold you.

873
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,768
<i>That's organizations for you</i>

874
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:45,802
Still,

875
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,471
I wanted to be scolded.

876
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,572
Really?

877
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,208
Are you sure we can scold you?

878
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,210
-By Mr. Akitsu.
-Of course. Go ahead.

879
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,278
There's nothing to scold you about.

880
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,481
You're fine the way you are.

881
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,516
I'm sorry.

882
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:03,386
I may have just wanted your attention.

883
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,523
That's hard to tell unless you tell me.

884
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>I'm glad we could have a conversation</i>

885
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,665
<i>I'm glad we could have a conversation</i>

886
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:22,672
<i>I'm glad we could have a conversation</i>

887
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,289
-Hey.
-Sorry. I don't have any cash.

888
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,357
I'll cover it for you.

889
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,859
Thanks.

890
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,462
I have to hurry, or my daughter
will have rumpy-pumpy.

891
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,706
Not bad.

892
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,011
Sort of.

893
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,753
The hole in the toilet. To the toilet.

894
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:14,858
To the toilet…

895
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,365
Oh.

896
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,334
Hey.

897
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,172
You came.

898
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,376
I thought I'd be able to see you
if I waited here.

899
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:34,778
What?

900
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:35,812
You want a drink?

901
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,148
Beer, then.

902
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:44,854
This is where you work?

903
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,891
At night, this place
becomes a hostess bar.

904
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,032
By the way, mister.

905
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:56,967
It's Ogawa.

906
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,370
Mr. Ogawa,
you're getting bashed on socials.

907
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,472
Socials?

908
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,444
-This is you, right?
-<i>You're the one risking danger, miss.</i>

909
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,948
<i>Udon noodles are hanging from your ears,
and your panties are almost showing.</i>

910
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,851
You should be careful
of saying stuff like this.

911
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:19,189
Once it's out there online,
you can't just hit delete.

912
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,325
-It's called a digital tattoo--
-This thing…

913
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:24,694
So it's a TV.

914
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,130
Not exactly.

915
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,700
It's more like a phone, wallet, radio,

916
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,370
and camera.

917
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,439
I have one too. The same one.

918
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,376
Huh?

919
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,412
Huh? Wait a minute.

920
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:49,753
Looking for this?

921
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,058
That's it.

922
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,559
Thanks for bringing it to me.

923
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:58,862
This is it.

924
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,238
I-Is something the matter?

925
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,140
Well, um…

926
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,013
You probably won't believe me,

927
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,650
but I come from Showa 61.

928
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,424
W-What are you talking about?

929
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,591
Through time strip.

930
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,893
Don't you know?

931
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,762
There's a movie called
<i>Back to the Whatchamacallit.</i>

932
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,299
I'm here from 38 years ago.

933
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,502
Which means,
you guys are people of the future.

934
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:46,976
You're crazy.

935
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,979
I'm a P.E. teacher at School 6
and the baseball club staff adviser.

936
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,481
I'm known as Ogawa from Hell.

937
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,118
This is my student's lost item.

938
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,622
Sorry, see you again.

939
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,324
My daughter might have rumpy-pumpy.

940
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,604
Where's Kyon Kyon?

941
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,673
Where's Kyon Kyon's poster?

942
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,982
Why?

943
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,618
Want to come over?

944
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,186
Huh?

945
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,422
You need to get this treated properly.

946
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:35,992
Don't worry.

947
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,461
My dad isn't home today.

948
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,463
Let's go.

949
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,336
Where's Kyon Kyon?!

950
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,605
Kyon Kyon?

951
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,907
The toilet! It's a Western-style one now!

952
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:52,942
Oh, yeah.

953
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,478
We had a dealer install a Washlet today.

954
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,247
Today? Why?

955
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,518
Well, because having
a Japanese-style toilet is outdated.

956
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,720
And the barkeep says he has hemorrhoids.

957
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,088
What the hell, you ugly?!

958
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,623
Excuse me?!

959
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,825
She's going to have rumpy-pumpy!

960
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,060
My daughter is going to have rumpy…

961
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,034
Huh?

962
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,206
Shall we watch something?

963
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,508
Like a video of me when I was little

964
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,644
dancing to Pink Lady
with my mom after a bath.

965
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,312
Of you, Junko?

966
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,114
I want to see it.

967
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,221
F*CK TO THE TEACHER

968
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,089
JUNKO 1978
PINK LADY

969
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,991
Damn it. I screwed up!

970
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,328
MOM

971
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,902
MOM
VIDEO CALL

972
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:03,546
<i>Hello?</i>

973
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,548
<i>Hello?</i>

974
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,184

00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,400
What the hell is a "work style"?

981
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,736
They'll reprimand me
for making you work unpaid overtime!

982
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,506
Don't try to carry everything on your own.

986
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,981
Let me choose my own work style, at least!
