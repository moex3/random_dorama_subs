1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,238
<i>Hello?</i>

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,741
<i>Is that… Ogawa?</i>

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,877
<i>Hello?</i>

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,979
<i>Hello?</i>

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,914
Hello,

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,017
Kiyoshi's mother!

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,585
Can you hear me?

8
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,553
<i>Yes. I can hear you.</i>

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,123
This is so frustrating.

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,958
Sorry about this.

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,093
There's no Wi-Fi here, you see.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,864
But I tried calling using my Pocket WiFi
while standing on a stepladder,

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,400
and now I can hear you.

14
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,968
Oh, it's her!

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:36,836
It's her!

16
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,771
Look.

17
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,940
She's Sakae Sakisaka, a feminist.

18
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,844
So she was from over here.

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,016
You're famous. Cool.

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,217
You put men to shame.

21
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,088
<i>That expression is discriminatory.
It assumes women are inferior.</i>

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,156
Whatever.

23
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,458
Mrs. Sakisaka, where are you right now?

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>Now?</i>

25
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,464
<i>I'm in front of a cafe called Scandal.</i>

26
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,732
What?

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,336
Try entering the cafe.

28
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>I'm in.</i>

29
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,346
See?

30
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,315
She's in the Showa era.

31
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,488
That means
you really are in the Reiwa era.

32
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,689
Hello.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,491
<i>Are you by yourself?</i>

34
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,725
<i>Take any seat you like.</i>

35
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,128
Huh? Barkeep?

36
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,497
-That's the barkeep?!
-That's him 38 years ago.

37
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,266
Anyway, it's great my call went through.

38
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,137
It's not great at all!

39
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,140
Sorry for the trouble,
but could you go to my house now?

40
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,241
I'll share my address.

41
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,776
What? Why?

42
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,345
My daughter is going
to have rumpy-pumpy with your son!

43
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,513
<i>Rumpy-pumpy?</i>

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,950
For some reason, the video of my daughter
when she was little is here,

45
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,654
<i>which means the porn video I confiscated
from a student is inside the VCR.</i>

46
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,056
It's of a lady teacher.

47
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,960
If they watch it, your horny ape of a son
will become even more like an ape!

48
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,862
Kiyoshi.

49
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,164
Kiyoshi.

50
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:19,038
Kiyoshi!

51
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,250
Who are you?

52
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,518
Step aside!

53
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,220
Kiyoshi!

54
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,822
Are you his mother?

55
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,357
Kiyoshi!

56
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,892
Kiyo…

57
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,297
It seems he lost confidence
after watching this.

58
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,733
All I wanted to see were boobs.

59
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,870
Watching something like that
would make me go insane.

60
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,873
I'm going to go insane.

61
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,510
Where's my stupid geezer?
Why isn't he coming home?

62
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,513
After my baseball club activities,
I boarded a bus.

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,150
<i>Then a high school girl wearing
a very short skirt boarded the bus.</i>

64
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,653
-Are these what you saw?
-Yeah.

65
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,922
They're earphones
that transmit sound via Bluetooth.

66
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,858
Transmit sound? Via Bluetooth?

67
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,327
And what happened
when you stepped off the bus?

68
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,362
A package of hi-lite was 520 yen.

69
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,597
<i>I met you.</i>

70
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>I went to the toilet and saw
Kyon Kyon's 40th anniversary poster.</i>

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,970
<i>There was a hole in the wall
that led to the Showa era.</i>

72
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,106
You arrived here from the past by bus,

73
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,475
and you returned to the past
through the toilet?

74
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,811
So the toilet is a gateway
to the Showa era.

75
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,214
Until the other day. But not anymore.

76
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,449
I can't go back.

77
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,917
Because you renovated it!

78
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,887
I mean, it's outdated
to have a Japanese-style toilet.

79
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,790
I'm sorry, I guess.

80
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,525
I'm the one to blame?

81
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,960
Why did you come back?

82
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,029
Huh? Well…

83
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,631
Because…

84
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,234
Did you forget something here?

85
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,269
Because, um…

86
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,473
I was curious about you.

87
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,776
Me?

88
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:04,944
Yeah, you.

89
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,813
You were crying the other day.

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,781
My baby finally fell asleep.

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,254
If you'd like,
I can lend you a listening ear.

92
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,162
Sorry. I accidentally paired
the earphones.

93
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,497
Paired?

94
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,770
<i>Your daughter… having rumpy-pumpy.</i>

95
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,904
What?

96
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,873
I managed to prevent them.

97
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,644
Also, it seems I can connect to the Wi-Fi
when in this position.

98
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,245
The stepladder had nothing to do with it.

99
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,914
So, what will you do?

100
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,450
Do you know how you can come back?

101
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,885
I don't.

102
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,186
Do you?

103
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,855
What's with that bus anyway?

104
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,658
This is a real pain.
There's a baseball match tomorrow!

105
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,393
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

106
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,365
What's wrong with high school girls
in the Showa era?

107
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,968
As soon as you look away,
they start going at it.

108
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,003
I can't let my guard down at all.

109
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,307
-Shut up, you hysteric biddy!
-What?

110
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,909
Who cares?
It's not like it's the end of the world.

111
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,678
Everyone else has gone through it!

112
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,280
Being a virgin isn't cool these days!

113
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,284
I want to live it up in my teens
and become a Clarion Girl!

114
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,187
This is my business card
from my previous job.

115
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,657
EBS? You worked at a TV station?

116
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,428
I had a passion for comedy
and hoped to work with variety shows,

117
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,630
but I ended up in the news department.

118
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,865
I was sent to the New York branch,

119
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,501
where I met my husband,
who worked as a correspondent.

120
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,437
Ryusuke Taniguchi.

121
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,073
-He's a freelance journalist now.
-Wow.

122
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,941
He's got 1.58 million subscribers!

123
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,710
-What are you talking about?
-Look.

124
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,847
<i>Welcome to Ryusuke Taniguchi's channel,</i>
Sound Arguments.

125
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:52,385
<i>Today, I will present sound arguments
about environmental issues.</i>

126
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,387
<i>Waste sorting.</i>

127
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,024
<i>Super important.</i>

128
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,125
<i>This is because…</i>

129
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,396
Like that, he basically only presents
sound arguments.

130
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,465
But the night view of New York
was gorgeous,

131
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,434
and it just felt like
he was saying something cool.

132
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,239
And I wanted to show myself
in a wedding dress to my father soon.

133
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,878
My mother passed away in the year
of the Great Hanshin earthquake.

134
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,514
The Great Hanshin earthquake?

135
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,951
When you don't know something,
you just Google it, like this.

136
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:25,852
See?

137
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,020
What? Are you kidding me?

138
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,323
1995? That's nine years from now.

139
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,158
An earthquake that big?

140
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,762
Another one hit Tohoku in 2011.

141
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,298
Huh, I see. I'll keep that in mind.

142
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,135
And then?

143
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,539
Then I came back to Japan
when I married him.

144
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,941
All your memories are in there, huh?

145
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,145
Huh? Oh, yeah.

146
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,614
Losing it would be a big deal, then.

147
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,182
And?

148
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,253
My husband supported my decision
to continue working.

149
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,221
And I was chosen as the assistant producer

150
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,724
in the variety department
I've been longing to join.

151
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,394
Just as my job was becoming interesting,

152
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,331
I discovered I was pregnant with Masato.

153
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,737
My husband was involved in childcare
and told me not to shoulder everything.

154
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,976
He kept telling me, "If there's anything
I can do, just let me know."

155
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,011
Revolting.

156
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,947
-What?
-No, go on.

157
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,818
I was eager to return to work quickly.

158
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,353
Even while on maternity leave,
I made a project plan

159
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,689
and prepared myself
to rejoin the workforce.

160
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,394
But I didn't pass the screening
to enroll the baby in a nursery.

161
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,830
Even though you both worked?

162
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,699
The person at the ward office said,

163
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,903
"Your husband is
on paternity leave, isn't he?"

164
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,905
<i>I'm going to share a sound argument.</i>

165
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,006
<i>Paternity leave.</i>

166
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,976
<i>You should definitely take it.</i>

167
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,711
<i>I will also take time off work.</i>

168
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,446
<i>The reason is…</i>

169
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,982
His argument is sound, but the timing is…

170
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,550
When I spoke with my supervisor,

171
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,752
the company was promoting
the Work Style Reform.

172
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,989
They were planning to set up
a daycare in their annex next year,

173
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,593
so he urged me to make use of it
and share its benefits with others.

174
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,895
I finally managed to return to the office.

175
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,463
Good morning!

176
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,732
-Good morning.
-You're early.

177
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,001
-Sorry.
-I will open the door right now.

178
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,604
Here we go.

179
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,473
-Here are his diapers and baby wipes.
-Right.

180
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,108
-And this is his baby food.
-Right.

181
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,310
If he refuses to eat,
there's jelly in this bag.

182
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,979
-Here we go, Machato.
-Right.

183
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,914
Be a good boy, okay?

184
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,415
-See you later.
-Take care.

185
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,021
Mr. Uryu, here's the project plan I made
during my maternity leave.

186
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,391
Meet Ai, the new assistant producer.

187
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,726
Please hand over your tasks.

188
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,028
H-Hand over?

189
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,532
You're being promoted to producer,
and I'm stepping into an executive role.

190
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,035
Right, of course.

191
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,571
Let me know if there's anything
I can support you.

192
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,611
You look at the cast lineup for the day
and allocate dressing rooms accordingly.

193
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,314
Put this person in Room D,
close to the smoking area.

194
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:13,185
This duo hates each other, so assign them
Rooms A and G, situated farthest apart.

195
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,723
Mr. Mushanokoji, the main emcee,
is into feng shui and fortune-telling.

196
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,293
So, I always switch the color
of the curtains to purple.

197
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,294
Got it.

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,563
Wait. Aren't you going to take notes?

199
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,998
No, I don't use paper.

200
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,767
I see.

201
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,937
Where are you going?

202
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,638
To say hello to Mr. Mushanokoji.

203
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,973
No!

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,708
Never until the show is over.

205
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,078
But Mr. Sakakibara will lecture you
if you don't greet him,

206
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,613
so go do it now!

207
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,052
BABYSITTER

208
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,760
Your mommy is coming, okay?

209
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:55,861
What's the matter?

210
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,129
I'm so sorry.

211
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,566
I glanced away for a moment, and I think
he may have swallowed a marble.

212
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:01,901
You think?

213
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,270
When I counted them, one was missing.

214
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,909
Machato, did you swallow a marble?

215
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,143
Machato?

216
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,947
-Hello?
-<i>Hello?</i>

217
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,652
<i>I tasked Ai with booking plane tickets
for the overseas location shoot.</i>

218
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,953
<i>Could you check on her?</i>

219
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,688
Economy seats will do for them.

220
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,859
These young people here
should be fine with economy seats.

221
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,429
But Mr. Ikusaburo Yamazaki
is flying business class.

222
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,199
Won't the others with longer careers
see it as unfair?

223
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,668
Then, arrange separate flights for them.

224
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,802
I see.

225
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,104
-May I?
-Sure.

226
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,575
They won't know
unless they are on the same flight.

227
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,012
"If I'm flying economy,
they must be flying economy, too."

228
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,315
"If I'm flying business,
they must be flying economy."

229
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,584
That's how celebrities tend to think.

230
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,019
That's good to know.

231
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,721
And having a standard makes it easier.

232
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,724
In my case,
I use Norito Yashima as the benchmark.

233
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,460
-Mr. Yashima? The one with glasses?
-Yeah, him.

234
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,930
Doesn't he seem like the type
who won't complain about an economy seat?

235
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,034
But he would appreciate
a business class seat.

236
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,934
True.

237
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,805
When in doubt, I consider
whether they're above or below Yashima.

238
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,407
-Your phone is ringing.
-Right.

239
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,841
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

240
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,376
-Can I look at the script?
-Sure.

241
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,981
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

242
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,987
Place the bento boxes
in the dressing rooms,

243
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,322
then copy the second script
and allocate the rooms.

244
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,291
Um, I'm clocking out for the day.

245
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,393
What? But we're shooting
two programs today.

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,029
-Sorry, but my shift is over.
-What are you doing, Ai?

247
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,531
Your shift is over.

248
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,433
-Head home already!
-Right. Sorry.

249
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,102
This is Elza.
She's taking over for the afternoon shift.

250
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,071
Please hand over your tasks.

251
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,507
Nagisa, are you okay?

252
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,244
Well, I wasn't aware
they worked on a shift basis.

253
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,681
Don't shoulder everything by yourself.
If I can do anything…

254
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,052
You said, "if I can do anything,"

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,555
but what exactly can you do?

256
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,191
I'm not you, so I have no idea.

257
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:10,730
And considering how you can help
in this situation is an additional burden.

258
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,200
In the first place, anything you can do,
I can pretty much do too.

259
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,003
And there aren't too many tasks
that you can handle, but I can't.

260
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,808
There's also the issue
of whether it's something you want to do.

261
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,513
What if I request something you can do,
but you react negatively?

262
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,782
It would make me feel so empty inside.

263
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,519
It's easier to shoulder things
on your own.

264
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,521
Exactly.

265
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,190
Yikes. I can only laugh at this point.

266
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,793
I don't really get it,
but I made fried udon noodles.

267
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,595
Why?

268
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,297
This was pretty much
the only thing I could do.

269
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,500
You'll try my cooking?

270
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,538
Sorry.

271
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,275
It would've been better if I could express
what I wanted to say at the office.

272
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,277
The fried udon noodles are delicious.

273
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,779
This is a serious problem.

274
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,916
You're suffering all the negative effects
of the Work Style Reform.

275
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,954
That day, I ended up handling the workload
of filming two programs on my own,

276
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,990
<i>while also guiding two newcomers</i>

277
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,593
<i>and making five trips
between the daycare room and the studio.</i>

278
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,662
<i>And as I was cleaning the dressing rooms…</i>

279
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,800
Nagisa, my shift is over.
I'll see you tomorrow.

280
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,370
<i>I was like, "I can't take this anymore!"</i>

281
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,173
<i>And I rushed into
the office's counseling room.</i>

282
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,076
You have a tendency
to shoulder everything by yourself.

283
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,282
Um, were you listening?

284
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,517
It's easier to do things by myself.

285
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,419
This is just your first day back at work.

286
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,823
At this rate, you'll be exhausted,
and you won't be able to enjoy your job.

287
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,891
About that…

288
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,261
Is it mandatory to enjoy my job?

289
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,163
I spent the entire day

290
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,099
struggling with the stress
of feeling compelled to enjoy myself.

291
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,836
What led you to join this company?

292
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,239
To create project plans for variety shows.

293
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,910
My dream is to produce a unique program
with my favorite comedian.

294
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,548
In that case, it would be a shame
to let something like this bring you down.

295
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,152
Don't throw away the career
you've worked so hard to build.

296
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,788
I see.

297
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,758
Right. Absolutely.

298
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,962
Well then, I'm looking forward
to continuing our collaboration. Bye.

299
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,065
What?

300
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,302
This is a project plan for a new show
that I made while on maternity leave.

301
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,638
You can show me that later.
Go home already!

302
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,541
They'll reprimand me
for making you work unpaid overtime!

303
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:38,978
I see.

304
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,181
And paper is so outdated.
Email me the data.

305
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,415
I don't "see" it at all!

306
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,220
At this rate, I don't even know
why I returned to the office!

307
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,257
Anyway, I thought I should find
a proper childcare service.

308
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,360
<i>I visited the Child Care Support Service
at the ward office.</i>

309
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,096
The Kawasumi Nursery
has a waiting list of 30 people.

310
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,298
What?

311
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,834
When I came here a year ago,

312
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
I was told there were ten people
on the waiting list and…

313
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,173
-<i>I tried to consult with my husband.</i>
-May I speak with Taniguchi?

314
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,075
<i>He's been working remotely since five.</i>

315
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,078
I see.

316
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,082
<i>I'm Nunokawa, Mr. Taniguchi's attorney
and public relations representative.</i>

317
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,318
Until when is he working remotely?

318
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,819
<i>I'm unable to answer that.</i>

319
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,388
<i>It's confidential information.</i>

320
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Shall I take a message?
Or would you prefer a callback?</i>

321
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,862
Actually, never mind.

322
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,231
Thank you for your time.

323
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,092
That was me.

324
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,593
At that moment,

325
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,930
my patience reached its breaking point.

326
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,032
I worked hard all day

327
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,836
for this one glass.

328
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,405
And yet…

329
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,574
Huh?!

330
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,544
In the heat of the moment,
I sent in my resignation to my company,

331
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,080
and divorce papers to my husband.

332
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,987
Why did you do that, Mr. Ogawa?

333
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,423
My bad. I didn't think a glass of beer
would lead to a divorce.

334
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,092
I've gotten over it already.

335
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:38,964
Right now, I work as a hostess
during the evenings at this bar.

336
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:45,804
Because of Mr. Ogawa, or thanks to him,
my life has done a complete 180.

337
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,943
Anyway, it's the last call.

338
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,779
What will you do?

339
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,516
Even if trains are running,
I guess you can't go home.

340
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,884
Where do you live, Nagisa?

341
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,420
Huh? You're coming over?

342
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,255
Don't worry. I won't do anything.

343
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,290
I'll call the police if you do.

344
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,325
You can stay at mine.

345
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,359
Where? Nearby?

346
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,660
It's a ten-minute walk.

347
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,230
I don't need bedding.
A sofa or a sleeping bag will do.

348
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,265
But my place is small, and I have a baby.

349
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,401
My place is spacious,
and there's no one else.

350
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,369
I have medaka. Would you like to see them?

351
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,745
What's wrong with you?
Read the room a little and scram!

352
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,313
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,251
But telling a woman, "Don't worry,
I won't do anything!" is inappropriate.

354
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,385
Why?

355
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,488
Accidents like that are just what happens
between men and women!

356
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,625
The next morning, she'd say,
"You said you wouldn't do anything."

357
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,094
And you grin at each other
while having coffee.

358
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,263
That'd be an act of indecency
without consent.

359
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,632
Any sexual activity
without consent is a crime.

360
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,635
What? Isn't it consent
when she lets you into her place?

361
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,470
To avoid misunderstandings like that,

362
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,673
our company recommends
the sexual consent app.

363
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,977
You give consent by scanning this QR code.

364
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,980
So it has to go like this?

365
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,949
"I won't do anything,
so let me come over."

366
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,852
"But I want something to happen."
"Are you sure?"

367
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,920
"Of course!"

368
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,688
Or you can't have rumpy-pumpy?

369
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,856
You don't.

370
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,124
You don't?

371
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,960
Don't you want to have rumpy-pumpy?
At your age?

372
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,096
What's the joy in life, then?

373
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,398
Dating isn't a good bang for your buck.

374
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,767
Huh? What's that?

375
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,268
Wait, don't tell me.

376
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,338
I'll Google it.

377
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,477
This is my mom.
She died five years ago from an illness.

378
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:32,911
I see.

379
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,382
She was hospitalized for a long time.

380
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,785
I was mentally prepared for it.

381
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,757
But my dad became so depressed,
it was almost laughable.

382
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,061
He would sit there every night and cry.

383
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:56,034
So right now, I'm behaving
like a delinquent to distract him.

384
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,273
This is before we got married.

385
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,442
Yuri was so young here.

386
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,445
Isn't she cute?
She's nine years younger than me.

387
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,081
She was a student
who came for teaching practice,

388
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
and I seduced her after assuring her
I wouldn't do anything.

389
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,487
This is her first letter to me.

390
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,856
MR. ICHIRO OGAWA

391
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,191
And this is my reply.

392
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,161
MS. YURI SHIRAI

393
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,663
This is us in Kamakura,
where we had our first date.

394
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,966
And here's the charm we bought there.

395
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,305
This is us at Expo'70.

396
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,073
And our ticket.

397
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,679
This is Junko's first visit to a shrine.

398
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,283
This is Junko's umbilical cord.

399
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,388
This is her baby teeth.

400
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,128
So you keep all your keepsakes
in that bag.

401
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,963
Yeah, I carry it with me.

402
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,832
Oh, do you want to watch a video?

403
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,802
It's of Junko dancing to Pink Lady.
Where's your VCR?

404
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,937
I don't have one.

405
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,039
What? You don't have one yet?

406
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,407
Yet? It's more like…

407
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,210
I can watch whatever I want
at any time with my subs.

408
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,111
Su… sub…

409
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,213
Whatever.

410
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,183
You keep saying things I don't understand.
I can't keep up at all.

411
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,854
I want to return to the Showa era
and watch <i>Tonight</i>.

412
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,426
So it's just been you and your daughter
for a while now?

413
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,028
That's the promise I made to my wife.

414
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,965
I'll make sure
she doesn't get involved with bad guys

415
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,466
until she finishes high school.

416
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,669
She's a bit wanton, but she's not stupid.

417
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,708
My mom asked me to stay with him
until I graduate from high school.

418
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,478
And without me, my dad would be
weeping all alone anyway.

419
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,513
You never know,

420
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,783
maybe he's contemplating remarriage.

421
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,819
My dad?

422
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,488
No way. That's impossible.

423
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,993
Not when he's still watching videos
like this at the age of 50.

424
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,761
That farting geezer.

425
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,296
He never stops, you know.

426
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,566
He wakes up with a fart
and comes walking here farting,

427
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,767
like "Pfft, pfft, pfft."

428
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,671
That geezer is late today.

429
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,043
Junko.

430
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,083
Listen.

431
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,319
Kiyoshi, come here.

432
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,792
What's with this serious mood?

433
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,629
Did he die? Is he dead?

434
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,866
Junko.

435
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,769
Listen to me calmly.

436
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:55,180
No way. How did he die?
Was it heart failure?

437
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,215
Will I inherit?
I'll get everything, right?

438
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,116
He's alive.

439
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,554
But he's not in this world.

440
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,159
So he's dead, then!

441
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,694
-He's not.
-What?

442
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,063
He's alive and well in another world.

443
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,866
So he's unable to pass on.
Is he a lingering ghost?

444
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,601
Is that why you look so serious?

445
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,403
I was born with this look.

446
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,938
Aiko Gibo?

447
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,373
Are you Aiko Gibo?

448
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,041
I'm not Aiko Gibo!

449
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,579
I never imagined there would come a day
when I'd yell, "I'm not Aiko Gibo!"

450
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,752
Put simply,
your father is now in the future.

451
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,357
Do you understand?
He traveled through time.

452
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,095
We came from the future.

453
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,466
We came from 2024,
so that's 38 years from now.

454
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,737
Professor Masakazu Inoue
of the Metropolis Institute of Technology

455
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:56,508
and his research team collaborated
with NASA to invent the time machine.

456
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,144
He renovated a Showa-era route bus.

457
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,213
This guy. He's my dad.

458
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,381
He's an inventor.

459
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,817
Several trial runs
were privately conducted,

460
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,388
and as his family members,
we were given priority access.

461
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,357
Everyone returned safely,

462
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,427
but Kiyoshi said
he didn't want to go back.

463
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,599
In exchange,
there was some sort of mix-up,

464
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,769
and Mr. Ogawa ended up traveling
to 2024 and is unable to return.

465
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,671
Do you understand?

466
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,574
This thing…

467
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,245
is a TV?

468
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,882
It's so thin!

469
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,585
True. It's strange, isn't it?
But what's more strange is…

470
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,523
You can even turn the page.
This is so cool!

471
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,557
You can even zoom in.

472
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,925
Kiyoshi!

473
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,995
Look at his nostrils!

474
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,930
You can even see his nose hair.

475
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:58,103
Anyway, until your father returns,
we will live here with you.

476
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,472
We're going to cohabit?

477
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,941
Gosh, it's like something
from <i>Tonda Couple</i>.

478
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,342
You will have separate rooms.

479
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,012
Well then, shall we take a bath?

480
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,480
-Yeah.
-Absolutely not.

481
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,617
Thank you for shopping with us.

482
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,097
<i>I've got nothing to do.</i>

483
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,467
<i>Maybe I'll check out the school.</i>

484
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,479
You little! What's going on
between you and Junko Ogawa?

485
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,015
Junko is my chick.

486
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,985
-So, yeah.
-Say what?

487
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,057
We're cohabiting, so yeah.

488
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,461
Don't act all cocky with us,
you little wimp!

489
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,605
Crap. It's Mutchy's ghost bicycle.

490
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,374
Mutchy, that's me!

491
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,202
Let's scram!

492
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,315
Why did you help me?

493
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,785
After a one-on-one fight,
you become buddies.

494
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,459
A line from <i>Let's Dachiko</i>.

495
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,966
Mutchy, thanks for being cozy with me.

496
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,670
The way you use that word is weird,
so study this.

497
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,574
And the school uniform
is formal wear for a delinquent,

498
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,708
so look sharp in it.

499
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:21,313
All right, come with me.
I'll give you my shortened uniform.

500
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,881
Right.

501
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:31,990
NITORI

502
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,462
<i>"Ni… to… ri"?</i>

503
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,031
<i>To think it'd be turned into Nitori.</i>

504
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,270
<i>What now?</i>

505
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,039
<i>I can't stay in this world forever.</i>

506
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,743
<i>If I board a bus going the other way,</i>

507
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,512
<i>I might be able
to travel back to the past.</i>

508
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,930
<i>I'm concerned about Junko.</i>

509
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,301
<i>But I'm even more concerned about Nagisa.</i>

510
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,603
<i>Junko or Nagisa?</i>

511
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,840
<i>This is so frustrating.
If only there were two of me.</i>

512
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,076
Oh, there are!

513
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,848
Sorry.

514
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,683
Sorry.

515
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,954
<i>Ichiro Ogawa in 1986 is 50.</i>

516
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,492
<i>Ichiro, 38 years later, will be 88!</i>

517
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,195
<i>An 88-year-old me
should be in this world somewhere!</i>

518
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,200
<i>Is it possible?
I'm not sure if I'll even live until 88.</i>

519
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,071
<i>My lungs are probably black,
and my blood pressure is reaching 140.</i>

520
00:27:54,172 --> 00:28:00,845
<i>No, even if I were alive,
what can an 88-year-old man do?</i>

521
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,015
<i>Can he have rumpy-pumpy?
Will he even want to?</i>

522
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,692
NAGISA
MOBILE PHONE

523
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,227
Hello?

524
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,131
<i>Mr. Ogawa, where are you right now?</i>

525
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:26,471
Uh, I think I'm in Shinagawa.
But it's not the Shinagawa I know.

526
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,505
<i>What do you see?</i>

527
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,208
<i>Can you use the map app
on your smartphone?</i>

528
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,811
Map? Let's see.

529
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,649
Can you come over
to EBS TV Station right now?

530
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,252
When I arrived to collect my belongings,
things got a bit messy.

531
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,588
<i>What? Did something happen?</i>

532
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,257
Sorry. Never mind.

533
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,693
Don't be like that.
You called, so tell me.

534
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,430
I don't think there's anything
you can do for me right now.

535
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,065
That's not true!

536
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,469
What you want me to do now
is what I can do for you!

537
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,339
"Ma… ru… e… tsu"?

538
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,309
I see a store with Maruetsu
written in Romaji.

539
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,980
Baby wipes.

540
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,383
Please buy me baby wipes.

541
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,486
Baby wipes, huh? On it.

542
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,960
Please let me pass.

543
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:26,131
If you leave now,
it's going to be tough for us.

544
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,999
What about the new assistants?

545
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,901
They both quit.

546
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,238
They said they didn't
join the company to do tedious jobs

547
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,807
like making copies
and distributing bento boxes.

548
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:40,879
Maybe you're the one
who could use some counseling.

549
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,081
Even the counselor is on leave.

550
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,750
He has had a mental breakdown.

551
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,853
-I see.
-Anyway…

552
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,323
We can talk it out. So please reconsider.

553
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,691
Reconsider!

554
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:57,128
-Reconsider!
-Please let go of me!

555
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,697
Talking won't help.

556
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,902
Ryusuke? How?

557
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,471
I sent you my schedule, didn't I?

558
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,040
I have a quiz show to film on Monday.

559
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,977
Restraining her would infringe
upon Article 22 of the Constitution,

560
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,914
which guarantees the freedom
to choose one's occupation.

561
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,982
I'm aware of that.

562
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,883
Ryusuke…

563
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,121
I know your personality well.
So, I won't stop you from leaving.

564
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,589
I will accept everything.

565
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,562
Do you mean you'll divorce me?

566
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,798
On one condition.
I will have custody of our child.

567
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,535
Because you're not suited for parenting.

568
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,240
Nowadays, childcare
isn't restricted to women.

569
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,943
I've been considering
shifting my focus to online streaming

570
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,511
and moving my operations overseas.

571
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,881
I'm relocating to Sweden, a country
with excellent childcare benefits.

572
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,319
This would be better
for Masato's future as well.

573
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,566
No.

574
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,202
I will raise Masato.

575
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,072
Don't try to carry everything on your own.

576
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,576
Is it wrong to shoulder everything alone?

577
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,581
BABY WIPES

578
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,655
The whole nation is working toward
promoting the Work Style Reform now.

579
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,324
What the hell is a "work style" anyway?

580
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,426
Do you know him?

581
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:39,464
What other work styles exist besides
working like crazy or like a horse?

582
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,834
That takes me back.

583
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,436
How old are you?

584
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,706
I was born in Showa 10.

585
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,377
So I'm 88.

586
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,045
Eighty-eight!

587
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,114
You look young for your age.

588
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,752
<i>I'm a product
Of the Japanese Economic Miracle</i>

589
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,455
<i>I work from morning till night</i>

590
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,159
<i>I work even in my dreams</i>

591
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,296
<i>I felt like I had become an old man</i>

592
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,599
<i>The night I turned 88</i>

593
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,103
We implement shift work to prevent
an overload on specific employees

594
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,072
and prevent unpaid overtime and overwork.

595
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,473
That's the Work Style Reform.

596
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,377
This reform isn't helping her at least.

597
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,546
It's simpler for her
to manage things alone,

598
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,581
which is why
she's doing things on her own.

599
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:38,256
<i>That's her work style</i>

600
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,326
If she works overtime,
her juniors would have to do the same.

601
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,529
No, they should just leave,
saying, "I'm done for the day!"

602
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:51,369
<i>That's their work style</i>

603
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,707
There's this thing called peer pressure.

604
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,876
<i>An atmosphere that makes it hard to say no</i>

605
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,178
<i>That's peer pressure</i>

606
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,413
<i>An atmosphere that makes it hard to leave</i>

607
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,381
<i>That's peer pressure</i>

608
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,384
<i>An atmosphere
That makes it hard to request time off</i>

609
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,019
<i>That's peer pressure</i>

610
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,456
<i>They say it's not mandatory</i>

611
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,225
<i>But the air they exude
Makes it hard to refuse</i>

612
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,159
<i>The air</i>

613
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,695
<i>Let's call it a day, leave work on the dot</i>

614
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,732
<i>Let's quietly take work home</i>

615
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:26,204
<i>Instead of pushing yourself
Until you break down</i>

616
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,341
<i>It's better to leave work on schedule</i>

617
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,880
<i>And lie down</i>

618
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,020
Revolting.

619
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,455
Revolting?

620
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,624
Is it mandatory to leave work on schedule?

621
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,126
What a joke.

622
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,128
Let me choose my own work style, at least!

623
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,964
Your ideas are too extreme.
They don't align with the current times!

624
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,534
Do I have to conform to the times?

625
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,605
You people talk about the Showa era
as if it were all bad,

626
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,641
but at least the economy
was stronger back then compared to now.

627
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,846
I can't argue with that.

628
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,716
But either way, she's going to quit.

629
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,884
I won't quit.

630
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,186
-Really?
-Yes.

631
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,556
I kind of felt upset,

632
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,726
so I decided to quit quitting.

633
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,429
In exchange, Mr. Uryu,

634
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,866
would you allow me to have things my way?

635
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:35,973
Even though having you accommodate me
makes me feel a little bad.

636
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,279
<i>Let me make four requests</i>

637
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,249
<i>Please consider them</i>

638
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,718
Was that Naomi Chiaki?

639
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,955
<i>First, I'll do things on my own</i>

640
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,056
<i>On my own</i>

641
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,092
<i>Second, simply give me</i>

642
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,194
<i>A raise</i>

643
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,131
<i>Third, move the daycare room</i>

644
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:04,802
<i>From the annex to the main building</i>

645
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,673
<i>Fourth, don't rush</i>

646
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,343
<i>Going paperless</i>

647
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,014
I hear you, but young people
nowadays grow up using tablets.

648
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,016
And upper management promotes paperless--

649
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,252
But they're out of touch
with the situation.

650
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,689
They still request scripts in paper form
and want visual materials on DVDs,

651
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,925
which only adds to our workload.

652
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,232
<i>Fifth, make sure our lunch break is</i>

653
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,468
<i>At least one hour long</i>

654
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,503
Didn't she say four?

655
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,607
<i>Sixth, implement shifts</i>

656
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,611
<i>After new employees have learned
Their responsibilities</i>

657
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:51,015
<i>Seventh, end the practice
Of TV personalities</i>

658
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,119
<i>Greeting their fellow cast members
In the dressing room</i>

659
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,757
<i>Eighth, don't take away</i>

660
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:04,061
<i>My motivation</i>

661
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,666
Nagisa…

662
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,003
Even if it means working a bit overtime,

663
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,972
take the time to review
your subordinate's project plans.

664
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,645
Without such flexibility,
discretion, or leeway,

665
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,080
you can't create anything interesting.

666
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,452
If you make exceptions like that,
it will result in death from overwork.

667
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,157
Is the point of the Work Style Reform
to diminish your employees' motivation?

668
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:37,528
I'm telling you to give your best effort
within a limited budget and timeframe.

669
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,131
Listen. I said
you could return to the office,

670
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,533
but I didn't tell you
to make something interesting.

671
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,138
You…

672
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,676
…are right, but have no heart.

673
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,612
I handed you divorce papers,

674
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,914
and all you can come up with
is sound arguments?

675
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,383
Are you an AI? Are you HusbandGPT?

676
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,586
If you can't talk calmly,
let's talk another time.

677
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,254
I'm not suited for parenting.

678
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,823
You think I don't know that?

679
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,460
Even so, I have to do it
and I want to do it.

680
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,329
If you think I'm not cut out for it,

681
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,665
do what you want me to do,
not what you can do.

682
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,601
Stop this.

683
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,738
I'm not sure
what type of harassment this is,

684
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,408
but it's my primary source of stress.

685
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,583
He passed gas.

686
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:41,292
He hasn't passed gas at all today.

687
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,862
You farted, Machato!

688
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,631
Thank goodness.

689
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,066
Sorry, that was me.

690
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,936
Give me a break.

691
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,271
Goodness.

692
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,372
-Huh?
-Huh?

693
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,273
He farted!

694
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:59,310
<i>Masato's custody was given to Nagisa
by mutual agreement.</i>

695
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,115
Funny, huh?

696
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,452
<i>I was also faced
with an unexpected opportunity.</i>

697
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,023
Mr. Ogawa, this is our personnel manager.

698
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,725
Let me cut to the chase,

699
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,495
could you work as our company's counselor?

700
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,796
What? Me?

701
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,599
You can't hire someone like me.

702
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,468
Your extreme logic made a fool
of someone wielding sound arguments,

703
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,271
while also providing others
with food for thought.

704
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,739
It was truly impressive.

705
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,174
I only said what I wanted to.

706
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,243
People today are constrained
by common sense.

707
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,079
What we need is extreme arguments
rather than sound ones.

708
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,715
-Someone individualistic like you--
-Okay. I'll do it.

709
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,817
-Are you sure?
-Not for very long, though.

710
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,585
Or my daughter will have rumpy-pumpy.

711
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,120
Kiyoshi!

712
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,222
-What happened to you?
-Huh?

713
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,326
I got Mutchy to make a man out of me.

714
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,828
Please no.

715
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,564
It's the type of appearance
I find least attractive.

716
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,800
Pretty cool.

717
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,135
Thanks.

718
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,339
Well, you can't compete with Ghibli.

719
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:05,009
The core rating remains unchanged
from last week, so walk with confidence.

720
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,845
-Right. Thank you.
-Let's go.

721
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,915
-Speak louder!
-Excuse me.

722
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,789
All these people are mentally weak.

723
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,559
Well then…

724
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,497
JUNKO 1978 PINK LADY

725
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,170
<i>Okay, go!</i>

726
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,558
Good morning.

727
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,459
Morning.

728
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,529
I saw the videos of the overseas location.
They looked amazing.

729
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,797
Oh, yeah?

730
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,333
I got to fly business class,
so I made an extra effort.

731
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,501
Thank you so much.

732
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,302
I'm the one who should thank you.

733
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,336
Are you sure I'm the right fit?

734
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,639
I'll keep saying inappropriate things.

735
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,542
Your disregard for compliance
makes your words hit home.

736
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,712
Especially for us modern-day people
who are immersed in compliance culture.

737
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,616
COMPLIANCE

738
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,684
You're fast!

739
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,053
But I have presbyopia, so I can't read.

740
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,589
If you do this, the text will get bigger.

741
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,090
What?!

742
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,626
I still have so much to learn.

743
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,161
Teach me more, Nagisa.

744
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,230
Can I come over tonight?
I won't do anything.

745
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,032
Stop. That's sexual harassment.

746
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,366
I don't mind if you do.

747
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,908
I'll go buy some cigarettes.

748
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,344
I was just joking.

749
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,479
Of course, you were!

750
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,280
Don't go, Akitsu! Don't read the room!

751
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,915
You'll make things awkward.

752
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,317
He left so quickly.

753
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:39,763
Earlier, why did I call you again?

754
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:45,202
Why? You wanted me
to get baby wipes, didn't you?

755
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,241
You said,

756
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,746
"What you want me to do
is what I can do for you."

757
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,751
It made me happy.

758
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,222
Even though my husband
and the ward office abandoned me,

759
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:10,494
it made me think I still had you.

760
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,431
It encouraged me to keep going.

761
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,035
I, um…

762
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,841
Thank you.

763
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,709
Well…

764
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,820
Where's Masato today?

765
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,425
My father is looking after him,
so it's okay.

766
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,902
Rumpy-pumpy is on, isn't it?

767
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,910
<i>I'm in a pickle. What should I do?</i>

768
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,212
<i>Am I already going to meet her father?</i>

769
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,382
<i>Anyway, I should refrain
from drinking any more.</i>

770
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,451
<i>Wait, am I going to do the deed?</i>

771
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,454
<i>Since when? Since what? Is it okay?</i>

772
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:15,392
Why not? Even I want to enjoy
some romance sometimes.

773
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,327
MOM

774
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,831
<i>What am I calling her for?
What will I say?</i>

775
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,902
<i>Am I going to ask Junko
if I can have rumpy-pumpy?</i>

776
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,804
No signal?

777
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,435
Huh? Where's Mr. Ogawa?

778
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,572
He said he was going
to get some fresh air.

779
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,141
Ow!

780
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,260
"NANTETTATTE IDOL"
KYOKO KOIZUMI

781
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,896
No way.

782
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,301
Are you okay? Are you drunk, Mr. Ogawa?

783
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,471
Huh? What?

784
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,345
What year is it?

785
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,013
Showa 61.

786
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,448
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

787
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,716
What?!

788
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,084
Time to make my rounds!

789
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,686
It's the most extreme show right now.

790
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,587
-What are you doing here?
-Huh?

791
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,589
Please don't.
It will get taken out of context.

792
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,092
An inappropriate remark was made.

793
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,260
