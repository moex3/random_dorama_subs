1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,741
<i>GO TO BED EARLY
OR THERE WILL BE HANKY-PANKY</i>

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,278
<i>Mommy is having hanky-panky</i>

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,316
<i>Daddy is also having hanky-panky</i>

4
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,320
<i>If you don't go to bed early</i>

5
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,222
<i>Your flushed body will go</i>

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,329
<i>Hanky-panky</i>

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>Up we get.</i>

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>Crawling out from under the skirt
of a hanky-panky girl once more</i>

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,308
<i>is me, Zucchi.</i>

10
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,446
<i>Let's begin with the usual segment.</i>

11
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,282
<i>Presented by Ginza Joyaux Couture Maki!</i>

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,619
<i>If your BWH measurements
are guessed correctly…</i>

13
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>-Hanky-panky!</i>
-Oh.

14
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,989
This won't do. I was watching mindlessly.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,690
Don't turn it off. I'm watching.

16
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,460
No. Watching this stupid show
will make you stupid.

17
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,497
-I'm out of the bath.
-Junko!

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,867
Put on some clothes.
You'll make Kiyoshi explode.

19
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:08,768
What?

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>Your flushed body will go</i>

21
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,010
-<i>Hanky-panky!</i>
-I'm back!

22
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,381
Junko! What are you not wearing,
you female gorilla?!

23
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,415
Mr. Ogawa!

24
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,417
Don't you go
<i>Maido Osawagase Shimasu</i> on me.

25
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,785
I'm not Eiji Bando, okay?

26
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,787
You better not have a hard-on.

27
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,955
I don't!

28
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,590
Get up, then.

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,858
Stand up.

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,627
See? You're all ding-a-ling, aren't you?

31
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,797
-The pain in the neck is back.
-Say what?

32
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,932
You want fried udon?

33
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:39,866
Absolutely.

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,001
With a fried egg. Make it half fry.

35
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,270
First, you need to tell Mom you're back.

36
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,940
Why? How?

37
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,541
I've got no clue.

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,077
Damn, I was so close to
having hanky-panky.

39
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,011
What?

40
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,847
Nothing.

41
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,483
I'm back home.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,491
Well, goodnight.

43
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,458
Goodnight.

44
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,269
It made me think I still had you.

45
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,039
It encouraged me to keep going.

46
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,443
Thank you.

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,748
Where has he gone?

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,222
I recorded <i>11 PM</i>
and the professional baseball news.

49
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,960
Oh, right.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,795
I've got to return this to you.

51
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
I don't want it. You can have it.

52
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,100
Are you sure?

53
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,270
It's no fun when no one else has one.

54
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,971
Here you go.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,748
Nice.

56
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,189
It's good.

57
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,396
Anyway, why do I go to the future by bus
but come back through the toilet?

58
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,932
You'll have to ask Inoue about that.

59
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,166
Inoue?

60
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,569
That's my dad. He's an inventor.

61
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,872
What's up with that undercut?
You look like an idiot.

62
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,974
Excuse you, what are you doing?

63
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,443
Did you two have hanky-panky already?

64
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,111
Not yet.

65
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,615
Not yet? You're totally planning to!

66
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,152
Kiyoshi was turned off after seeing this.

67
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,787
Hey! Give me that!

68
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,522
Hey, folks in the neighborhood,

69
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,258
the old pervert is back!

70
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,527
It's not mine, okay? Give it back!

71
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,462
I haven't even watched it yet!

72
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,864
Stop right there, Junko!

73
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,670
It's really feeling like
<i>Maido Osawagase Shimasu</i>.

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,250
PROF. MASAKAZU INOUE
METROPOLIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

75
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,920
My former wife sent me an email

76
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,356
saying that Mr. Ogawa was here.

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,760
Now, I'm working
in the same workplace as he is.

78
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,562
You are?

79
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,598
With Mr. Ogawa? At a TV station?

80
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,068
But he hasn't shown up since he left
without his belongings two days ago.

81
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,238
I've been trying to call him, but…

82
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,210
What's your connection to Mr. Ogawa?

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,646
He's my former teacher.

84
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,749
I was in the baseball club
at Katsushika Ward Junior High School 6.

85
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,552
Boys worldwide were inspired
by <i>Back to the Future </i>

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,889
and dreamed of inventing a time machine.

87
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,491
I was one of them.

88
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,795
No adult took me seriously. Except…

89
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,097
for Mr. Ogawa.

90
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,966
Can a time machine be built?

91
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,167
I believe so.

92
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,636
Work hard, Inoue. You can do it.

93
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,804
Right!

94
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,809
For 38 years, I worked hard
to fulfill my promise to Mr. Ogawa.

95
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,045
Whenever I felt like giving up,

96
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,281
I remembered his spanking with a bat.

97
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,856
Sakae, give it all you've got.

98
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,258
Okay.

99
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,761
-Here goes!
-Do it!

100
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,764
Here goes!

101
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,466
Do it!

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,234
Here goes!

103
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,738
Masa, I can't do this.

104
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,275
Sakae, this is absolutely not violence.

105
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,576
Nor corporal punishment.

106
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,912
As a Katsushika-born
former baseball club member,

107
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,414
compliance means nothing to me.

108
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,515
Now do it!

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,684
Okay!

110
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,488
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry!

111
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:57,990
Again!

112
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,158
Right!

113
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,430
-Again!
-Right!

114
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,232
Again!

115
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,105
I bought a large Showa-era bus
for cheap and put it to use.

116
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,642
Doc's DeLorean had a digital display
for time travel,

117
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,644
letting you pick any destination in time.

118
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,247
But that's just movie fiction.

119
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,082
With our current technology,

120
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,086
we can only travel to and from
predetermined times.

121
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,258
I set the time 38 years ago
because I wanted to meet Mr. Ogawa,

122
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,395
to whom I'm indebted to,
and express my gratitude to him.

123
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,462
Stop.

124
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,731
-It's Mr. Ogawa.
-What?

125
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,732
Hello?

126
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,868
<i>It connected. Hey, Nagisa!</i>

127
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,671
Mr. Ogawa!
It's been so long! This is Inoue.

128
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,841
Huh? Who the hell are you?
Let me speak with Nagisa.

129
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,112
He's the inventor of the time machine.

130
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,915
Oh, is that so?
Why'd you do that for, huh?

131
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,751
Mr. Ogawa, where are you right now?

132
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,688
I'm on the baseball field in Showa 61.

133
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,723
<i>What?!</i>

134
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,660
<i>Anyway, I'll have to take a break
from my counselor job.</i>

135
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,495
I'll tell them so.

136
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,264
-By the way…
-<i>And…</i>

137
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,965
You go first.

138
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:13,966
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

139
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,601
<i>Akitsu,</i>

140
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>keep my belongings safe for me.
They're important.</i>

141
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,739
Got it.

142
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,507
-<i>One more thing…</i>
-By the way…

143
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,608
Go ahead.

144
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,510
<i>You're annoying me.</i>

145
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,345
If you have something to say, say it.

146
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,585
<i>Um, is my son doing well?</i>

147
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,686
Your son?

148
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,024
Right, you're Kiyoshi's father, huh?

149
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,592
Hey, Kiyoshi!

150
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,994
<i>Your dad wants to know how you're doing.</i>

151
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,331
<i>I'm doing good, Dad.</i>

152
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,101
What's with that undercut, huh?

153
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,637
Hey! Who did that to you?

154
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,506
My arms are dead.

155
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,343
-Coach!
-Mr. Ogawa!

156
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,879
Go ahead.

157
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,647
So annoying!

158
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,318
The call dropped.

159
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,724
Why don't you go see him?

160
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,794
Yeah. Isn't that
what the time machine is for?

161
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,763
The thing is,

162
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,399
I can't.

163
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,804
-Together, let us travel through time.
-<i>On the day of the trial run…</i>

164
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,074
<i>I welcomed NASA and government staff
onto the time machine</i>

165
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,510
<i>and took the driver's seat.</i>

166
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,079
-Take care.
-The door's closing.

167
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,350
But my ears went "eeee."

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,721
"Eeee"?

169
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,357
Yeah. "Eeee."

170
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,425
My semicircular canals.

171
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,129
You can't unclog your ears.

172
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,402
No! Stop!

173
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,206
I'm stopping the bus!

174
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,148
<i>I had no choice but to switch
to having the bus self-drive with an AI.</i>

175
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,717
It's pathetic.

176
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,421
I invented the time machine,

177
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,590
and yet I can't board it.

178
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,099
Is that why Sakae went in your stead?

179
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,171
She threatened to divorce me
if I insisted she get on the bus.

180
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,740
Feeling on edge myself,

181
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,209
I told her if she refused to board,
I'd divorce her.

182
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,780
So it was divorce either way.

183
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,617
Kiyoshi chose to be with his mother.

184
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:53,359
My wife is currently conducting research
on gender and harassment during Showa.

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,294
And it seems my son…

186
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,932
got himself a girlfriend.

187
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,636
That's nice.

188
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,073
Mom, I'm going to watch a movie,
so give me some pocket money.

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,474
What movie?

190
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,242
<i>Back to the Future</i>.

191
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,545
Is this your friend?

192
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,014
He's Inoue from the baseball club.

193
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,515
What's your first name again?

194
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,318
It's Masakazu. Nice to meet you.

195
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,623
What a surprise, right?
He shares the same name as Dad.

196
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,758
Please.

197
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,229
-Thanks.
-Let's go. We'll be late for the movie.

198
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,966
I've seen this movie countless times.

199
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,034
-How many times?
-Wait.

200
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,302
Like 18 times.

201
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,236
That's insane.

202
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,338
-It's fun?
-Yeah, it's super fun.

203
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,407
Huh?

204
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,743
A time paradox?

205
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,080
When you alter the past,
it changes the future,

206
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,350
creating a time paradox.

207
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,422
If you prevent Masumi Kuwata
from meeting Maki,

208
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,226
Matt will no longer exist in this world.
Something like that?

209
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,130
I can't say if that example
is appropriate, but…

210
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,132
yes.

211
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,170
What happens to Matt then?
Will he disappear?

212
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,506
When a time paradox occurs…

213
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,480
You feel a tingling.

214
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,484
Not just a tingling.

215
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,788
-It's more like a zap.
-You're a university professor, right?

216
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,857
Even if I were to explain,
you wouldn't get it.

217
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,060
Anyway, it must never happen.

218
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,207
Enough! What time do you think it is?

219
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,777
Junko! I won tickets to <i>Hanky-Panky</i>!

220
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,646
For real?

221
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,282
YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED AS A PARTICIPANT

222
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,584
What's this? A participant?

223
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,755
I'm going to join
Zucchi's <i>Hanky-Panky</i> show.

224
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,623
It's the most extreme show right now.

225
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,692
Someone has a nip slip every week.

226
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,195
Join!

227
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,164
-Junko's not going to have a nip slip.
-Don't get too excited.

228
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,368
What is it?

229
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,171
But minors must be accompanied
by their parents.

230
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,840
My folks can't make it.

231
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,408
Can't your dad come?

232
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,577
What? He can't. No way.

233
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,946
He's annoying, stinky, dirty, and busy.

234
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:27,980
Say what?

235
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,448
Junko's going to be on TV.

236
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,416
TV?

237
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,187
Not on this perverted show.

238
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,222
You've watched it?

239
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,256
I have.

240
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,592
No! I can tell without watching it.

241
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,093
No way. You're not joining.

242
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,796
-Come on.
-What are you doing here?

243
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,098
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry?

244
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,933
-What are you doing here?
-Huh?

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,568
-Was it the toilet?
-The toilet?

246
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,736
You too?

247
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,877
<i>PREMIUM SATURDAY</i>
MR. NORITO YASHIMA

248
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,578
Mr. Yashima is here.

249
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,752
I'll make it on time. Yes.

250
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,055
Right. I understand. Thank you.

251
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,490
-Huh?
-Mr. Kurita.

252
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,225
We're shooting <i>PS</i> today, right?

253
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,895
That's why my phone won't stop ringing.

254
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,164
Oh, it's you. Check this out.

255
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:19,899
Yes, hello?

256
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,869
"Kengo Tsutsumi, juggling romance
with four assistant emcees"?!

257
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,437
Not out loud!

258
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,372
Sorry?

259
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,642
It seems our emcee has been tailed
for over six months.

260
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,911
His only good point
was that he seemed clean.

261
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,213
We kept him around
for his scandal-free record.

262
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,849
And we're about to celebrate
the 300th episode next week!

263
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,951
Where is he now?

264
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,121
We told him to stay in his car for now.

265
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,425
This is an article from <i>Shukan Bunsun</i>,
set to be published on Monday.

266
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,996
Preceding this, the digital version
will be uploaded today at 4 p.m.

267
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,999
Mr. Kurita is reaching out to people

268
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,036
to keep it from being published
until the show concludes.

269
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,305
Is it true, Tsutsumin?

270
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:05,411
If you're innocent, you could
brush it off as a little slipup.

271
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,612
If you're innocent.

272
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,383
You could say you were having
a <i>takoyaki</i> party or playing UNO with them.

273
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,852
If you're innocent, that is.

274
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,289
Look me in the eyes
and answer me, Tsutsumin.

275
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,128
The story…

276
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,697
is true.

277
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,467
Are you serious?

278
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,835
With all four of them?

279
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,738
Why the hell did you do that?

280
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,276
What about these texts
that are painful to even read?

281
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,179
You didn't send these, right?
They're easy to forge, after all.

282
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,981
I sent those texts.

283
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,089
Keep him in the car until the show's over.
Someone watch him.

284
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,058
-What about the four victims?
-They're all over 20.

285
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,461
If they were minors,
we'd be in deep trouble.

286
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,198
We'll drop them from the program,
but who can we find for the emcee?

287
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,700
Panther's Mukai
or Oriental Radio's Fujimori…

288
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,969
They're shooting <i>Brunch</i>.
They won't make it.

289
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:04,904
Um…

290
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,572
You're still around, Nagisa?

291
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,241
The guest for today's
entertainment segment…

292
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,143
It's some guy with glasses.

293
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,745
Mr. Norito Yashima, right?

294
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,048
He wants to promote some dull play of his.
What about him?

295
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,617
How about I ask him?

296
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,220
HOMETOWN TAX GIFTS

297
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,554
Come in.

298
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,223
Excuse me.

299
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,925
No problem.

300
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,594
-You got me the business class seat!
-That's me.

301
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,330
Thanks to you,
the overseas shoot was a huge hit,

302
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,299
and the ratings were amazing.

303
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,834
I got to fly business class
there and back, after all.

304
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,472
Not that I'd cut corners
if I were in economy,

305
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,741
but it boosts your confidence,
that's for sure.

306
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,078
It really improved my voice,
having those business class seats.

307
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,881
-About today…
-Oh, right.

308
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,284
Today, I'm here to promote
my theater performance.

309
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,455
Actually, I have a big favor to ask you.

310
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,823
What is it, Ms. Business?

311
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,326
The thing is, our emcee…

312
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,329
Ken Tsutsumi? What happened to him? Covid?

313
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,565
Not quite, but we need
someone to fill in for him.

314
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
Shall I?

315
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,602
Sure. I'll do it.

316
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,504
You got me those business class seats.

317
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,174
Just let me promote my play,
and we're good.

318
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,376
Thank you so much.

319
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,444
No problem!

320
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,179
-Excuse me.
-Uh-huh!

321
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,017
You won't be the guest…

322
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,652
You want me to emcee, right?

323
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,954
I've got it covered. It's what I do best.

324
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,689
-What?
-He said yes?

325
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,590
Yes.

326
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,227
He quickly agreed while browsing gifts
for hometown tax donations.

327
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,996
I didn't know you two were close.

328
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,365
We're not.
It was only my second time meeting him.

329
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,403
I upgraded his flight to business class
for an overseas shoot the other day.

330
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,739
And it seems he really feels
indebted to me.

331
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,908
So he wants to return the favor, huh?

332
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,212
That sounds promising. Thanks, Nagisa.

333
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,086
You didn't have to tag along.

334
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:05,624
I have a crucial mission to investigate
the culture and customs of Showa

335
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,760
from a feminist standpoint.

336
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,328
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

337
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,332
There's Zucchi! Fukusuke Suzuki.

338
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,735
He may not look it, but he comes
from a line of gynecologists.

339
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,770
I don't remember him.

340
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,305
Was he really around in Showa 61?

341
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,007
Well, his shows are for adults.

342
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,309
In the west, Takajin, in the east, Zucchi.

343
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,579
Hey, Zucchi! I'm a big fan of your show.

344
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,648
-Thank you, Teruyo!
-Subway comedy.

345
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,086
Hey, miss.

346
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,454
Getting enough hanky-panky?

347
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,223
What?

348
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,758
Let's go!

349
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,096
He just groped my butt.

350
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,931
That's Zucchi for you.

351
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,000
What does that mean? Huh?

352
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,269
This is unbelievable!

353
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,336
I'll sue you!

354
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,539
Can I sue him? This is outrageous!

355
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,340
Seriously?

356
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,109
Unbelievable.

357
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,912
Let's start with introductions.

358
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,814
Here are today's participants!

359
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,783
-We're the porn star team!
-We're the porn star team!

360
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,752
-All right!
-What?

361
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,087
Next up is…

362
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,657
-We're the Shinjuku Nichome drag team!
-We're the Shinjuku Nichome drag team!

363
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,393
And lastly…

364
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,532
-We're the peppy high school girl team!
-We're the peppy high school girl team!

365
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,867
-Cute!
-Cute!

366
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,537
After seeing the other teams,
Junko seems decent.

367
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,674
I'm recalling that
Showa-era TV shows were like this.

368
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,008
And the main emcee

369
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,679
is our very own Dr. Zucchi!

370
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,683
Time to make my rounds!

371
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,785
Is he drinking alcohol?

372
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,590
Here's Mr. Norito Yashima.

373
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,592
Hey, this is Yashima!

374
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,295
I was unexpectedly chosen
as the emcee for <i>PS.</i>

375
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,531
I'll give it my all. I'll do my best!

376
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,832
<i>Please don't.</i>

377
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,933
What?

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,303
<i>Whatever you do,
don't try to make a lasting impression.</i>

379
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,340
<i>Just emcee with efficiency and smoothness.</i>

380
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,508
Who is this?

381
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,443
It's rude not to show your face!

382
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,914
I'm Kurita, the producer
and general director of this program.

383
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,618
I realize this is sudden,
but we're on the brink of cancellation.

384
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>Following this live broadcast, a scandal
involving the main emcee will go public.</i>

385
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,561
<i>He was sexually harassing
the assistant emcees.</i>

386
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,933
Whether this show will be canceled
or continued, depends on you, Mr. Yashima.

387
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:29,968
Why?

388
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,875
You must act as if you've been the emcee
not only last week and the week before,

389
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,246
but even for the past year,
without causing an uproar on social media.

390
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,348
That's a hard ask.

391
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,319
If you can avoid becoming online news,
that's a win for you.

392
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,423
I'm so sorry. I know you only wanted
to promote your play.

393
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,593
<i>Can you do this for us?</i>

394
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,264
Interesting. Let's do this.

395
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,567
Are you sure you can do this?

396
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,001
Of course!

397
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,970
In this competitive
entertainment industry,

398
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,739
how did I achieve my current status?

399
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,809
Do you know? Do you guys know?

400
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,078
You don't know? Then, let me tell you!

401
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,480
I nonchalantly slipped in.

402
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,418
I'm the guy who seems like
he's been on TV for ages!

403
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,953
That's me, Norito Yashima!

404
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:22,988
I didn't realize.

405
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,758
I nonchalantly slipped into
a historical drama and a kabuki play.

406
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,994
-He's annoying.
-Mr. Nonchalance!

407
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,429
That's me, Norito Yashima!

408
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:31,930
That's enough.

409
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,467
From year one, I held a midlevel position,
lacking freshness but exuding stability.

410
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,338
-He's letting off steam at work.
-Smoothness and efficiency are my forte!

411
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,110
Are you done?

412
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,511
<i>Yes.</i>

413
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,348
I'll give you a rundown of the program.

414
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,716
No need!

415
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,618
I've been the emcee for over a year now.

416
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,387
He's cool!

417
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,423
I'll give you a rundown of the program.

418
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,192
The opening will go as usual.

419
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,695
Zucchi will crawl out
from under a girl's skirt.

420
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,832
-Boom! Applause, please!
-What?

421
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,467
Next!

422
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,371
Who's up for some hanky-panky
if their BWH is guessed right?

423
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,272
Raise your hand!

424
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,073
Me!

425
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,042
Junko, you idiot! What are you thinking?

426
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,978
Mister, stay quiet, please.

427
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:21,947
Sorry.

428
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:26,551
After that, we'll welcome
the Bulge Troop and Nip Slip Club.

429
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,022
-For a sumo wedgie tournament!
-I can't take it anymore.

430
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,823
Cut the crap already!

431
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,892
Right back at you!

432
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,861
If you'll cause a scene, leave.

433
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,966
As if you usually don't watch
more explicit stuff.

434
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,171
Touché. Damn it.

435
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,642
Twenty seconds till we're live!

436
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,210
There you go.

437
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,378
Thanks.

438
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,848
<i>While we're live, instructions
will be given to the floor director Ujiie.</i>

439
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,584
Fifteen seconds till we're live!

440
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,688
Mr. Yashima, you don't have to be funny.
Just keep it clean.

441
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,723
Online news can twist things
out of context,

442
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,759
so make sure whatever they take out,
they won't find you at fault.

443
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,361
<i>No need to tell me.</i>

444
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,230
<i>I'm the guy
who'll make everything fall into place. </i>

445
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,167
Three, two, one.

446
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,838
<i>TSUTSUMIN'S PREMIUM SATURDAY</i>

447
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,377
<i>Welcome to this week's</i> PS.

<i>I'm your handsome weather anchor,

<i>-Hi, everyone!
-Hi, everyone!</i>

00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,965
<i>So cute!</i>

455
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,468
<i>Some of them couldn't join us today.</i>

456
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,570
<i>Maybe they're tied up
with end-of-term exams.</i>

457
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,273
<i>Today, our focus is on hot pots
and Valentine's Day.</i>

<i>Will you ladies
give chocolates to your friends?</i>

459
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,678
<i>Or to a special someone?</i>

460
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,315
<i>-We're going to exchange chocolates.</i>
-He's so smooth.

461

-It's like he's been the emcee every week.
<i>-Sounds nice!</i>

"What's on the menu?"</i>

465

<i>-PS!
-PS!</i>

466

WHAT'S ON THE MENU?

467
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,868
We're playing the video!

468
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,674
PLEASE GIVE AN APOLOGY
AFTER THE VIDEO

469
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,976
What?

470
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:31,877
<i>Too casual.</i>

471
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,212
<i>Your delivery is too lighthearted.</i>

472
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,116
This is an information program
meant to convey bland information.

473
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,954
Avoid saying "yay" and keep away
from giving flashy, partygoer vibes.

474
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,323
<i>I was not giving partygoer vibes!</i>

475
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,325
Your face is on camera, so put on a smile.

476
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,226
<i>Right.</i>

477
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,396
The gossip goes public in two hours,

<i>If you understand, raise your left hand.</i>

479
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,499
Roger Dodger.

480
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,568
By the way, the way you said

481
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,504
"So cute!" can be seen as
sexual harassment.

482
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,140
-<i>No way!</i>
-Don't stretch it out. Keep it crisp.

483
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,476
Stick to simply saying, "Cute!"

484
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,245
Asking if they have someone special
to give chocolates to is

485
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,081
sexual harassment
for prying into their relationship status.

486
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,817
What else?

487
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,920
You made a suggestive joke from the start,
mentioning <i>Kiritanpo</i>.

488
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,522
<i>It was not suggestive!
Apologize to the people of Akita!</i>

489
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,491
This isn't broadcast in Akita.

490
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,760
You also made disrespectful remarks.

491
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,363
Something about people
not making it due to tests.

492
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,566
Please don't.
It will get taken out of context.

493
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,870
The four seats at the front are empty,
it would've been odd not to address them.

494
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,506
Props team,
place plushies on the empty seats!

495
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,476
Despite all that I said…

496
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,777
What is it?

497
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,480
There's no uproar on social media at all.

498
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,149
That makes me feel conflicted.

499
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,717
"Oh, it's Yashima."

500
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,152
"It's Yashima today."

501
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,256
<i>"Is it Yajima or Yashima?" That's it.</i>

502
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,492
No need to read them to me!
And it's Yashima.

503
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm Inushima as well.

504
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,229
<i>And one more thing.</i>

505
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,800
Yashiman sounds lewd
when you say it, so don't use that name.

506
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,835
That's prejudice!

507
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,104
Tsutsumin is lewder,
which is why I'm here.

508
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,306
<i>You've got 30 seconds
after the video to apologize</i>

509
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,741
<i>before we cut to a commercial.</i>

510
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,646
<i>An inappropriate remark was made.</i>

511
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,314
<i>I sincerely apologize.</i>

512
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,385
<i>Moving on to the hot pot segment,
who's taking the lead on this?</i>

513
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,388
<i>Me! I, Kanon, went to investigate.</i>

514
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,624
<i>Cute!</i>

515
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,994
<i>Kanon, you got a haircut.
The very short hair looks good on you.</i>

516
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,829
<i>So where did you go?</i>

517
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,864
<i>Namegata City in Ibaraki.</i>

518
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,334
<i>Namegata, it's a good place down there.</i>

519
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>Let's check out the hot pots
after the commercial break.</i>

520
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,044
<i>After working overtime…</i>

521
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,346
The commercial break is on now!

522
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,517
GIVE AN APOLOGY AFTER THE COMMERCIAL

523
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,686
What for?

524
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,722
Saying "You got a haircut"
can be seen as sexual harassment.

525
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,957
I had to say it.

526
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,159
She had long hair in the video clip.

527
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,028
Now she has a buzz cut!

528
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,496
I had to address it!

529
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,031
Did you do it for a fresh start?

530
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,198
One more thing.

531
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:12,671
Namegata somehow
comes across as lewd when you say it,

532
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,005
so try not to say it.

533
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,440
It's just the name of a place.

534
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,375
You purposely said "down there" too.

535
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,310
<i>I did not!</i>

536
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,679
Social media is starting to buzz now.

537
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,447
<i>The emcee has changed, after all.</i>

538
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,583
Apologize before you start getting bashed.

539
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,052
You're the only one we can count on.

540
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,754
Fine.

541
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,690
I'll make everything work out in the end.

542
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,392
Give me that.

543
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,295
Go.

544
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,039
I am now one of you.
Give me instructions directly.

545
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,509
Let's get through this together,

546
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,545
until 4 p.m.

547
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,381
Let me promote my play properly, though.

548
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,550
We're coming back in five seconds!

549
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,884
Three!

550
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,829
<i>Mommy is having hanky-panky…</i>

551
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,364
<i>Junko is right.</i>

552
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,633
<i>I'm a huge fan of porn.</i>

553
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,370
<i>I've been following the three porn stars
since their debut.</i>

554
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,541
<i>And the team captain, Ruru Aida,
played the teacher in </i>F*ck to the Teacher<i>!</i>

555
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>I just realized that now!</i>

556
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,948
<i>And I love this show so much I record it
at normal speed, not at triple speed.</i>

557
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,150
<i>But today…</i>

558
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,153
What happens
if your BWH is guessed correctly?

559
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,855
-Hanky-panky!
-Hanky-panky!

560
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,458
<i>I'm more outraged than entertained,
spoiling the fun.</i>

561
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,560
Let's start with Ruru Aida!

562
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,263
<i>Miss High-strung next to me
seems lost in thought.</i>

563
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,534
<i>Kiyoshi made best friends
with my ex-husband.</i>

564
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,606
<i>I'm worried.
But the only thing I can do is to watch.</i>

565
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,309
<i>If I get too involved,
I'll create a time paradox.</i>

566
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,512
<i>What's the matter with Mrs. Compliance?</i>

567
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:04,249
<i>Has her long stay in Showa
messed with her morals?</i>

568
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,287
<i>That means my few days in the future</i>

569
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,923
<i>might have instilled compliance
or something in me.</i>

570
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,393
Here goes Ruru Aida's BWH. From the top…

571
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,196
<i>An inappropriate remark was made.</i>

572
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,864
<i>Shopping by weight!</i>

573
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>If you exceed the weight limit…</i>

574
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,902
<i>-Hanky-panky!
-Hanky-panky!</i>

575
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,770
<i>I'll make a correction and apologize.</i>

576
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,674
<i>Whose bulge is it?
If you can guess by touch…</i>

577
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,209
<i>-Fanky-panky!
-Fanky-panky!</i>

578
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,044
<i>I sincerely apologize.</i>

579
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,148
With a sumo wedgie tournament…

580
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,684
-Hanky-panky!
-Hanky-panky!

581
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,319
<i>I feel torn.</i>

582
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,456
<i>I want to see a nip slip from a porn star.</i>

583
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,325
<i>But as a father,
I'm concerned about Junko.</i>

584
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,527
Junko Ogawa!

585
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,264
Damn it. I can't tolerate this.

586
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,801
-What will you do?
-I'll pull her out and take her home.

587
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,138
So you're never going to watch porn again?

588
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,372
That's…

589
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,974
different.

590
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,275
That's a separate matter.

591
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,210
No, it isn't.

592
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,479
Those girls have parents, too.

593
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,683
You ogle other people's daughters,

594
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,753
but you can't tolerate
someone else eyeing your own.

595
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,291
I'm a man.
Allow me to feel a little aroused.

596
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,927
Of course. We're animals, after all.

597
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,730
Feminism doesn't deny male instincts.

598
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,665
<i>Nokotta</i>!

599
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,302
<i>Nokotta</i>!

600
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,239
I admire those girls.

601
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,306
You do?

602
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,744
They know why they're here
and how to conduct themselves.

603
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,349
They're fulfilling the roles
expected of them with pride.

604
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,488
<i>She's right.</i>

605
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,057
<i>Junko isn't the only daughter here.</i>

606
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,527
<i>Everybody is somebody's daughter.</i>

607
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,595
<i>Even porn stars</i>

608
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,731
<i>and bunny girls.</i>

609
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,267
<i>The drags from Nichome
are also somebody's sons.</i>

610
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,637
<i>Or daughters now.</i>

611
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,174
<i>Everyone is fighting in the same ring.</i>

612
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,643
<i>Everybody is somebody's daughter.</i>

613
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,012
Let's start the next bout.

614
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,313
On your left!

615
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,016
Miss Delinquent Girl!

616
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,585
From Tokyo's Delinquent Stable.

617
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,325
Go! You've got this, Junko!

618
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,497
#<i>PS</i> #YASHIMA_THE_GOAT

619
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,066
-We're coming back in five seconds!
-Amazing.

620
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,570
-Three, two…
-#Yashima_The_Goat is trending.

621
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,771
<i>It's three o'clock.</i>

622
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,673
<i>Up next, we've got the weather report.</i>

623
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,907
<i>Toriumi!</i>

624
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,909
<i>Right.</i>

625
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,880
<i>Today, we have a low-pressure system…</i>

626
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:49,781
Huh?

627
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,883
Is he crying?

628
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,353
Approaching the Kyushu area.

629
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,723
<i>After the weather segment,
please start with an apology.</i>

630
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,326
What now?
What did I say that was inappropriate?

631
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,629
Everything!
You keep making inappropriate remarks.

632
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,564
First, you said, "It's all gooey inside."

633
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,901
What else was I supposed to say
when eating a crab cream croquette?

634
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,070
You also said the noodles were firm!

635
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,840
<i>I had Inaniwa udon noodles.
What would you have said?</i>

636
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,242
And also…

637
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,411
Mr. Kurita, you're being overly sensitive!

638
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,547
At this rate,
he won't be able to say anything!

639
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,916
Yeah, I'm beginning to lose track.

640
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,852
But once I started noticing,
everything started to bother me!

641
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,920
Hey, Camera 4!

642
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,223
Don't pan from a girl's legs to her face!

643
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,627
Focus on her legs or her face,
and keep the camera still!

644
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,262
What is it?

645
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,265
We've been played.

646
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,702
The digital version is already out.

647
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,538
Weren't they going to hold off
until the live broadcast ended?

648
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:51,843
They bumped it up by an hour
and even upped the count to six!

649
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,911
What?

650
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,178
Six affairs?

651
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,918
That's Kanon. She's only 17.

652
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,853
She's still a minor.

653
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,322
We're done for!

654
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,124
Not only that,

655
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,393
he even went for a guy.

656
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,962
RENDEZVOUS WITH WEATHER ANCHOR

657
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,500
<i>When heading out,</i>

658
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,535
<i>take your folding…</i>

659
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,405
That's why he started crying.

660
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,640
<i>Your folding…</i>

661
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:24,943
Mr. Kurita?

662
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,444
<i>Folding umbrella…</i>

663
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,979
I was having a lapse.

664
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,816
Keep Kanon and Toriumi off-screen.

665
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,384
-Cut to commercial now!
-Okay.

666
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,420
-Nagisa, go check on the parking lot!
-Okay.

667
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,121
Mr. Yashima!

668
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,427
<i>I heard everything.</i>

669
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,231
<i>We can't use the video of Kamakura
for the second half because Kanon's in it.</i>

670
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,467
We're all high and dry.

671
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,704
You're all we have, Mr. Yashima.

672
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,272
It's Yashima Hour.

673
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,574
<i>Then, I'll spend an hour
promoting my play.</i>

674
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,909
You can't do that.

675
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,812
You'll have a generous 30 seconds
to promote your play.

676
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,549
You've got a full hour of nothing,
but I'm only given 30 seconds?

677
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,250
That's absolutely ridiculous.

678
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,452
Over here.

679
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,623
Wait. Did I mention I'm good at <i>kendama</i>?
Did my Wikipedia article say that?

680
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,627
No, but Japanese people
love <i>enka</i> ballads and <i>kendama</i>.

681
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,767
Am I going to do this?

682
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,306
Up until now, I've earned a reputation
for making things fall into place on set

683
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,008
and I've actually delivered.

684
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,111
Let's do this!

685
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,380
I can't back out
of this business class seat now.

686
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,914
Come on, Yashima!

687
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:41,452
How can I not?

688
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,122
<i>I missed that.</i>

689
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,057
Come on!

690
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,659
Social media is blowing up.

691
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,961
SIX AFFAIRS?

692
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,396
WHAT A TURN-OFF

693
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,864
DISAPPOINTED

694
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,065
WHERE'S KENGO?

695
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,233
HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE!

696
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,847
Yeah!

697
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,382
I won!

698
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,383
Yes!

699
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,119
That's her second win!

700
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,456
NAGISA

701
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,892
Hello? Hello…

702
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,127
-Did it connect?
-No.

703
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,495
MR. OGAWA

704
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,198
What am I doing?

705
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,702
Calling Mr. Ogawa won't help anything.

706
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,475
<i>Hakkeyoi</i>! <i>Nokotta</i>!

707
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,644
<i>Nokotta</i>!

708
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,779
<i>Nokotta</i>!

709
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,748
NAGISA
UNABLE TO CONNECT

710
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,984
Junko?

711
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,520
Huh? What happened, Junko?

712
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,389
Junko?

713
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,092
Don't touch her.

714
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,726
Stop the camera.

715
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,196
First, let's get the menfolk out of here.

716
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,998
Cover her with a blue sheet.

717
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,834
-I need a female staff here.
-Right.

718
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,869
-Unzip her outfit.
-Right.

719
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,638
-And apply ice to the back of her head.
-Right.

720
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,842
Let her recline on her back.
She's got a concussion.

721
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,244
Um…

722
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,946
We'll help you up.

723
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,514
-I'm fine.
-Get up slowly.

724
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,282
-Junko.
-Junko.

725
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,384
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

726
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,920
-Help her from both sides.
-Right.

727
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,824
Wow. What a gentleman.

728
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,027
Are you okay?

729
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,100
I'm sorry about the accident, mister.

730
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,202
Thanks.

731
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,275
How long do you plan
on pumping your fists?

732
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,818
Dad, look.

733
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,319
They gave me a hustle award.

734
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,155
Oh, that's cool.

735
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,726
What is it? Did something happen?

736
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:07,231
Junko, I need to go.

737
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,201
Okay.

738
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,540
I left my belongings over there and…

739
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,142
You've fallen in love, haven't you?

740
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,611
Why?

741
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,848
It's obvious. How many years
do you think we've lived together?

742
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,952
You've been acting strangely
this whole time.

743
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,023
Pacing in front of the <i>butsudan</i>,
daydreaming on the veranda,

744
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,624
and you've stopped passing gas.

745
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,161
That's because there's Kiyoshi and Sakae.

746
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,830
I don't know what this person is like,

747
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:46,637
but with this person,
you can hold hands and hug.

748
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,807
-And have rumpy-humpy, right?
-Hey!

749
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,845
No matter how deeply you love someone,
once they've passed away,

750
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,416
they're not on the same level
as someone who's alive.

751
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,352
It's disrespectful to compare them.

752
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,992
It'd be rude to both of them.

753
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,696
Junko.

754
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,232
I suppose

755
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,467
it's weird to say that
while dressed like this.

756
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,170
I'll go change.

757
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,772
Junko!

758
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,010
I won't be long.

759
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,945
I promise I'll return.

760
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,985
You better. You're my dad, after all.

761
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,020
Right.

762
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,331
<i>Here goes.</i>

763
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,502
<i>I dropped it! Here we go again.</i>

764
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,040
It's oddly entertaining.

765
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,210
Let me go! Please!

766
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,779
-I have to go.
-Hey!

767
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,952
-Commercial! Cut to commercial!
-Okay!

768
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,800
I genuinely apologize
to everyone for this.

769
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,671
<i>Get out of here!
Do you want to waste all our hard work?</i>

770
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,441
Mr. Kurita, let me offer my apology
in my own words.

771
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,378
Your self-centered excuses aren't
appropriate for a Saturday afternoon.

772
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,913
It's Mr. Yashima's <i>kendama</i>!

773
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,987
Nagisa!

774
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,724
Mr. Ogawa!

775
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,460
I wanted to see you!

776
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,536
That startled me!

777
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,304
Was it static shock?

778
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:01,972
So?

779
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,474
Follow me.

780
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,379
I didn't see it as sexual
or power harassment.

781
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:13,084
I seriously intended to have
an equal relationship with each of them.

782
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,618
But with six people?

783
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,887
As a public figure, that's highly unpro--

784
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,589
I'm Yashima.

785
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,893
-That's highly unprofessional!
-I never two-timed any of them.

786
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,329
I don't believe I wronged them.

787
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,099
I never pressured them to see me either.

788
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,368
What you think doesn't matter.

789
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,739
<i>Who decides what qualifies as harassment?</i>

790
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,610
<i>Even if you mean well</i>

791
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,480
<i>Who decides what qualifies as harassment?</i>

792
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:52,990
<i>There is only a fine line
Between love and harassment</i>

793
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:57,294
If a girl were wearing a short skirt
like this, you'd stare, wouldn't you?

794
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,496
-No!
-No!

795
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,064
-You'd totally stare!
-Yes!

796
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,402
<i>But it's not for you</i>

797
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:08,606
<i>That I'm wearing a mini skirt</i>

798
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,675
May I? Something's been bothering me
this entire time.

799
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,111
<i>You'd totally eye that</i>

800
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,783
<i>It's unnatural not to</i>

801
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,287
<i>Mm-hmm, that's sexy</i>

802
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:27,358
<i>Let us entertain that thought, at least</i>

803
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,429
<i>But it's not for you</i>

804
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,499
<i>That I'm showing my cleavage</i>

805
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,269
<i>That's also harassment</i>

806
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,537
<i>You're overly sensitive</i>

807
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,906
<i>That's harassment</i>

808
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,541
<i>That's why TV is boring</i>

809
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,813
<i>Who decides what qualifies as harassment?</i>

810
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,319
<i>Someone please establish guidelines</i>

811
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,457
Why not try to see them
as if they were your own daughter?

812
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,357
-Who?
-Who?

813
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,370
<i>Porn stars and idols</i>

814
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,440
<i>Ordinary women and old women</i>

815
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:22,346
<i>Think of them all
As if they were your daughters</i>

816
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,821
<i>Don't say things
You wouldn't say to your daughter</i>

817
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,495
<i>Don't do things
You wouldn't do to your daughter</i>

818
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,968
<i>Don't do things
That would distress your daughter</i>

819
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:48,172
<i>Do things that bring her joy</i>

820
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:54,678
<i>That's our guideline</i>

The commercial break is over.
Thirty seconds left!

831
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:52,803
It's all right.

832
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,904
Mr. Yashima…

COMECOME MINIKI-NA, of which I'm a part.

837
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,987
It will be running from
February 1st to 11th at Za-Koenji 1,

838
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,258
and at the Kintetsu Art Museum
on February 17th and 18th.

Please come and see it.

Now, on next week's
300th anniversary episode,

00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,432
<i>we're hosting
a gourmet delivery championship!</i>

842

<i>There's still more time?</i>

843
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,536
<i>Remember, everyone.</i>

844

<i>When flying, always opt for economy class!</i>

<i>Nori and steam…</i>

We've cut to commercial!

00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,012
-That's it for today! Good work!
-Good work!

848
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,647
Good work.

849
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,187
I suppose things worked out in the end.

850
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,725
I might get
a first-class seat for you next time!

851
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,460
Sure.

852
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,933
Nagisa.

853
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,716
Mr. Ogawa,

854
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,721
thank you for coming.

855
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,659
What's the matter?

856
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:49,820
Just as I thought.

857

00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,023
What?

859
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,491
Will you scan the QR code?

860
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,461
I've been waiting ever since
it was marked as read. So why?

861
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,796
You have a smartphone addiction.

862
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,431
You have second-grade syndrome!

863
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,365
Stupid girl.

864
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,067
Akitsu, is your mother…

865
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,501
Damn it.

866
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,604
Are Mr. Ogawa and I
not allowed to be together?
