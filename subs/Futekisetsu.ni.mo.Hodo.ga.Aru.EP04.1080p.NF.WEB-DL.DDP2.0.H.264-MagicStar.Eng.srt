1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,039
What?

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,548
Just as I thought.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,486
When you alter the past,
it changes the future,

4
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,655
<i>creating a time paradox.</i>

5
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,392
What is it?

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,559
What's the matter?

7
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,970
Do you want me to touch you, Nagisa?

8
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,842
When a time paradox occurs…

9
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,211
You feel a tingling.

10
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,013
It really is, isn't it?

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,148
It has to be.

12
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,321
Are you sure?

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,393
A time paradox.

14
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,097
What do you want?

15
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,432
A time paradox.

16
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,651
What are these two doing?

17
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,453
Good question.

18
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,398
ICHIRO OGAWA
DRIVER'S LICENSE, VALID UNTIL SHOWA 64

19
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,037
Thank you for your patience.
My name is Wakai.

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,339
-I will guide you through the process.
-Right.

21
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,676
Were you okay with the standard plan?

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,811
"Were"?

23
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,048
Did you prefer the unlimited calls
and data bargain plan?

24
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,317
Calls? Data?

25
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,551
"Did"?

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,154
If you get hung up on her grammar,
we can't move forward.

27
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,388
Why the past tense?

28
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,923
Hey!

29
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,825
Is it because I'm from the past?

30
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,696
Are Mr. Ogawa and I
not allowed to be together?

31
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,566
Mr. Ogawa is my junior high school
homeroom teacher.

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,201
I mean, he was born in Showa 10.

33
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,973
He'd be 88 now,
since he's the same age as me.

34
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,808
Here you go.

35
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,775
Enjoy.

36
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,110
Thank you.

37
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,846
What's with Wakai?!

38
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,282
Treating me like an old man,
when she's not young either!

39
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,085
We couldn't change ownership
without parental permission.

40
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,353
Mr. Ogawa!

41
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,121
Huh? Who the hell are you?

42
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,089
It's Inoue!

43
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,525
Student number 2, Class B,
Grade 2 at School 6.

44
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,026
I'm Masakazu Inoue!

45
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,363
It's been so long, Mr. Ogawa!

46
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,633
-Yeah, yeah.
-I've been wanting to see you!

47
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,834
Sure.

48
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,570
It takes me back.

49
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,539
You haven't changed at all.

50
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,009
I'm so glad I got to see you!

51
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,146
You don't seem excited.

52
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,614
I mean, it's revolting.

53
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,416
Even if you think so, don't say it.

54
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,918
Have you forgotten

55
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,153
the promise we made 38 years ago?

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,321
Look.

57
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:09,789
<i>Hey, four-eyes.</i>

58
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,658
Can a time machine be built?

59
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,992
Yes.

60
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:13,927
Remember?

61
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,763
Oh, right.

62
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,164
At the essay presentation.

63
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,599
I suppose it happened.

64
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,900
You suppose?

65
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,671
I believed your words,
that's why I spent 38 years--

66
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,005
It's hard to grasp, okay?

67
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,374
For me, it was just a few weeks ago.

68
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,376
It's not like
"You haven't changed at all!"

69
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,513
For me, you've changed
so much, it's scary.

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,714
What's with that haircut?

71
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,249
You look like a convict.

72
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,819
I kept this haircut for 38 years
so you'd recognize me instantly.

73
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,589
Typical of you to do that, Inoue.

74
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,724
And I'm the one
who's traveled through time.

75
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,559
Damn it!

76
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,661
I've wasted 38 years of my life!

77
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,966
Oh, this smartphone.

78
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,834
It's your son's, right?

79
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,537
Right!

80
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,038
Inoue, come with us.

81
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,640
-Come on!
-O-Okay…

82
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,881
So you want to transfer ownership
of the smartphone

83
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,350
from Mr. Masakazu Inoue's son

84
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,819
to Mr. Akitsu, and this grandfather…

85
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm not a grandfather.

86
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,921
Pardon me.

87
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,590
So, Mr. Ichiro Ogawa
will be using this phone.

88
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,459
You got that right.

89
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,060
I will handle the process now.

90
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,695
-Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

91
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,998
Inoue, brighten the screen.

92
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,767
You hold down this button.

93
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,406
So, the other side of this wall…

94
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,641
is Showa?

95
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,411
You were covering the hole
with a poster, right?

96
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,548
I don't remember.

97
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,084
You were! Pull yourself together, old man!

98
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,154
The other side had Kyon Kyon's
"Nagisa no Haikara Ningyo" poster

99
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,224
and this side had
her 40th anniversary poster.

100
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,559
He fell from the ceiling the second time.

101
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,196
Ow!

102
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,565
What year is it?

103
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,767
Showa 61.

104
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,069
Now that you mention it,

105
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,171
something like that

106
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,407
might have happened.

107
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,808
This is a time paradox.

108
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,779
Since you altered the barkeep's past,
his memory has also changed.

109
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,116
Well, he didn't remember much
to begin with.

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,154
Anyway, why do I go to the future by bus
but come back through the toilet?

111
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,622
That's because…

112
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,759
I don't know.

113
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,894
You don't know?

114
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,429
Let's go.

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,532
It's still a work in progress!

116
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,867
And you said you go to the future by bus,

117
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,404
but the way I invented it,
you travel from the present to the past.

118
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,040
You just happened to hop on
the return bus.

119
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,208
Hey, Nagisacchi.

120
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,477
Will you add me as a friend
and connect with me?

121
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,279
Will you scan the QR code?

122
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,380
Right.

123
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,550
-Here.
-Okay.

124
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,617
There.

125
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
There.

126
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,856
That's me.

127
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,292
Tap the round photo
to go to the registration screen.

128
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,393
You sure know a lot.

129
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,228
My company made this app.

130
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,064
The two of you made contact
in the elevator.

131
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,034
-It works!
-Then, you felt a zapping. That means…

132
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,205
NAGISACCHI,
YOU'RE LOOKING CUTE

133
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,875
It's marked as read!

134
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,811
That means you were about to cross a line
you shouldn't cross!

135
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,648
What about this?

136
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,083
LET'S GO EAT GRILLED MEAT?

137
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,984
READ

138
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,185
It's marked as read!

139
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,520
Can't you do that later?

140
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,109
Toson Shimazaki
intentionally wrote it this way

141
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,680
to express the moment of falling in love.

142
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,018
The feeling of meeting a beautiful girl.

143
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,953
Do you understand?

144
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,225
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SHIZUKA?

145
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,627
Huh?

146
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,130
And this "pale crimson fall fruit" is…

147
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,905
What does the apple represent?

148
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,006
Who knows the answer?

149
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,240
Me!

150
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,376
LIKE=YES DISLIKE=NO
CIRCLE ONE!

151
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,477
Huh?

152
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,145
Huh?

153
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,214
What?!

154
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,783
Sakisaka, be quiet!

155
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,586
Sorry.

156
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,423
All right, anyone else?

157
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,558
Me!

158
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,762
I think the sweet and sour taste of apples
resembles the image of first love.

159
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,696
That's right.

160
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,031
DID YOU WATCH <i>YORU HIT</i> LAST NIGHT?

161
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,934
He mentioned the apple's flavor.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,368
<i>"Yoru Hit"</i>?

163
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,004
It hinted at the taste of first love.

164
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:57,076
It's rhetoric that expresses
the author's feelings.

165
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,446
And there's another keyword.

166
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,983
YELL WAAH! AT NOON SHARP

167
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,651
This is…

168
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,587
not yet…

169
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,591
This started…

170
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,359
You startled me!

171
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,196
You little punks!

172
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,866
What the hell?

173
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,602
You weren't listening at all, were you?

174
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,939
What's so fun about being with girls?

175
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,641
They're fun.

176
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,745
They comment on your Stories
and sometimes send you DMs.

177
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,882
Sorry.

178
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,283
I guess you wouldn't know.

179
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,322
"Kiyoshi, it looks like
you're Shizuka's type."

180
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,191
"If you're single, answer yes."

181
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,325
"If not, answer no."

182
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,295
"If baseball is your love, answer Bass."

183
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,467
You only have three options:
yes, no, and Bass!

184
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,603
Girls are so stupid.

185
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,641
And yet, you're reading a shojo manga.

186
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:07,346
I understand Gilbert so well it hurts.

187
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,981
<i>THE SONG OF WIND AND TREES</i>

188
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,917
What? <i>The Song of Wind and Trees</i>

189
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,119
is a BL manga classic.

190
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,687
What's BL?

191
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,489
A bacon and lettuce manga?

192
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,158
He said he could only love men.

193
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,059
Huh?

194
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,827
Wait a minute. Inoue said that?

195
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,696
I know PL, though.

196
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,331
It's where Kiyohara and Kuwata…

197
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,099
BL stands for Boys' Love.

198
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,001
Kuwata and Kiyohara?

199
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,670
Junko, it's only eight.

200
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,606
Go for a ride on someone's bike.
You're a hussy, aren't you?

201
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,074
That's a rude way to shoo me out.

202
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,776
Sorry.

203
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,544
This is your home, isn't it?

204
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,612
And?

205
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,948
He went on to confess his love.

206
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,282
To you?

207
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,352
Kiyoshi, I'm in love with you!

208
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,754
Since I met you,
you've never felt like a stranger.

209
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,024
Answer me with yes, no, or Bass!

210
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,859
No, he's just confused.

211
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,128
He only said that
because girls aren't into him.

212
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,364
How do you know that?

213
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,632
True.

214
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,934
Why are you getting
so worked up about Inoue?

215
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,536
<i>Why?</i>

216
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,907
<i>Because he's my future husband
and the father of Kiyoshi.</i>

217
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>Inoue is right about Kiyoshi
not feeling like a stranger.</i>

218
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,478
Anyway, your answer should be no.

219
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,180
We're a thing, aren't we?

220
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,215
How would I know?

221
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,150
You don't let me see your boobs.

222
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,419
And you told Mutchy you weren't dating me.

223
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,320
And?

224
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,124
I decided to date him for a bit.

225
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,525
-What?
-What?

226
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,426
You two-timer!

227
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,462
-Be quiet!
-Two-timer!

228
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,596
Do you even understand?

229
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,032
LGBTQ, right?

230
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,101
There was a gay kid
in my previous junior high as well.

231
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,802
I see.

232
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,337
I didn't know.

233
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,273
He said he had a crush on me,
so we dated for a bit.

234
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,377
We only held hands
as we walked home, though.

235
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,345
No way!

236
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,780
Gross!

237
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,149
What's with your reaction?

238
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,185
You always say it's not right
to discriminate based on sexuality.

239
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,354
You're right.

240
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,956
It's not right to discriminate.

241
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,592
Diverse sexuality
should be equally recognized.

242
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,597
I don't even know if I really like girls.

243
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,631
Ugh!

244
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,433
I can't believe you!

245
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,101
I mean, I like boobs!

246
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,638
But maybe that's all I like.

247
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,707
That's not how it works.

248
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,642
Anyway, that's not the issue.

249
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,045
<i>It's about time you realized, my son!</i>

250
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,481
<i>His name, his buzz cut,
his obsession with time machines,</i>

251
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,083
<i>are all clear indicators!</i>

252
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,317
And?

253
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,054
We went along with the flow
and decided to try kissing.

254
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,188
What kind of flow is that?

255
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,589
You're the worst!

256
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,091
You haven't even kissed me yet!

257
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:32,992
You jerk!

258
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,407
<i>A time paradox!</i>

259
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,077
That's when I realized.

260
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,947
I actually really like boobs!

261
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,216
<i>No, Kiyoshi, that's not it.</i>

262
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,351
No, I mean,

263
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,586
I really like you, Junko!

264
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,121
Are you kidding me?

265
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,823
So you only like me for my boobs?

266
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,191
Screw you!

267
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,926
Junko, calm down!

268
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,296
Hello?

269
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,031
Inoue?

270
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,233
Quit putting weird thoughts
into Kiyoshi's head!

271
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,267
Move.

272
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,037
Inoue, listen to me carefully.

273
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,973
You look down on girls
because you're not popular with them.

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,041
That's misogyny.

275
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,076
You've always had this tendency.

276
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,812
There's always been
a misogynistic aspect to you.

277
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,648
It's always guys like you
who mistake homosocial relationships

278
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,218
as homosexual
and seek solace in homosexuality.

279
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,486
That's where you are now!

280
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,355
Do you see? You're going after guys
because girls aren't into you!

281
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,857
You have second-grade syndrome!

282
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,694
<i>Unless you let go of the notion that girls
are to blame for your lack of popularity,</i>

283
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,829
<i>you'll stay unchanged and unpopular.
Got that?</i>

284
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:44,830
<i>Just because girls--</i>

285
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,402
Second-grade syndrome?

286
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,872
I'll be in third grade this spring!

287
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,142
Oops, I sent it.

288
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,811
Mr. Ogawa.

289
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,513
Mr. Ogawa.

290
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,550
This is my colleague and a drama producer.

291
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,818
I'm Sekine.

292
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,419
Right. What's the matter?

293
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,489
We've got a complaint about the title
of a drama starting in April.

294
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,258
This teen drama, <i>Cheerleading Boys</i>,

295
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,361
follows students from a boys' school
as they attempt cheerleading.

296
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,630
But we received a comment
stating the term "boys"

297
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,133
is homosocial, making girls feel excluded.

298
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,335
Who wrote this? A homo?

299
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,470
Huh?

300
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,340
There you go again.

301
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,109
You're as sharp as ever, Mr. Ogawa.

302
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,745
You find it funny
when guys spread their legs

303
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
and prance around like girls, right?

304
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,714
Own it.

305
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,484
When we make one's sex the primary focus,

306
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,821
we tend to receive complaints
saying it goes against gender equality.

307
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,721
From who?

308
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,056
From "Gender"?

309
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,393
There's no one by the name of gender.

310
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,929
Then, what about
Kensaku Morita's <i>I'm a Man!</i>?

311
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,231
That won't do. It's out of the question.

312
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,732
What about <i>The Woman of S.R.I.</i>?

313
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,603
If Ms. Yasuko Sawaguchi has reservations
about it, then it's a no.

314
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,338
What about <i>Seven Men and Women,
Summer Story</i>?

315
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,339
That's fine, right?

316
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,741
But it says men and women.

317
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,677
<i>Seven Humans, Summer Story</i>, then?

318
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,413
Yes. It sounds boring, though.

319
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,950
Basically, titles like
<i>Cheerleading Boys and Girls </i>

320
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,619
or <i>Human Cheerleaders</i>
won't make anyone feel excluded.

321
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,554
Oh, please. That's just weird.

322
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,024
And Marketing wants a title
that can be shortened to four characters.

323
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,159
Huh?

324
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,827
It makes hashtag searches easier.

325
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,162
H-hash?

326
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,732
For instance, <i>An Incurable Case of Love</i>
could be shortened to <i>ICOL</i>.

327
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,902
It's similar to how
<i>Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen TV</i>

328
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,270
is shortened to <i>KCKC</i>.

329
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,538
Sorry, I'm taking a break.

330
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,439
OUT OF OFFICE

331
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,141
Give him my chat ID, will you?

332
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,744
I'll reach out once I've come up
with a good title.

333
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,516
Wakai, can I have a moment?

334
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,786
I'm sorry, please issue a numbered ticket.

335
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,787
I have to?

336
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,456
Even though we know each other?

337
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,390
Coming through.

338
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,725
TICKET 1

339
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,059
Ticket number 1…

340
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,094
Me!

341
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,398
Wakai, what's a hashtag?

342
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,568
It's the # symbol placed
in front of a word you want to search.

343
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,337
This one that looks like
the first character in "well"?

344
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
I see. Thanks, Wakai.

345
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,342
Waka-hashtag.

346
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,477
WAKAI

347
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,247
Ticket number 2, please.

348
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,985
There are transitive
and intransitive verbs.

349
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,257
Transitive verbs are those

350
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,027
that require an object…

351
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,729
MEET ME AT SCANDAL AFTER SCHOOL

352
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:36,635
Like "know" and "see."
These are transitive verbs.

353
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,009
Here you go.

354
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,711
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

355
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,684
Since then, I've been pondering it
this whole time,

356
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,420
but nothing is coming to mind.

357
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,723
Do you have family, Ms. Inushima?

358
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,159
I've divorced my husband

359
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,562
and am now living
with my 18-month-old son and my father.

360
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,799
Mr. Ogawa also lost his wife early on

361
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,500
and became a single father.

362
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,235
Are you seeing him lately?

363
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,072
I'm trying not to see him.

364
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,844
He seems to interpret the zapping
as a sign we're meant for each other

365
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,747
and is texting me nonstop.

366
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,251
Hello?

367
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,487
Kiyoshi?

368
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,521
No, not yet.

369
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,024
I wonder if he's forgotten.

370
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,995
He asked me to help him buy
a reference book after school.

371
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,364
Yeah.

372
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,667
I'll wait a little longer.

373
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,236
Sorry. If he calls, I'll let him know.

374
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,747
Mr. Ogawa.

375
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,649
Mr. Ogawa?

376
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,353
Nagisacchi!

377
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,888
Did you see what I sent you?

378
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,923
A photo of a naughty-looking cloud!

379
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,558
This is <i>Premium Saturday</i>'s…

380
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,493
I'm Kurita.

381
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,395
Thank you for your help
during the Yashima incident.

382
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,797
Want to add me as a friend already?

383
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,366
I'll invite you
to the program's group chat.

384
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,401
I'm not sure if…

385
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,502
Yay!

386
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,736
So? What is it?

387
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,508
We're collecting oldie songs
from our dads' era for a feature,

388
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,078
but all the lyrics are problematic
in terms of compliance.

389
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,212
What?

390
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,048
"HOTEL"
YUTAKA SHIMAZU

391
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,499
Okay, stop.

392
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,769
Let him get to the hotel part, at least.

393
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,639
No letters or calls allowed?
That's moral harassment.

394
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,074
Not cool. So not cool.

395
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,408
You too, Wakai?

396
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,579
In the second verse, the woman visits
her affair partner's house on a Sunday.

397
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,016
It's about an affair between
a harassing man and a stalking girl.

398
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,150
Not cool.

399
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,752
"CASABLANCA DANDY"
KENJI SAWADA

400
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,069
Okay, stop.

401
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,405
It's not just power harassment, it's DV!

402
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,406
Not cool.

403
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,476
I cringed singing it myself.

404
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,745
Many songs by men tend to belittle women.

405
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,915
How about a song
from a female perspective?

406
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,219
Who ordered the <i>Napolitan</i> dish?

407
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,720
That would be me.

408
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,592
Kiyoshi, are you together with Junko?

409
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,193
They're cohabiting.

410
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,194
Hey!

411
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,031
We're living together
due to family circumstances.

412
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,101
I bet she walks around
in a towel after a bath,

413
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,637
and it excites you, doesn't it?

414
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,038
I'm not interested.

415
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,674
You're getting red!

416
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,909
I am not!

417
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,811
You totally are!

418
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,845
Where?

419
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,480
Your nose.

420
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,849
My nose? No way.

421
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,786
I just like the color red.

422
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,850
I'll turn toward you!

423
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,086
If you said that to me, I'd turn twice
and end up where I started.

424
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,826
What's the matter, Team White?

425
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,764
Isn't it kind of intense?

426
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,932
Agreed.

427
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,568
Most songs from Team Red are intense.

428
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,804
We need to reconsider
the red-and-white format as well.

429
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,239
Huh? Why?

430
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,473
For diversity.

431
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,142
It's an era of gender neutrality.

432
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,277
Some people don't identify
with red or white.

433
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,213
There's that word again, "gender."

434
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,450
We're fans of Kyon Kyon
because we love her.

435
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,220
Not because she's a woman.

436
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,489
If not by sex, do we use income levels
to divide the performers?

437
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,225
<i>Rich vs. Poor Song Battle</i>?

438
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,328
How about Jomon vs. Yayoi people?

439
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,097
Did you know?
Wet earwax indicates Jomon ancestry,

440
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,799
while dry indicates Yayoi ancestry.

441
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,834
I'd hate a song battle like that.

442
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,737
Hey, how about
something more lighthearted?

443
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,572
Nagisacchi, sing an Onyanko song.

444
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,904
Outrageous!

445
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,307
Akimoto sure has a screw loose!

446
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,509
I don't even feel like
mentioning compliance.

447
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,011
I've had enough. I'm leaving.

448
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,913
What's more, Akimoto is
still churning out hits.

449
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,015
He is?!

450
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,182
He'll go to hell!

451
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,084
"HIGHTEEN BOOGIE"
MASAHIKO KONDO

452
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,619
I'm taking this one.

453
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,121
It's my dad's favorite.

454
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,771
What's the matter, Junko?

455
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,939
Nothing.

456
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,376
I just wanted to get a ride
on someone's bike.

457
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,613
Stupid girl.

458
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,462
Why'd you do that?

459
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,197
Hey, you mantis!

460
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,634
Tell me your dad's name.

461
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,835
My dad?

462
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,338
It's Mutsumi.

463
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,939
Mutsumi Akitsu.

464
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,040
I knew it.

465
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,109
It's Mutchy!

466
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,079
Akitsu, you're Mutchy's son, aren't you?

467
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,681
You know his father?

468
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,882
Do I know him?

469
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,553
He's a biker gang member in Katsushika
who's seducing my daughter!

470
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,454
For real?

471
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,722
I remember him!

472
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,257
His family owned a dumpling shop.

473
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,793
He adored Matchy
and insisted on being called Mutchy.

474
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,796
Otherwise, he'd threaten us with a belt.
He's legendary.

475
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,633
That's so lame of him.

476
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,503
By the way, my name

477
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,205
is Masahiko.

478
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,941
That means…

479
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,176
Akitsu,

480
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,212
is your mother…

481
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,381
No, don't tell me!

482
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,082
You bastard!

483
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:08,253
If you dare mention Junko's name,

484
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,888
I will stab you to death!

485
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,524
A muddler won't work.

486
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,730
I've got a counseling meeting!

487
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,366
I'll share my mom's name
in the group chat.

488
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,467
Don't you dare!

489
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,669
You can't share something
so important via chat!

490
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,105
Junko?

491
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,244
I'm back.

492
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,311
Welcome back.

493
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,880
It's suddenly raining.

494
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,515
Huh?

495
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,883
Aren't you with Junko?

496
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,652
You wanted to buy a reference book, right?

497
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,157
You silly! Did you forget?

498
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,278
Want to come over?

499
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,513
I'll lend you dry clothes.

500
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,860
What?

501
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,261
Not you again.

502
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,632
This is Katie Ikeda,
an intimacy coordinator.

503
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,301
Huh? What the hell is that?

504
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,805
Sorry. I'm just so busy.

505
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,973
Take a seat.

506
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,443
If there's anything I don't know,
I Google it.

507
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,879
Interior cootie-nator?

508
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:46,852
Say that again.

509
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,993
"Specializes in choreographing
intimate scenes, including sex scenes."

510
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,296
I wouldn't have guessed.

511
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,031
You're a bit of a pervert, huh?

512
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,267
Sorry. He means no offense.

513
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,403
Her role is to align the director's vision

514
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,208
with the comfort level of the actors
in advance to prevent any problems.

515
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,345
Why can't they discuss it directly
between themselves?

516
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,581
Japanese people struggle
with discussing sexual topics openly.

517
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,518
It's hanky-panky. Just stick to the usual.

518
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:25,857
This sort of male-oriented mindset
has hurt many women in the past.

519
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,593
Sorry.

520
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,230
They decided the title will be
<i>That Day's Dazzling You</i>.

521
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,066
It's completely different
from <i>Cheerleading Boys</i>.

522
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,069
-<i>TDDY</i> is a romantic drama and…
-You've already shortened it.

523
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,907
There's a bit of an intimate scene
in the fourth episode.

524
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,174
What?

525
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,812
THE WAY OF MATCHY

526
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,115
Sit wherever you like.

527
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,050
All right.

528
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,752
Thanks.

529
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,059
Get changed or you'll catch a cold.

530
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,532
I don't know what happened.

531
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,834
-But don't make your dad worry.
-He's gone.

532
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,604
Gone?

533
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,272
Where did he go?

534
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,908
No idea.

535
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,280
What about Kiyoshi?

536
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,348
No idea.

537
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,419
Nobody cares.

538
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,188
Not about me.

539
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,096
Nobody worries about me.

540
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,300
Everyone thinks I'm fine
because I can take care of myself.

541
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,204
Give me a break.

542
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,108
I'm not doing all that because I want to.

543
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,646
I wish I could say
"I don't want to touch fish."

544
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,648
Or "I can't open a jar."

545
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,818
But if I did, I wouldn't be able to cook.

546
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,953
So I've been putting up with it
all this time.

547
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,189
But…

548
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,561
Kiyoshi's mother came
and took over all the chores.

549
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,764
Then everyone started doing
their own thing.

550
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,800
My dad went off somewhere.

551
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,269
Even Kiyoshi left.

552
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,040
He claimed to like me, but…

553
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,744
he's dating other girls and guys.

554
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,781
It's ticking me off.

555
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,983
Nobody pays me any attention.

556
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,321
It's always going to be like that.

557
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,491
I'm going to be an old maid

558
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,527
without anyone paying attention to me.

559
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,134
Mutchy?

560
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,879
Why are you naked?

561
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,214
I don't know.

562
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,083
But

563
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,552
I care about you.

564
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,355
So I won't leave you.

565
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,424
I only have eyes for you.

566
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,127
I'll protect you with my life.

567
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,364
I wanted to express

568
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,333
this passionate feeling.

569
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,369
That's why I'm naked.

570
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,441
Thanks.

571
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,680
Want me to wear something?

572
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,614
Whichever.

573
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,191
Come here, Junko.

574
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,439
<i>Cut!</i>

575
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,209
Her cleavage! Her cleavage showed!

576
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,310
Intimacy!

577
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,712
At the audition,
he said he'd let her do anything,

578
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,782
but now he's saying she has
a pure and innocent image to maintain.

579
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,185
Her cleavage can never be shown on camera.

580
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,121
-I'm counting on you, Intimacy.
-Right.

581
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,189
Only her collarbone and above

582
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,758
and her ankles below.

583
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,059
We can hardly show anything.

584
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,394
How about we have her wear a turtleneck?

585
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,029
Isn't this a sex scene?

586
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,198
How about we wrap her in a sheet?

587
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,201
Let's give the impression
while shooting only from the neck up.

588
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,202
Stroke her hair--

589
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,805
He's going to touch her?
No one told me this.

590
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,440
He won't.

591
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,743
How about he lifts her chin
with his fingers?

592
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,780
Fine.

593
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,348
From the top!

594
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,449
-Okay.
-Okay.

595
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,354
"Don't say anything."

596
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,689
"Your wet T-shirt

597
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,857
is cute."

598
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,026
That's "Manatsu no Ichibyo"

599
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,295
by Masahiko Kondo.

600
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,714
Damn it.

601
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,528
KIYOSHI, YOU JERK!

602
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,098
"The shirt on your naked skin. Sexy."

603
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,102
"It's a little wet. Sexy."

604
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,372
"Jonetsu Neppu Serenade"

605
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,308
by Masahiko Kondo.

606
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,744
Matchy loves wet shirts.

607
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,681
This is embarrassing.

608
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,182
Turn the light off.

609
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,125
Cut!

610
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,126
You touched her!

611
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,428
You touched her just now!

612
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,296
Managers aren't allowed to say cut!

613
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,898
It's outside the frame.

614
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,600
Then why did he have to touch her?

615
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,635
You're so fussy!

616
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,737
Fine. Lift your arms so you can't touch!

617
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,273
How will they make sounds
without touching?

618
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,876
With hand power!

619
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,744
Use hand power!

620
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,216
Anyway, this girl became an actress
because she wanted to act, right?

621
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,585
In that case, let her act!

622
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,054
It's no different
from eating scenes, fighting scenes,

623
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,823
or dancing and singing scenes.

624
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,726
Why are intimate scenes
treated differently?

625
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,997
My favorite actresses,
Mineko Nishikawa and Rino Katase

626
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,368
rose to fame through their bold stripping
and explicit scenes.

627
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,470
Explicit scenes?

628
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,671
That's right.

629
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,872
That's how they made it.

630
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,174
They showed their tits and asses
and committed!

631
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,576
That's professionalism!

632
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,112
Who's this guy spouting nonsense?

633
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,146
Huh?

634
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,715
I'm this company's counselor.

635
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,018
Counselor? You?

636
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,686
TV stations are messed up!

637
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,057
Inoue!

638
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,426
Inoue!

639
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,429
What?

640
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,765
Do you know where Mutchy lives?

641
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,300
It's the dumplings shop.

642
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,305
<i>Banzai</i>

643
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,640
-<i>Banzai</i>
-Stop.

644
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,909
No more Matchy.

645
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,755
It overlapped a little.

646
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,159
Twist her right leg counterclockwise.

647
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,860
Right leg, counterclockwise.

648
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,562
No. Her thigh will show.

649
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,597
Scratch that. Your thigh will show.

650
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,367
Twist her left leg clockwise
and her hip counterclockwise.

651
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,004
How about this?

652
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,406
All the important parts are hidden.

653
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,875
Who has sex in this position, though?

654
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,311
It looks more like a judo technique.

655
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,580
What is it, Intimacy?

656
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,485
She wants to experiment a little,
so she'd like you to step out for a bit.

657
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,221
What?

658
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,356
Me?

659
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:15,660
It's my job as the intimacy coordinator
to respect the actor's preferences.

660
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,074
AKITSU DUMPLINGS

661
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,146
Junko!

662
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,750
What's the matter?

663
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,254
My stupid thing…

664
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,059
won't ding-a-ling.

665
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,329
What?

666
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,865
Sorry.

667
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,246
Junko!

668
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,514
Is something the matter?

669
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,415
Huh?

670
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,120
No, it's nothing.

671
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,128
Junko!

672
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,899
Hey. Let go of me!

673
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,100
Just come with me!

674
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,354
Wow, I'm feeling super excited right now!

675
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,390
Why?

676
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,592
I managed to find you
without a smartphone.

677
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,561
On a rainy night,

678
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,297
I managed to find you
without using my phone.

679
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,033
I'm amazing.

680
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,135
This is so cool!

681
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,604
I love Showa!

682
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,740
Kiyoshi!

683
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,345
If you're a man,

684
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,148
don't be an idiot
and make the girl you love cry!

685
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,651
Mutchy!

686
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,254
Don't you ever let her go.

687
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,555
You got that?

688
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,358
I won't.

689
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,332
Thanks, Junko.

690
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,535
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,120
Nagisa, can I have a moment?

692
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,388
What is it?

693
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,457
These ladies are,

694
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,726
how should I put it, members of…

695
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,027
Mr. Ogawa's victims' club.

696
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,596
Victims?

697
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,743
What's taking her so long to respond?

698
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,380
-Sorry?
-Mr. Ichiro, you can't cut in.

699
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,081
He's talking about a group chat.

700
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,251
I've been waiting ever since
it was marked as read.

701
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,252
So why?

702
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,857
Last month, I got advice from Mr. Ogawa
about my supervisor's power harassment.

703
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,727
So I sent him a thank-you message, but…

704
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,431
"Come talk to me whenever you want."

705
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,266
"Thank you."

706
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,668
"How are things since then?"

707
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,169
"Are you still being harassed?"

708
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,539
"My message is marked as read,
but you haven't responded."

709
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,907
"Bow."

710
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,710
"What's with the bow?
Do you think this is funny?"

711
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,179
"Why did you delete your message?"

712
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,381
"Hey. Answer me!"

713
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,585
This exchange itself is harassment.

714
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,688
If we showed this to Personnel,
he'd be fired on the spot.

715
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,858
He also messaged our program's group chat.

716
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,796
"Karaoke was a blast."

717
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,031
"By the way,
how's the program coming along?"

718
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,834
I sent that on Friday night,
and the show aired on Saturday.

719
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,804
And this is what I got today
after all that silence!

720
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:26,544
I mean, it didn't feel right for me
to reply before you, the general director.

721
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,914
I don't check my business phone
on my days off,

722
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,315
so I only noticed on Monday.

723
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,486
AT LEAST LET ME KNOW
HOW THE SHOW WENT

724
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,423
UNDERSTOOD
UNDERSTOOD

725
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,727
I get it. It's an understandable reaction.

726
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,598
I always leave a program's group chat
once the program is over.

727
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:51,035
You can get in touch
if you're connected personally, after all.

728
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,338
Leaving is cutting ties with the group.

729
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,973
It's like a breakup.

730
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,743
That's intense.
You're taking this too seriously.

731
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,411
"Why did you leave the group?"

732
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,846
"What did I do?"

733
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,047
"Give me your reason."

734
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,782
That's intense!

735
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,184
Feeling concerned,
I decided to hear them out.

736
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,787
I created a new group
and began chatting with them there.

737
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,756
But then, someone invited Mr. Ogawa.

738
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,093
"So this is where you've been.
I found you."

739
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,596
"I want a drinking party
on Thursday or Friday."

740
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,964
"This place looks good."

741
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,866
"It has a Tabelog rating of 3.8 stars."

742
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,201
-Scary.
-Scary.

743
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,403
What should we do?

744
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,438
I think someone should tell him.

745
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,609
I might be responsible for this.

746
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,145
In our group chat with the three of us,

747
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,414
Nagisa has been ignoring your messages.

748
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,450
Ever since I shared
my mom's name in the chat.

749
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,152
About that.

750
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,187
I'm so glad it wasn't Junko.

751
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,425
But I've been checking my phone
every minute, waiting for her to reply.

752
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,327
It's making it hard to focus on work.

753
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,563
You have a smartphone addiction,
like some high schooler.

754
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,598
When a message is read but not replied to,

755
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,903
to me, it feels like serving a meal
without receiving a thank you!

756
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,605
Damn it!

757
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,975
<i>Calm down</i>

758
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:10,514
<i>Mr. Ogawa</i>

759
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,083
Nagisacchi?

760
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,767
<i>Calm down, Mr. Ogawa</i>

761
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,203
<i>It might be tough to grasp
When you're new to it</i>

762
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:38,342
<i>But you can't take social media seriously</i>

763
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,410
You can't?

764
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,114
When a message is marked as read,
it means you've been heard.

765
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,882
It's a response in itself.

766
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,085
<i>Marked as read means they're alive</i>

767
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,654
<i>No reply is good news</i>

768
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,324
<i>Marked as read means they're well</i>

769
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,661
<i>It's silly to feel hurt</i>

770
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,230
No!

771
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,664
In that case…

772
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,701
<i>Don't mark it as read</i>

773
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,637
<i>Marked as read makes me anxious</i>

774
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,875
<i>No news is bad news</i>

775
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:15,079
Yeah, when your message
is marked as read, you expect a reply,

776
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,381
putting pressure
on the other person to respond.

777
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,483
And that's why…

778
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,684
<i>Understood</i>

779
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,052

00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,124
<i>Understood</i>

783
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,494
No.

784
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,796
That's not it.

785
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:35,099
I'm not looking for a robotic response.

786
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,868
If I wanted a business interaction,
I'd use a call network!

787
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,904
-A call network?
-A call network?

788
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,174
<i>They're not familiar with a call network</i>

789
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,074
Come on!

790
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,045
<i>Generation Z is missing out</i>

791
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,048
<i>They're not familiar with a call network</i>

792
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,621
Okay, thank you. Have a good day.

793
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,625
Call network…

794
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,194
<i>A calls B</i>

795
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,062
<i>B calls C</i>

796
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,364
<i>And on it goes</i>

797
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,667
<i>Until Z calls A</i>

798
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,935
Hello?

799
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,603
This is Sakisaka.

800
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,339
Tomorrow's PTA meeting starts at 2 p.m.

801
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,408
By the way, Intimacy,

802
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,876
on the main actor's birthday,

803
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,413
you were the only one
who didn't send a birthday message!

804
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,747
That bothered me.

805
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,618
<i>You don't understand anything</i>

806
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,554
<i>Wishing someone a happy birthday
In a group chat</i>

807
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:35,159
<i>Is nothing more than a public display</i>

808
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,094
Really?

809
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,398
If you truly want to celebrate someone,
you message them in person.

810
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,902
<i>Calm down, Mr. Ogawa</i>

811
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,505
<i>Everyone is vaguely aware</i>

812
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,373
<i>That social media isn't the place</i>

813
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,376
<i>For serious discourse</i>

814
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,579
<i>If you took everything seriously
It would exhaust you</i>

815
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,780
Is that how it is?

816
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,017
<i>That's social networking</i>

817
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,754
<i>Networking</i>

818
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,523
<i>Service</i>

819
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,560
<i>Is that how it is?</i>

820
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,263
<i>I see now</i>

821
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:17,334
<i>I'm so sorry</i>

822
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,077
But

823
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,215
what I'm about to tell you is the truth,

824
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,784
so I want you to take it seriously.

825
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,420
I see.

826
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,557
Next week,

827
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,093
I want you to come see my father.

828
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,762
What?

829
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,364
Your father?

830
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,733
What? Did you hear that?

831
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,937
Akitsu, did you hear that?

832
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:55,973
Sure!

833
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,614
How about we stop marking messages
as read and, instead,

834
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,050
mark unread messages with hearts?

835
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,720
This could make waiting
for the message to be read

836
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,322
more enjoyable for the sender.

837
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,425
If five people haven't seen the message,
there would be five hearts.

838
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,060
It adds a bit of fun.

839
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:16,961
Right?

840
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,997
This new feature would prevent people
from feeling hurt.

841
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,466
Excuse me.

842
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,502
NAGISA INUSHIMA

843
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,082
It's gorgeous.

844
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,150
This way.

845
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,232
This is my father.

846
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,279
This is Mr. Ichiro Ogawa.

847
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,417
Nice to meet you, sir.

848
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,092
Are you all right, sir?

849
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,696
Sir, lift your head.

850
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,833
Father.

851
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,535
What? No.

852
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,971
You're the father.

853
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,007
Who is this?

854
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,853
You're my father, aren't you?

855
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:51,789
Sorry?

856
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,492
if I become a champion, will you marry me?

857
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,694
Don't cut in, shoulder pads.

858
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,761
We're connected with the field.

859
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:58,796
Please show me the ropes!

860
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,030
Is this allowed?

861
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,598
That's a cover-up!

862
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:02,499
Father.

863
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,967
Take care.

864
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,369
What are you doing, geezer?

865
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,137
What the hell have you done?

866
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,038
