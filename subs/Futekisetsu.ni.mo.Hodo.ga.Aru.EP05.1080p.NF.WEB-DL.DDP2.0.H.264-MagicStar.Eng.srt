1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,374
There's no chance you'd get into
any college with your standard score.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,508
Don't say that.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,877
I want to go to the same place
as Naomi Kawashima.

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,278
You mean AGU?

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,115
You wouldn't even make it
into their kindergarten, silly!

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,316
If I don't go to college,

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,519
I can't become Miss Campus
or appear on <i>All Night Fuji</i>.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,555
I'll take the back door route
to Ferris if I have to.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,291
You're her mother. Tell her.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm not her mother.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,396
I thought you married her father.

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,264
Absolutely not. That's not even funny--

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,198
Father.

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,467
No. You're not getting it, do you?

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,569
You're the father.

16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,171
Yes.

17
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,874
But you're my father.

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,179
Your daughter wanted me
to talk to her father, so here I am.

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,016
I mean, sure, I'm a father too.

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,384
I've got a daughter as well.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,321
-Father.
-Weren't you listening?

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,458
Call me father one more time,
and who knows what might happen!

23
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,293
I sent you something.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,694
Huh?

25
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,531
Listen, Ogawa, with your looks,

26
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,900
you could find a husband
without education.

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,737
Excuse me, are you serious?

28
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,905
If she wasn't pretty,

29
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,474
I'd advise her to study hard
for a national university.

30
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,909
I graduated from one!

31
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,445
Anyway, that's a terrible thing to say
as an educator!

32
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,747
Misogyny, education-based
discrimination, lookism,

33
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,082
and what else?

34
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,285
But I won't attract any guys at Maharaja
unless I'm in college.

35
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,654
Oh, Junko.

36
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,660
This is Junko.

37
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,561
It's Junko.

38
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,962
You go by her first name?

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,164
Huh?

40
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,934
Hold up, what's going on here, huh?

41
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,669
What?

42
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,406
Who's the kid in her arms?

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,775
That's me.

44
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,712
Nagisa is Junko's daughter.

45
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,393
You're my granddaughter?

46
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,795
Hey, Grandpa.

47
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,132
Father.

48
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,037
I'm your father-in-law.

49
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,174
And I'm your grandpa.

50
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,343
What the hell?!

51
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,527
Don't bother. I'll do it myself.

52
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,433
He just had heart surgery,
so his breathing isn't stable yet.

53
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,172
Got it.

54
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,407
So you're my granddaughter.

55
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,977
Barkeep, did you know this?

56
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,612
You should've said, stupid geezer!

57
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,195
That's why we felt tinglings
when we tried some hanky-panky.

58
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,663
You tried some hanky-panky?

59
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,131
-Sorry about that.
-No worries.

60
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,201
It would've been messed up
to make out with my grandkid.

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,236
It was a near miss.

62
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,371
I was careless too.

63
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,406
You were.

64
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,941
You were really careless.

65
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,877
You made your grandpa fall for you.

66
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,381
By the way, did she tell you
that I'm from the past?

67
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,283
I got here on a time machine.

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,785
Yes, sort of.

69
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,555
Speaking of 1986,
the prime minister back then was…

70
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,656
Nakasone.

71
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,794
I see.

72
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,165
So Junko married you.

73
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm afraid so.

74
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,003
Beats her getting together
with that punk Mutchy.

75
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,072
So, where's Junko now?

76
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,444
Hm? What's the matter?

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,347
She couldn't make it?

78
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,189
Don't tell me…

79
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,224
Well?

80
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,694
They split up.

81
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,034
ABNORMAL

82
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,439
They got divorced,
and my mother is living overseas now.

83
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,442
Right?

84
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,344
I'm afraid so.

85
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,183
I see.

86
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,121
The Junko I know is still in high school,
so it's all hard to imagine.

87
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,956
I see.

88
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,959
But marriages can be complicated.

89
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,096
Even Shingo Yamashiro split
with Hiromi Hanazono after 20 years.

90
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,434
Six years later,
he tied the knot with her again.

91
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,102
He did?

92
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,305
And eight years after that,

93
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,973
they divorced once more.

94
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,209
Shingo's quite the character, huh?

95
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,914
Maybe you'll have another shot
with Junko then.

96
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,948
Where exactly is she?

97
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:20,920
What's your deal?

98
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,623
You had more to say
about Shingo Yamashiro.

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,928
FRANCE, PROVENCE REGION

100
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,229
She's…

101
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,199
in the Provence region.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,368
In southern France.

103
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:37,970
Right?

104
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:43,176
She said it was her dream
to open a bouillabaisse shop.

105
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,484
Why don't you tell me
how you got to know each other?

106
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,454
You mean Junko and me?

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,391
Yeah, tell me what you know about her
after she finished high school.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,994
Are you okay?

109
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,335
I heard she was a bit of a rebel
in high school.

110
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,937
That's an understatement.

111
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,306
They call her the Downtown Junko Mihara.

112
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,474
She's a Diet member now.

113
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,275
Who? Junko Mihara?

114
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,478
You're kidding me.
After releasing "Sexy Night"?

115
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,315
In 2007, she divorced Happy Happy,
formerly Koala, and…

116
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,549
Forget about Mihara.

117
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,952
Tell me about Ogawa. Junko Ogawa.

118
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:31,057
In her third year of high school,
she cut ties with her delinquent friends.

119
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,025
She turned over a new leaf,

120
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,928
and nailed the college entrance exam
upon graduation.

121
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,463
Is that so?

122
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,432
Good.

123
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,734
I knew she had it in her. She's not dumb.

124
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,870
Female college students were all the rage.

125
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,038
She gathered attention wherever she went.

126
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,541
<i>And she got scouted by a modeling agency.</i>

127
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,081
Nice.

128
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,084
How about we get rid of the shirt soon?

129
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,720
What?

130
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,356
Very funny. No way.

131
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,591
I was just joking!

132
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,563
All right, let's hit Roppongi!

133
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,976
This way. Follow me.

134
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,479
Here we go.

135
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,750
If you're pals with the black-suited,
you get special treatment.

136
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,121
Mr. Noshima,
who's this cute chick with you?

137
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,924
This is Junko, a college student.
It's her debut at a disco.

138
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,392
Is that so?

139
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,627
Let me treat you to a drink, then.

140
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,763
No way. Are you sure?

141
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,899
Excuse me? That rosé is my order.

142
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,835
Hang tight. I'll bring you one shortly.

143
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,369
That's not the problem!

144
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,672
I paid a hefty cover charge,
and you serve this girl first?

145
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,973
It's not fair!

146
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,442
Shut up! Who cares about your rosé?

147
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,012
If you're acting high and mighty,
you should drink pickle sauce instead!

148
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,214
That's me.

149
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,882
Sorry, who?

150
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:05,952
This.

151
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,457
I was young and fearless,
rocking a black suit at a disco.

152
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,959
Those were the days.

153
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,596
You usually keep a hint of your youth,

154
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,431
no matter how much time goes by.

155
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,332
I don't?

156
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,967
No, not even a bit.

157
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,034
This is someone else.

158
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,539
I agree. I felt like I was being lied to
since I was a child.

159
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,607
Very well.

160
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,209
Let me use the Wi-Fi here.

161
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,611
Dad, don't.

162
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,981
If you see this,
I know you will believe me.

163
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,928
<i>Newbies wore dark red, waiters wore blue,
and top waiters wore yellow.</i>

164
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,430
<i>Like that, the staff was ranked by color.</i>

165
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,100
<i>When I became a captain,
I finally got to wear black.</i>

166
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,402
<i>The highest rank was champion.</i>

167
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,940
Junko,

168
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,809
if I become a champion, will you marry me?

169
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,479
Of course.

170
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,083
But Yuzu, what color comes after black?

171
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,019
This is Yuzuru Inushima.

172
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,688
I'm going to marry this man.

173
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,691
What are you?

174
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,260
An alien?

175
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,029
I'm from Hyogo.

176
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,465
Whatever. I can't marry her off
to a guy with such wide shoulders.

177
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,301
Oh, come on.

178
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,002
And what's with your outfit?

179
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,405
There's barely any fabric on you.

180
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,674
It's called the one-length bodycon look.

181
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,043
Father, I love Junko.

182
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,411
Don't cut in, shoulder pads.

183
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:43,616
I played around since I turned 16
and slept with over 400 women.

184
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,388
But I believe all that experience was
just practice for meeting Junko.

185
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,457
That's how crazy in love I am with her.

186
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,526
What parent would be happy to hear that?

187
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,861
I mean it.
I'll end things with the other women!

188
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,631
-You haven't yet?
-I'll break up with them soon. I promise!

189
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,632
Shut up.

190
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,901
End it with the other girls,

191
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,703
ditch those shoulder pads,
and then we'll talk.

192
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,805
I can't…

193
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,174
promise you that.

194
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,443
Yuzu?

195
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,746
These shoulder pads
represent being a champion.

196
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,915
They're the essence of Roppongi.

197
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,883
I can't let them go.

198
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,852
My name means yield,
but I won't yield these.

199
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,488
Then, forget it. It's not happening.

200
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,056
Is that so?

201
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:24,957
Yeah.

202
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,226
I understand.

203
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,598
Allow me to use your cassette tape player.

204
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,266
Yuzu, what are you doing?

205
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,870
I have to show your father
how serious I am.

206
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,980
Please let me marry Junko.

207
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,315
This is how committed I am.

208
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,651
What on earth?

209
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,121
It's a dance asking for your blessing.

210
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,992
Father, do you see?

211
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,794
Please believe me.

212
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,496
-Go home!
-It's too late.

213
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,033
I'm pregnant.

214
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,604
That's me.

215
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,842
You bastard!

216
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,414
What the hell have you done?

217
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,052
Junko, apologize to your mom!

218
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,788
Calm down, Mr. Ogawa! Please!

219
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,528
Sorry. My bad.

220
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,165
The Junko I know is still in high school.

221
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,966
It's all right.

222
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,436
That wasn't my first time.

223
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,072
It was a first for me.

224
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,040
Right.

225
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,208
It hasn't happened yet.

226
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,979
So this alien is coming to visit
my place in the future, huh?

227
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,283
How many years from now?

228
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,985
It was when Junko was
in her fourth year of college.

229
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,120
Four years from now?

230
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,588
Just four years?

231
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,990
I don't know if I can keep my cool.

232
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,459
You don't have to.

233
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,660
I suppose not.

234
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,562
It's this guy, right?

235
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,565
I'm sure I can be just as furious at him.

236
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233
Third baseman!

237
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,305
<i>You didn't give our marriage
your blessing.</i>

238
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,675
<i>When we brought Nagisa to see you,</i>

239
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,944
<i>you wouldn't even hold her.</i>

240
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,447
Shall we go, Nagisa?

241
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,649
Grandpa's too busy.

242
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,054
<i>When the economy bubble burst,</i>

243
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,723
the disco industry also began to decline.

244
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,495
So, I headed back to Kobe
to manage the family business.

245
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,331
It's a tailor shop.

246
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,270
I thought of making a suit
for you as a gift.

247
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,574
I wrote you a letter, asking you
to come in for measurements.

248
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,310
I included a bullet train ticket

249
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,613
and I invited you to come…

250
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,483
I didn't go, did I?

251
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,785
I can be pretty stubborn.

252
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,223
-Are you good?
-I'm fine.

253
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:14,960
You know what?

254
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
I'll go to Kobe.

255
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,230
Wait,

256
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,498
I shouldn't go.

257
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,833
This is so complicated.

258
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,971
This is the past for you,
but for me, it's the future.

259
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,609
Anyway, why did you and Junko break up?

260
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,179
Well…

261
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,817
My father was unfaithful.

262
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,418
I suspected as much.

263
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,820
He's a champion, after all.

264
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,155
My lack of virtue is to blame.

265
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:44,723
So, who with?

266
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:48,928
The first person…

267
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,131
<i>was a life insurance saleswoman.</i>

268
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,632
Her name?

269
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,871
Soko Fujii.

270
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,106
She was a sharp girl.

271
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,375
And the second?

272
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,110
T-The second?

273
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,046
You mentioned "first."

274
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,019
She was a yoga instructor.

275
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,287
Her name?

276
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,657
Does her name concern you?

277
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,894
Um…

278
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,633
It was Uber…

279
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,603
Itsuko Uuba.

280
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,941
Uuba is written using the Kanji
for feather, universe, and horse.

281
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,744
-And the third--
-You can stop.

282
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,913
I've heard enough.

283
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,014
Right.

284
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,688
After the divorce, I moved to Tokyo
and started a tailor shop in Chofu.

285
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,092
But I fell ill last year and…

286
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,830
Now, Masato, him, and I
are living together.

287
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,700
Did you compensate her?

288
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,402
Absolutely.

289
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,240
With that money, she fulfilled
her long-cherished dream of…

290
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:18,117
She went to Brazil to pursue her dream
of becoming a samba dancer.

291
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,318
Not southern France?

292
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,225
She mastered samba
and now runs a bouillabaisse shop, right?

293
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:27,826
That's right.

294
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,201
So Junko's doing well, huh?

295
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,906
That's all I need to know.

296
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,876
I'm sorry, Nagisa.

297
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,346
Your grandpa was too stubborn to hold you.

298
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,050
Do it now.

299
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,585
What?

300
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,487
Wait a minute.

301
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,589
Really?

302
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,192
Absolutely.
Junko would be pleased as well.

303
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,772
She's my grandkid.

304
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,308
That's why this is fine.

305
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,747
Grandpa.

306
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,116
Nagisa.

307
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,665
C-Come on!

308
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,603
Akitsu, this won't do.

309
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,472
The sleeves are too long. Can I cut them?

310
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,707
Just roll them up.

311
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,609
Like this.

312
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,312
Can't I wear a polo shirt?
I'm just a part-timer.

313
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,413
No way.

314
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,582
The new recruits will look down on you.

315
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>Hello?</i>

316
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,218
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

317
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,886
Sorry, Sakae.

318
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,821
Anyway,

319
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,656
let the principal know

320
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,093
I might be able to return
before the midterm exam.

321
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,628
<i>Got it.</i>

322
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,765
Junko, what are you wearing?

323
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,466
Huh?

324
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,270
Just trying to make sure
the new students don't look down on me.

325
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,105
<i>I nearly mistook you for Bull Nakano.</i>

326
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,441
But my socks have a Dalmatian pattern.

327
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,575
What did you call it?

328
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,943
<i>Gap-moe</i>.

329
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,911
That's lame.

330
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,515
My roommate says you look lame. Go change.

331
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,952
This gives off vibes
of a famous actress' delinquent past

332
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,454
that would go viral online.

333
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,423
Huh? Who the hell are you? I'll kill you!

334
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,491
Junko, my arms are dead.

335
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,927
Sako…

336
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,595
What are you doing?

337
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,165
The call network.

338
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,133
We have a PTA meeting today.

339
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,502
There's no one called Sako in my class.

340
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,004
What?

341
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,442
<i>April is a hectic period for TV stations
as it's a transitional period.</i>

342
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,280
<i>I got Sakae to extend my leave.</i>

343
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,848
Premium Saturday<i>!</i>

344
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,351
<i>I will nonchalantly make
your Saturday noon premium.</i>

345
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,519
<i>Don't miss it!</i>

346
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,189
Look who's full of himself.

347
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,624
<i>Let the principal know</i>

348
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,727
<i>I might be able to return
before the midterm exam.</i>

349
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:17,729
That's it.

350
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,466
Oh, well.

351
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,302
It seems the baseball club
is more relaxed without him.

352
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,271
If the parents ask,
we can say he's off for training.

353
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,443
Mr. Yasumori, can I take a look
at the PTA's expenses and past ledgers?

354
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
We don't have those.

355
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,884
We gather operating fees
at the start of the school year.

356
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,586
When we run out, we ask for more.

357
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,887
And if there's extra…

358
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,090
We go, "we have some left over."

359
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:45,991
Right?

360
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,528
Yes, and then we use it
to buy snacks and juice and stuff.

361
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,364
Are you seriously spending
the parents' money so carelessly?

362
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,767
We get receipts for our expenses
and keep them in a notebook, of course.

363
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,137
And we reconcile the books
at the end of the year.

364
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,138
And if they don't add up?

365
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,109
We simply go, "They didn't add up,"
and find money elsewhere.

366
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,644
That's a cover-up!

367
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,712
A cover-up?

368
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,082
We've been doing this for decades.

369
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,818
The books don't add up
because some parent is overspending.

370
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,319
Well…

371
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,822
I can't investigate that.

372
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,857
It's basically everyone's money,
after all.

373
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,758
Right?

374
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,761
Um… I've got some work to attend to.

375
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,100
Wait, Mr. Yasumori!

376
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,572
The call network.
The person after me is a Sako.

377
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,941
Sako…

378
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,509
is a truant.

379
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,245
You mean an absentee?

380
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,315
I guess you wouldn't know.

381
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,384
It started last year in the second term.

382
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,488
We've visited his home,
called him up, and tried everything.

383
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,456
But his parents asked us to stop.

384
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,293
They wanted their son's name
removed from the register.

385
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,061
Another cover-up.

386
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,297
There's nothing we can do.

387
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,033
Truancy is a family issue.

388
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,067
No, it's not.

389
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,670
Absenteeism is a problem
society needs to address together.

390
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,737
It's truancy.

391
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,506
It's absenteeism.

392
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,409
Kids aren't absent from school
for just one reason.

393
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,245
Sometimes it's psychological,
emotional, or social.

394
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,681
Some kids want to go but physically can't.

395
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,785
You can't assume they're playing truant,
so you shouldn't use the word "truancy."

396
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:20,886
Based on that belief,

397
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:25,357
the Ministry of Justice submits a report
on absentee children in Heisei 1.

398
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,360
Mr. Yasumori,
you can be ahead of your time.

399
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,163
Heisei?

400
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,532
Ugh, I'm so upset.

401
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,500
I shouldn't have joined the PTA board.

402
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,704
If only I could use social media.

403
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,507
When you were taking time off,
you were texting your friends on Insta.

404
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,277
What? You weren't going to school?

405
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,247
He stopped going to school
in the second term as well.

406
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,749
He started going again after coming here,
but now he's like this.

407
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,184
No way!

408
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,885
So it's thanks to me!

409
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,921
It's thanks to you and boobs.

410
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,156
He must be lonely,

411
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,826
being alone all day.

412
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,228
And without social media or subs.

413
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,997
And no free schools either.

414
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,598
What are those?

415
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,102
They're privately run schools for kids
who don't go to regular school.

416
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,738
Not bad, future.

417
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,342
Hey, Kiyoshi,
why don't you reach out to this kid?

418
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,444
No way. We've never even met.

419
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,913
It actually might make it easier for him.

420
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,318
But I don't even know
what his interests are.

421
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,453
That tasted horrible!

422
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,554
Hey!

423
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,723
I could use something refreshing.

424
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,761
It's me, Mutchy!

425
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,498
Anyone up for a ride
on my Honda CBX along the shoreline?

426
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,666
I'm game!

427
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,536
I wanted to go with Junko, not you.

428
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,638
Why not? You should take her.

429
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,739
Come on…

430
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,974
Shut up!

431
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,075
Be quiet.

432
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,978
This show kicked off today.

433
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,513
It's <i>Yuri Osawa's Yu Yu Wide</i>.

434
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,481
<i>I will now share a letter.</i>

435
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,451
-<i>It's from Scandal in Katsushika.</i>
-That's me!

436
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,585
I sent that in!

437
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,288
-They're reading my postcard.
-<i>"Hello, Yuri."</i>

438
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,692
<i>"I'd like to request
'Anoko to Scandal' by Checkers, please."</i>

439
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,393
<i>Let's give it a listen.</i>

440
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,201
Where to?

441
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,637
I don't know. Anywhere you want.

442
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,240
Actually, go to Matsudo Midori Park!

443
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,875
You totally had a place in mind!

444
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,711
Hurry.

445
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,285
Want one?

446
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,586
Yeah. Thanks.

447
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,667
Look.

448
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,802
That kid is me.

449
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,905
You guys are so stupid, you know that?

450
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,507
Apologize!

451
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,110
Sakae, it's fine now.

452
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,144
No, it's not!

453
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,148
Big kids have bigger problems.

454
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,617
What are you stuffing in there?

455
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,619
Show me!

456
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,255
When I was a kid,
they used to call me PTA.

457
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,289
I remember now.

458
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,959
On my way back from cram school,

459
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,129
I used to hold
public lectures here every day.

460
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,567
Those are melon buns!

461
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,069
That's disrespectful to the baker!

462
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,339
What?

463
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,909
Are you saying that girl
is similar to you, old lady?

464
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,047
Yeah.

465
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,252
Shouldn't you just call me "lady"
instead of throwing in "old"?

466
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,122
If I give you permission
to call me "old lady," then go ahead.

467
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,223
Mind your manners.

468
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,360
S-Sorry.

469
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,028
Apologize now!

470
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,564
To this girl and the bakery!

471
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,867
Things never change, do they?

472
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,537
Neither me nor society.

473
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,608
What are you doing?

474
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,943
Nothing.

475
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,679
No need to hide it.

476
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,481
Is it porn? Show me!

477
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,716
<i>RADIO EXCITE</i>

478
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,120
I thought that Sako might be listening.

479
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,655
To the radio?

480
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,125
He'd probably ignore my calls.

481
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,061
And showing up unannounced
might overwhelm him.

482
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,231
So, I figured I could reach out via radio.

483
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,167
That's ridiculously inefficient, you know.

484
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,635
I know that.

485
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,839
I wish I could message him on Insta or X,

486
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,408
without making him feel pressured.

487
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,877
But this was all I could come up with.

488
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,114
Fine. I'll help you.

489
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:44,916
Junko…

490
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,452
You put your stupid brain
to work on this, right?

491
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,456
I'm not stupid, you know.

492
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,259
Maybe we can start with <i>Super Gang</i>.

493
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,527
What's your handle?

494
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,296
Mysterious Transfer Student.

495
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,165
That's lame.

496
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,744
Is he in?

497
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,979
He is.

498
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,749
May I have a moment?

499
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,984
COUNSELOR OGAWA FROM HELL

500
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,318
Sure.

501
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,722
I saw the ad for <i>PS</i>.
He was so full of himself.

502
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,192
Actually, starting this April,
I've moved to a different department.

503
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,093
RISK MANAGEMENT DEPT.

504
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,862
He's the manager of Risk Management.
He's on the career track.

505
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,131
I've nominated her as my successor

506
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,467
and handed over the production
to the younger team.

507
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,103
What? You're a producer now, Nagisacchi?

508
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,872
That's a big step up!
That calls for a celebration!

509
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,474
However,

510
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,777
we've just had a major scandal
involving the main emcee.

511
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,245
I know.

512
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,347
Tsutsumin's six affairs, right?
Outrageous.

513
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,450
To prevent a similar blunder,
I've had talks with the higher-ups.

514
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,451
Moving forward,

515
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,889
I'm planning to carefully monitor
our cast's behavior, not just our staff's.

516
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,959
And I'll be using
a location-based service for that.

517
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,197
Are you available
after the broadcast on Saturday?

518
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,337
<i>Next week, we've got a Yashima special.</i>

519
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,440
<i>Get ready for three hours
of non-stop karaoke fun!</i>

520
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,342
<i>Let's hope I make it through alive.</i>

521
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,611
<i>All right, everyone,
let's say it together.</i>

522
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,413
PS<i>!</i>

523
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,849
Okay, that's it for today!

524
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,084
-Well done!
-Well done.

525
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,321
-Well done.
-Thank you.

526
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,790
What? What's happening?

527
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,660
We've installed a GPS app
on our cast members' smartphones.

528
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,863
With their and their agencies' consent,
of course.

529
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,567
It's to track their movements
after the broadcast.

530
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,002
Huh? What is this?

531
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,770
Wait, is this allowed??

532
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,806
Honestly, we'd rather not resort to this.

533
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,708
But given that some of them are minors,

534
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,611
this serves as a deterrent
to avoid any potential trouble.

535
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,379
Unfortunately, it's effective.

536
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,247
Better safe than sorry, I suppose.

537
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,384
I've spotted someone acting suspiciously.

538
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,253
Great observation, Mr. Ogawa.
You've got a sharp eye.

539
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,154
This is indeed

540
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,689
our greatest concern.

541
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,826
There he is, Yashiman.

542
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,727
Exactly.

543
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,097
After the live broadcast on Saturday,

544
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,434
Mr. Yashima consistently takes a taxi
in the opposite direction of his home.

545
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,404
And for some reason,
he gets off near the Skytree.

546
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,607
A man heading to the Skytree alone
on a Saturday evening.

547
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,009
Seems fishy, right?

548
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,245
That's just your perspective, isn't it?
He could be going to a sauna.

549
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,513
I want to believe him too.

550
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,181
I don't want to jump to conclusions

551
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,951
just because a 53-year-old actor
doesn't head straight home.

552
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,487
But in these times,
it's too late if something happens.

553
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,256
Today is the day
we'll get to the bottom of this.

554
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,624
You're doubting him 100%.

555
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,426
We're connected with the field.

556
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,497
This is Ujiie, reporting from the field.

557
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,736
Mr. Yashima

558
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,839
is running in circles near the Skytree.

559
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,177
Maybe he's lost or…

560
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,446
waiting for someone.

561
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,982
<i>He's carrying
a suspicious-looking black bag.</i>

562
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,118
Maybe it contains items
used for kinky sex.

563
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,653
Like whips or handcuffs.

564
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,029
He's drinking an energy drink

565
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,998
and now he's doing squats.

566
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,735
Is he married?

567
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,771
Yes, to an actress. She's quite tall.

568
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,106
This is an affair, then.

569
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,675
Huh? What now?

570
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,312
He's making a dash for it!

571
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,916
Damn it! He just disabled the GPS.

572
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,452
Ujiie, it's on you.
Don't let him slip away!

573
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,990
Mr. Ogawa, do we let this slide?

574
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
Or…

575
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,360
We investigate!

576
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,431
What's this? What's the occasion?

577
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,734
Did I win the Galaxy Award?
It's too early, huh?

578
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,970
We'll cut to the chase.

579
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,905
Mr. Yashima, you are

580
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,741
having an affair.

581
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,142
-No.
-Don't lie!

582
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,043
Quiet.

583
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,445
Look me in the eye.

584
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,047
Mr. Yashima,

585
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,416
are you having an affair?

586
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,485
Yes or no?

587
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,686
No.

588
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,887
You sound fishy.

589
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,523
Your glasses scream deceit.
You lying four-eyes!

590
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,424
Shut up.

591
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,759
Why are you so rude?

592
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,826
For a whole month,

593
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,929
we've been keeping tabs on you.

594
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,664
What?

595
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,302
From 5 to 6 p.m.,

596
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,806
you were wandering around the Skytree.

597
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,877
After that, you turned off your GPS
and disappeared.

598
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,545
And precisely for two hours…

599
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,284
You took a break, didn't you?

600
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,586
You went into a hotel for a break.

601
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,855
And after 10 p.m.,

602
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,124
you returned home acting innocent.

603
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,626
You're guilty.

604
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:55,727
Totally guilty.

605
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,429
I'm disappointed, Mr. Yashima.

606
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,900
Damn.

607
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,336
I didn't want anyone
to find out about this.

608
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,438
There! Yashima confessed!

609
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,907
He confessed.

610
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,176
It's not an affair. I was playing <i>kendama</i>.

611
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,811
<i>Kendama</i>?

612
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,813
Take a good look at the sign.

613
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,482
We investigate.

614
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,986
<i>KENDAMA</i> CAFE

615
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:22,987
A <i>kendama</i> cafe?

616
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,789
Mr. Kurita,

617
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,658
remember what you said?

618
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,093
About what's appropriate
for a Saturday afternoon.

619
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,396
It's not your self-centered excuses!

620
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,764
It's Mr. Yashima's <i>kendama</i>!

621
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,266
<i>Your words struck a chord in me.</i>

622
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:36,901
And it hit me.

623
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,103
That you were genuinely thinking

624
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,074
about creating a program
that fits into people's lives.

625
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,510
So, I will take it seriously too

626
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,680
and be a guy who is appropriate
for a Saturday afternoon.

627
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,883
Right after I made that vow
came the three-hour karaoke special.

628
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,985
<i>Simply singing wouldn't cut it.</i>

629
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,687
Please show me the ropes!

630
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,226
Hey, pull yourself together!

631
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,927
Focus and keep your eye on the ball!

632
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,899
Oops, sorry!

633
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,835
-You're getting better though.
-Right.

634
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,403
-Try tossing the ball straight up.
-Okay.

635
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,339
And catch it softly with your hand.

636
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,340
<i>Well,</i>

637
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,108
what about those squats?

638
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,543
I was mentally practicing.

639
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,612
You guys have got it all wrong.

640
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,714
<i>Kendama</i> isn't just about using your arms.

641
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,682
It's all in the knees. That's the key.

642
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,353
I'd rather keep my efforts to myself.

643
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,654
-You're so earnest.
-Huh?

644
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,089
-You're earnest four-eyes.
-What?

645
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,125
Mr. Yashima, I totally misjudged you.

646
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,860
I'm sorry for doubting you.

647
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,696
Mr. Yashima, I beg your forgiveness.

648
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,697
Please lift your head.

649
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,500
I'm sorry for saying
you were into kinky stuff.

650
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,103
That's news to me, but no hard feelings.

651
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:54,579
YASHIMA KARAOKE SPECIAL

652
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,982
This is perfect for a Saturday afternoon.

653
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:01,986
Huh?

654
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,224
MR. ICHIRO OGAWA

655
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,593
It's from Nagisa's father, right?

656
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,331
I WILL TAILOR A SUIT FOR YOU
PLEASE COME ANYTIME

657
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,606
I guess I'll go.

658
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,678
When my daughter returns from France,
she'll laugh if she sees me like this.

659
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,880
Huh?

660
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:55,840
Father.

661
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,080
You came.

662
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,815
May I come in?

663
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,716
Of course.

664
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,721
To the second floor, please.

665
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,064
This way.

666
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:20,965
Okay.

667
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,605
This is for taking measurements.
Please change into this.

668
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,506
Right.

669
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,641
Here.

670
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,410
How long will it take?

671
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,013
I'm still recovering,
so it might take longer than usual.

672
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,913
I see.

673
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,158
What fabric would you like?

674
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,760
I'll leave it to you.

675
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,261
Well then,

676
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,765
how about a standard dark gray?

677
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,873
-Something like this.
-Okay.

678
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,357
Now that I look closely,
Nagisa does kind of resemble Junko.

679
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:20,958
Excuse me.

680
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,062
How long have you been a tailor?

681
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,530
For 33 years.

682
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,899
Eighteen years in Kobe.

683
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,436
And 15 years here.

684
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,973
My father was strict,
so it took me a while to go independent.

685
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:41,779
But after five years, he finally told me
to make a suit from scratch on my own.

686
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,116
I wanted my very first suit

687
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,052
to be a gift for Junko's father.

688
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,888
So I gathered my courage

689
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,124
and wrote you a letter.

690
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,932
<i>Please forgive</i>

691
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,803
<i>This sudden letter</i>

692
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,742
<i>Father, allow me</i>

693
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:17,748
<i>To gift you a suit</i>

694
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,021
<i>Not an off-the-rack suit</i>

695
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:28,159
<i>But a custom-made one</i>

696
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:34,832
<i>Please come to Kobe</i>

697
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:41,906
<i>So I can take your measurements</i>

698
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,010
But I didn't come.

699
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,812
Sorry about that.

700
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,582
I think you know by now,
but it's just who I am.

701
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,286
No, you came.

702
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,224
Junko said she'd drag you if she had to.

703
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,693
<i>And she went to Tokyo to fetch you.</i>

704
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,794
Hey.

705
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,331
What are you doing, geezer?

706
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,966
Let's go to Kobe.

707
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,835
Like hell, silly.

708
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,303
You might say that,

709
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,574
but you placed the letter on the <i>butsudan</i>.

710
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,177
I couldn't just toss it out.

711
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,080
Come on, the taxi's waiting outside.

712
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,449
I don't want to go.

713
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,657
Nagisa wants to meet her grandpa.

714
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,828
We're here.

715
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,796
Hey.

716
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,167
Come on. Get in.

717
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,142
Father.

718
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,843
Hey.

719
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,549
Nagisa, your grandpa from Tokyo is here.

720
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,384
Welcome.

721
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,654
<i>Shoulder width</i>

722
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,856
<i>Back width</i>

723
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,159
<i>Chest width</i>

724
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,561
<i>Sleeve length</i>

725
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,296
<i>Center back sleeve length</i>

726
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,098
Huh?

727
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,100
Sorry, I made a mistake.

728
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,768
Can I start over?

729
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,669
Sure.

730
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,807
<i>My lack of experience,
coupled with intense nerves,</i>

731
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,409
<i>kept causing me to mess up and start over.</i>

732
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,346
<i>Shoulder width</i>

733
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,880
You must be a pro with shoulders.

734
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,781
Right, alien?

735
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,918
<i>Chest width</i>

736
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,520
Wait, the back width comes first.

737
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,589
I forgot to take notes.

738
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,124
Let's take a break.

739
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,125
Let's rest.

740
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm sorry, Father.

741
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,928
It's fine.

742
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,396
Don't worry about it.

743
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,598
Come on, Nagisa.

744
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,600
Sit on Grandpa's lap.

745
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,501
Huh?

746
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,936
Come on.

747
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,006
Come here.

748
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,848
Take a photo.

749
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,449
I held her?

750
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,251
I'm going to hold Nagisa?

751
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,389
This is the photo I took that day.

752
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,359
By golly!

753
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,695
That's a good photo!

754
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,264
When is this? How many years from now?

755
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,237
What is it? Again?

756
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,819
January of 1995, huh?

757
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,788
<i>In the end,</i>

758
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,158
by the time my father finished with
the measurements, it was already late.

759
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,260
And my grandfather missed the last train.

760
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,597
So the three of them decided
to go to a bar that stayed open all night.

761
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,667
-<i>And they killed time over drinks.</i>
-Thank you.

762
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,804
She was a handful, let me tell you.

763
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,439
She was such a hussy.

764
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,275
She was constantly after hanky-panky,
I mean rumpy-pumpy.

765
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,176
Shut up already.

766
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,777
Go to sleep. I'll wake you up.

767
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,180
No way, silly! I'm pulling an all-nighter.

768
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,049
SEIRYU

769
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,984
Thank you.

770
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,122
I'll walk him to the station.

771
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,290
All right.

772
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,927
Father, once your suit is ready,
I'll come drop it off.

773
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,795
Don't be silly. I'll pick it up myself.

774
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,031
Not to see you guys.

775
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,432
I'll come to see Nagisa.

776
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,167
Sure. Bye.

777
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,239
Take care!

778
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,042
Hey, watch it.

779
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,257
<i>That…</i>

780
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,194
was January 17th,

781
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,464
5:46 a.m.

782
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,967
Forgive me.

783
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,838
If I hadn't been so slow
with taking your measurements…

784
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,243
You and Junko would have survived.

785
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,616
<i>Does he</i>

786
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,317
know about this?

787
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,156
I think

788
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,426
he's finding out now.

789
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,265
We can't keep this from him forever.

790
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,972
I think he already knew.

791
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,410
What?

792
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,679
Remember?

793
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,981
The day I first met you.

794
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,319
I wanted to show myself
in a wedding dress to my father soon.

795
00:40:56,187 --> 00:41:00,124
My mother passed away in the year
of the Great Hanshin earthquake.

796
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,992
The Great Hanshin earthquake?

797
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,396
When you don't know something,
you just Google it, like this.

798
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,430
See?

799
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,799
What? Are you kidding me?

800
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,935
1995? That's nine years from now.

801
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,636
An earthquake that big?

802
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,039
Huh, I see.

803
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,007
I'll keep that in mind.

804
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:22,379
When he found out
that your mother was his own daughter,

805
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,315
he knew about her passing.

806
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,531
What?

807
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,835
So he knew already

808
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,038
and played along with our lies?

809
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,149
I see.

810
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:02,887
I see.

811
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,156
But I'm glad.

812
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,427
I was able to become friendly with you,
patch things up,

813
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,631
share some drinks, and hold my grandkid.

814
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,834
I get to enjoy all that in the future.

815
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,738
I'm looking forward to it!

816
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,278
So,

817
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:28,913
where's my suit?

818
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,153
Hey.

819
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:40,758
Right.

820
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,860
I'd brought it from Kobe.

821
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,564
<i>This is the first suit</i>

822
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,333
<i>I tailored</i>

823
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,240
<i>A suit</i>

824
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,275
<i>For my father</i>

825
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,582
<i>The first suit</i>

826
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,318
<i>I am tailoring</i>

827
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,791
<i>A suit</i>

828
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,327
<i>For my father</i>

829
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,970
<i>If your figure</i>

830
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,773
<i>Is unchanged</i>

831
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:34,445
<i>It's still the same</i>

832
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:41,952
<i>It should suit you very well</i>

833
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,680
Hey.

834
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,482
What do you think?

835
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,450
You look great.

836
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,257
Of course, you do.

837
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,327
Dad made that suit.

838
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,103

839
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,191
You don't know? You're behind.

840
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,893
-Is it behind the times?
-The topics and wording…

841
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,061
They're like something from old stories.

842
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,962
When geezers can't find
hope in the future,

843
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,798
they start reminiscing about the past.

844
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,033
The only one allowed to mock my dad

845
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,235
is me, his daughter.

846
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,004
I'm back, Junko.

847
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:07,905
