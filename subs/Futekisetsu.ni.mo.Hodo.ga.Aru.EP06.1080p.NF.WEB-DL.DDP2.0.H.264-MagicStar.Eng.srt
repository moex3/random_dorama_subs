1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,940
This is Yuki Hamura
from the drama department.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,342
We joined the company in the same year.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,311
What's the matter? Did you have an affair?

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,545
That's rude.

5
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,515
Come on, who hasn't had an affair or two?

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,951
Affairs were all the rage in Showa 60.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,853
Even Eiji Bando was popular.

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,688
Haven't you heard of <i>Kintsuma</i>?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,297
D-Don't worry.

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,967
In the end, he'll be really empathetic.

11
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,171
Starting this spring, she's teaming up
with a big-shot scriptwriter

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,839
to create a new drama.

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,075
Have you heard of Kentaro Emo?

14
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,411
The only screenwriter I know
is James Miki.

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,981
From the late 90s to the early 2000s,

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,151
he was the leading writer
who had massive support from the youth.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,186
He's famous for <i>An Eye for an Eye and</i>…

18
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,521
<i>Love for My Brother</i>.

19
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,657
Oh, yeah! Back in high school,
everyone was hooked on it.

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,559
That iconic scene in the broadcast room.

21
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,829
"I can't return your love, because I…"

22
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,566
And then, Haruka, the protagonist,
realizes the mic is on.

23
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,435
Exactly, she realizes the mic is on!

24
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,703
Haruka freaks out
and pushes the teacher down.

25
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,106
But then the teacher drops the bomb.

26
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,775
"Because I'm your brother."

27
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,812
And it's broadcast to the whole school!

28
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,147
Every student in the school hears it.

29
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,217
Then, in the gym,
someone shoots a basketball,

30
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,519
and it shifts to slow motion,
but the ball…

31
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,454
misses.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,323
It misses! That was a metaphor, wasn't it?

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,958
He was the wizard of metaphors!

34
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,861
You're not impressed?

35
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,498
No. That's not true. I'm enjoying this.

36
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,967
Oh, speaking of Emoken,

37
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,136
there was a drama
about a street gang in Shimbashi?

38
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,038
<i>SSLP</i>, <i>Shimbashi SL Park</i>.

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,940
We used to copy the SL boys' fashion!

40
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,576
What was the iconic line
from the protagonist again?

41
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,944
"That's so neutral!"

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,178
"So neutral!"

43
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,347
Not many chances
to drop that line these days.

44
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,515
I know, right?

45
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,818
Sorry for leaving you hanging.

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,522
No worries. Don't mind me.

47
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,426
Anyway, he's like the
embodiment of my youth.

48
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,995
I've always dreamt
of working with him in this industry,

49
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,296
but it was impossible!

50
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,532
I didn't want to risk
seeming like a cringy fan.

51
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,501
So your dream finally came true.

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,904
Yes. We had a meeting today.

53
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,005
As it turns out…

54
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,509
I wish I never met him.

55
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,580
It's been so long since I've visited EBS.
What was my last project?

56
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>Love Navigation</i> in 2003.

57
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,152
<i>LN</i>, huh?

58
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,354
You guys probably don't know me.

59
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,688
I bet you weren't even born.

60
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,260
Anyway, it's an honor to collaborate with…

61
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,662
I have a fun story
about the <i>LN</i> wrap-up party.

62
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,766
We were at an Italian place in Roppongi,
and I had a little spat with Johnny.

63
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,368
You know him as Giba now.

64
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,336
And Show Aikawa ended up stopping us.

65
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,106
As we were leaving,
the bill was already settled.

66
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,340
Guess who covered it.

67
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,509
-<i>What do you call it, idle talk?</i>
-Mariko Kaga.

68
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,711
<i>He kept on bragging for nearly two hours.</i>

69
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,246
And it was all…

70
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,215
-Is it behind the times?
-Exactly.

71
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,818
He was totally dwelling on the past
in his choice of words and topics.

72
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:10,156
What inspired me to join this industry
was your <i>Eye for an Eye and</i>…

73
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,325
I can't stand people
who dwell on the past.

74
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,862
Right. I'm sorry.

75
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,730
There are sexual services
for women, right?

76
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,965
Huh?

77
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,803
An ordinary housewife stumbles upon
sexual services for women by chance.

78
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,306
But then her daughter finds out by chance.

79
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,907
That's from <i>LN</i>, right?

80
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,677
In the third episode of <i>LN</i>…

81
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,982
I was amazed at how ahead
of the times you were.

82
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,151
-I remember so--
-How about a shared house?

83
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,788
A bookstore owner and an actress
meet by chance

84
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,823
and end up living together by chance.

85
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,725
So come up with those chance scenarios!

86
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,293
As a screenwriter, it's his job!

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,296
Wait, an actress and a bookstore owner?

88
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,232
Yup, it's totally from <i>Notting Hill</i>.

89
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,167
Yikes.

90
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,802
Why is he like this?

91
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,639
The truth is,
Mr. Emo announced a hiatus in 2008.

92
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,110
<i>Let's delve into what Emoken
has been up to during his break.</i>

93
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,546
He suddenly developed a passion
for environmental issues,

94
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,949
relocated to Okinawa, and started blogging
about ecology and slow living.

95
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,419
In his personal life, he abruptly married
a model 19 years his junior,

96
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,954
but they split 18 months later.

97
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,358
He raised funds through crowdfunding
to open a salon, but it closed.

98
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,227
Lately, he's been sharing
about his relationship

99
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,296
with an influencer 19 years his junior.

100
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,001
Apart from his romantic history,
everything he does is inconsistent.

101
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,437
In fact, the higher-ups are saying
he can't attract enough viewers anymore.

102
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,375
I bet it's tough for him
to admit he's old news now.

103
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,778
Which makes it hard for me
to work with him.

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,781
Why don't I tell him?

105
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,682
Huh?

106
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,550
Tell him what?

107
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,820
"Stop sharing old stories.
They're outdated and bothering everyone."

108
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,088
Please don't.

109
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,124
Someone older should tell him.

110
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,892
When's your next meeting?

111
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,329
Wednesday, from 4 p.m.

112
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,930
I happen to be free.

113
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,367
Hey.

114
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,969
Are you okay?

115
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,304
What do you mean?

116
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,173
Nothing.

117
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:15,915
<i>This man is Mr. Ichiro Ogawa,
EBS TV's counselor.</i>

118
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,486
<i>He was my grandfather
on my late mother's side.</i>

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,868
Say, Kiyoshi,

120
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,004
how long are you staying here?

121
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,341
I don't know. I've got to ask Mom.

122
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,377
Am I a bother?

123
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,378
No.

124
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,681
She's a sociologist, right?

125
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,987
<i>Eiji Okuda is about to have an affair
with Ryoko Moriyama.</i>

126
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,124
<i>Ryoko Moriyama
and Tomoko Ogawa are best friends.</i>

127
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>It's unsettling.</i>

128
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,996
<i>What's with Eiji Okuda's sexiness?</i>

129
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,999
<i>I didn't get it as a child but now I do.</i>

130
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,603
<i>Anyone would get the butterflies.</i>

131
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,138
<i>And…</i>

132
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,807
<i>I love this person
more than anything in the world.</i>

133
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,911
<i>Eiji Bando's likability just skyrocketed.</i>

134
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,548
<i>A child is happiest
when their parents get along.</i>

135
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,118
<i>And parents are happiest</i>

136
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,287
<i>when children get along.</i>

137
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,525
-This is such a tearjerker.
-<i>So who cares what other people say?</i>

138
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,997
<i>Your dad loves your mom.</i>

139
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,866
<i>A whole lot.</i>

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,107
Welcome back.

141
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,046
What?

142
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,884
Junko wants to know
how long we're staying.

143
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,787
As long as <i>Kintsuma</i> is running.

144
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,221
That's a rerun.

145
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,258
Kiyoshi doesn't want to go back.

146
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,627
Dinner isn't ready yet.

147
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,163
What?

148
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,298
Has there been any word?

149
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,434
From your father?

150
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,605
Not today.

151
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,308
Not today? So, not today either.

152
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,144
Is he really in the future?

153
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,279
Maybe he's playing elsewhere.

154
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,680
Hey, be quiet!

155
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,116
<i>Can we read one more? We can?</i>

156
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,819
<i>Okay, the handle is
Mysterious Transfer Student.</i>

157
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,587
-No way.
-That's me!

158
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,788
<i>Hanky-panky apple.</i>

159
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,926
<i>"There's a student in my class
I haven't met yet."</i>

160
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,929
<i>"It seems he hasn't come to school
since I transferred."</i>

161
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,730
<i>"And he won't answer the phone."</i>

162
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,599
<i>"Hey, S."</i>

163
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,402
<i>"If you peek under
your TV's cathode ray tube,</i>

164
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,438
<i>you might be able to see Iyo's pants."</i>

165
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,041
<i>This kid is so silly!</i>

166
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,046
I'm from Class B, Grade 3 at School 6--

167
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,681
The Mysterious Transfer Student.

168
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,352
I'm sorry. He doesn't want to see anyone.

169
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,423
<i>Mysterious Transfer Student,
you've won a present.</i>

170
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,792
<i>Writer Emoken's personal sunglasses.</i>

171
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,961
-Shall we head back?
-<i>You might not want them.</i>

172
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,296
Sunglasses were fine,

173
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,467
but he kept giving away my stuff
like my wristwatch and sneakers.

174
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,735
It was such a pain.

175
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,138
Everyone has interesting pasts, huh?
How about we start discussing--

176
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,575
Zucchi took really good care of me.

177
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,546
Do you guys know
<i>Be Early or There Will Be Hanky-Panky</i>?

178
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,415
It was a program that would never fly
compliance-wise today.

179
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,019
It's not <i>Be Early</i>, it's <i>Go to Bed Early
or There Will Be Hanky-Panky</i>.

180
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:40,920
Who?

181
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,589
Someone gets what I'm talking about.

182
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,025
This is our company's counselor,
Mr. Ogawa.

183
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
I've been to a public filming
of <i>Hanky-Panky.</i>

184
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,965
Have you heard of the drama
featuring the Hanky-Panky girls?

185
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>Hanky-Panky on Friday,
and More Hanky-Panky on Saturday</i>.

186
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,237
No way, that's my debut piece!

187
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,273
Wow. It's not even on Wikipedia.

188
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,574
What are you, a Showa geek?

189
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,911
You can ask me anything up until Showa 61.

190
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,313
I'll take it from here.
Everyone, back to your jobs.

191
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,514
Or head home if you can.

192
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,349
Good work.

193
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,222
Let me tell you,
that drama was such a pain to make.

194
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,025
The other lead was such a poor actor
we had to pull in--

195
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,359
Toshinori Omi.

196
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,195
Exactly, Omi accepted the role.

197
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,064
-And the theme song was…
-Senri Oe.

198
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,866
Senri Oe, exactly!

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,467
No, it was Omega Tribe.

200
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,803
Wait, you know more than I do.

201
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,305
Let's grab drinks in Kasumicho.

202
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,442
You were late.
How many bars did you hit up?

203
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,410
Three.

204
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,514
I had a blast myself
talking about the good old days.

205
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,253
Did it make you want to return?

206
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,454
To Showa?

207
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,825
I can't.

208
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,961
I'm too busy, thanks to you guys.

209
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,896
I'm going to be on TV.

210
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,698
What?

211
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,701
Wait, you two know each other?

212
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,235
That'll save us time.

213
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,871
I was just looking for a participant.

214
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,208
Mr. Kazushige Nagashima
keeps going away to Hawaii.

215
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,044
What do you say?

216
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,647
A general knowledge quiz?

217
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,716
Me? You can't pick me.

218
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,351
Everything I say is inappropriate.

219
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,086
That's why you're perfect.

220
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,554
TV is so dull these days.

221
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,156
Everyone's so neutral.

222
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,291
Don't you agree, Uryu?

223
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,626
You

224
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,160
should be on this.

225
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,196
So, I'll be staying here for a while.

226
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't you miss your daughter, Junko?

227
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,938
Sorry. Maybe I should've put Ms.

228
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,707
If I see her,
I might let my emotions show.

229
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,142
I'm like an open book.

230
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,410
Is it already showing?

231
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,512
Yeah.

232
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,247
I bet it would distress Junko as well

233
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,218
if I told her, "In nine years,
you and I are going to die."

234
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm going to bed.

235
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,671
MR. OGAWA

236
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,472
Found it.

237
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,775
MR. OGAWA

238
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,876
MR. OGAWA
CALLING

239
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,082
SAKAE

240
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,007
MR. OGAWA

241
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,379
This is stupid.

242
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,665
Let go of me!

243
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,834
What is this place? What university?

244
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,369
The lab of the Metropolis Institute
of Technology.

245
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,371
Please go see Junko.

246
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,273
What?

247
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,776
Um…

248
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,977
I mean…

249
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,747
It just feels like

250
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,749
you're like, you know,

251
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,384
running from like, some kind of problem.

252
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,619
You use "like" a lot.

253
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,723
If I were a parent, I'd want to spend
as much time as possible with my kid.

254
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,459
What would I do if I saw her?

255
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,794
I can't tell her the truth.

256
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,095
Why not?

257
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,631
What good will that do?
I can't change the future!

258
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,133
Why can't you?

259
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,801
You can't do that.

260
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,505
Since I arrived early,

261
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:57,376
I asked him to give me a tour and explain
the principle of the time machine.

262
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,779
I'm not concerned with the specifics.

263
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,781
Just transport Ichiro to the past.

264
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,916
Forget it. I don't want to go.

265
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,685
This project has government recognition,

266
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,922
but trial runs are currently
being conducted in secret.

267
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,091
Only one bus runs on Saturday.

268
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,826
Saturday?

269
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,030
It leaves at 4:55 a.m.
and returns at 3:55 p.m.

270
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,600
<i>My son added the times
to the timetable to remember them,</i>

271
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,068
<i>and he hid it with tape.</i>

272
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,104
Currently,

273
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,207
<i>there are 50 passengers,
including my wife and son,</i>

274
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,076
<i>registered on a face recognition system.</i>

275
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,445
What? Then why was I able to
board the bus?

276
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,182
That's because…

277
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,920
when setting up
the facial recognition system,

278
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,523
I used your photo as a sample.

279
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,239
That's creepy.

280
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,709
I was born with weak semicircular canals,

281
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,146
and when I got on the bus,
my ears went "eeee."

282
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,215
That's why I switched
to a self-driving bus.

283
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,584
That explains the other passengers.

284
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,385
Any other questions?

285
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,989
Why did I fall into the bathroom
both times I returned to the past?

286
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,724
That's because…

287
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,827
I don't know.

288
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,063
Why don't you know that?

289
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,235
Did you know…

290
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,971
that I'm going to die?

291
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,806
Of course.

292
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,042
I visit your grave every year.

293
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,245
I'm in a grave, huh?

294
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,881
You should've said, baldy.

295
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:48,754
What if you stop Junko
from meeting the black suit at a disco…

296
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,688
No way.

297
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,024
Why not?
Both you and Junko will be able to live.

298
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,659
Nagisacchi wouldn't exist!

299
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,676
It's inevitable. It can't be helped.

300
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,279
Dying isn't a negative event.

301
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,683
Rather, having the chance to meet you
as an adult is a positive experience.

302
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,021
I'm already dead, after all.

303
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:26,992
Grandpa…

304
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,435
I guess I'll go see your mom
after so long.

305
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,339
Crap.

306
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,274
Kiyoshi, wait!

307
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,077
You forgot your rice balls!

308
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,978
Hey!

309
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,613
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

310
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,847
Hey!

311
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,616
-Morning.
-Morning.

312
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,753
I spotted Yuki Matsumura
at a station in Kinshicho!

313
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,755
No way! The Baddest Punk in Kawahama?

314
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,656
Why was he there?

315
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,658
He's probably shooting a new drama.

316
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,926
Skip school?

317
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,227
Definitely!

318
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,195
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

319
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,300
Junko.

320
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,237
You're back.

321
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,741
Where did you get that?

322
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,477
It's custom-made.

323
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,047
What do you think?

324
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,983
ICHIRO OGAWA

325
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,051
Pretty cool.

326
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,660
Junko.

327
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,532
Yeah.

328
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,901
I'm back.

329
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,571
I'm back, Junko.

330
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,140
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

331
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,611
Hey, my friends are watching.

332
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,086
Take good care of Junko.

333
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,888
Oh, okay.

334
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,494
Too tight.

335
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,462
Mr. Ogawa?

336
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,432
What are you doing?

337
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,601
Sakae.

338
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,704
Thanks for looking after things
while I was gone.

339
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,039
Whoa, hey!

340
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,174
Stop. It's too early for that.

341
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,075
What?!

342
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,750
Mr. Ogawa, where have you been?

343
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,919
Just somewhere else.

344
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,054
-Mr. Principal!
-What?

345
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,722
Check this out.

346
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,290
-You wear it like this.
-What? No.

347
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,224
There you go.

348
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,826
Huh? Hey.

349
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,694
-What's this?
-You've caused us trouble.

350
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,264
Even as an assistant,
you can't just be absent without--

351
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,534
Now, Mr. Yasumori,
you're a Hanshin fan, aren't you?

352
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,737
This is an Okada mug commemorating
their victory after 38 years.

353
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,872
After 38 years?

354
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,541
What do you mean, 38 years?

355
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,009
What is this?

356
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,144
Women! I see women!

357
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,479
Huh?

358
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,350
Eat up. Eat more, Junko!

359
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,220
I feel a little bad
for joining you for dinner.

360
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,757
We're going to have a lot to do
with each other ahead.

361
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,459
Right.

362
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,393
Is that so?

363
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,329
Maybe you're my future husband.

364
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,935
Huh? Is he really?

365
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,837
Never mind. Just eat.

366
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,972
Forget the leeks.
Eat the meat two slices at a time!

367
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,042
Do people in the future eat sukiyaki too?

368
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,777
We mostly eat the same stuff.

369
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,512
The saury gets smaller, though.

370
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,716
Hmm.

371
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,985
What's with the "hmm."

372
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,887
Something seems off.

373
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,590
You didn't go to the future, did you?

374
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,959
Sorry.

375
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,129
I've been feeling like I'm not keeping up.

376
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,063
With what?

377
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,699
With the conversation
about the future and stuff.

378
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,470
Should I take all of this
with a grain of salt?

379
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,574
How about another egg?

380
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,709
Yes, please.

381
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,313
You were in Susukino, weren't you?

382
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,015
Junko!

383
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,819
I can explain.
I had a spat with my wife in the past.

384
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,189
When Junko was still a kid,
she had a fever and was crying.

385
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,325
But I was sitting there,
watching an <i>11 PM</i> special on Susukino.

386
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,493
And I failed to notice.

387
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,697
I'm surprised you remember.

388
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,432
Don't dodge the question.

389
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,735
You're lying to me.

390
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,670
Do you have any proof?

391
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,139
Tell us something surprising
about the future,

392
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,841
if you really did go to the future.

393
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,511
Tell me what it's like
38 years down the road.

394
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,719
Junko Mihara becomes a Diet member.

395
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,121
What?!

396
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,556
That's a lie!

397
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,157
It's true. She's an active politician.

398
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,159
You expect us to believe that?

399
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,397
She's Reiko Yamada,
the queen of hussies, our role model.

400
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,099
She's famous for saying,
"Not the face, focus on his body."

401
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,435
And she's in politics now? Unbelievable.

402
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,771
She's confusing reality with <i>Mr. Kinpachi</i>.

403
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,872
I've got one more.

404
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,640
You'll be astonished.

405
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,243
Kato-chan

406
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,513
at the age of 80, has a wife who's 35.

407
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,315
What?!

408
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,217
Are you kidding me?

409
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,686
If his wife is 35 in 38 years,

410
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,554
she hasn't even been born!

411
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,489
That's scary! It's like a sci-fi story!

412
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,091
Kin-chan is 82.

413
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,561
He drops out of university when he's 78.

414
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,263
Stop. The fabric of time and space…

415
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,831
It's unraveling!

416
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,767
What about Matchy? Our idol?

417
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,005
After a series of events,
he becomes a racer.

418
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,641
That's our Matchy!

419
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,767
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,470
I don't know what to say.

421
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,340
I don't care about myself.

422
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,643
I can die whenever.

423
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,680
But not Junko.

424
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,285
To think she only has 26 years to live.

425
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,456
It's too short.

426
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,759
No matter how you look at it.

427
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,572
Totally.

428
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,010
My wife was often sick,

429
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,914
so I took special care of Junko's health.

430
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,218
But all that effort will be wasted.
Damn it.

431
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,360
If you know how your life will play out,

432
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,397
is there even a point in living?

433
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,879
It can't be helped.

434
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,349
Not this.

435
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,887
Sorry.

436
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,493
You're about the only one I can talk to.

437
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,165
So…

438
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,434
what are you going to do?

439
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,073
What would you do?

440
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,978
If you knew that your son
only had nine years left to live,

441
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,848
would you tell him?

442
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,123
If there's no way to change his fate,
there's no use in telling him.

443
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,561
That would be
my line of thinking, I think.

444
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,235
Is it really inevitable?

445
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,384
Up to the point that Nagisa is born,

446
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,788
Junko's life isn't bad.

447
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,489
It's wonderful, in fact.

448
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,327
We're all smiles,

449
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,630
Junko and I.

450
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,301
The problem is what comes next.

451
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,137
I know…

452
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,308
what happens after this.

453
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,879
And yet, I can't…

454
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,593
Maybe you're supposed to worry about it

455
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,728
when that moment comes.

456
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,867
If the situation will stay the same

457
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,037
whether you fret about it now or later,

458
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,906
maybe it's best to enjoy the present

459
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,243
and live life the way you want to.

460
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,096
You're right.

461
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,899
It's not happening right away.

462
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,337
We still have nine years ahead of us.

463
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,241
Nine years left to live.

464
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,817
You…

465
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,755
You were here?

466
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,223
Why did you think I was gone?

467
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,826
Quiet! Come over here.

468
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,931
My stomach hurt because I ate too much.

469
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,766
So, I was using the bathroom

470
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,302
when you guys, like,
started this serious conversation.

471
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,306
And it was like, I didn't even exist,

472
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,708
and I couldn't like, step out.

473
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,210
You sure use "like" a lot.

474
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,212
I'm not the type of guy
to leave without a word.

475
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,152
I always make sure to say
thank you before I leave.

476
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,655
-I've got decency.
-Sorry about that.

477
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,822
Take care on your way home.

478
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,024
Hey.

479
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,626
Is Junko going to die?

480
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,794
Let's step outside.

481
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,362
Come on.

482
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,270
What's going on? Is something the matter?

483
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,805
Huh?

484
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,807
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

485
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,710
-Junko. Is Junko going to die?
-Listen, Akitsu. Hey!

486
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,645
Calm down. Listen to me.

487
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,714
That was

488
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,149
all an act.

489
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,117
An act?

490
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,319
Yes, just an act.

491
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,955
We lied for you to hear,

492
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,490
to make a man out of you.

493
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,359
To make

494
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,394
a man out of me?

495
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,295
That's right.

496
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,401
Junko is experiencing
the frogification phenomenon right now.

497
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,937
Junko is turning into a frog?

498
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,840
It's when you lose interest in your crush

499
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,710
the moment
they start paying attention to you.

500
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,211
Girls are like that.

501
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,646
So,

502
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,549
it's best to distance yourself for now

503
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,218
and make her feel anxious.

504
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,823
I don't…

505
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,026
dislike doing that sort of thing.

506
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,928
-Good.
-Yeah.

507
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,865
-Hey.
-Huh?

508
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,735
How was Yasuko Sawaguchi?

509
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,572
She was working for S.R.I.

510
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,174
What about Yuki Saito?

511
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,477
She was in the investigation division.

512
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,678
The delinquent detective?

513
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,146
Cool.

514
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,315
What about me?

515
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:31,850
What?

516
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,452
Never mind. I don't want to know.

517
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,621
I want to keep it a surprise.

518
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,494
Goodnight.

519
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,230
Goodnight.

520
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,238
CAFE &amp; BAR SCANDAL

521
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,640
<i>She's excited about the future.</i>

522
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,909
<i>Now, I really can't tell her.</i>

523
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,048
<i>It's Thursday.</i>

524
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,116
<i>Still two days to go.</i>

525
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,786
<i>Even though I'm finally back home,</i>

526
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,621
<i>the week feels unbearably long.</i>

527
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,423
Give me one.

528
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,491
Here.

529
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,066
-Barkeep.
-Huh?

530
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,601
How much longer will you run this place?

531
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,537
Five years at most, I think.

532
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,639
Why?

533
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,409
It's about time.
The customers are dwindling, after all.

534
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,348
Things were at their peak
around the time of the Tokyo Olympics.

535
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,817
1964.

536
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,752
I went to catch the events.

537
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,854
I was so bummed
seeing Abebe wearing shoes.

538
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,092
Crap. My daughter
is going to scold me again.

539
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,259
Junko?

540
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,428
She always says,
"Don't dwell on the past!"

541
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,496
I wonder why.

542
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,199
Reminiscing is easier.

543
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,802
Talking about the future at our age
brings us down.

544
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,705
When geezers can't find
hope in the future,

545
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,108
they start reminiscing about the past.

546
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,077
Junko is just getting started.

547
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,979
She has a brilliant future ahead of her.

548
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,447
What's not to envy?

549
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,188
Hey!

550
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,490
Wake up, ugly!

551
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,891
Get out of bed, you little!

552
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,892
Shut up.

553
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,660
Don't barge in, you short gorilla!

554
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,131
If I'm a short gorilla,
that makes you an ugly gorilla!

555
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,834
Come on, you little!

556
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,372
Junko, what's your plan for today?

557
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,241
Huh? School.

558
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,376
It's Saturday, so it's a half-day, right?

559
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,278
Just say "after school."

560
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,047
Come with me.
I've got something to show you.

561
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,483
We're catching the 3:55 p.m. bus,

562
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,520
so meet me at School-6-ura bus stop
ten minutes beforehand.

563
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
Huh?

564
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,490
Mr. Ogawa…

565
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,894
No way, you're creeping me out.
What do you want to show me?

566
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,432
Go, Junko. You should go.

567
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,405
SCHOOL-6-URA

568
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,640
Take care, Junko.

569
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,310
Watch out for touts, themed cafes,
and owing hosts.

570
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,546
What? I didn't get any of that.

571
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,714
Where are we going?

572
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,892
Come on.

573
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,464
Hey.

574
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:34,899
What are you doing?

575
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,868
You should, too. Your ears will go "eeee."

576
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,875
<i>We are stopping at Shiga Icchome.</i>

577
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,014
All right.

578
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,486
What do you think?

579
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,522
What do you mean?

580
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,357
It's nothing special.

581
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,092
Look at that.

582
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,563
What the hell is that?

583
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,432
It's the Skytree.

584
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,704
She has something dangling from her ears.

585
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,807
That person and that person too.

586
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,041
They're called AirPods.

587
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,913
They're showing their tummies.

588
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,749
So slim! Their waists are so slim.

589
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,517
Thanks for going up there.

590
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,485
Can I get on now?

591
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,854
I'll keep it steady.

592
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,055
Yes, thank you.

593
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,202
Junko, these people…

594
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:50,608
have taken good care of me
here in this world.

595
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm Nagisa Inushima.

596
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,316
Cool name.

597
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,419
From "Nagisa no Haikara Ningyo"?

598
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,322
Yeah.

599
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,192
This man is my father.

600
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,698
Come on, Dad.

601
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,435
Stop crying. You're scaring Junko.

602
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,772
Your father has told me about you.

603
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,674
Junko the hussy.

604
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,574
What?

605
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,143
You want me to kill you?

606
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,445
You really are a hussy!

607
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,048
Is it seriously 2024 now?

608
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,683
This isn't a prank?

609
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,785
It's not. This is Reiwa 6.

610
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,687
Look at the barkeep.

611
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,888
He's doddering.

612
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,591
Mutchy?

613
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,859
That's my dad.

614
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,795
I'm his son, Masahiko.

615
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,563
So you're Matchy.

616
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,967
Hey, Junko,

617
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,770
would you like to watch
your father at work?

618
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,140
Sure.

619
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,109
You're so late, Ogawa.

620
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,911
I had to come because I was so worried.

621
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,047
You should focus on that script instead.

622
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,352
Mr. Ogawa, today
you'll be competing in pairs.

623
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,454
This is your partner.

624
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,655
I'm Yuki Matsumura.

625
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,125
What?! The Baddest Punk in Kawahama?

626
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,461
My goodness! It's him in the flesh!

627
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,662
This is his daughter.

628
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,398
Can she stay to watch? She'll be quiet.

629
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,466
Yes, sure.

630
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,167
-You're going to appear on TV?
-Yeah.

631
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,370
Where's Aesop? Isn't he with you?

632
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,738
Junko.

633
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm a big fan!

634
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,709
Welcome to <i>General Knowledge Quiz</i>,

635
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,646
<i>Reiwa Generation Z
vs. Showa Generation of Dads</i>!

636
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,887
Let's dive straight into the first round!

637
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,657
Representing Team Reiwa, we have
the popular TikTokers, Potemkins!

638
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,893
-Make sure to follow us!
-Make sure to follow us!

639
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,029
On the opposing side,
representing Team Showa,

640
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,898
is actor Mr. Yuki Matsumura
and Mr. Ichiro Ogawa.

641
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,133
Good to be here.

642
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,368
YUKI MATSUMURA
ICHIRO OGAWA

643
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:02,907
According to our notes,
Mr. Ogawa is EBS TV's counselor.

644
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,108
Is your job hard?

645
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:05,510
Oh, yeah.

646
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,812
The TV station is filled with cuckoos.

647
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,648
Thank goodness this isn't live.

648
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,518
Let's kick off with the first question.

649
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,053
Team Showa, it's your turn.

650
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,287
Insta…

651
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,423
-Sapporo Ichiban!
-No.

652
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,591
-Instant noodles…
-Sapporo Ichiban!

653
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,093
-Instant noodles…
-Miso!

654
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,961
-Soy sauce!
-Don't hit the table.

655
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,063
This isn't a buzzer quiz.
Please calm down.

656
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,398
Listen carefully. Here goes.

657
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:32,904
Instagram offers a feature
where you can share posts for 24 hours…

658
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,939
Stories.

659
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,040
Correct.

660
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,109
Yeah!

661
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,744
However,

662
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,182
due to Mr. Ogawa's incorrect response,
you don't earn any points.

663
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,117
Oh, man!

664
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,253
-My bad.
-No worries.

665
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,956
Now, on to the next question.

666
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,159
What is the name of this idol group?

667
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,530
I can't answer this one.
They all seem identical to me.

668
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,531
Thirty-eight!

669
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,732
You startled me!

670
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,301
No, I didn't ask how many.

671
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,403
-Good effort on the counting, but--
-Onyanko, right?

672
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,971
I know! It's School Mates!

673
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,107
That's old. That's ancient.

674
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,308
I'll give you a hint.

675
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,209
Hills.

676
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,243
Hill start!

677
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,444
-Wrong!
-Hills.

678
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,214
There's no group by that name.

679
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,315
Minato ward! Many slopes--

680
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,650
It's starting to look
like the Elderly Buzzer Quiz.

681
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,186
Unfortunately,
no points for you this round!

682
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,789
Now, it's Team Reiwa's turn.

683
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,890
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

684
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,894
This question is relevant
to today's guest, Mr. Yuki Matsumura.

685
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,029
It's about the Showa era's
delinquent culture.

686
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:36,134
A group attacking a delinquent
on their way to school,

687
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,103
trying to steal their unique pants.

688
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,873
This was known as "something" hunting.

689
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,940
-I have no idea.
-Now,

690
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,809
what is the name of this activity?

691
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,144
Geezer hunting!

692
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,311
That's it!

693
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,212
Right?

694
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,582
Today, Mr. Ogawa has come wearing
the special pants in question.

695
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,050
-Let's take a look.
-Okay.

696
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,553
Check this out.

697
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,222
-What's he got on?
-So lame!

698
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,857
I've never seen anything like it!

699
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,592
Is that a <i>hakama</i>?

700
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,827
Festive season vibes.

701
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,363
Okay, time's up!

702
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,099
The answer is <i>bontan</i> hunting!

703
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,735
Who'd want to wear pants
that lame, anyway?

704
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,471
These aren't pants. They're called <i>bontan</i>.

705
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,373
I wasn't asking you, Mr. Ogawa.

706
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,010
They might seem uncool now,
but punks used to be proud of them.

707
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,079
Back then, it was all about
who had the puffiest pants.

708
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,414
Like mounting?

709
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,682
Mounting? What's that?

710
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,350
Like climbing a mountain?

711
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,419
You're getting it wrong.

712
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,321
We're not even in the same book.

713
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,889
It shows how times have changed.

714
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,925
Anyway, neither team scored any points.

715
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,761
-All right, moving on--
-Hey.

716
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,230
What was that, huh?

717
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,431
Junko!

718
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,934
You should listen to my old man.

719
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,805
You've been showing a bias
toward the younger folks

720
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,774
and making fun of my dad.

721
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,242
Apologize.

722
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,543
It's rude.

723
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,213
I'm just following the script here…

724
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,683
Miss, that's the nature of this show.

725
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,718
Huh? What kind of show is that?

726
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,421
It's a show that pokes fun
at our dads' generation

727
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,289
and teases the youths' ignorance,

728
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,159
while also educating
and fostering mutual understanding.

729
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,861
-And updating old perspectives.
-I don't get it.

730
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,432
You're turning him into a joke.
Give me a break.

731
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,336
The only one allowed to mock my dad

732
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,504
is me, his daughter.

733
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,307
Junko.

734
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,410
If you're going to mock him,
at least make it amusing.

735
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,480
This isn't cutting it.
It's not funny at all.

736
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,483
Is this all you've come up with
after 38 years?

737
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,418
That's enough, Junko. Thank you.

738
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,787
Don't touch me.
I'm not doing this for you, geezer.

739
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:41,225
If you're the Baddest Punk in Kawahama,
say something!

740
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,562
That drama aired 40 years ago.

741
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,998
I just watched it the other day.

742
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,667
It moved me and made me cry.

743
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,702
You're only 17.

744
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,171
That's why you take things so seriously.

745
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,042
Isn't that right?
That's how we all were when we were 17.

746
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,444
We can't tell apart today's idols.

747
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,713
But we know Agnes Lum's BWH.

748
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,682
They're 90, 55, 92!

749
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,617
We remember that, don't we?

750
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,289

00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,600
<i>We wanted a Vespa</i>

<i>And delivered newspapers</i>

Kudo, you don't know?

756
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,508
You're behind.

Junko.

797

But this sight I'm seeing right now

798
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,812
will become a memory
I can reminisce about.

799
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,082
Just kidding.

800
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,020
What were you like when you were 17?

801
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,355
Me?

802
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,259
When I was 17, TV didn't exist.

803
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,694
-Huh?
-Yeah.

804
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,397
So, it was all about movies and the radio.

805
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,768
Hey.

806
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,737
Where did Junko go?

807
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,140
Hey, did she turn into a frog?

808
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,408
Lady.

809
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,644

-Old lady!
-Shut up!

-Can I have a soda float?

815
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,788
Okay.

816
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,959
<i>"There's a student in my class
I haven't met yet."</i>

817
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:10,728
Huh?

818
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:14,832
<i>"There was a time when I couldn't attend
junior high school either,</i>

820

please reply."</i>

822
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,550
Sorry for coming over so many times, I…

823
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,724
Come in.

824
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,495
Thanks.

825
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,565
There you are!

826
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,632
Nagisa!

827
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,703
Check it out! Mr. Emo submitted
the title and plot of the story.

828
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,773
That's amazing! What did you think?

829
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,141
I haven't read it yet.

830

<i>"Seventeen."</i>

<i>"I Won't Forget This Sight."</i>

832
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,750
It's a school drama.

833
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,587
I'm so excited, I feel sick!

834
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,322
But what if it sucks?

835
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,624
There's no way it could be bad.

836
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,660
You're right.
Emoken is the embodiment of our youth!

837
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,362
Thanks.

838
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,097
-Coffee, please.
-Just a moment.

839
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,307
Nagisa, so you have a kid?

840
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,875
Huh?

841
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,211
My dad told me.

842
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,714
I'm impressed.

843
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,049
You don't look like it at all.

844
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,086
Thanks.

845
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,021
Where's your husband?

846
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,094
We couldn't see eye to eye,
so we recently split up.

847
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,899
You're cool for working so hard.

848
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,501
I respect you.

849
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,279
Say, Junko.

850
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:15,719
Do you like kids?

851
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,422
Sure.

852
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,124
I love them!

853
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,629
Yeah?

854
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,338
Hey, after we're done,

855
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,606
let's go clothes shopping.

856
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,441
Huh?

857
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:42,012
I want to buy you some clothes.

858
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,714
Let's go to Harajuku.

859
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:45,416
Okay.

860
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,350

861
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,518
Do they have to be resolved?

862
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,319
They do. I'm a perfectionist.

863
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,588
-The deadline!
-I'm Naoki, I'll cut your hair.

864
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,590
I want to show you all the sights I know.

865
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,591
Where did Junko go?

866
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,226
-I might stay over.
-You can't!

867
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,761
-I like him.
-You've got to be kidding.

868
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,797
The last episode is undecided?

869
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,365
That's awesome!
