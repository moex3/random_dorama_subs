1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,875
They say you shouldn't do that.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:09,776
Huh?

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,312
Blowing on it. It doesn't help.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,114
I saw it on Yahoo! Chiebukuro.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,284
It's got Umaibo crumbs in it too.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,392
Hey, it works.

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,164
Well? Did you put it on?

8
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,468
Cute.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,004
That's nice, too.

10
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,440
Looks good on you.

11
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:42,876
Pretty.

12
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,677
Yay.

13
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,112
Perfect.

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,782
I don't know which one to pick.

15
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,383
Nagisa, what's your budget?

16
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,385
By the way,

17
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,788
doesn't your hair feel a bit heavy?

18
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,755
How about a trim?

19
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,490
What?

20
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,926
But you already got me a bunch of clothes.

21
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,827
It's fine.

22
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,997
I want you to look even cuter, Junko.

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,066
Let's go!

24
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,704
Hello.

25
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,540
Sorry about our sudden visit, Naoki.

26
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,041
This is the girl.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,678
You're cute.

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,214
I'm Naoki, I'll cut your hair.

29
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,455
Junko, I'll be working remotely
from the cafe across the street.

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,355
Okay.

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,291
Thank you.

32
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,261
What style should we go for?

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,701
Do you have any particular style
that you like, Junko?

34
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,003
Um…

35
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,739
You can decide.

36
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,176
I saw the article about the drama.

37
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,012
<i>Yeah. I'll share my screen with you.</i>

38
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,081
KENTARO EMO RETURNS
TO DRAMA AFTER 16 YEARS

39
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,918
<i>SEVENTEEN: I WON'T FORGET THIS SIGHT</i>
A REIWA LOVE STORY

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,122
"Glad I waited."

41
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,256
"This is so emotional."

42
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,726
"A school drama by Emoken!
So pumped for this one."

43
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,331
So far, the comments are all positive.

44
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,199
That's why I'm worried.

45
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,368
Anti-fans are bound to pop up eventually.

46
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,037
If Mr. Emo ever egosurfs,
he's going to hit a roadblock again.

47
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,973
Anti-fans? Egosurf?

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,043
<i>What was the name of the quiz show
you were on the other day, Mr. Ogawa?</i>

49
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,812
<i>General Knowledge Quiz</i>?

50
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,248
<i>General Knowledge Quiz</i>.
Search the hashtag.

51
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,616
That's egosurfing.

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,120
#GENERAL_KNOWLEDGE_QUIZ

53
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,127
"This shortie, Ogawa or something, sucks."

54
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,063
"So loud and annoying."

55
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,734
"He's like some PE teacher. LOL."

56
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,036
"Screw off, Ogawa."

57
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,738
"Go to hell, Ogawa."

58
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,008
Shut up, you idiots!

59
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,077
What do you know, anyway? What do you…

60
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,213
Damn it!

61
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,583
Who the hell are you? Come fight me!

62
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,352
Am I a PE teacher? The hell I am!

63
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,158
Those are the side effects
of egosurfing and dealing with anti-fans.

64
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,594
That's scary. Egosurfing is scary.

65
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,830
<i>When's the deadline
for the script of the first episode again?</i>

66
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:18,731
Friday.

67
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,534
But he hasn't finished
writing the script yet, has he?

68
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,603
Huh? Why are you asking me?

69
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,072
Huh?!

70
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,775
The influencer,
19 years his junior, posted this picture.

71
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,178
-<i>Seventeen</i>!
-<i>Seventeen</i>!

72
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,783
Let's order some wine.

73
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,351
A lighter red this time.

74
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,720
What? Aren't you going to get writing?

75
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,121
Don't you need to write?

76
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,291
Typing on the keyboard isn't
the only time I'm writing.

77
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,630
Just like waiting for wine to open up,

78
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:55,635
even in the time waiting
for my ideas to ripen,

79
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,771
I'm already in the process of writing.

80
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,507
Deep!

81
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,344
Minami, compared to your photos,
you seem a bit…

82
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,278
chubbier.

83
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,113
It's coming to me.

84
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,782
A 17-year-old girl…

85
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,351
-Take notes.
-Right.

86
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,753
That's when he went home,
but did he fail to write?

87
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,623
<i>Maybe he really is old news.</i>

88
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,523
Huh?

89
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,026
Is that Junko?

90
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,435
You look great.

91
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,471
What should I do?

92
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,539
I got asked out on a date.

93
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,540
<i>What?!</i>

94
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,709
The Skytree…

95
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,245
I mentioned wanting to go up there,

96
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,283
and he said he'd take me there
after he gets off work at 6 p.m.

97
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,284
Way to go.

98
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>What do you mean, a date?
Hey! Answer me!</i>

99
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,390
-I'll cover for you with your dad.
-<i>Don't ignore me! Hey!</i>

100
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,391
You should go.

101
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,259
Appreciate it.

102
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,228
I'll try to get back before it's too late.

103
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,397
<i>Wait, you hussy!</i>

104
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>Sex five seconds after meeting?</i>

105
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,338
Have fun…

106
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,742
Mom.

107
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,058
Hey!

108
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,430
Where did my Junko go?

109
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,065
Mutchy,

110
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,901
didn't we agree she's my Junko?

111
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,802
Kiyoshi!

112
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,105
Don't you ever let her go.

113
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,707
You got that?

114
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,942
That was then, this is now.

115
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,944
Where is she?

116
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,746
Answer me!

117
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,860
PAY WITH E-MONEY

118
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,101
Huh? Bleep.

119
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,245
We're so high up!

120
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,514
The cars look so tiny!

121
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,384
This really is your first time.

122
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,385
Yeah.

123
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,555
I live way out in the boonies.

124
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,125
Only one bus runs once a week.

125
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,059
For real?

126
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,597
Huh? What is it?

127
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,698
What's the matter?

128
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,899
Where's the time machine?

129
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:40,800
What?

130
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,003
Junko!

131
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,938
Hey!

132
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,143
It's me, Mutchy!

133
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,345
You told him?

134
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,147
-Where are you?
-Sorry.

135
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,283
How dare you lie to me!

136
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,585
Saying Junko is dying

137
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,154
and has turned into a frog.

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,356
No, I said frogification phenomenon.

139
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,991
Shut up, you time traveler!

140
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,893
Now that I take a closer look,

141
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,329
you and your son
have faces that scream future.

142
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,432
Damn it!

143
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,101
You think I'm dumb because
I'm a punk who only finished junior high.

144
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,303
Junko!

145
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,039
Can you hear me?

146
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,774
Why do you buy what he said so easily?

147
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,712
Because without a time machine,

148
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,017
Doraemon wouldn't have been able
to meet Nobita.

149
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,822
INUSHIMA

150
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,659
I wish I could've taken photos
of that view.

151
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,962
I never thought
things would unfold like this.

152
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,831
What's happening tomorrow?

153
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,500
I might stay over at Naoki's place.

154
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,401
-No!
-No!

155
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
Why not?

156
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,304
I didn't bring you here
for hanky-panky, you ugly!

157
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,372
A male hairdresser?

158
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,341
I'm sure he's a good-for-nothing flirt.

159
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,576
I agree, Father.

160
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,111
A black suit at a disco is
much more grounded than him.

161
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,781
-They even had company dorms!
-You can use my digital camera.

162
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,616
Look.

163
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,254
See?

164
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,656
You can see the picture
without developing it.

165
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,959
What is this thing?

166
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,862
Take it down a notch, Junko.

167
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,030
Sorry. I woke Machato up.

168
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,202
Hey.

169
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,939
Just to clarify,

170
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,809
have you told her that she's marrying you?

171
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,577
I haven't. And I won't.

172
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,381
Then don't mention "black suit"
or refer to him as "Father."

173
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,515
Stop dropping hints.

174
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,783
My bad.

175
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,152
But seeing my wife's face

176
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,787
triggers a flood of memories.

177
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,290
Will you stop? It's putting Mom off.

178
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,425
She's not your mom
and she's not your wife.

179
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,693
She's my daughter!

180
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,594
Right.

181
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,129
But instead,

182
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,698
allow me to sleep with Junko tonight--

183
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,633
Absolutely not!

184
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
I mean, we're a married couple.

185
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,871
I have a feeling
I can finally perform tonight.

186
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,474
How dare you! I'll kill you!

187
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,176
There, there.

188
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,979
Machato is so cute.

189
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,881
I can't wait to have a kid, too.

190
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,985
He's your grandson.

191
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,721
It's not exactly…

192
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,625
a return to my roots.

193
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,930
I just happened to be in the mood

194
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,933
to create a story about teenagers.

195
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,135
He talks a lot
despite not writing anything.

196
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,037
He loves interviews.

197
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,939
He's the epitome of craving recognition.

198
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,640
The epitome of what?

199
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:39,612
He wants to be acknowledged, praised,
pampered, and flattered.

200
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,913
Egosurfing?

201
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,848
I never do that.

202
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,153
I don't write for a million people
whose faces or names I don't know.

203
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,688
Instead,

204
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,457
I write

205
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,693
for one lonely person.

206
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,728
<i>Emiko…</i>

207
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,765
<i>is the daughter of Director Takagi,
who passed five years ago.</i>

208
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,968
This is a drama airing
on another TV station.

209
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,871
And these are real-time comments
from viewers.

210
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,441
-"Finally!"
-"It's coming together."

211
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,109
This is scary.

212
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,243
One person at a time!

213
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,411
I'm not Prince Shotoku!

214
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,548
These days, viewers share
their predictions as they watch.

215
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,049
They're not watching, are they?

216
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,384
They're a crucial audience,

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,853
and their desire
for recognition is fulfilled like this.

218
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,455
We got caught in the crossfire.

219
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,058
"Does Emoken still have what it takes
to deliver foreshadowing to this extent?"

220
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,794
That's nasty. Isn't it?

221
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,765
What's the matter, Hamura?

222
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,669
Mr. Emo just updated his social media.

223
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,308
"I wonder if the deadline can be extended
by a week, meow."

224
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,346
It's the foreshadowing, you see.

225
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,548
I'm not sure if I can pay off

226
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,951
the first episode's
foreshadowing in the finale.

227
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,152
Did you egosurf?

228
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,153
I didn't.

229
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,523
If we postpone by a week,
the preparations will also be set back.

230
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,326
What kind of foreshadowing is this?

231
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,262
You're writing
for one lonely person, right?

232
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,999
I might not look like it,
but I'm quite lonely. So, tell me.

233
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,336
A 17-year-old girl.

234
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,506
-She is from the boonies.
-It's delicious.

235
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,008
-<i>And a young content writer…</i>
-Good.

236
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,677
-<i>They fall in love.</i>
-Let's swap.

237
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,417
<i>But the girl</i>

238
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,453
<i>harbors a secret.</i>

239
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,724
<i>And the two are fated never to be.</i>

240
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,026
<i>It's already carved in stone.</i>

241
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,162
A secret?

242
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,531
In <i>Roman Holiday</i>,

243
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,835
the girl's secret was that
she was a crown princess.

244
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,769
But nowadays…

245
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,173
It's tough to come up with obstacles
for love in this era of diversity.

246
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,275
Why not make her ugly?

247
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,543
Like that would work!

248
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,877
Give her a time limit, then.

249
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,778
A time limit?

250
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,581
This ugly girl doesn't have long to live.

251
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,616
-The date of her death is already set.
-Why?

252
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,722
You're the professionals.
Think of something.

253
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,023
It could be an accident or a sickness.

254
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,092
Too flimsy.

255
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,660
It's deep.

256
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,429
It's deep.

257
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,732
And the girl knows--

258
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,301
No, the guy should learn about it first.

259
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,937
It's the theory of tragedy.

260
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,908
The man grapples with conflict
after learning the girl's secret.

261
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,677
I can write this.

262
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,579
This time, I can write.

263
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,683
BUS TIMETABLE

264
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,424
It says 3:55 p.m.

265
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,893
That's when the time machine arrives.

266
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,729
We hid it so present-day people
wouldn't uncover

267
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,364
the secret of us future people.

268
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,535
If I get on this bus,
I better be able to go.

269
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,705
What?

270
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,976
I didn't draw them.

271
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:57,977
Okay, I did.

272
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,813
I don't want to be
looked down on in the future.

273
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,328
I promise to bring Junko back.

274
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:17,930
So long.

275
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,570
BOUND FOR KODAI SEIMON-MAE

276
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,194
Mr. Yasumori.

277
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,195
Hey.

278
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,084
<i>I am now…</i>

279
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,853
<i>in the future.</i>

280
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>This…</i>

281
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,627
<i>is one small step for Mutchy.</i>

282
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,563
<i>But one giant leap for…</i>

283
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,467
I wonder why Midori Satsuki is so sexy.

284
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,036
I'm still in junior high,
so I wouldn't know.

285
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,242
This is totally Showa.

286
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,977
They tricked me!

287
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,414
Tsuyoshi Sako's mother thanked me.

288
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,484
She said she asked her son

289
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,754
why he only hung out with Kiyoshi.

290
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,956
Her son said,

291
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,560
"I had a few friends who visited before,

292
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:59,131
but Kiyoshi was the first one
who didn't tell me to attend school."

293
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,367
I see.

294
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,037
And I informed Kiyoshi about this.

295
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,306
He doesn't have to come to school.

296
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,408
Because I can hang out
with him at his place.

297
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,877
I see.

298
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,479
Kiyoshi understands.

299
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,285
It's tough to hear "Come to school"
when you already know you have to.

300
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,253
He took time off too.

301
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,591
But there are things
you can only learn in a school setting.

302
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,761
Mr. Yasumori.

303
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,162
It's not just about studying.

304
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,599
You should have shared memories
from field trips and sports events.

305
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,301
-Otherwise, when you--
-Mr. Yasumori.

306
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,236
Are you married?

307
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,005
Not yet.

308
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,640
What about it?

309
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,811
Would you say the same
if your own son refused to go to school?

310
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,912
I would.

311
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,248
I would make him go to school,
no matter what.

312
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,150
He'd stab you if you're not careful.

313
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,218
That's ridiculous.

314
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,989
What?

315
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,259
You clearly got upset just there.

316
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,296
Because I mentioned marriage
when you're already feeling pressured to.

317
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,700
Excuse me.

318
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,868
Wait a minute.

319
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,572
It's true, I'm a conservative teacher.

320
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,909
I'm narrow-minded and
unable to crack a single joke.

321
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,744
I'm boring and unpopular.

322
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,945
I didn't go that far.

323
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:20,879
Let go of me.

324
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:21,780
However,

325
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,983
despite my looks,

326
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,519
Mr. Ogawa surpasses me in popularity,
and I can't fathom why.

327
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,856
I'm the homeroom teacher,
while he's just an assistant.

328
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,826
I'm eight heads tall,
while he's only five heads--

329
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,760
Stop right there.

330
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,230
I never mentioned Mr. Ogawa.

331
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,365
You're dating him, right?

332
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,700
Absolutely not!

333
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,269
You're not?

334
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,218
<i>Next song, the ninth place for this week…</i>

335
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,252
I love you.

336
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,192
You've got to be kidding.

337
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,696
Crap, I said it.

338
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,503
You've got to be kidding.
Don't turn it up.

339
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,904
Lower it.

340
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,006
Lower it. Barkeep!

341
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,079
This must be a joke.

342
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,925
Sorry, I'm singing in Japanese.

343
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,849
Wow.

344
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,018
I didn't recognize
any of the songs you sang.

345
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,654
Sorry.

346
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,390
I don't know the latest tunes.

347
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,591
No worries.

348
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,026
It's new for me.

349
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,129
I'm hitting the bathroom.

350
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,907
STUDENT ID
SHOWA 61

351
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,044
BORN SHOWA 43

352
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,146
Showa 43?

353
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,434
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

354
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,574
SORRY

355
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,776
YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE ME

356
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,979
BUT SHE'S MY MOM

357
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,814
What?

358
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,725
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING LATER.

359
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,794
"I'll explain everything later."

360
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,303
How did it go?

361
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,606
I had such a great time.

362
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,443
-I snapped a bunch.
-Photos?

363
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,945
Let me see.

364
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,787
Everyone is so nice to me.

365
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,790
I wonder why.

366
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,927
Because you're cute.

367
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,664
Stop it. It messes with my groove.

368
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,101
It puts me more at ease
to be called ugly, like my dad does.

369
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,173
When I first met your dad,
he called me ugly too.

370
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,979
He likes you, Nagisa.

371
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,015
Mr. Ogawa?

372
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,352
I'm not sure.

373
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,087
It's true.

374
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,191
What about you?

375
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,070
How do you feel

376
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,138
about my dad?

377
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,778
I like him.

378
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,114
Really?

379
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,819
That's a relief.

380
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,322
Unless he finds happiness,

381
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,125
I can't become independent either.

382
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,998
He might have a sharp tongue,
but he's not stupid.

383
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,234
So please…

384
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,872
take care of Ichiro Ogawa.

385
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,178
Sure. Goodnight.

386
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
Goodnight.

387
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,897
Have you noticed any health changes
like dizziness or fever since your return?

388
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,432
Not me.

389
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,367
Barkeep, a pizza toast.

390
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,002
I want a pizza toast.

391
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,571
"Not me"?

392
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,776
Actually, I brought my daughter along.

393
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,445
What?! You've brought Junko?

394
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,081
You can't just do that.

395
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,616
I'll send her back on Saturday.

396
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,385
And your wife, or should I say, ex-wife?

397
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,587
She's on the PTA board.

398
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,057
Speaking of which,

399
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,727
just how long does Sakae
plan to stay there?

400
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,198
Enjoy.

401
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,702
Eiji Bando?

402
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,370
Yes.

403
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,507
I've decided to think
of you as Eiji Bando.

404
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,010
I'm a little confused.

405
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,113
First, the looks are exactly my type.

406
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,314
You mean Eiji Bando?

407
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,716
I mean you.

408
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,651
Use your head a little.

409
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,187
Right. Sorry.

410
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,422
<i>You shouldn't judge someone</i>

411
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,624
<i>By their looks</i>

412
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,827
<i>But your looks are exactly her type</i>

413
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,162
<i>I'm against lookism</i>

414
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,032
<i>What matters is what's on the inside</i>

415
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,134
<i>But inside he's conservative</i>

416
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,471
<i>And yet, his looks are exactly my type</i>

417
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,808
Because of your looks,
I find myself going easy on you.

418
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,377
That's not fair.

419
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,913
So until I find something positive
about you beyond your looks…

420
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,849
<i>Bang bang bang</i>

421
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,285
<i>You're Eiji Bando</i>

422
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,421
<i>Bang bang bang</i>

423
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,191
<i>You used to play for the Chunichi Dragons</i>

424
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,860
<i>Bang bang bang</i>

425
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,395
<i>Bang bang bang</i>

426
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,930
<i>Eiji Bando</i>

427
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,933
<i>Lookism and Dragons</i>

428
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,903
<i>I'm wavering between those two</i>

429
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,010
<i>Bang bang bang</i>

430
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,817
Is that your answer to my question?

431
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,153
Answer?

432
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,022
Well,

433
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,191
I suppose so.

434
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,628
What on earth?

435
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,197
"Emoken announces retirement."

436
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,300
"Steps down from drama after 16 years."

437
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,935
"Press conference on Friday."

438
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,403
I was so shocked,

439
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,806
I accidentally used
my pajama pants as a scarf.

440
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,207
Sheesh.

441
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,275
What day is it?

442
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,242
It's Friday!

443
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,545
Forget the press conference,
today's the deadline!

444
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,779
Where is Mr. Emo?

445
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,482
He's been in a Sheraton Hotel suite
for the past four days.

446
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,184
-Say what?!
-Say what?!

447
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,889
You egosurfed, didn't you?

448
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,458
-I didn't.
-You're lying!

449
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,193
You totally did!

450
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,330
Yesterday, I shared
a concept video with the media.

451
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,871
<i>In the spring of 2024,</i>

452
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,440
<i>in a corner of the city,</i>

453
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,144
<i>a 17-year-old girl crosses paths
with a novice writer,</i>

454
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,946
<i>and they spend the night together.</i>

455
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,717
What is it?

456
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,820
I'll take a photo.

457
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,223
I want one together.

458
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,563
-Okay. Here we go.
-<i>However…</i>

459
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,000
-Say cheese. Yay.
-<i>The girl has a secret.</i>

460
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,704
<i>Get ready for an unpredictable
and fresh love story.</i>

461
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,640
Anyway, scroll down the article

462
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,108
and you'll find the comments.

463
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,710
"Must be a sickness."

464
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,545
"I bet she doesn't have long to live."

465
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,348
They already guessed it.

466
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,618
That's what you get for egosurfing.
You come across unnecessary stuff.

467
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,120
You don't know that until you see them!

468
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,759
At least show us
what you've written so far.

469
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,864
We've come this far believing in you.

470
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,466
We deserve this much!

471
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,136
Let us read what you've written so far.

472
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,458
Don't pretend you've written a lot.

473
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,631
Just this?

474
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,701
I should've stepped down a little sooner.

475
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,703
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,942
<i>That was fun.</i>

477
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,110
Best of luck with your work.

478
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,847
I've taken tomorrow off,
so how about a trip to Enoshima?

479
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,584
Tomorrow…

480
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,453
is Saturday, so I don't think so.

481
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,388
What?

482
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,792
I need to head back soon.

483
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,127
Having this much fun might jinx things.

484
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,066
By bus?

485
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,435
By bus.

486
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,672
Does that mean

487
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,708
we won't see each other again?

488
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,944
Probably.

489
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,319
Why don't we go now?

490
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,588
To Enoshima?

491
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,191
I want to show you all the sights I know.

492
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,959
Let's go.

493
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,097
<i>I should've admitted that I'm old now</i>

494
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,232
<i>and left sooner.</i>

495
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,202
But you know,

496
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,305
it makes me happy
when I create something good,

497
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,907
and I was looking forward
to the drama airing.

498
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,145
Just getting by on past accomplishments

499
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,981
doesn't make me feel alive.

500
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,353
Why is this so interesting?

501
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,088
Huh?

502
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,325
I could've left if it was boring.

503
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,694
But these five pages

504
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,396
are incredible!

505
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,296
Right?

506
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,232
Exactly.

507
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,166
You get it.

508
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,113
Did you write it?

509
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,685
No, um,

510
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,420
I just typed it out.

511
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,622
Wait a minute, Mr. Emo,

512
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,157
you can't use a computer?

513
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,626
I'm embarrassed to say

514
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,629
I'm not tech-savvy.

515
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,183
Amazing.

516
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,586
It's like I'm following
your train of thought.

517
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,987
How can you decipher them?

518
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,590
-Mr. Emo.
-Yeah?

519
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,560
I'll pitch in ideas too,
so let's finish the script today.

520
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,195
-What?
-Huh?

521
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,197
Are you serious?

522
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,164
I mean,

523
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,167
you struggled so much
just to write five pages.

524
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,738
After seeing that,
I can't help but lend you a hand.

525
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,142
In that case, um…

526
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,911
Here it is.

527
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,783
THIS SIGHT

528
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,685
It's about "this sight."

529
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,021
If I were to feature it in the finale,

530
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,957
what should it be?

531
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,194
It might be cliché,

532
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,396
but how about the sinking sunset?

533
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,317
<i>Or an aquarium.</i>

534
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,996
<i>Or a shrine on a hill.</i>

535
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,367
Can I pay with e-money?

536
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,369
Sorry, we only take cash.

537
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,270
What?

538
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,514
What's your first choice university?

539
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,716
Aoyama, I think.

540
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:27,225
MAY I GET INTO AOYAMA UNIVERSITY

541
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,129
Something feels off.

542
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,898
I think you're missing "Gakuin."

543
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,701
Right.

544
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,541
AOYAMA GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

545
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:44,876
<i>What about Rome?</i>

546
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,412
During the press conference,

547
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,415
when the princess is asked
which city she enjoyed the most,

548
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,118
Audrey Hepburn looks at Gregory Peck

549
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,088
and says, "Rome."

550
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,391
What?

551
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,427
Have you never seen <i>Roman Holiday</i>?

552
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,328
Nope.

553
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,395
These few years,

554
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,497
it's just been <i>Tora-san</i>
and <i>Truck Yaro</i> films for me.

555
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,565
Truck…

556
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,435
That's no help at all!

557
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,305
Let's just go with Rome, then.
Hamura, can't we film in Italy?

558
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,240
No.

559
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,710
I'm no expert,

560
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,714
but if all this brainstorming
isn't leading anywhere,

561
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,618
maybe you should finish the first episode
in a way that satisfies you.

562
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,119
I agree.

563
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,957
I'm not writing for folks
who'll just watch one episode and bail.

564
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,294
This is Kentaro Emo's
final work before retirement.

565
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,263
It needs a flawless four-part structure.

566
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,633
Every foreshadowing in all the episodes
must be resolved in the finale.

567
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,703
And the final piece falls into place
in the last scene just before "The End."

568
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,804
It's the only way.

569
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,374
Do they have to be resolved?

570
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,375
They do.

571
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,277
I'm a perfectionist.

572
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,012
It's always been my approach.

573
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,648
When you have a goal,
the path becomes clear.

574
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,450
Then, writing the rest becomes easy.

575
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,087
Do you think you're a god?

576
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,424
When it comes to my dramas, yes.

577
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,227
I have the perspective of a god.

578
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,162
No offense, but I think that's arrogant.

579
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,831
You don't know what happens

580
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,302
or how long something will last.
That's what makes it intriguing.

581
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,838
You can't write
unless you know the finale?

582
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,973
Give me a break!

583
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,741
The…

584
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,944
The finale for Junko and me

585
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,313
is already set!

586
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,692
I win!

587
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,460
Not fair!

588
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,697
Wait!

589
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,466
<i>Sorry.</i>

590
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,134
I didn't mean to yell like that.

591
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,771
But…

592
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,507
everything has its end.

593
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,110
Even dramas and people's lives.

594
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,779
So…

595
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,282
up until the very last moment,

596
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,950
why can't things be messy?

597
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,854
The last episode is undecided?

598
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,458
That's awesome!

599
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,063
From my viewpoint, it's fantastic.

600
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,839
Excuse me.

601
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,309
Hello?

602
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,944
What?!

603
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,078
Sorry.

604
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,081
It's past 10 p.m.,
but she still hasn't come home.

605
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,018
Yeah. Naoki.

606
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,820
She's with him, but…

607
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,256
Look.

608
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:48,926
Yes.

609
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,329
We finally found it!

610
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,631
She's with some dude? Damn it!

611
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,866
What's the matter?

612
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,267
My daughter

613
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,770
might be having hanky-panky!

614
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,073
You ordered way too much.

615
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,008
It's the last call.

616
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,811
Aren't you going to drink alcohol?

617
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,681
Well then, this wine, please.

618
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,616
Right.

619
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,683
What about you, Junko?

620
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,618
I'll have a little.

621
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,754
DRINKING IS ILLEGAL UNDER THE AGE OF 20

622
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,456
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

623
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,305
I've always wanted to do
those typical teenage things.

624
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,341
Running on the sandy shore
in the middle of the night,

625
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,709
absurd stuff like that.

626
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,380
Do you have a girlfriend, Naoki?

627
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,618
Right.

628
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,721
It's not something
you bring up unless asked.

629
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,460
Sorry.

630
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,894
Don't be.

631
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,996
I'm not single myself.

632
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,035
What's he like?

633
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,571
One of them…

634
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,940
is an older local punk.

635
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,208
There's another?

636
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,444
The other is a junior high kid
who's all about boobs.

637
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,378
Yikes.

638
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,447
But

639
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,883
they're both nice.

640
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,686
Stupid but nice.

641
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,590
I see.

642
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,193
Everyone seems to be nice to me.

643
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,763
Even my dad isn't nagging as much.

644
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,998
Nagisa too.

645
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,367
I wonder why.

646
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,004
It's not like I'm a good girl or anything.

647
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,674
You're a good girl, Junko.

648
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:50,948
A photo.

649
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,683
Allow me.

650
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,355
Make sure to get all the food.

651
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,256
Sure.

652
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:00,858
Ready?

653
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,327
Say cheese.

654
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,731
Here.

655
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:08,799
I'll take one too.

656
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,471
A good girl wouldn't be out
playing around this late.

657
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,777
What's wrong?

658
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,512
No, it's okay.

659
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,914
Huh?

660
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,751
Huh?

661
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,689
I'm screwed.

662
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,824
What's the matter?

663
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,594
I've lost my phone.

664
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,062
Huh?

665
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,897
Excuse me.

666
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,900
Here's your wine.

667
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,108
Please settle your bill first.

668
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,915
Don't you have your wallet?

669
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,184
I do, but…

670
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,087
Earlier,

671
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,523
I got that <i>ema</i>.

672
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,828
Right, you were using that thing
to pay for everything.

673
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,663
Junko,

674
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,300
do you happen to have any cash?

675
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,337
Sorry, I only have enough
for my train ride home.

676
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,073
I'm screwed.

677
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:22,974
Huh?

678
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,276
Can't you borrow money from someone?

679
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,645
Like a coworker, your girlfriend,
or your parents?

680
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,779
I could,

681
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,182
but I don't know their numbers.

682
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,652
Right, it's all in that thing.

683
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,155
I even forgot my parents' number.

684
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,025
I'm screwed.

685
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,162
So you're in trouble without that thing.

686
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,032
I told you to keep an eye on her.

687
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,933
Sorry.

688
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,502
She used to be back by 9 p.m.
until yesterday.

689
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,037
You ogled her, didn't you?

690
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,005
This is on you!

691
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,407
How can you say that
when I have such innocent eyes?

692
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,976
I hope she hasn't gone
to Kabukicho or somewhere.

693
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,279
They say To-yoko is a rough place.

694
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,014
Toyoko? You mean Norengai?

695
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,017
There's a spot
where runaway girls tend to gather.

696
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,151
What are you doing here, Inoue?

697
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,953
Junko.

698
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,854
Huh?

699
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,422
Junko--

700
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,134
What's that?

701
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:24,969
What's that noise?

702
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,705
A phone ringing?

703
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,124
Hello?

704
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,127
<i>This is the Shonan police station
in Kanagawa.</i>

705
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,195
SHONAN POLICE STATION

706
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,463
Junko!

707
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,598
Junko!

708
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,301
Junko!

709
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,905
What on earth did you do?!

710
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,906
Dining and dashing.

711
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,442
When an employee tried to stop her,
she turned violent.

712
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,110
Ow!

713
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,511
-This is the police.
-It hurts! Customer!

714
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,513
-What are you doing?!
-It hurts!

715
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,082
-Ow!
-Stop it.

716
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,917
No! Let go of me!

717
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,385
Let me go, pig!

718
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,554
I'll crush your balls!

719
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,621
Hey!

720
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,092
How shameful. You hussy!

721
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,060
-It's my fault.
-Huh?

722
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,629
This is Naoki, the hairdresser.

723
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,998
Why aren't you locked up?

724
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,301
He was sorry and came with us quietly.

725
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,869
Is that so?

726
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,671
My bad.

727
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,208
I dropped my phone,
and I couldn't pay the bill.

728
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,610
You dropped your phone, huh?

729
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,012
That's all that happened?

730
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,515
Did you have hanky-panky with her?

731
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,850
Not yet.

732
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,351
If you'll excuse me.

733
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,386
"Not yet"?

734
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,087
Hold on.

735
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,223
You're seriously leaving now?

736
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,226
Yeah. Her father is here.

737
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,398
How much do you know about Junko?

738
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,766
How much?

739
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,103
She's a girl

740
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,505
who knows a lot of old songs.

741
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,208
Is that all?

742
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,877
Yeah.

743
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,546
You like her, don't you?

744
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,047
Don't you want to know more?

745
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,649
Stop it, Mr. Ogawa.

746
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,086
If this were a drama,
it's like you only tuned in midway.

747
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,556
If you enjoy it, wouldn't you want
to watch the entire series from the top?

748
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,461
Actually, I've never watched
a series all the way through.

749
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,131
-What?
-I turn on the TV.

750
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,767
And I watch the sixth or seventh episode.

751
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,969
And if I enjoy that episode,

752
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,840
then I'm a fan of that drama.

753
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,611
Wait, what are we talking about?

754
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,512
Well…

755
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,484
You can leave. Sorry about that.

756
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,563
Sorry, Junko.

757
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,866
I was caught up with stuff
and didn't pay attention to you.

758
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,836
Did you have fun?

759
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,239
Loads of fun.

760
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,377
Thanks for not paying attention to me.

761
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,431
I've gotten the script.

762
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,433
Thank you.

763
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,342
Crap.

764
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,381
What is it?

765
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,051
You seem a little different.

766
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:02,853
Not really.

767
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,723
I just took two weeks off from school.

768
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,659
Well then,

769
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,028
I guess I'll head home soon.

770
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:12,930
Right.

771
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,667
Sako, here's a souvenir for you.

772
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,801
What's that?

773
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:19,937
"Mayonnaise Shrimp"?

774
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,939
What is it? I've never seen it before.

775
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,074
What's the plan back home?

776
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,177
Studying.

777
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,347
I've decided to be a good girl.

778
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,118
Hey.

779
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,925
Which place in the future
left the strongest impression on you?

780
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,626
What?

781
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,062
I don't know.

782
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,973
NO PHOTOS

783
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,210
They're gone.

784
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,913
Everything okay?

785
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,017
Let's see…

786
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,923
The Skytree and Enoshima were both pretty,

787
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,726
but my favorite place was…

788
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,171
Junko!

789
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,775
Jail…

790
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,144
I guess.

791
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,647
Good work.

It was just one mistake.

Don't defend someone who had an affair.
