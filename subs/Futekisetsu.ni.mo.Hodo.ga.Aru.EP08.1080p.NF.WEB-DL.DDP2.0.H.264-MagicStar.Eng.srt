1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,208
Where's your father?

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,113
Here you go.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,281
Hey.

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,017
It's me, Mutchy!

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,352
How was he able to come?

6
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,791
Move aside!

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,761
Future, here I come!

8
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,030
Wait for me, Junko!

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,034
Unclog your ears.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,136
Don't forget to unclog your ears.

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,937
Anyway, that's how…

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:42,475
I, Mutchy, made it to Tokyo in 2024
all the way from 1986.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,411
As proof,

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,813
I left my autograph on the wall.

15
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,283
I think it should be "from."

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,019
Anyway, you really do look like me.

17
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,687
My son,

18
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,756
come here.

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,696
Don't be so tense.

20
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,432
Come on, you.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,168
Take a photo of us.

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,336
You've got one
of those sleek gadgets, right?

23
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,738
Uh, okay.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,406
Yo, future people!

25
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,909
Say cheese.

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,079
So, where's Junko?

27
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,681
She departed
on the 5 a.m. bus this morning.

28
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,516
Huh?

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,751
Junko?

30
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,619
Hey, long time no see.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,855
Why are you dressed all cutesy?

32
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,490
Mutchy was looking for you.

33
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,159
We won tickets to be in the audience
for <i>Yan Yan Utau Studio</i>.

34
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,527
-You'll join us, right?
-Uh…

35
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,363
Well, I'm not interested
in stuff like that anymore.

36
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,832
Bye!

37
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,467
What?

38
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,136
TSUNETA CRAM SCHOOL

39
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,408
My ears still feel a little blocked.

40
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,677
Huh? She went back?

41
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,878
That's right.

42
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,713
Give me a break.

43
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,449
If Junko isn't here,
why did I come to the future?

44
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,986
If you truly traveled
through time here, that is.

45
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,021
What did you say?

46
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,189
Do you…

47
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,627
seriously believe this is 2024?

48
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,330
It isn't?

49
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,833
What? Then who is he?

50
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,803
Are you familiar with doppelgangers?

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,837
D…

52
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,806
Doppel…?

53
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,007
In this world,

54
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,545
there are three individuals who share
the same face as you, including yourself.

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,147
And this man is one of them.

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,249
He's your doppelganger.

57
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,786
Doppel…

58
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,389
Doppelgangers don't have an identity.

59
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,825
They're like mirrored reflections of you.

60
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,176
What? Stop it.

61
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,911
You're creeping me out.

62
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,847
What's your favorite vehicle?
Three, two, one.

63
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,981
-Bikes.
-Bikes.

64
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,650
"Our matching…"

65
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,717
-"Sneakers."
-"Sneakers."

66
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,085
This is freaky.

67
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,789
Those who encounter their doppelgangers
experience their bodies deteriorating,

68
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,524
and eventually…

69
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,826
they die.

70
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,094
You're lying!

71
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,663
I don't feel sick at all.

72
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,732
You're bleeding from your ear.

73
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,633
Here.

74
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,039
We can't afford to let more people
know about the time machine!

75
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,006
Dad!

76
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,107
Stay back!

77
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,184
This is scary.

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,491
Mr. Ogawa.

79
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,427
Mr. Ogawa.

80
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,729
How can I help you?

81
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,264
Um…

82
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,167
Do you know who I am?

83
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,535
No.

84
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,604
Thank goodness.

85
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,273
They all seem to know you, though.

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,174
Huh?

87
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm Takeru Kuramochi,

88
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,450
I've been an announcer here
for seven years now.

89
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,452
EBS TV'S POPULAR ANNOUNCER
WHY WAS HE DROPPED?

90
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,487
<i>In his first year as an announcer,</i>

91
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,390
<i>he landed the prime time sports section,
an exceptional feat.</i>

92
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,393
<i>He had a great start to his career!</i>

93
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,063
<i>In his second year, his good looks
helped him win the top spot</i>

94
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,599
<i>in the favorite TV announcer ranking.</i>

95
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,934
<i>He's handsome, after all.</i>

96
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,437
<i>I wonder why we don't see him lately.</i>

97
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,008
<i>It's all because of something
that happened three years ago.</i>

98
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,845
<i>It was that secret affair
he had with a female athlete, right?</i>

99
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,781
Why did you turn it off?

100
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,453
I accompanied an athlete
to her training camp

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,689
before the Tokyo Olympics
to cover her journey.

102
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,724
What? The Tokyo Olympics?

103
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,793
Three years ago?

104
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,497
Damn it. I won't be able to see it.

105
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,066
-And?
-Right.

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,636
I was chosen to be
the main presenter for EBS.

107
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,605
It must've been a big step up for you.

108
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,206
I commentated on skateboarding.

109
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,975
What? Skateboarding at the Olympics?

110
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,844
It became an Olympic sport
for the first time in the Tokyo Games.

111
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,350
Who did you have an affair with?

112
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,251
Um…

113
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,153
Isn't it a little much?

114
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,654
It is, isn't it?

115
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,789
It's a bit much.

116
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,990
I'll shut up for a while.

117
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:24,991
Right.

118
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,173
Her name is Seira Kido,

119
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,643
an athlete from the street skateboarding
whom I got to interview.

120
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,013
Then, I got to send her
a DM on social media.

121
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,350
I got to like her post
and got her to follow me.

122
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,618
Then, I got her to have a meal with me.

123
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,355
And when she got drunk,
I got to take her to a hotel.

124
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,422
And that night…

125
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,458
we hooked up.

126
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,026
Shouldn't you say you "got some"?

127
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:00,993
Huh?

128
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,595
You should say you "got some."

129
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,897
If anything, that's what you really "got."

130
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,333
I was excited because
it was my first business trip,

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,368
and I got some twice.

132
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,669
I didn't ask how many times.

133
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,704
So, how did they find out?

134
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,939
Were there photos?

135
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,081
-<i>These are photos from that time.</i>
-Hey, that's enough!

136
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,184
<i>Funny how they didn't notice someone
taking photos of them so close.</i>

137
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,554
<i>He cheated once
and ended up losing everything.</i>

138
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,623
Twice, to be exact.

139
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,259
That's right.

140
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,165
For the duration of the Olympics,

141
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,768
I was ordered to stay at home.

142
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,940
<i>After I was allowed back to the office,
I spent two and a half years</i>

143
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,143
<i>handling assistant duties.</i>

144
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:55,014
<i>I regularly submitted written apologies
and underwent compliance training.</i>

145
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,317
<i>I finally finished making amends
and was poised for a comeback.</i>

146
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,420
But this spring,

147
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,122
the manager of Risk Management changed,

148
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,892
putting me back to square one.

149
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,126
So it's you!

150
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,362
That's risky! Pause the video.

151
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,130
He's not buckled up.

152
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,467
His outfit blends with the seatbelt,
but he's wearing it.

153
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,370
If it's not clear, it's not there.

154
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,105
We need to retake or cut the scene.

155
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,441
What do you want?

156
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,242
Your features have changed.

157
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,647
Spending all day checking footage
and scripts will do that to you.

158
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,151
Hey, this actor is acting a little hyper.
I want a urine test!

159
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,219
-What?
-Yeah.

160
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
A test?

161
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,291
Mr. Ogawa has a question
regarding announcer Takeru Kuramochi.

162
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,592
Forget it.

163
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,929
As long as I'm in this position,
he's never making a comeback.

164
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,666
Nagisacchi,

165
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,969
as of 2024, is committing adultery
an illegal offense?

166
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,472
It's not a crime.

167
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,240
Basically, it's a private problem.

168
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,109
It's up to the missus
whether to forgive him or not.

169
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,946
I don't think you guys
have the right to judge.

170
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,515
He's still saying stuff like this.

171
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,449
Huh?

172
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,184
Are you Mr. Compliance's henchman?

173
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm Uryu, the sub-leader
of the political correctness

174
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,922
and SDGs promotion section
of the examination department.

175
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,524
Oh? Say that again.

176
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,925
I'd rather not.

177
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,862
Cheating is a sign of man's wealth.

178
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,964
Even Hiroshi &amp; Kibo agree.

179
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,900
"If you're into unattractive guys,
I'll reconsider."

180
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,035
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,004
Don't defend someone who had an affair.

182
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,874
I know it's wrong to cheat on your spouse.

183
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,942
But it was just once.

184
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,347
Just one mistake, and you kick him
downstairs for three years.

185
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,184
Relocating and assigning him
minimal work is an abuse of authority.

186
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,987
I say this falls under power harassment.

187
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,922
Wow.

188
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,924
I sound like a proper counselor, don't I?

189
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,392
Do I need to repeat myself?

190
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,596
It's true that his wife was quick
to issue an apology.

191
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,831
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

192
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,801
She's Yoko@home, a cooking specialist.

193
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,171
She released an apology four hours
before news of the adultery leaked.

194
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:06,245
<i>I'm sorry my hubby's nibbling caused
concern to the public.</i>

195
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,614
<i>Don't worry about us.</i>

196
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,084
<i>After all, I have him hooked
through his stomach.</i>

197
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,986
<i>Let's love and eat!</i>

198
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,790
She doesn't sound upset,
but it's still scary.

199
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,625
She shared this
four hours before the news?

200
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah.

201
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,829
It was too early, and people didn't know
what she was apologizing for.

202
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,264
It's better than being late.

203
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,035
Was it 20 days later that Kuramochi held
the apology press conference?

204
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,606
<i>He apologized while standing up,
seated, half-sitting, and at an angle.</i>

205
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,741
<i>I'm truly sorry!</i>

206
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,411
Even after the affair,
he and his wife got along,

207
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,048
and they welcomed
their long-awaited first baby last year.

208
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,285
So, the stage is set.

209
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,588
All that's left is the hubby's comeback!

210
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,622
Mr. Ogawa,

211
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,425
don't underestimate the influence of TV.

212
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,626
What do you mean?

213
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,596
TV is free, so folks who don't want
to watch don't have to!

214
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,731
Why can't you take
a firm stance like that?

215
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,969
Fine, for a trial run,

216
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,138
let's send him to the streets
for <i>Asappara Time</i>.

217
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,608
We did it, Nagisacchi!

218
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,947
-<i>Prepare with a boil!</i>
-<i>Prepare with a boil!</i>

219
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,116
<i>Raku Foods' fried rice vermicelli!</i>

220
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,784
<i>Good morning.</i>

221
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,087
<i>It's 5:45 a.m.</i>

222
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,389
<i>It's 11 degrees Celsius
outside Shiodome Station.</i>

223
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,558
<i>It can be chilly
in the morning and evening,</i>

224
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,093
<i>so you'll want a light jacket.</i>

225
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,196
<i>But it will warm up around noon
and may make you sweat a little.</i>

226
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,565
-<i>Also, the air is dry.</i>
-Huh?

227
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,935
-<i>It's perfect for drying your laundry.</i>
-Wake up, Ichiro!

228
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,337
My dad! My dad is on TV!

229
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,173
-Wake up!
-<i>Many people may be planning outings.</i>

230
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,575
<i>It's me, Mutchy!</i>

231
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,545
<i>We should have a warm day ahead.</i>

232
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,781
-<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>
-Oh, crap!

233
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>ASAPPARA TIME</i>

234
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,752
Morning!

235
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,155
I missed the program when it aired.
How are the reactions?

236
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,189
Well,

237
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,891
not too good.

238
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,760
-Actually, they're the worst.
-What?

239
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,664
First, these posts were made
on social media.

240
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,133
"Hey, did I just see Kuramochi?"

241
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,870
"Is it okay for someone who had an affair
with an athlete to appear on TV?

242
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,372
It's just two people who noticed.

243
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,943
These comments were noticed
by a content writer

244
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,780
who probably searched #<i>AsapparaTime.</i>

245
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,182
And lazy article number one was written.

246
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,886
"After his affair with a female athlete,

247
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,722
TV announcer Takeru Kuramochi
vanished from the spotlight."

248
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,759
"He returned to TV after three years,
appearing on a morning news show."

249
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,796
You could literally write this
without leaving your <i>kotatsu</i>.

250
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:42,268
This flimsy article was copied and pasted
on social media, where it went viral.

251
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:47,406
<i>And the content writer quoted excerpts
to craft lazy article number two.</i>

252
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,809
"One of the opinions shared online

253
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,244
was, 'Seeing this adultererr ruined
my morninng.'"

254
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,113
This article is way too lazy!

255
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,749
Right. Even the typos seem half asleep.

256
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,784
A comment left on this article,

257
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,121
"Isn't it too early for his comeback?"
was agreed by 27,000 users.

258
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,389
What?!

259
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,758
TOTAL: 2 COMMENTS

260
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,960
None of them watched
the program, did they?

261
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,361
Well, I didn't either.

262
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,831
"I didn't watch it,
but I'm still offended."

263
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,835
"Never seen this show,
but if Kuramochi's on it, count me out."

264
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,038
"My husband cheated on me
with a married woman."

265
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,574
"It's unforgivable,
I didn't watch it though."

266
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,742
Do you see now?

267
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,710
It's not about
pleasing the actual viewers.

268
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,012
TV must cater to the nonviewers.

269
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,883
How does that even work?
They're not even tuning in!

270
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,451
That's why it's all pointless.

271
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,286
Real viewers provide positive feedback,

272
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,790
but nonviewers only care
about griping and finding faults.

273
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,759
That's the reality of bashers.

274
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,627
But…

275
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,196
people will complain
no matter when we bring him back.

276
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,198
We've got to deal with it sooner or later.

277
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,000
Obviously, it's too soon for that.

278
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,536
So, Kuramochi,

279
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,571
if you're on TV,

280
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,074
the nonviewers make a fuss.

281
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,978
I'll resign.

282
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,950
I don't want to cause
more trouble for everyone.

283
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,052
I understand, but not just yet.

284
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,089
I'm Kuhombutsu, the personnel manager.

285
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,858
-What's your name?
-Kuramochi.

286
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,160
Because of you,

287
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,796
there's about to be a boycott
against rice vermicelli.

288
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,430
Vermicelli?

289
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,232
They're sponsoring <i>Asappara Time</i>.

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,136
#I_Won't_Buy_Rice_Vermicelli is trending!

291
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,073
"I used to enjoy the rice vermicelli
they advertise on the program

292
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,342
with that cheating announcer. Too bad."

293
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,512
"I wasn't a fan of rice vermicelli
to begin with, but now I hate it."

294
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,214
Well, you won't die not eating it!

295
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,715
-Grandpa!
-Huh?

296
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,617
Sorry.

297
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,855
Soon, our various sponsors will come
to our sales department with complaints.

298
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,191
So, if you want to resign,
that would be the time.

299
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,428
He doesn't even have
the freedom to quit? Hold on!

300
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,265
In these times, you need to address
scandals in your own company.

301
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,735
Otherwise, people may bash you
for being too lenient.

302
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,440
Let's put together a special on <i>Asappara</i>
and interview people on the street.

303
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,277
Don't worry, Kuramochi.
You'll make your comeback.

304
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,981
No, it's fine now.

305
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,382
You can't give up.

306
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,153
If you're never forgiven
for making one mistake,

307
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,355
this world is messed up!

308
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,023
<i>Just once</i>

309
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,059
<i>Just one mis--</i>

310
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,163
Um…

311
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,103
<i>Just once</i>

312
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,973
Suzuki-kun was sold out.

313
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,140
So I got Sato-kun.

314
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,075
Thanks.

315
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,610
Take a seat.

316
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,914
I think I'll go to school.

317
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,749
Why?

318
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,050
Because staying home

319
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,853
feels like being in school now.

320
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,756
<i>No way!</i>

321
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,791
Sako is coming to school?

322
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,261
You did it! You moved mountains!

323
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,096
It's not confirmed yet.

324
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,566
But I didn't want people to be shocked,
so I let Mr. Yasumori know.

325
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,901
And what did he say?

326
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,003
He was pissing everywhere as he said,

327
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,907
"Great job! Thanks, Kiyoshi!"

328
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,647
Uh, this happened in the bathroom.

329
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,682
Say that first.

330
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,883
You surprised me.

331
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,185
I'm happy for you, Kiyoshi.

332
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,023
Go take a bath.

333
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,090
Okay.

334
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
What?

335
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,175
Did something nice happen over there?

336
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,244
Why do you ask?

337
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,247
Because you've come back
acting like a good girl.

338
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,916
Nothing really.

339
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,054
I just realized
it's better to be seen as cute.

340
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,823
What do you mean?

341
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,226
Delinquent girls…

342
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,962
were extinct.

343
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,932
<i>I should've expected that.</i>

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,735
<i>Dressing like that,</i>

345
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,372
<i>smoking, spitting,</i>

346
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,374
<i>scowling, and fighting.</i>

347
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,478
<i>And saying, "It's irritating.
It doesn't concern me."</i>

348
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,613
<i>It's weird.</i>

349
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,750
I thought being delinquent…

350
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,153
was a sign of being rebellious.

351
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,623
But rebellion is just…

352
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,059
a way of seeking attention.

353
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,597
If you really want to be left alone,

354
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,533
you should dress like
you don't need people to care.

355
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,603
And when I did…

356
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,082
They didn't leave you alone, did they?

357
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,652
I see.

358
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,055
So something nice did happen.

359
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,189
I'm happy for you.

360
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,958
Yeah.

361
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,927
I'm excited.

362
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,499
I'm not afraid of getting older anymore.

363
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,471
I don't know who I'll meet,

364
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,141
what job I'll have,

365
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,478
or if I'll get married.

366
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,081
But I want to enjoy them all.

367
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,650
That's why I'm going to study now.

368
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,889
Good idea.

369
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,992
Being a delinquent is a waste of time.

370
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,493
It really is.

371
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,563
Everyone has their own phone.

372
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,867
They can take photos, listen to music,
and even board the train with it.

373
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,872
And with those, anything you want
gets delivered with just one click.

374
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,541
It's awesome.

375
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,447
Maybe delinquents died out
because they're less discontent.

376
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,850
I'm not sure about that.

377
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,853
People are still discontent about things.

378
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,157
My dad…

379
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,393
is pretty cool.

380
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,562
Mr. Ogawa?

381
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,464
You think so?

382
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,870
He's a short-tempered geezer
who smells like farts,

383
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,540
and who can't even tell
C-C-B from Checkers.

384
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,244
But he's keeping up with the future.

385
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,615
Not only that,
people in the future are counting on him.

386
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,353
I need to work hard too.

387
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,759
Did his adultery

388
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,864
personally cause you any trouble?

389
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,699
DID HIS ADULTERY
PERSONALLY CAUSE YOU ANY TROUBLE?

390
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,502
HE DIDN'T DIRECTLY HARM ME,
BUT IT'S STILL OFFENSIVE.

391
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,003
Could you

392
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,138
say that

393
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,273
to his face?

394
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,108
COULD YOU SAY THAT TO HIS FACE?

395
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,011
I COULD, BUT I PREFER NOT TO.

396
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,413
You're still here?

397
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,416
I'm combating slander right now.

398
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,018
Then,

399
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,421
I'll come to your house to apologize.

400
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,257
THEN, I'LL COME
TO YOUR HOUSE TO APOLOGIZE.

401
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,859
I'D… RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

402
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,162
See? You little…

403
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,098
Are you going to reply to each user?

404
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,065
Yeah.

405
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,746
I thought you were going
to go back with Junko.

406
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,348
To Showa? Me?

407
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,249
Yeah?

408
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,621
I'm glad you stayed.

409
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,456
But aren't you worried?

410
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,660
Junko will be fine without me.

411
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,964
True.

412
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,668
Mom is all right.

413
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,537
We still have nine years.

414
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,973
But

415
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,341
I feel like this era…

416
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,611
needs an outsider like me
to shake things up.

417
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,513
An outsider?

418
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,181
Yup.

419
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,549
Someone inappropriate.

420
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:23,722
I need to stick around
until the world is a little better.

421
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,460
So youngsters like you, Akitsu,
and Kuramochi can find happiness.

422
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,429
If I went back to Showa now,

423
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,398
I wouldn't want to contribute
to a future like this.

424
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,901
<i>Here is your order.
Please take your drink.</i>

425
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:36,802
Hey!

426
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,404
We didn't order that much,
you stupid robot!

427
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,342
It's fine. We'll finish them anyway.

428
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,013
Go.

429
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,049
-Let's toast.
-<i>Thank you for your order.</i>

430
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,485
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

431
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,221
-Did you watch <i>Hanky-Panky</i>?
-Yeah

432
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,589
Did you watch a nip slip?

433
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,392
Sako!

434
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,262
-Welcome to Class B, Grade 3!
-Welcome to Class B, Grade 3!

435
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,931
Hey!

436
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,667
-Sako!
-Sako!

437
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,570
-Sako!
-Sako!

438
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,640
-Sako!
-Sako!

439
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,609
-Sako!
-Sako!

440
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,113
-Sako!
-Sako!

441
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,284
Tsuyoshi Sato, welcome back!

442
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,353
It's Sako, not Sato.

443
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,389
Welcome back!

444
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,459
All right!

445
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,395
For the first period,

446
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,697
we're running a marathon!

447
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,833
-Sako!
-Sako!

448
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,901
Sako!

449
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,969
You got this!

450
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:45,871
Thanks.

451
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,439
These are my notes for English.

452
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,807
And for Classical Japanese.

453
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,509
Thanks.

454
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,644
Everyone!

455
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,047
Let's reach the finish line together!

456
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,783
Almost there! Go for it.

457
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,987
Sako!

458
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,056
-Yeah!
-Sako!

459
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,857
SAKO

460
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,193
Sorry. He wants to stay home today.

461
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,035
I thought I was treating him normally.

462
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,606
If so, your idea of normal must be off.

463
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,775
Sorry.

464
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,944
You ruined it.

465
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:31,016
Kiyoshi spent a lot of time
to get Sako to open up and yet…

466
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,919
-Are you listening?
-Sorry.

467
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,795
As a parent with a child
who skipped school,

468
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,198
it's like a miracle
to see all the other kids

469
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,201
going to school
and studying at the same time.

470
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,002
In fact, it feels abnormal.

471
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,271
Are you familiar with ASD?

472
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,776
It's short for autism spectrum disorder.

473
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,011
And there's ADHD too,

474
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,748
which stands for attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder,

475
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,851
and SLD, specific learning disorder.

476
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,187
Kids with these conditions struggle
in school and group settings.

477
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,489
And in Showa…

478
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,857
I mean, in the present,

479
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,827
they get labeled as truants,
lazy, or just not trying hard enough.

480
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,131
People assume it's a family issue
or a lack of willpower that--

481
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,365
What is it?

482
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,402
-Did you see?
-Yeah. It's her, isn't it?

483
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,404
I'm talking about something important.

484
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,172
-That's Kyon Kyon.
-Kyon Kyon.

485
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,140
Huh?

486
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,211
No way.

487
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,981
Her face was tiny!

488
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,316
It was the size of a small paperback.

489
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,519
I should've asked her for an autograph!

490
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,221
Totally! Another opportunity might never--

491
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,122
Sorry.

492
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,829
Regarding Sako, I'll rethink
how I approach him from tomorrow onwards.

493
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,968
By the way, Sakae,
are you free after this?

494
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,138
I am.

495
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,273
You promised me

496
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,043
you'd take me to that salad bar
at the disco in Shinjuku, remember?

497
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,578
I'm not feeling it, though.

498
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,213
Exactly!

499
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,449
You can eat all the salad you want!

500
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,984
That's the point of a salad bar.

501
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:13,885
Let's go.

502
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,789
Here.

503
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,458
Thanks.

504
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:24,095
<i>He suddenly started acting strange
as we were leaving the bar.</i>

505
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,264
Ladies first?

506
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,500
I didn't expect you to know that, Sakae.

507
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:36,074
It's a dying custom in Europe
because it contradicts gender equality.

508
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,343
But it's Showa 61,

509
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,614
and it didn't come across as sarcastic.

510
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,716
So, it felt casual?

511
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,118
Exactly!

512
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,523
He stood in front of me on the way down
the escalator, and behind on the way up.

513
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,625
He carried my heavy stuff too.

514
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,895
And with his looks,
it felt pretty nice having him do that.

515
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,530
Did it make you like him?

516
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,168
I'm not sure about that.

517
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,776
<i>At the disco, he just kept
munching on salad and dancing.</i>

518
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,545
<i>Salad and dancing.</i>

519
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,915
<i>He was like some rabbit,
like a tall rabbit.</i>

520
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,151
Please take the sofa.

521
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,920
Thanks.

522
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,656
-<i>He even let me have the comfy sofa.</i>
-Thank you.

523
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,790
<i>So I asked him.</i>

524
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,393
<i>"Why does it come so naturally to you?"</i>

525
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,330
My father has always had that mindset.

526
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,398
Your father?

527
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,868
My father is an excellent cook,

528
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:42,641
and he's never been shy about saying,
"I love your Mom," in front of us kids.

529
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,710
And he does it all so casually,
without sarcasm.

530
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,946
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

531
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,849
<i>That's like Eiji Bando from</i> Kintsuma.

532
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,450
Come and meet my father.

533
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,352
What?

534
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,423
Let's have a meal out on the patio.

535
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,925
<i>A patio?</i>

536
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,827
<i>I've never seen one outside</i> Kintsuma.

537
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,731
<i>His looks are exactly my type,
and inside he's like Eiji Bando.</i>

538
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,167
Don't you think he's
a fine catch, at the very least?

539
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,836
Guys who only care
about their image are the worst.

540
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,406
And it reminded me of my ex-husband--

541
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,678
You went through a divorce?

542
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,479
Yeah.

543
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,182
Sorry.

544
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,952
Why are you apologizing?

545
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,257
Anyway, whenever he got drunk,
he'd always get arrogant.

546
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm a scientist destined
to win the Nobel Prize.

547
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,630
As the wife of a man
who will be remembered in history,

548
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,299
I expect you to act in a fitting way.

549
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,603
I only asked you to switch seats
because of the draft.

550
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,207
I just don't feel like I'm being respected
with the way you're acting!

551
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,842
Me?

552
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,876
Yes.

553
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,612
You're too handsome inside.

554
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,447
You've got the looks of Eiji Bando,

555
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,016
but your mindset is like Eiji Okuda!

556
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,153
If you don't act more humble,
you'll regret it when you grow up.

557
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,989
Um, old lady.

558
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,123
Old lady?

559
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,926
You're a little tough on me sometimes.

560
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,862
Am I?

561
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,664
I'm only in junior high,

562
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,899
so please go easy on me.

563
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,244
Inoue…

564
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,457
OCCUPATION: BEING HOT

565
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,059
ANNUAL SALES
SURPASSED 100 MILLION

566
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,662
One hundred million?

567
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,665
Wait, 100 million?

568
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,100
<i>What's your take on Kuramochi's comeback?</i>

569
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,536
<i>Saying sorry doesn't fix it.</i>

570
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,737
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

571
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,640
<i>I don't want to see him back on TV.</i>

572
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,541
<i>May I?</i>

573
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,876
<i>Don't worry.</i>

574
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,844
<i>Keep the camera rolling.</i>

575
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>Who should he apologize to?</i>

576
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,715
<i>Obviously,</i>

577
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,251
<i>to the people he's harmed.</i>

578
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,087
You said sorry to your wife
and the skateboarder, right?

579
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,523
Yes, and they accepted my apology.

580
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,224
Crap, it's him.

581
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,727
If so, don't you think
he can make his comeback now?

582
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,630
<i>But the public hasn't forgiven him yet.</i>

583
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,798
<i>The public?</i>

584
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,366
Do you mean you two?

585
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,536
I'm really sorry for causing trouble.

586
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,373
You don't have to apologize to us… Right?

587
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,742
Yeah, we weren't fans
to begin with anyway.

588
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,511
Obviously, no one's actually upset.

589
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,915
In that case, let's put down
two votes for yes.

590
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,616
<i>Got two votes.</i>

591
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,819
It's too contrived.
We can't broadcast this.

592
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,587
I mean, this isn't right!

593
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,224
He just wants to do his job, but he needs
the public's approval for that?

594
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,425
Forget about reporting.

595
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,961
Is there a place for him in entertainment?

596
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,431
If he were a comedian, he could get
an older comedian to rib him on YouTube

597
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,699
and pave a new path for him.

598
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,935
But TV announcers are
company employees, so…

599
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,704
If a big-name celebrity were to rib him,

600
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,173
wouldn't that send the message
that it's okay to do so?

601
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,508
Someone like Sanma.

602
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,310
I could do it.

603
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,045
Not you, Yashima. She said Sanma!

604
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,048
You put me in an economy seat
the other day, not that I mind.

605
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,617
Sorry, the budget
is a bit tight these days.

606
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,486
Four-eyes won't do the trick.

607
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,620
Your wife…

608
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,755
is on <i>PS</i>, right?

609
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,923
Oh, that's right!

610
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,126
Yoko's cooking segment just started.

611
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,928
He should appear on that, nonchalantly.

612
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:24,829
What?

613
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,767
He should wear matching aprons
with his older wife in the kitchen studio

614
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,869
and say, "Oh, I can't whip up meringue."

615
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,338
Then she'd reply, "Let me."
Whip, whip. "Here."

616
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,774
"Wow. You're amazing, Yoko!"

617
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,809
And they could keep this up
for a few years.

618
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,611
I like that, four-eyes! Pretty clever!

619
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,781
Once viewers get used
to his clumsy persona,

620
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,116
and memories of his affair
have been overwritten,

621
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,753
he can nonchalantly return by commentating
for a long-distance relay race.

622
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,054
That will never happen.

623
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,689
-Why not?
-Why not?

624
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,592
Impression management
can't overwrite memories.

625
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,727
It just adds another layer.

626
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,895
Layer?

627
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,029
Like a level.

628
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,466
If anyone brings up his affair,
it'll be back to that phase.

629
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,067
Phase is like a period.

630
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,337
Yesterday's affair will receive bashing
with the same intensity

631
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,506
as one from a decade ago.

632
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,708
Bashing, setting an example
and imposing social sanctions.

633
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,811
Shut up. I get the gist.

634
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,213
Maybe…

635
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,350
I really do have to resign.

636
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,552
No!

637
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,821
You can't set this precedent. Never.

638
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,389
But still…

639
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,358
If I were a regular person,

640
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,562
I wouldn't be receiving
this level of backlash.

641
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,871
It was just once.

642
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,273
A man messes up just once,

643
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,411
and this society won't let him return
to his former position.

644
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,346
Something's seriously wrong with that!

645
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,480
You know what?

646
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,049
It's not tolerant at all.

647
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,119
Even in mah-jongg,
beginners' mistakes are forgiven.

648
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,721
That's tolerance, isn't it?

649
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,491
It's the same for regular people.

650
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,026
What?

651
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,097
Kuramochi, how about
dinner tomorrow night?

652
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,534
Mr. Ogawa, you're welcome to join us.

653
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,277
-Hello. Come in.
-Hello.

654
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,380
I'm sorry. My husband is
a bit occupied right now.

655
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,282
Hey! Come in!

656
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,150
Kayo, watch over the bouillabaisse.

657
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,754
Don't just stand there!
I'll introduce you to everyone.

658
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,155
-Enjoy!
-Huh?

659
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,025
He didn't have that furrow here.

660
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:34,959
Yeah.

661
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,729
All right, everyone. Attention, please!

662
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,565
This is my company's announcer Kuramochi

663
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,000
and our counselor…

664
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,135
Hi, I'm Ichiro Ogawa.

665
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,303
I've brought wine.

666
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,871
Thank you so much.

667
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,775
We've been friends since kindergarten,
and we've brought our husbands and kids

668
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,144
to celebrate
Kayo and Kurita's anniversary.

669
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,345
She's Pocky.

670
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,781
She used to be as thin as a Pocky stick.

671
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,316
Now I'm like a Chocoroom.

672
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,719
That's funny.

673
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,221
I'm Takashima, her husband.

674
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,757
Third-generation director
at a cosmetic surgery clinic.

675
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,660
This is Taiko.

676
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,061
Her real name is Taeko,

677
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,264
but she caught a pervert
on her way to school in junior high.

678
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,533
Stop it. It's embarrassing.

679
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,869
We took "tai" from <i>hentai</i>
and call her Taiko.

680
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,239
And I'm <i>hentai</i> Taiko's husband, Hiratsuka.

681
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,807
I'm an architect.

682
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,543
This feels like something
straight out of <i>Kintsuma.</i>

683
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,378
Guess you don't know.

684
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,480
Shall we head out to the patio?

685
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,550
Patio!

686
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,053
I've never seen one outside of <i>Kintsuma</i>!

687
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,221
That's right.

688
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,389
Really?

689
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,727
So you were a junior high school teacher
and got recruited?

690
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,930
The folks at the TV station are
a lot like junior high school kids.

691
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,333
Hey, Kurita,

692
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,400
where are you off to?

693
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,603
It's getting chilly,
so I thought I'd grab a blanket.

694
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,272
Just sit down.

695
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,814
Come sit.

696
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,150
Right.

697
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,520
Anyway, Mr. Kurita's personality at home

698
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,789
is totally different
from his office persona.

699
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,459
You're aware, right?

700
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,195
This is your 20th wedding anniversary.

701
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,397
You know what that means.

702
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,199
Of course.

703
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,668
It's been 17 years…

704
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,603
since that occasion.

705
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,238
That occasion?

706
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,873
That sounds a bit flippant.

707
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,977
Let it go, Pocky. It's all in the past.

708
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,479
I've been telling her too.

709
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,548
-It's been 17 years already.
-There's no such thing as "already."

710
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,151
What's going on?

711
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,552
What's all this about?

712
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,022
-Say, Kuramochi.
-Yes?

713
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,691
You cheated on your wife, right?

714
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,926
Uh…

715
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,429
Yes.

716
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,533
Did Kurita say anything to you about that?

717
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,936
He's been giving me a stern talking-to.

718
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,807
So he can call out others
when they mess up.

719
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,710
It took him a while to admit it
when he did it himself though.

720
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,481
Just let it go already.

721
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,518
See? You've shocked Mr. Ogawa.

722
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,722
I think I get the gist.

723
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,258
Shall we head inside?

724
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,259
It's fine.

725
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,195
The kids understand.

726
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,868
It was such a mess.

727
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,904
Kayo was so upset, poor thing.

728
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,372
Oh, yes.

729
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,842
She found out he was having an affair
with her childhood friend, Hitomi.

730
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,610
My bad.

731
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,249
Ever since then,
we two couples gather every year

732
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,820
to make sure Mr. and Mrs. Kurita
are getting along.

733
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,955
You won't slip up this year,
will you, Kurita?

734
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,256
They say some people

735
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,194
in the entertainment industry
sleep their way up, you know.

736
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,329
That will never happen.

737
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,298
My wife has forgiven me,

738
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,568
and you guys can rest assured
I'll never make that mistake again.

739
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,002
Are you kidding me?

740
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:10,041
Kayo might've forgiven you,
but we will never forgive your betrayal!

741
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,145
Mr. Kurita, it seems
you're not getting it at all.

742
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:18,683
No amount of apologies can erase
what you've done.

743
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,018
It will never fix
Kayo and Hitomi's friendship.

744
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,753
One can never be zero.

745
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,990
I thought you understood
that much, at least.

746
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,960
Guess we'll have to check
on you again next year.

747
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:33,231
I can't forgive you for acting so carefree
when you've hurt our dear friend.

748
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,167
You're integrating into society,
reprimanding your subordinates,

749
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,035
and cracking jokes. It's unforgivable!

750
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,938
That's why I don't even watch TV.

751
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,573
Revolting.

752
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,312
What did you say?

753
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,781
Nothing.

754
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,090
This is the public, huh?

755
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,193
Go on, apologize.

756
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,295
Let it go, Pocky.

757
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,097
Apologize.

758
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,432
To Kayo

759
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,168
and Hitomi.

760
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,445
<i>I never imagined they had invited her.</i>

761
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,513
Yeah.

762
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,448
They didn't introduce her,

763
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,651
so I assumed she was a housekeeper.

764
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,487
She was the one he cheated with?

765
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,055
Kayo

766
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,891
and Hitomi,

767
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,627
I'm truly sorry.

768
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,298
For crying out loud,

769
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,567
you better not do it again.

770
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,704
Unbelievable.

771
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,140
It all felt staged too.

772
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,010
It seemed like
they were high on themselves.

773
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,213
But…

774
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,082
I don't know if I should say this.

775
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,183
Spill it.

776
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,820
These people…

777
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,824
It's none of their business.

778
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,693
It's none of their business!

779
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,195
They're no different
from the random people who comment online!

780
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,335
They dug up the past, made a fuss,
and intimidated the husband.

781
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,371
<i>And afterward, the wife</i>

782
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,574
<i>had this triumphant smile.</i>

783
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,178
All right, how about dessert?

784
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,547
It was so scary!

785
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:35,286
<i>Mr. Kurita understands the mindset
of online bashers better than anyone else.</i>

786
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,489
That's why he's perfect for the role
of Risk Management manager.

787
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,628
Have you ever cheated
on your wife, Mr. Ogawa?

788
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,029
No.

789
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,097
Actually,

790
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,131
yes.

791
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,899
-Huh?
-No, yes.

792
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,301
-Huh?
-No.

793
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,435
Which is it?

794
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,171
It was in my third year of our marriage.

795
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,707
<i>I must've thought that
unless I had an affair,</i>

796
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,410
<i>it meant I was unattractive and boring.</i>

797
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,018
I'm home!

798
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,891
Welcome back!

799
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,794
Yuri, one of my buttons is coming loose.

800
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,129
Leave it right there.

801
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,196
Okay.

802
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,269
<i>I pretended to be having an affair.</i>

803
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,837
<i>Or rather, I fabricated evidence.</i>

804
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,739
<i>I'll never forget my wife's reaction.</i>

805
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,112
After that, I was too scared
to ever cheat on her.

806
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,948
Sorry, it's a joke!

807
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,383
It's not what it looks like!

808
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,052
Look, Yuri.

809
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,219
It's April 1st.

810
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,721
April 1st?

811
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,356
It's April Fool's Day!

812
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,557
All Fool's Day!

813
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,093
Anyway, I didn't cheat on you.
It's just a joke!

814
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,462
-I'll stab you!
-Huh?

815
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,231
If you cheat on me,
I'll stab you and kill myself!

816
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,733
I didn't cheat on you.

817
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,134
-You really didn't?
-I didn't.

818
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,070
-Are you telling the truth?
-I am.

819
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,305
Thank goodness!

Can I help you?

00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,287
Are you Kyon Kyon?

867
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,923
I am.

868
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,058
No way.

869
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,960
W-What do you mean?

870
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,463
Kyon Kyon is the same age as me.

871
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,631
Huh?

872
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,566
-Huh?
-Huh?

873
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,801
That means you're her doppelganger!

874
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,702
Huh?!

875
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:19,970
-What?!
-Huh?

876
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,105
What?!

877
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,975
Is that you, Mutchy?
What are you doing over here?

878
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,377
-Look!
-Huh?

879
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,013
This lady is Kyon Kyon,
but she's not Kyon Kyon!

880
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,015
Huh? What are you talking about?

881
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,082
You're right!

882
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,884
It's Kyon Kyon, but not Kyon Kyon!

883
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:34,785
Barkeep, look!

884
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,388
-It's Kyon Kyon but--
-What's your problem?

885
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,422
You've been really rude!

886
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,657
It's Kyon Kyon's doppelganger!

887
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,559
No. Calm down, Mutchy.

888
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:42,960
Kyon Kyon…

889
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,962
is 58 now.

890
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,132
She's like this now.

891
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,769
Congratulations on your 40th anniversary.

892
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,904
Thank you very much.

893
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,106
I saw a poster of you

894
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,775
<i>on the wall in the toilet.</i>

895
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,510
<i>When I peeled it off,</i>

896
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,812
<i>there was this hole.</i>

897
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,948
<i>And when I climbed through</i>

898
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,749
<i>it was Showa 61.</i>

899
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,418
SHOWA 61 (1986)
JANUARY 18TH SATURDAY

900
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,123
You're really cute in person.

901
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,426
It's not flattering to hear that now.

902
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,896
There he is! There's my dad!

903
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,698
Stay back, doppelganger!

904
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,800
Akitsu, wait outside.

905
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,435
It's all right.

906
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,636
-Calm down.
-Stay back!

907
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,304
Let's go. No worries.

908
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,305
Let's step outside.

909
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,374
-Who are you?
-It's all right.

910
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,909
I'm scared!

911
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,844
Are you an actor?

912
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,880
Are you part of an acting troupe?

913
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,083
Is this actually the future?

914
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,284
It is, isn't it?

915
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,621
Forget about that. Just watch over Junko!

916
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,623
Wait, I passed my job interview

917
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,757
to become a host.

918
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,792
I'm going to straighten my hair
and make 100 million.

919
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,994
Hey!

920
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,862
Open the door!

921
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,865
Stop! Hey, open the door!

922
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:58,969
Bye!

923
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,804
Take care, Dad.

924
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,809
Who's this?

925
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,579
This is my dad.

926
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,254
Hey.

927
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,123
It's been a long time.

928
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,259
It's me, Mutchy.

929
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,107
I don't know what to say.

930
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,008
Subtitle translation by: Ai Matsuoka

931
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,209
Let's all go see Junko.

932
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,177
This is maternity harassment!

933
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,445
O-Outing?

934
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,480
-Unforgivable!
-That means I won't have to die.

935
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,482
Junko, help me!

936
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,018
It made me feel like
I could stay in Showa forever.

937
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,119
Is this a date?

938
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,754
You know nothing about my daughter.

939
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,023
I can't run the time machine anymore.
