1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,372
Look up a little.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,806
Now, turn a little this way.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,442
<i>It's a little embarrassing</i>

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,980
<i>for someone like me to be on the cover
of a working mom special issue.</i>

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,882
There are others, you know?

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,086
Employees younger than me
who are raising kids all on their own.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,222
-Look, it's Mommy!
-Machato!

8
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,224
<i>The mood of the office changed.</i>

9
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,262
<i>I'm getting the right amount
of support that I really need.</i>

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,463
-Okay.
-Look at the camera!

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,966
<i>"Calling me Joan of Arc is
an exaggeration."</i>

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,367
"Laughter in parentheses."

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,871
"But I want to keep doing my part
as an experienced mom."

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,142
"Inushima's eyes were set
on a bright future."

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:45,945
What do you think?

16
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,280
I feel proud of her.

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,883
Please read this part.

18
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:50,850
Hm?

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,189
"I know a female employee
who is planning and trying to conceive."

20
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,425
-"Here's what…"
-<i>…what I want to say.</i>

21
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,260
It's normal for life

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,630
to not go the way you plan.

23
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:09,069
So I think it's important to have
an open heart and go with the flow.

24
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,805
And take things lightheartedly.

25
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,973
This is harassment?

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,642
She's talking about me.

27
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,243
-Oh, yeah?
-Definitely.

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,113
She's the only one I confided in
about trying for a baby.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,815
This is

30
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,450
outing, isn't it?

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,786
O-Ou…?

32
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,122
Outing.

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,891
Revealing someone's gender identity
or private information

34
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,693
without their permission.

35
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,863
I keep learning new words,
but there's always more.

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,797
Unforgivable!

37
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,265
This is maternity harassment!

38
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,867
"Lightheartedly"? Get real!

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,802
This isn't a lighthearted matter for me!

40
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,272
Sorry.

41
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,642
I'm shocked.

42
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,379
I didn't intend to single anyone out.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,483
Let alone engage in maternity harassment.

44
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,052
In that case, you should watch
your words a bit.

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,753
It's been bothering me for a while.

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,455
You can be a little harsh sometimes.

47
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,389
Huh?!

48
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,457
That expression!

49
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,925
It's just like Junko's.

50
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,393
I don't feel respected.

51
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,529
I don't want to hear that
from you, Grandpa.

52
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,899
Even you calling me "Grandpa"
can be taken two ways.

53
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,069
Do you mean I'm your
actual grandfather or just an old man?

54
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,004
I see.

55
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,875
Next time I see Sugiyama, I'll apologize.

56
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,210
Wait,

57
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,445
isn't that risky?

58
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,346
Huh?

59
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,348
Oh, right.

60
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,416
She might press charges
against you, Mr. Ogawa.

61
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,317
Me?

62
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,452
But why?

63
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,454
Confidentiality.

64
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,957
Counselors aren't supposed
to discuss their clients with outsiders.

65
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,326
But you're family,
so naturally, I'd tell you.

66
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,563
You know what, people keep
way too many secrets.

67
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,400
If you're trying for a baby,
don't hide it. Be open about it.

68
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:52,272
"Sorry, I'm heading home to have
some hanky-panky with my husband."

69
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,873
-Grandpa.
-Right.

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,843
Do you really equate trying to conceive
with having hanky-panky?

71
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,744
Am I wrong?

72
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,479
Less hanky-panky is causing
the declining birthrate.

73
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,148
Maybe you should face charges.

74
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,318
It's not that simple, okay?

75
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,421
There's still this notion
that if you're trying for a baby,

76
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,223
you'll be taken off the career track.

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,692
That, in itself, is
maternity harassment, though.

78
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,861
Hey!

79
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,796
Why have you been glancing at your phone?

80
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,231
Sorry.

81
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,267
This is our company's new matching app.

82
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,405
"Un-MAY"?

83
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,141
Wait, are you on the hunt for a spouse?

84
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,042
No.

85
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,443
I'm just testing the product.

86
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,379
It's not performing as expected,
so they wanted my feedback.

87
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,814
I see.

88
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,684
So you're finally getting serious, Akitsu.

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,087
If you tie the knot,
I can return to Showa without worries.

90
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,556
I'll install the app too.

91
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,991
The thing about Un-MAY is

92
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,460
that it incorporates
the hyper-matching mode,

93
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,230
offering better efficiency
and value compared to other apps.

94
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,464
Hyper-matching?

95
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,134
By finely tuning your preferences
for age, gender identity, education,

96
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,804
yearly income, personality,
hobbies, favorite places,

97
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,673
and even preferred cuts of grilled meat,

98
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,177
you can avoid matching with partners
who don't align with your preferences.

99
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,448
But if you already know all that,
what's left to talk about if you do match?

100
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,583
I got a match!

101
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,484
-What?
-What?

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,720
I used your photo, Akitsu.

103
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,321
#JUST_WANT_HANKY-PANKY

104
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,223
Wait a minute, Mr. Ogawa!

105
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,592
Why did you use this picture?

106
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,595
Jeez.

107
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,671
Nagisa.

108
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,805
-Oh.
-Hey.

109
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,374
I watched the second episode.

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,009
<i>Seventeen</i> is incredible!

111
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,977
Thanks.
We're still shooting the third one.

112
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:38,878
Yikes.

113
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,048
He gives her the ring on the beach, right?

114
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,216
And the ring…

115
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,617
Doesn't fit.

116
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,919
Is that a metaphor?
Or was her finger swollen?

117
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,154
-It's a metaphor.
-Oh.

118
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,829
Good morning.

119
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,581
That girl is trying for a baby, right?

120
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,383
Hey.

121
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,919
Even if you know,
you shouldn't talk about it.

122
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,088
She's not keeping it a secret, though.

123
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,790
What, really?

124
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,625
FERTILITY RECIPES

125
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,362
Apparently, she bought an apartment
in the suburbs to prepare for a kid.

126
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,864
I see.

127
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,233
She's really going for it, huh?

128
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,569
WHEN WILL YOU COME HOME TONIGHT?

129
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,638
<i>Ever since she was
in the drama department,</i>

130
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,140
<i>she'd start trying for a baby
as soon as she got a boyfriend.</i>

131
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>She'd skip catered lunches,</i>

132
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,644
<i>take unauthorized leaves,
and be late to work.</i>

133
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,545
<i>Wait!</i>

134
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,215
She bought an apartment and is trying
for a baby when she's not married?

135
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,516
She's trouble.

136
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,320
When her superior finally talked to her,
she made a fuss about it being harassment.

137
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,689
That's why she moved
to the variety department.

138
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,458
You should be careful.

139
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,392
See you.

140
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,293
Thanks.

141
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,763
MATCHED WITH KYOKO

142
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,365
That's the sixth one!

143
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,801
You got a message from Kyoko,
working at a securities firm.

144
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,270
Well? You should narrow them down
to one soon.

145
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,472
I won't meet any of them.

146
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,473
Why not?

147
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,742
Because the app's flaws are obvious now.

148
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,211
You're right.

149
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,879
The editing is so heavy-handed

150
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,349
that some of these girls
have gone beyond cute.

151
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,452
Nobody realizes
that you're pretending to be me.

152
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,688
That's why
our company's app isn't growing.

153
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,491
Then, let's pick one
using the Six Poems Game.

154
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,660
<i>Living in Kasukabe</i>

155
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,330
<i>Shiori is an apprentice pastry chef…</i>

156
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,664
Mr. Ogawa.

157
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,368
<i>Her hobbies are cooking and hot yoga</i>

158
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,437
Is romance really necessary?

159
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,572
What even is romance?

160
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,908
Is it the buildup to getting together?

161
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,910
Or is maintaining a relationship?

162
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,713
Is it from the moment
you get together until you get married?

163
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,315
<i>Living in Setagaya…</i>

164
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,217
I've never fallen for anyone.

165
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,186
No one's like that.

166
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,687
Well, I am.

167
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,426
You just haven't met your soulmate yet.

168
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,163
Seeing a bunch
of non-soulmates just to find one is

169
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,631
a waste of time and effort.

170
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,466
Shut up. You're a guy, right?

171
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,667
Don't you want hanky-panky?

172
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,869
When you want that
with someone, is that love?

173
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,904
How would I know?

174
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,439
So annoying!

175
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,840
What's this?

176
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,110
It's fancy food a girl would make
for an anniversary.

177
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,179
It's <i>acqua pazza</i> and kale salad.

178
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,581
So annoying!

179
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,316
Guys don't cook like this.

180
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,318
They have chopped tuna and stewed offal.

181
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,920
Tell me,

182
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,957
have you never lost sleep over someone?

183
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,793
And dashed out of your room
in the dead of night to yell?

184
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,497
Or squeezed a pillow
between your legs and yelled?

185
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,566
Is that what romance is?

186
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,800
Just give it a try.

187
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,069
Clutch a pillow and yell.

188
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,505
Too weak!

189
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,106
Louder!

190
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,108
Louder.

191
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,177
-Hey.
-Huh?

192
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,780
"I Googled the cafe in Oshiage."

193
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,950
"It's a cool retro spot."

194
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,551
"Okay, see you at five!"

195
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,789
Kyoko, from the securities firm,
is coming to Scandal tomorrow!

196
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,429
I wonder if she's here.

197
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,133
Okay.

198
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,235
I'll check first.

199
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,003
Here's your order.

200
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,505
Thank you.

201
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,340
Would you like some milk?

202
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,276
I'll take it black. Thanks.

203
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,964
Did you see her?

204
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,033
There's a different woman.

205
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,236
Well, everyone enhances their photos.

206
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,571
Even her age is different.

207
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,606
I mean, what year is it?

208
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,309
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,610
What have you done?

210
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,212
You can't come over here.

211
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,380
Hey, Barkeep!

212
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,848
Two soda floats, please.

213
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,416
This is Akitsu, by the way.

214
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,152
You're Ms. Sakae Sakisaka,

215
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,353
the feminist.

216
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,857
I can't live without depending on a man.

217
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,725
Like the woman <i>In the Realm of the Senses</i>.

218
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,260
Wait, what happened?

219
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,862
You've become pretty too.

220
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,863
Thank you.

221
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,897
Not a compliment.

222
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,499
The teacher from Class B, Grade 3,

223
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,934
Mr. Yasumori.

224
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,404
The guy with the 90-centimeter inseam.
What about him?

225
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,139
I…

226
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,877
I got to start dating him.

227
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,914
Got to, huh?

228
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,683
See, Akitsu?

229
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,419
Leave a guy and a girl,
and they get together.

230
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,056
After your divorce,
"a hole was left deep in your heart."

231
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,325
"I'll fill it with food."

232
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,460
Hey, Barkeep! Hurry up!

233
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,661
-Two?
-Yeah.

234
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,562
Right.

235
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,832
Anyway, Kyoko might come soon.

236
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,267
No smartphones, no X,

237
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,302
no DMs or emails.

238
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,538
But they more than make up for this lack.

239
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,940
Oh, the way men court in the Showa era!

240
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>He ambushed me outside my house
without an appointment.</i>

241
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,847
Hey, I suddenly felt like seeing you.

242
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,485
<i>When he wasn't in his usual spot,
he covered my eyes from behind.</i>

243
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,586
Guess who?

244
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,922
<i>Then he hugged me, spun me around,</i>

245
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,324
<i>and patted my head,
heedless of the public eye.</i>

246
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,692
<i>He put his arm around me.</i>

247
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>When I sprained my ankle,
he carried me bridal style.</i>

248
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,896
<i>He danced,</i>

249
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,064
<i>danced some more,</i>

250
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,399
<i>and enjoyed the salad bar.</i>

251
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,304
<i>I love you more than a salad bar</i>

252
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,473
<i>And he sang with a guitar,
gazing into my eyes.</i>

253
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
Take notes, Akitsu.

254
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,910
This is what love looks like.

255
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,612
I'm not sure.

256
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,215
Sounds like moral harassment by a stalker.

257
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,216
But…

258
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,218
I didn't hate it.

259
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,820
It had been ages since I experienced that,

260
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,956
and it might be the last.

261
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,459
It made me feel like
I could stay in Showa forever.

262
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,363
Did you have

263
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,398
hanky-panky with him?

264
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,105
Um, sorry to break in.

265
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,507
Kyoko's here.

266
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,409
Forget the excuses, Mrs. Compliance.

267
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,110
Just tell me

268
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,679
if you had hanky-panky.

269
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,686
Um, Kyoko is here.

270
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,820
Hanky-panky?

271
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,458
Wait, this is a love hotel.

272
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,959
Did you realize that now?

273
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,294
No.

274
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,396
It slowly dawned on me

275
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,832
after we passed under the curtain
in the parking lot.

276
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,667
I want to clarify something.

277
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,635
What?

278
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,005
Whether doing that

279
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,674
in a place like this,

280
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,609
will still feel like that.

281
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,812
That's a lot of demonstrative pronouns.

282
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,347
I talked to you about Eiji Bando, right?

283
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,248
Yes.

284
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,984
You like his looks, right?

285
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,952
No, yours.

286
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,856
So until I find something positive
about you beyond your looks,

287
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,791
I imagine you look like Eiji Bando.

288
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,227
I feel silly saying it.

289
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,562
Did you find something?

290
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,199
"Did you find something?"

291
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,601
What's with your self-esteem?

292
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,269
Sushizanmai?

293
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,205
You throw me off.

294
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,140
I don't understand you.

295
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,743
Are you conservative, gentlemanly, wild,

296
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,711
kind, or calculating?

297
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,649
Do you need to put me

298
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,184
in a category?

299
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,387
I think

300
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,290
you're a lovely woman, Sakae.

301
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,661
I love how you're cool,
intense, cute, and gallant.

302
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,063
-Everything--
-Stop it.

303
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,568
Keep going.

304
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,937
Because all of those are

305
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,674
integral parts of who you are.

306
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,809
Actually, stop.

307
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,346
If you're too affirming,
I'll feel like denying them.

308
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,614
And of course,

309
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,350
I love your looks too.

310
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,191
Me too.

311
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,361
I love you, even if you're Eiji Bando.

312
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,971
-Huh?
-Well…

313
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,640
-Huh?
-It's nothing.

314
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,974
-Huh?!
-It's nothing.

315
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,042
-C--
-What?

316
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,943
A Color Timer?

317
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,245
No, it's not.

318
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,447
Ugh.

319
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,852
-Hello?
-<i>It's me.</i>

320
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,086
<i>There's been a problem.</i>

321
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>Come back now.</i>

322
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,025
It's not easy to be bad, is it?

323
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,860
You weren't being bad.

324
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,795
You're single now, after all.
Right, Akitsu?

325
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,031
He left with the woman.

326
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,066
What? That bastard!

327
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,901
Ugh!

328
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,037
I should've had <i>icchome</i>
before coming back.

329
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,139
"<i>Icchome</i>"?

330
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,374
Like "Wow, Higashimurayama"?

331
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,978
Wait a minute.

332
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,313
This isn't funny.

333
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,214
Where's Kiyoshi?

334
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,448
Is he home with Junko?

335
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,051
It's like something from <i>Tonda Couple</i>.

336
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,653
This is bad! They can have
all the hanky-panky they want!

337
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,689
I left a note, so it's okay.

338
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,724
Besides, she's busy studying for her exam.

339
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,693
She is?

340
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,028
Junko!

341
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,964
Help me.

342
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,633
What's that?

343
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,901
Murasaki Shikibu?

344
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,603
It's the note Mom left.

345
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,705
Um, read this part.

346
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,110
<i>Kiyoshi, this is what you must do
while you're in Showa.</i>

347
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,347
<i>You must bring your father
together with your mother.</i>

348
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,248
Are you listening?

349
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,783
Unless you two meet,

350
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,653
I won't exist.

351
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,922
You can't expect me to believe you.

352
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,258
-This isn't <i>Back to the Future</i>.
-Welcome.

353
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,361
I've brought her.

354
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,830
Nice to meet you.

355
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,932
I'm Sakae Sakisaka.

356
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,670
Sakae.

357
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,604
Okay.

358
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,509
You should say hi, at least.

359
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,111
She's come all the way from Matsudo.

360
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,579
A kid from elementary school?

361
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,450
I only feel romantically attracted
to someone older than me.

362
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,955
Ugh.

363
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,658
This sucks.

364
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,827
I even used Dep to stiffen my hair.

365
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,728
True.

366
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,330
Your hair is gleaming.

367
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,232
Saying you're only into someone older is

368
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,768
like admitting you're unreliable.

369
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,305
It's obvious you want someone
to pamper you and it's really lame.

370
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,273
She's really Sakae.

371
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,675
In the first place,

372
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,543
the fact you're concerned about age

373
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,846
shows you're not seeking
an equal partnership.

374
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,749
I bet you see women
as accessories for men.

375
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,919
The only older woman who'd put up
with that nonsense is

376
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,354
probably your mom.

377
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,958
So why don't you go home and
get her to pamper you?

378
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,802
What you did was uncalled-for.

379
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,204
How many times do I have to tell you?

380
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,473
Time paradoxes are off-limits.

381
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,942
Our first meeting was supposed to be

382
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,978
at the local government's
matchmaking event.

383
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,180
Yes, you're right.

384
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,450
It won't be
a "nice to meet you" situation.

385
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,684
Seriously.

386
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,454
You've become pretty too.

387
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,490
Want me to tell you why?

388
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,658
Anyway,

389
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,927
what's the problem you mentioned?

390
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,762
Truth is,

391
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,699
our sponsor backed out.

392
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,368
Jason?

393
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,337
There's a mail-order company in Shanghai.

394
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:50,342
The CEO is a Chinese-American
named Jason Chen.

395
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,345
What does it say?

396
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,647
He's pulling out
of the time machine business

397
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,950
because his company isn't performing well.

398
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,020
That means…

399
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,521
What?

400
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,056
I can't run

401
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,091
the time machine anymore.

402
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,394
I'm sorry.

403
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,701
<i>The time machine is over</i>

404
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,270
I got it. No need to sing.

405
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,005
That was a close call.

406
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,007
What do you mean? What about Kiyoshi?

407
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,010
I can't stay here forever either.

408
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,613
No, this won't do, Inoue.

409
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,181
Do something, I beg you.

410
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,783
I feel like begging myself.

411
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,585
I didn't even get to take a single trip.

412
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,486
How much?

413
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,156
I'll pay 2… No, 30,000.

414
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,527
A single trip costs
a few million just for the fuel.

415
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,036
<i>Of course.</i>

416
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,739
<i>I was starting to get used to it,</i>

417
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,642
<i>and I was seeing it
like some sort of long-distance bus.</i>

418
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,545
<i>But it's a time machine.</i>

419
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,520
<i>If I can't go back to Showa,</i>

420
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,322
<i>that means I won't have to die.</i>

421
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,691
<i>No, what about Junko?</i>

422
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,393
<i>I can't survive without her. Stupid!</i>

423
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>That time,</i>

424
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,834
<i>I managed to travel
without the time machine.</i>

425
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,773
Ow!

426
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,748
<i>I don't think this will work.</i>

427
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,550
<i>There isn't enough precedent.</i>

428
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,718
What are you doing?!

429
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,157
Ow!

430
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,027
What year is it?

431
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,963
Stop messing around and come with me.

432
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,133
Nagisa Inushima has been called in
on suspicion of power harassment.

433
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,701
What?!

434
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,276
We'll be filming this just in case.

435
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,485
This is Ms. Sugiyama's lawyer.

436
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,489
Have you told Ms. Sugiyama
to work extra hours

437
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,358
knowing she was trying to conceive?

438
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,829
I don't believe I have.

439
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,634
There are three
assistant producers, including her,

440
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,571
so I schedule the shifts
by talking to them.

441
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,373
May I?

442
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,744
Do the other two assistants know
she's trying for a baby?

443
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,881
I think they're pretending not to know.

444
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,386
Trying for a baby is
pretty sensitive stuff, after all.

445
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,123
Have you suggested any clinics
or supplements to her?

446
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,758
I only wanted to help.

447
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:53,892
I just thought

448
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,229
it must be rough not being able
to talk to anyone about it.

449
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,497
May I?

450
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,332
What is it, Mr. Ogawa?

451
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,402
Don't you think this girl is
partly to blame too?

452
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,339
She was keeping it secret at work,
but was dropping hints on social media.

453
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,641
So people had to tread
extra carefully around her.

454
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,879
She said the reason she wasn't open
about it was to avoid sexual harassment.

455
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,447
As feared,

456
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,484
after the employee magazine came out,
she started receiving slander.

457
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,055
That's absurd.

458
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,924
There's no way to tell
if the article was referring to her.

459
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,093
Can you give us examples?

460
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,999
"Hey, Sugiyama,
are you getting hanky-panky?"

461
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,202
No way.

462
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,104
"It's a three-day holiday,
so three times maybe?"

463
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,673
"If you're going to do it,
do it in the evening."

464
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,176
"<i>Sunset on Third Sex</i>, just kidding."

465
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,511
HE KEEPS MAKING INAPPROPRIATE REMARKS
AS HE TIME-TRAVELED FROM 1986

466
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,046
I'm very sorry!

467
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,849
So that's why you were a bit on edge.

468
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,719
I just couldn't shake off
that Showa mindset.

469
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,654
I'm very sorry.

470
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,156
It's not just you, Mr. Ogawa.

471
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,025
No.

472
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,563
In fact, we all have
a little Mr. Ogawa inside our hearts,

473
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,866
and we need to acknowledge
and eliminate them.

474
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,068
They tend to multiply if left alone.

475
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,638
Please don't talk about me
like I'm some bad germ.

476
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,110
Ms. Sugiyama is having a tough time
trying to get pregnant,

477
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,413
<i>and here you are, juggling work
and raising your kid.</i>

478
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,982
<i>To her, you seemed like someone
who's got it all figured out.</i>

479
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:25,717
But…

480
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,720
And then you made that comment last week.

481
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,823
You know what I'm referring to, right?

482
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,328
When should we have our next meeting?

483
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,063
After the broadcast on the 18th?

484
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,266
Sorry, I have to try for a baby.

485
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,408
Okay, how about 2 p.m.
the following Monday?

486
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,176
I have an appointment with a clinic.

487
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,344
Sorry.

488
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,182
How about Tuesday morning or afternoon?

489
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,283
I'm trying for a baby.

490
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,951
You don't have to keep saying that.

491
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,020
Actually, I think I should.

492
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,022
I shouldn't take sudden absences.

493
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,692
In that case,

494
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,095
I'll plan the shifts for that week
without including you.

495
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,730
You're welcome to join if you can.

496
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,799
Well, see you after the broadcast.

497
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,367
-Good work.
-Thank you.

498
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,407
"Without including you."

499
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,810
Even you understand, don't you, Mr. Ogawa?

500
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,081
This falls under pre-maternity harassment.

501
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,386
But that wasn't my intention.

502
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,590
In fact, I was trying to make it
easier for her to take time off.

503
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,992
Women shouldn't feel guilty
about trying for a baby.

504
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,494
Or stress about how men see them--

505
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,762
I hear you.

506
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,432
But it doesn't matter
if it wasn't your intention.

507
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,501
You, of all people, should know that.

508
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,304
Ms. Sugiyama…

509
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,273
will be taking a break
due to a mental breakdown.

510
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,376
Nagisa,

511
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,378
please take

512
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:00,879
a month off as well.

513
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,983
But why?

514
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,519
I messed up way more than she did.

515
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,888
Why am I not being reprimanded?

516
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,391
Because I'm a bad germ?

517
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,162
I understand.

518
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,236
Could you…

519
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,006
pass this message to Ms. Sugiyama for me?

520
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,413
I…

521
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,549
don't have it all figured out or anything.

522
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,752
I'm still struggling,

523
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,788
and I lose many fights too.

524
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm a working mom who can't manage
without asking for help.

525
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,731
I love my job

526
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,267
and I love my son.

527
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,204
Those are the only things
I can be proud of now.

528
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,577
But by the time you become a mom,

529
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,814
I hope I can offer you some support.

530
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,985
With what's happened,

531
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,456
I don't want you to feel discouraged
about trying to conceive.

532
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,827
I'm not great with words.

533
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,996
But…

534
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,667
I'm here for you.

535
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,049
Excuse me.

536
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,691
I see.

537
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,359
You're taking some time off?

538
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,596
I've asked Mr. Kurita to cover for me,

539
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,763
so no worries.

540
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,832
I'm just a stand-in myself.

541
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,637
In the showbiz, you never know
when someone else might take your place.

542
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,272
You're too modest.

543
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,042
You know how you get surprised
by new buildings in Shibuya?

544
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:15,046
But when you try to remember
what used to be there,

545
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,582
it's hard to recall.

546
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,019
I'll watch your show when it airs.

547
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,187
Thanks.

548
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,788
-Excuse me.
-Uh-huh!

549
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,473
Let me reintroduce her.

550
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,910
This is Ms. Kyoko Yano
from the securities firm.

551
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,580
Sorry about this weird old man
living with him.

552
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,883
How many dates have you
been on before today?

553
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,818
Dates? Is this a date?

554
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,186
I'm not sure.

555
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,088
I couldn't reserve a table today.

556
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,390
Wait a minute, you two.

557
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,824
You're formal with each other?

558
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,892
Yes.

559
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,627
I feel more at ease this way.

560
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,862
Yes, same here.

561
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,265
Now there are two people
who get on my nerves.

562
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,466
Wait,

563
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,801
so you two aren't a thing?

564
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,338
We matched on the app
because we had similar preferences.

565
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,674
I've never been in love
with anyone either.

566
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,843
But I never have trouble
finding a sex partner.

567
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,413
Why are you nodding, Akitsu?

568
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,948
She's not making any sense.

569
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,551
A meal partner, a sex partner,
a gaming partner…

570
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,653
Having personal time is important.

571
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,255
Oh, please.

572
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,357
I'm starting to feel
like I'm the weird one.

573
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,361
By the way, Ichiro, um…

574
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,197
How long are you planning to stay here?

575
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,366
As I've said,

576
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,236
until you get married
and Nagisacchi returns to the office.

577
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,841
I'll use the bathroom.

578
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,447
I hate to say this, but…

579
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,682
I can make a pretty good guess.

580
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,253
You're welcome to stay here,

581
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,589
but I thought it might be awkward for you.

582
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,969
Welcome.

583
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,404
I'm sorry

584
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,240
for intruding on your family.

585
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,677
She's taking a month-long childcare leave.

586
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,712
That's quite swanky of the TV station, no?

587
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,347
Father, will beer do?

588
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,248
Yeah.

589
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,584
You're looking good.

590
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,054
Nagisa takes me out for a walk every day,

591
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,024
and she even watches my calorie intake.

592
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,126
Coming.

593
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,494
All right.

594
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,230
Machato went to nursery school yesterday,

595
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,298
so we went to a public bath, right?

596
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,703
I said I'm on childcare leave
so he wouldn't worry.

597
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,138
Got it.

598
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,739
Huh? Who's that from?

599
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,474
It's a hometown tax gift.

600
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,375
What?

601
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,410
Could it be…

602
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,279
As I thought, it's from Mr. Yashima.

603
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,115
Huh? Snow crabs from Hokkaido.

604
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,284
That's quite swanky of him!

605
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,886
He's creepy, so let's toss this.

606
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,055
No, let's accept it.

607
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,057
It was Four-Eyes being swanky.

608
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,060
But the three of us
can't finish all of this.

609
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,897
Why don't we invite those two?

610
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,499
Is that so?

611
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,401
So you're stepping in as Junko's mother.

612
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,804
Just while Ichiro is away.

613
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,138
How is she?

614
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,840
Is Junko doing well?

615
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,741
Yes.

616
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,478
At first, she was puffing away
and calling me an old biddy.

617
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,447
I wanted to give her a spanking.

618
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,748
But she's a really good girl.

619
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,316
She sure is.

620
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,685
She's a good girl.

621
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,253
Don't cry every time.

622
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,855
Sorry.

623
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,023
It's just…

624
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,226
I can't tell if she's real or not,
if she's alive or not.

625
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,728
It's so confusing.

626
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,697
I wish I could cry too.

627
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,733
I might never see her again.

628
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,704
How was life back in the Showa era?

629
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,842
Everyone talks about the good old days,

630
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,343
but I'm not so sure.

631
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,345
Because I wasn't born then.

632
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,215
Let's see.

633
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,718
The food nowadays is definitely better.

634
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,919
I agree.

635
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,122
The conveyor belt sushi
over here is amazing.

636
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,656
The water is different.

637
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,159
But that cafe's <i>Napolitan</i> dish…

638
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,661
Scandal's <i>Napolitan</i> doesn't taste
the same anymore.

639
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,696
Absolutely.

640
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,332
It tastes worse now. It's soggy and mushy.

641
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,968
I think the geezer's grip is failing.

642
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,370
Really? I actually quite enjoy it.

643
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,772
You're being fooled.

644
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,573
It's almost worth asking for a refund.

645
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Anything else besides food?

646
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,476
You're a sociologist, aren't you?

647
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,547
They show boobs on terrestrial TV.

648
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,815
Oh, yeah.

649
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,950
Nip slips were everywhere!

650
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,619
They were happening right and left!

651
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,854
How embarrassing!

652
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,724
Overall, it was quite noisy.

653
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:54,692
You mean the streets?

654
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,327
The construction?

655
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,896
No, the people.

656
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,499
At the station or supermarket,
everyone was chitchatting away.

657
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,702
Nowadays, people have this and this.

658
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,772
They just look things up
instead of asking, so it's quieter.

659
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,509
I've never considered that before.

660
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,714
What about sexual or power harassment?

661
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,349
Just terrible.

662
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,952
It's so bad that
you have to numb yourself to it.

663
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,420
No standards for identifying them either.

664
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,759
A society that's a bit insensitive…

665
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,462
might be easier for me personally.

666
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,838
I don't think simply identifying
harassment helps, though.

667
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,574
Labeling something as power harassment

668
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,109
or moral harassment
instead of power harassment.

669
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,011
By putting them into little categories,

670
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,714
people feel like
they've addressed the problem.

671
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,352
I see.

672
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,991
I would've liked to go

673
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,860
to Showa.

674
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,999
That was yummy.

675
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,905
Inoue,

676
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,306
bring your car tomorrow.

677
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,841
What for?

678
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,778
Let's all go see Junko.

679
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,224
INUSHIMA FAMILY'S GRAVE

680
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,293
JUNKO INUSHIMA

681
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,198
I thought you'd be buried
in the Ogawa family's grave.

682
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,466
Sorry about that.

683
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,137
Died at 28, huh?

684
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,440
That hurts.

685
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,209
But…

686
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,244
everyone here…

687
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,880
is connected through Junko.

688
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,385
She's my daughter.

689
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,321
My mother.

690
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,456
My senior.

691
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,091
My wife.

692
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,527
Right?

693
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,439
Please enjoy.

694
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,881
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

695
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,019
I said when you finish high school,

696
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,255
let's get married.

697
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:40,959
No way.

698
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,728
So when you said you weren't listening,

699
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,496
it came as a shock.

700
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,333
Sorry.

701
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,738
I've always admired you

702
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,808
and tried to follow in your footsteps.

703
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,744
And I still like you.

704
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,214
But…

705
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,984
the world is big,

706
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,021
much bigger than your footsteps.

707
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,490
And I discovered

708
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,960
there are many ways to live.

709
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,629
I learned that too.

710
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,866
I've taken the bus there, you know.

711
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,201
I went after you.

712
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,769
To the future?

713
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,404
Yoasobi,

714
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,373
Ikinari Steak,

715
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,576
Takanawa Gateway…

716
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,879
I even met Kyon Kyon in her 50s.

717
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,051
KYOKO KOIZUMI

718
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,220
And yet,

719
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,156
you can still remain true
to your own style.

720
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,658
You really are

721
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,527
cool.

722
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,429
Occupation, being hot.

723
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,098
Mutchy, that's me.

724
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,967
I wish you luck.

725
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,256
Did I just…

726
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,625
get dumped?

727
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:25,897
Sorry I'm late.

728
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,432
I just arrived myself.

729
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,167
Are you hungry?

730
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,668
No, I'm good.

731
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,236
-I won't be staying.
-Welcome.

732
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,605
-No <i>Napolitan</i> for me, then.
-Right.

733
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,843
I mean…

734
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,448
I realized you weren't it.

735
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,049
Not it?

736
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,017
Sorry.

737
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,654
Do you mean…

738
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,355
my preferences?

739
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,957
I guess so.

740
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,560
I don't think I'm as dry as you.

741
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,228
Should I elaborate?

742
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,530
Yes, please.

743
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,533
This is our chat yesterday.

744
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,470
"Sorry, I'm having drinks with my junior."

745
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,604
"Okay."

746
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,739
"Akitsu, do you have
an early day tomorrow?"

747
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,774
"Yes."

748
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,275
"Sorry."

749
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:12,810
"Okay."

750
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,846
"I might not make it today."

751
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,614
"Right."

752
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,317
When I saw it this morning,

753
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,285
I realized you weren't the one.

754
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,020
Um…

755
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,455
Will I marry this guy?

756
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,556
No.

757
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,125
Especially

758
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,960
the "Yes" threw me off.

759
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,829
"Do you have an early day tomorrow?"
"Yes."

760
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,797
It's a lazy reply.

761
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,665
Sorry.

762
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,767
It's fine. It's just who you are.

763
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,769
I'm glad it made me realize

764
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,240
that I wanted you to feel jealous
and be more concerned about me.

765
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,909
I realized I have
preferences like that too.

766
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,614
Can't we learn to figure things out
as we continue to--

767
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,781
No.

768
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,750
My dream is to marry with zero dating.

769
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,751
Sorry.

770
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,323
Would you still like the <i>Napolitan</i>?

771
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,692
Oh, hey.

772
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,030
Akitsu.

773
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,198
We did it.

774
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,399
I can go home.

775
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,336
We found backup fuel for the time machine
in the lab at the university.

776
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,672
Enough for one round trip only.

777
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,073
KYOKO YANO
YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED

778
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,974
So,

779
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,911
when you get married
and Nagisacchi returns to work…

780
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,546
Stay here forever.

781
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,847
What?

782
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,218
So this is how it feels.

783
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,119
What?

784
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,587
What's wrong, Akitsu?

785
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,123
Any song will do.

786
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,925
Please sing me a breakup song.

787
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,760
Then it has to be "Restaurant."

788
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,094
Hey, Barkeep! Hurry!

789
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:37,995
Right.

790
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,431
I just realized something.

791
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,501
I was in love

792
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,169
with Kyoko.

793
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,006
So this is what it feels like

794
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,576
to be in love.

795
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,743
"SHITSUREN RESTAURANT"

796
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,113
Not that one.

797
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,317
I want one that goes,
"Even though I know you're not here."

798
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,118
Those songs should hit home right now.

799
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,387
I'll give them my full attention.

800
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,733
Junko!

801
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,504
Jun--

802
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,212
Kyoko!

803
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,916
You're not listening, are you?

804
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,852
Kyoko!

805
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,922
This tastes awful!

806
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,234
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

807
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,969
It's Thursday, right?

808
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,382
Good morning.

809
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,117
Good morning.

810
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,258
Ms. Namiki?

811
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,793
Yes?

812
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,664
They won't collect the bottles
unless you take off the labels.

813
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,634
Right.

814
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,137
Sorry about that.

815
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,744
Ms. Namiki?

816
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,416
But they always take them.

817
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,987
These bottles…

818
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,591
are the ones you brought last week.

819
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,061
They've been here the whole time,
so I took them home,

820
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,330
removed the labels, and brought them.

821
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,701
Please remove the labels.

822
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,474
Do you…

823
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,711
Sorry?

824
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,013
Do you have to talk down to me like that?

825
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,083
I just made a mistake,
like any other person.

826
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,684
Don't you ever make mistakes?

827
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,819
So you don't?

828
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,926
Hey!

829
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,060
Pour water.

830
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,328
There you go again.

831
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,265
That's why you get accused
of power harassment.

832
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,748
What do you mean by that?

833
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,690
You know nothing about my daughter.

834
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,791
Stop it, Dad.

835
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,093
Nagisa hasn't engaged in power harassment.

836
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,162
Absolutely not.

837
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,197
Even if,

838
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,233
for some reason,

839
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,735
by some chance, she has,

840
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,238
for me,

841
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,907
she's my only beloved daughter.

842
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,610
I've known her for 34 years.

843
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,213
Don't take one single incident,

844
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,516
take it out of context,

845
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,785
and label it as power harassment!

846
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,622
Don't categorize my daughter

847
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,291
based on society's standards!

848
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:31,862
Yuzuru!

00:40:55,653 --> 00:41:00,958
<i>From separating your trash</i>

859
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,831
Dad!

860
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,304
Okay. I get it.

861
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,406
No, you don't.

862
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,075
Ever since my wife passed away,

863
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,879
Nagisa has been my only family.

864
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,615
What's the matter, Yuzuru?

865
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,983
Hello.

866
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,285
Please send an ambulance right away.

867
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,154
That's enough, Dad.

868
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,656
Even in my current condition,

869
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,792
she hasn't abandoned me,

870
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,627
and she always stays by my side.

871
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,829
So don't speak ill

872
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,964
of my daughter!

873
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,198

All right.

887
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,670
Slowly.

888

I apologize for the disturbance.

890
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,514
I'll be away for a while,

00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:36,186

Nagisacchi,

906
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,764
let's go see your mother this Saturday.

907
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,301
You want to visit her grave again?

908
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,469
No.

909
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,637
While we're there,

910
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,905
I'll treat you to some amazing <i>Napolitan</i>.

911
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:04,842
What?

912
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,247
This is the last trip, right?

I'm Ogawa from Heaven.

915
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:39,910
No way!

916
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,613
-The engine started!
-I'll give up on the time machine.

917
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,647
Don't say that!

918
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,882
"I can't say goodbye."

919
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,050
"You idiot!"

920
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,018
It's okay to take better care of yourself.

921
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,054
So I'll never see you again.

922
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,523
It's my duty as a parent
to save my daughter.
