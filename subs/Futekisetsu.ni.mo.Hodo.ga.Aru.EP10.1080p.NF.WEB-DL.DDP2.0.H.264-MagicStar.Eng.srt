1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:05,939
Number 53.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:06,840
Got it.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,875
-Do you need a bag?
-Nope.

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,044
No chopsticks, no spoons. I'll use PayPay.

5
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,197
Shut up. Go home already!

6
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,435
How does Aimyon know how I feel?

7
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,469
She doesn't!

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,504
A breakup song sung

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,373
by a broken-hearted man is
like a staff meal.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,274
I'm leaving.

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,175
What do you mean?

12
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,246
When someone's singing at a karaoke,
and they're not good or hilariously bad,

13
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,680
it's the most stressful thing.

14
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,749
I'll end with "Dried Flower."

15
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,650
Don't.

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,186
You're making me hate my favorite songs.

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,891
I don't want to go back to that room.

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,927
I can't forget the six days
I spent with Kyoko.

19
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,464
I won't forget how you kicked me out
after we lived together for half a year.

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,167
So this is what loss feels like.

21
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,602
A world without Kyon Kyon…

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,638
Don't call her that
after she dumped you, stupid.

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,276
Have you finished handing over your tasks?

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,243
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,112
I've found a good successor.

26
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,881
I'm Kurita, the manager
of Risk Management.

27
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:22,949
Thank you.

28
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,184
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,019
You know, Mr. Ogawa,

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,721
I never dreamed
you'd introduce me to Ms. Sakisaka.

31
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,024
She's the complete opposite of me,
but a good fit.

32
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,325
She's more than welcome.

33
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,394
We can highlight our corporate governance.

34
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,729
I'll also be diving into
promoting gender equality.

35
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,531
<i>True.</i>

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,401
It sounds like
the perfect position for her.

37
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:42,802
Anyway,

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm steadily sorting out
my affairs like that.

39
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,877
Are you really okay?

40
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,454
I've pretty much done all I could,

41
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,990
and I've got a rough idea
of what my future holds.

42
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,094
I even got to meet
my grown grandchild and great-grandchild.

43
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,263
I had a lot of interesting experiences.

44
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,564
It's not half bad.

45
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,266
For a future like this,

46
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,435
your grandpa could give it
a bit more effort.

47
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,842
I wouldn't mind if you stayed forever.

48
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,914
But I guess you can't.

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,316
Maybe I could,

50
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,684
but there's Junko.

51
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,990
She'll have hanky-panky.

52
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,093
I'm excited to see her.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,361
She'll be thrilled.

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,862
But…

55
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,497
don't act like her daughter.

56
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,465
I know.

57
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,235
I'll act like an older sister
just like I did last time.

58
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,271
Hey!

59
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,674
You totally forgot about me, didn't you?

60
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,942
I did.

61
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,677
I wish you had already gone home.

62
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,413
When a guy's just had his heart broken,

63
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,882
he's like the main character 24/7.

64
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,019
You can't forget about him or ignore him!

65
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,986
How's your father?

66
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,021
Ogawa!

67
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,560
Father!

68
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,329
Can I help?

69
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,230
It's fine.

70
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,199
I need some exercise.

71
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,602
Sorry for visiting.

72
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,004
It's just I might not see you again.

73
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,372
So…

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,575
is it finally goodbye, Father?

75
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,476
The time machine,

76
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,646
I wanted to use the last trip
for Nagisacchi.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,315
You know,

78
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,150
she's been rather down lately.

79
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,084
-Here.
-Oh.

80
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,327
This won't be
the last time we see each other.

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,294
Not at all.

82
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,130
In fact, you'll see me again
four years from now.

83
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,166
This is Yuzuru Inushima.

84
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,968
I'm going to marry this man.

85
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,136
I hate to say this,

86
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,172
but I doubt I can approve
of your marriage.

87
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,773
Right.

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,175
Please don't.

89
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
I can't marry her off
to a guy with such wide shoulders.

90
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,278
Are you sure?

91
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,679
Nagisacchi won't be born.

92
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,081
Don't worry about that.

93
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm pregnant.

94
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,485
You bastard!

95
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,554
Huh?

96
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,422
That means…

97
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,592
If I really try to break you two up…

98
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,627
You bastard!

99
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,527
<i>It's fine.</i>

100
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,763
It doesn't matter how much you oppose it.

101
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,566
My name might mean "yield,"
but I will never yield.

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,702
I'm the champion of Roppongi, after all.

103
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,239
Father, do you see?

104
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,974
Please believe me.

105
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,111
Eventually, Nagisacchi will be born,

106
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,613
and Junko and I will pass away.

107
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,315
However,

108
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,083
in 2024,

109
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:49,088
you will travel through time
and appear before me.

110
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,156
Nice to meet you,

111
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,591
sir.

112
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,059
A bunch of things happen.

113
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,161
I return to Showa, and four years later,

114
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,629
you will come to see me.

115
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,366
-And I won't approve.
-Please don't.

116
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,467
You bastard!

117
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,036
Nagisacchi will be born,

118
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,305
Junko and I will die…

119
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,507
And in 2024,

120
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,177
you will travel through time
and appear before me.

121
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,245
Nice to meet you,

122
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,346
sir.

123
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,581
I return to Showa, and four years later…

124
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,650
-Let's stop. I feel sick.
-Right.

125
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,505
What should we do about this Falsetto?

126
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,307
It's even affecting his work.

127
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,276
He burst into tears at a client's place.

128
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,546
I want to Kyon Kyon with hanky-panky!

129
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,183
Can't we do something
to help him with your app?

130
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,720
The latest version features
a lock-on hyper-matching mode,

131
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,756
which lets you lock onto a partner
who shares a 99% compatibility.

132
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,026
But only the users themselves can register
for this system.

133
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,507
Hey, you can't do that!

134
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,613
How do I do it?

135
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,100
Sorry, I dozed off.

136
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,869
You should start getting ready soon.

137
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,504
The bus leaves at 4:55 a.m.

138
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,875
The return bus departs
in 11 hours at 3:55 p.m.

139
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,343
Don't be late.

140
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,611
It's a self-driving bus,

141
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,312
so it will depart right on schedule.

142
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,114
Right. We hear you.

143
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,182
Shall I go too?

144
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,351
Don't. You'll go "eeee" again.

145
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,253
Isn't…

146
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,054
the send-off team small?

147
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,624
Don't you think more people could've come?

148
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,892
Like Yashima.

149
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,361
He declined because it was too early.

150
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,562
I should've guessed.

151
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,131
Maybe I'm not popular enough.

152
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,032
I can call my dad.

153
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,600
No need. I'll see him anyway.

154
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,302
And he's not that special to me.

155
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,372
Please send Kiyoshi back.

156
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,842
Even if he hates it and you have to use
force, put him on the bus.

157
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,743
Right.

158
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,346
Please inform me

159
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,550
that the Mutsugoro Kingdom
will close down.

160
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,785
I promise…

161
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,023
to find happiness.

162
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,494
It's all about yourselves, huh?

163
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,300
Mr. Ogawa, you too…

164
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,205
It's okay to take better care of yourself.

165
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,341
Just kidding.

166
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,412
Thanks.

167
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,052
To save fuel,

168
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,323
my students will push
the bus to the bus stop.

169
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,525
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

170
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,494
-What?!
-What?!

171
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,299
-Hup, two!
-Hup, two!

172
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,868
-Hup, two!
-Hup, two!

173
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,102
Will this work?

174
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,804
I'm super worried.

175
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,306
Yes!

176
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,774
The engine started!

177
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,809
Close the window!

178
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,944
-Hup, two!
-Put your backs into it!

179
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,279
-Hup, two!
-Put more!

180
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,548
-Hup, two!
-Hup, two!

181
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,729
Good work!

182
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,630
Thanks.

183
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,536
Huh?

184
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:10,683
SCHOOL-6-URA

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,794
Welcome to Showa.

186
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,529
Well?

187
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,932
It stinks.

188
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,501
Stinks? That's a first.

189
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,104
Well, you'll get used to it.

190
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,514
Nagisa!

191
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,150
-Junko, how have you been?
-Great.

192
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,418
I'm coming in.

193
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,765
Is that…

194
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
Grandma?

195
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,602
No, that's my mom.

196
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,405
He's my geezer's wife,
but she's not an old woman.

197
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,774
She passed away at 35, after all.

198
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,110
-Where are you going?
-Uh…

199
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,244
Just going for a smoke.

200
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:46,846
You can do it here.

201
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,014
Right.

202
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,450
Nah.

203
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,452
I'll smoke outside.

204
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,656
What was your mother like?

205
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,891
Yuri?

206
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,627
She was a bit quirky.

207
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,062
Ichiro.

208
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,730
What did you have for lunch today?

209
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,065
Let's see.

210
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,501
I had my dear wife's bento box.

211
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,236
What did you enjoy most?

212
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,570
Let's see.

213
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,739
The breaded chicken breasts

214
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,608
and definitely the omelet.

215
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,843
The omelet was sweet and delicious.

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,046
That's what fueled my victory today.

217
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,814
What do you think is for dinner?

218
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,650
Let me think.

219
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,485
I'm getting a strong whiff of curry.

220
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,355
Lastly, what do you want to say
to your wife?

221
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,024
Yuri, I love you
more than anything in the universe!

222
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,460
Love you too!

223
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,030
That happened every night?

224
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,031
Every single night.

225
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,766
Even as a kid,

226
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,269
I remember wondering
if my parents were a bit strange.

227
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,640
What about your mom? What was she like?

228
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,576
Uh…

229
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,615
The oldest memory I have of her…

230
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,919
was when I was around five.

231
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,256
My grandpa came from Tokyo to visit.

232
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,626
Nagisa, your grandpa from Tokyo is here.

233
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,695
<i>I could tell my dad was nervous.</i>

234
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,629
Welcome.

235
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,565
Even though I was just a kid.

236
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
Come on, Nagisa.

237
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,335
Sit on Grandpa's lap.

238
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,703
<i>I could kind of tell</i>

239
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,942
it was up to me to ease the tension.

240
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,878
But I wasn't sure how.

241
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,314
<i>And Grandpa smelled like cigarettes.</i>

242
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,284
I see.

243
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,220
Do you have a photo?

244
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,291
No.

245
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,994
But…

246
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,230
I remember.

247
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,800
That awkward feeling…

248
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,836
and the smell of cigarette smoke.

249
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,683
Hey!

250
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,584
You seem well.

251
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,986
MAIYOMI NEWSPAPER

252
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,387
You're back.

253
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,489
I came back to watch <i>Tonight</i>.

254
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,726
What will you do?

255
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,033
You couldn't have hanky-panky with Junko,

256
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,068
but you saw boobs on terrestrial TV.

257
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,170
Aren't you craving

258
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,338
a Mango Frappuccino from Starbucks?

259
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,379
I am.

260
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,015
Well,

261
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,817
the bus leaves at 3:55 p.m.

262
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,118
So say bye to your friends.

263
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,920
Here you go.

264
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,288
Please enjoy.

265
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,191
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

266
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:52,998
What is it?

267
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,868
Are you

268
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,837
and Kiyoshi Sakisaka…

269
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,172
Yeah, we're living together.

270
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,843
Where did Sakae go?
I want to get in touch with her.

271
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,546
Um…

272
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,615
Did I do something wrong?

273
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,851
I can't remember what it was.

274
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,119
Besides,

275
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,256
you know how she's
a little strange, right?

276
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,157
Huh?

277
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,525
Yasumori?

278
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,894
What's up?

279
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,498
Is she a hostess?

280
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,200
Is this a paid date?

281
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,101
Huh?

282
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,269
Keep it in moderation.

283
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,037
Lemon squash.

284
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:32,938
Right.

285
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,874
Bill, please.

286
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,774
Coming.

287
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,446
Sorry.

288
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,183
So much has happened in such a short span.

289
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,685
-Shall we eat?
-Yeah.

290
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,561
I don't think your junior colleague is
still angry with you.

291
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,096
I'm trying for a baby.

292
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,833
I'm not sure.

293
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,236
Everyone can get wrapped up
in their own stuff sometimes.

294
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,140
In those moments,
people's words and attitudes

295
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,543
can sting like glass shards.

296
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,112
Once she calms down and reflects,

297
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,282
I'm sure she'll see that
you didn't mean it like that.

298
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,585
Oops, sorry.

299
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,953
I didn't mean to be bossy.

300
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,087
It's fine.

301
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,359
Anyway, I think she is regretting it now.

302
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,597
She probably wants to apologize,
but it's just awkward for her.

303
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,444
It's good.

304
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,387
Goodness!

305
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,624
You can cook well when you try, Barkeep!

306
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:00,793
Me?

307
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,528
The <i>Napolitan</i>!

308
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,929
It tastes so different!

309
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,764
Why? Did you change something?

310
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,600
No, it's the same old.

311
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,637
You should always prepare it
this way, then.

312
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,639
You're a pro, aren't you?

313
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,475
Don't make it soggy and mushy!

314
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,609
Nagisa.

315
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,612
You've got ketchup on your face.

316
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,148
Really? Where?

317
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,616
Let's sit.

318
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,717
I'm changing schools.

319
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,687
Oh, yeah?

320
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,589
When?

321
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,758
Today.

322
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,327
Huh.

323
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,464
I've lost even more motivation
to go to school now.

324
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,106
<i>Well,</i>

325
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,543
you've had the <i>Napolitan</i> and a soda float.

326
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,445
What other Showa-era activity is there?

327
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,515
The no-panties cafe got busted, after all.

328
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,116
I've had enough.

329
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,751
I'm full.

330
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,688
I see.

331
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,458
-Hey.
-I know!

332
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,295
Riding behind Mutchy on his bike is
a Showa thing to do!

333
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:45,931
Akitsu?

334
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:47,933
Yeah.

335
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,236
-I'm Mutsumi Akitsu.
-Yeah.

336
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,440
He's Akitsu's dad.
Don't they look exactly alike?

337
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,076
Wait, you changed your look.

338
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,511
You're giving off Senri Oe vibes.

339
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,547
I bought these

340
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,649
from the DC brand.

341
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,819
Sorry, Mutchy!

342
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,488
I was late because I got
caught up drawing my eyebrows.

343
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,722
You look cute.

344
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,559
SCHOOL-6-URA

345
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,993
Thanks, everyone.

346
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,329
I wasn't expecting such a crowd.

347
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,999
A larger send-off team isn't
necessarily better.

348
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,367
Kiyoshi.

349
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,270
These past six months have been a blast.

350
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,438
Thanks.

351
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,074
Junko…

352
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,377
-Me too.
-Sakisaka.

353
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,847
Say hi to your mother. Don't forget.

354
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,014
Write me.

355
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,116
Call me.

356
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,016
Yeah.

357
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,785
Huh?

358
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,753
"I can't say goodbye."

359
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,088
"You idiot!"

360
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,123
Who are you?

361
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,592
Tell my future self,

362
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,393
the Mutsugoro Kingdom is everlasting!

363
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,395
Did everyone put in a word?

364
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,631
Here comes!

365
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,057
Thanks,

366
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,659
Mr. Ogawa.

367
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,001
So I'll never see you again.

368
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,539
I'll see you again.

369
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,242
But you…

370
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,850
You wouldn't know me.

371
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,106
It didn't tingle.

372
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,716
Take care of yourself.

373
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,552
Take care.

374
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,088
Grandpa.

375
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,333
Grandpa?

376
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,470
She meant I'm an old man.

377
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,572
Dad.

378
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,941
Mom.

379
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,611
Please

380
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,179
try to get along.

381
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,616
Hey.

382
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,984
It's almost time.

383
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,085
What about this?

384
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,286
Keep it.

385
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,988
I'll get a new one.

386
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,670
Thank you, Junko!

387
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,675
Kiyoshi!

388
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,477
Junko!

389
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,779
Take care!

390
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,416
Thanks for showing me your boobs!

391
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,717
What?!

392
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,688
Bye-bye!

393
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,944
Huh?

394
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,646
Who are you?

395
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,549
My predecessor, Ogawa, left this?

396
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,918
Yes, 30,000 yen.

397
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,255
So, you two had a same-sex marriage?

398
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,289
Yes,

399
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,391
using the partnership system.

400
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,794
Takeda works for an IT-related company

401
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,529
and received a money gift.

402
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,697
I got 30,000 yen.

403
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:16,201
But EBS said they couldn't provide a gift
unless we could prove our marriage.

404
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,937
A TV station is supposed
to be progressive.

405
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,506
It should recognize same-sex marriage.

406
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,008
That's why we went to him.

407
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,343
Hold up!

408
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,412
Here. It's not much, but…

409
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,482
No, that's not what we were asking for.

410
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,050
Take it! It's the least I can do.

411
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,518
I can't accept this.

412
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,419
Just take it!

413
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,490
So he was pretty accepting
of same-sex marriage, huh?

414
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,792
I'm not sure
if he fully grasped it, though.

415
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,196
Anyway, I'll return this to you.

416
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,130
No, please don't.

417
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,465
I don't need it.

418
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,367
It would be weird for me to take it.

419
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,401
And I'll help you get

420
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,671
dependency allowances
and other welfare benefits.

421
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,773
It's what you deserve.

422
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,275
KATSUSHIKA WARD
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 6

423
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,176
I'm sorry

424
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,445
for taking a long leave.

425
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,347
You don't smoke, Ms. Takasugi,

426
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,149
so I got a reusable bag.

427
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,217
Did everyone get one?

428
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,651
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

429
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,387
The only one left is the principal.

430
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,322
Mr. Ogawa!

431
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,759
Where have you been
for the past six months?

432
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,293
Training.

433
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,995
Didn't the principal inform you?

434
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,830
We should celebrate your return.

435
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,432
-Yasumori!
-Yes?

436
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,833
Time to bond over drinks!

437
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,301
Let's do it.

438
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,640
So noisy.

439
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:30,809
-Yasumori.
-Yes?

440
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,877
Where's the principal?

441
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,547
Let's step outside.

442
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,048
They made him quit?!

443
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,884
Why? What did he do?

444
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,285
Actually, the principal…

445
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,588
was a pervert.

446
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,258
Was he groping? Peeping?

447
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,225
Streaking?

448
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,628
Could you please explain?

449
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,799
<i>He was going as far as Shinjuku
and Ikebukuro on his days off</i>

450
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,335
<i>to dress in drag and stroll around,
which some parents noticed.</i>

451
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,236
<i>Hold on.</i>

452
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,705
Is it a crime to dress in drag?

453
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,508
Isn't it a crime?

454
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,743
No, it's not.

455
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,044
Groping is a crime,

456
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,246
but dressing in drag is just a hobby.

457
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,150
Anyway, go on.

458
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,286
This person is a surgeon,

459
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,621
and this one's a bureaucrat.

460
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,224
Secretary.

461
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,727
People with similar interests
dress up and meet up.

462
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,229
Then, over lunch,

463
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,566
we chat about cool cosmetics

464
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,569
or cute underwear being sold in Harajuku.

465
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,271
We swap information like that.

466
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,806
Stop, I don't want to hear it!

467
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,708
Aren't you embarrassed as a clergyman?

468
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,044
I'm at a loss for how to apologize.

469
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,212
Why are you apologizing?

470
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,980
Because it's setting a bad example!

471
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,048
Let's make this clear.

472
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,150
Are you going to stop
drag or quit teaching?

473
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,619
In that case, I quit.

474
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,821
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

475
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,960
That's terrible.

476
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:55,861
Absolutely.

477
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,896
I never expected that from him.

478
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,498
No, I'm referring to you people.

479
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,799
It's just a personal hobby.

480
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,335
He's not bothering anyone,
and yet you all bashed him.

481
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,803
This is seriously messed up!

482
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,073
Mr. Ogawa, you've…

483
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,842
changed somehow.

484
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,247
No, I haven't.

485
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,448
May I?

486
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,851
That guy came here last Saturday, right?

487
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,986
Keep it in moderation.

488
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,821
Lemon squash.

489
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:23,722
Right.

490
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,590
Bill, please.

491
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,826
I saw him later that day.

492
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,405
Thank you.

493
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,351
Thank you.

494
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,926
Goodness!

495
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,061
You can cook well when you try, Barkeep!

496
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:04,896
Me?

497
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,299
And I thought he looked
like a pretty nice chick.

498
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,600
Are you serious?

499
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,502
So for the time being,

500
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,204
Vice-Principal Saeki will be filling
in for the principal.

501
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,041
I really can't stand Saeki.

502
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,676
He's so boorish

503
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,843
and boring.

504
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,646
Men's greetings and women's skirts

505
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,214
should be short, after all!

506
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,020
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

507
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,488
<i>I want to go home.</i>

508
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,358
<i>Is this really
a welcome back party for me?</i>

509
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,493
Excuse me, can you take our order?

510
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,262
With pleasure!

511
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,465
<i>He said "with pleasure,"
but he's taking his time.</i>

512
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,134
<i>Guess you can't expect much
given the low wages.</i>

513
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,135
Ms. Takasugi.

514
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,338
Can I have a sip of that?

515
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,608
Here you go.

516
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,012
Where did you drink from?

517
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,147
An indirect kiss?

518
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,882
Don't say that!

519
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,453
My predecessor just didn't have
what it takes.

520
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,488
And it turns out, he was gay.

521
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,658
He brought shame
upon the legacy of School 6.

522
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,061
Dressing in drag doesn't
necessarily mean someone is gay.

523
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,498
And it's "men's speeches
and women's skirts."

524
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,333
Speeches and skirts alliterate.

525
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,302
Either way, it's inappropriate.

526
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,572
O-ga-wa!

527
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,476
Go easy on me!

528
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,377
Yeah!

529
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,444
Ogawa from Hell!

530
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,946
-Ogawa from Hell!
-Yeah!

531
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,816
Youngster Yasumori,
what's going on with the truant?

532
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,385
Do you mean Tsuyoshi Sako?

533
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,553
Well, it's not looking too good.

534
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,789
Sometimes you need tough love.

535
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,693
You need the harshness of lions
pushing their cubs off a cliff.

536
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,562
What's missing here is communication.

537
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,766
You've got to open up and have a chat,

538
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,702
and value both vertical
and horizontal connections--

539
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,736
Revolting.

540
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,205
Hey, Mr. Ogawa!

541
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,408
Why emulate lions?

542
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,609
You're not Mutsugoro.

543
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,211
We're humans, both teachers and students.

544
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,515
"Open up"?
"Vertical and horizontal connections"?

545
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,350
At a mandatory drinking party?

546
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,419
That's just peer pressure!

547
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:09,788
Ogawa…

548
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,922
Each student is

549
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,158
different from the other.

550
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,228
You can't simply impose the idea
of willpower on them and call it a day.

551
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,566
These kids are the ones who will shape
the future 30 or 40 years from now.

552
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,034
Let's treat them with care!

553
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,669
H-Hey.

554
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,471
What's gotten into you, Mr. Ogawa?

555
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,372
Yeah.

556
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,307
Your sound arguments are tiresome.

557
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,475
What?

558
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,944
Come on, Ms. Oversized Tits.

559
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,380
Pour some more sake
for the deputy principal.

560
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,514
Right.

561
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,349
You don't have to do that!

562
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,754
Regardless of being a woman or young,
you don't have to settle for that role!

563
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,523
If people are being revolting,
tell them so!

564
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,658
I'm…

565
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,060
leaving!

566
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,130
-Mr. Ogawa!
-Mr. Ogawa.

567
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,065
Thank you for waiting. What's your order?

568
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,167
Bring 200 plates of Broiled <i>Shime Saba</i>!

569
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,702
With pleasure!

570
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,673
Shortstop!

571
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,645
You could've gotten that one!

572
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,047
Get lower in your stance!

573
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,117
What's going on? What?

574
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,754
Please spank us with a bat.

575
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,590
Okay.

576
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,930
This is stupid.

577
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,398
Gather around!

578
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,235
Listen up.

579
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,271
As of today, Ogawa from Hell is retiring.

580
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,039
From now on…

581
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,343
I'm Ogawa from Heaven.

582
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,547
Those guys who become pros

583
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,183
take action before they get yelled at.

584
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,352
Keep that in mind.

585
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,254
In the future,

586
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,523
Japan is going to pump out
tons of major leaguers

587
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,024
who'll be global stars.

588
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,693
A pitcher who wins a home run title.

589
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,428
A two-way player.

590
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,197
He's got a head this tiny.

591
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,333
And his butt is
right at my face level.

592
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,303
How am I supposed to spank
someone like him, huh?

593
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,772
Are big leaguers popular with girls?

594
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,542
What do you think?

595
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,678
What's the matter, Inoue?

596
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,080
I want to practice!

597
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,184
Right.

598
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,352
Let's practice.

599
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,289
Make sure to stay hydrated.

600
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,631
Wake up, ugly!

601
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,366
You female gorilla in heat!

602
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,702
-I'm already up.
-Huh?

603
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,508
Didn't I tell you I've got a practice exam
and a meeting with the teacher after that?

604
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,444
You've changed, Junko.

605
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,146
Who is this guy?

606
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,982
Don't you know Abe?

607
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,084
He's the model for <i>MEN'S NON-NO</i>.

608
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,290
Well,

609
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,659
what about me?

610
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,795
Have I changed?

611
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,230
Huh?

612
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,632
What're you talking about, geezer?

613
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,434
-Cash, please.
-Uh…

614
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
Here.

615
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,972
Here's your bento box.

616
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,873
Huh?

617
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,675
I might've made the omelet too sweet.

618
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,211
Good luck.

619
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,250
Looks like it's just us again.
At least it's cozy.

620
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,318
If you say stuff like that, I'll remarry.

621
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,554
Go ahead and try.

622
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,989
You farting geezer.

623
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,692
<i>No matter how hard she studies,</i>

624
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,395
<i>I already know Junko's future.</i>

625
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,801
Your daughter is amazing.

626
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,104
She could enter college
straight from high school.

627
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,772
Don't say that!

628
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,107
I'm serious.

629
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,542
Up until April, her grades were
at the very bottom.

630
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,044
Her standard score was just 30.

631
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,847
She was the lowest-scoring delinquent
and look at her now!

632
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,882
Junko doesn't have to go to college.

633
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,884
Get a job after high school.

634
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,853
Work at a bar or even in sexual services.

635
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,421
What are you saying, geezer?

636
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,323
Aren't you thrilled? I got an A.

637
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,525
You worked so hard, Ogawa!

638
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,195
You used to be too dumb
even for AGU's kindergarten.

639
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,531
It's okay for Junko to be dumb.

640
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,768
I wish you'd stayed dumb!

641
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,848
Do you think…

642
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,152
I should tell Junko the truth?

643
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,322
Who cares about the time paradox?

644
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,092
It's my duty as a parent
to save my daughter.

645
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,129
But I can't tell her.

646
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,398
Nagisacchi won't exist.

647
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,033
More than anything,

648
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:50,768
Junko seems

649
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,304
so happy these days.

650
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,344
Maybe I've changed.

651
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,481
What do you think, Yuri?

652
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,317
Is it bad for me to change?

653
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,519
It's only natural, right?

654
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,655
Especially after all I've learned.

655
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,025
<i>You probably got an update.</i>

656
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,761
An update?

657
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,397
<i>Learning about diverse perspectives</i>

658
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,165
<i>gave… update.</i>

659
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:22,900
No way.

660
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,068
Yuri?

661
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,269
Where are you?

662
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,371
Yuri?

663
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,839
-Yuri?
-<i>Mr. Ogawa?</i>

664
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,041
<i>Calm down.</i>

665
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,376
<i>It's me,</i>

666
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,677
<i>Sakae.</i>

667
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,215
So it's you.

668
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,282
What is it?

669
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,019
You're the one who called.

670
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,620
Mr. Ogawa,

671
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,490
if you don't update
your phone to the latest version,

672
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,924
it'll stop connecting.

673
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,159
How's it going there?

674
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,961
We're managing.

675
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,929
Kiyoshi is buckling down on his studies.

676
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,265
How's Nagisacchi?

677
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,301
She's back at the office tomorrow,
so I'll tag along just in case.

678
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,213
I'm very sorry for causing you
worry and trouble.

679
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,282
Right.

680
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,784
If there's anything I can do…

681
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,686
Don't give her
the obvious kid-glove treatment.

682
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,221
Welcome back, Nagisa.

683
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,325
I got out for some outdoor filming
after so long. It was a blast.

684
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,629
Have you been following
Mr. Yashima's bathhouse adventures?

685
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,032
I love how he dilutes the bath
and gets scolded for it every time.

686
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,134
<i>So hot!</i>

687
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,371
YASHIMAN'S BATHHOUSE ADVENTURES

688
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,339
<i>Here goes. It's hot!</i>

689
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,242
<i>Hot!</i>

690
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,113
<i>So the water is 42 degrees, right?</i>

691
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,347
<i>It's so hot.</i>

692
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,716
<i>My bath is always at 39 degrees.</i>

693
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,985
What, 39 degrees? He's not a kid anymore.

694
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,554
<i>So hot!</i>

695
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,522
Oh! That's risky! Stop!

696
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,423
Isn't it showing?

697
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,324
-Um…
-Huh?

698
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,959
Yashima Junior is showing!

699
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:55,860
Excuse me!

700
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,030
Sugiyama…

701
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,165
got transferred, right?

702
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,102
Yeah, she works
on the 20th floor in the annex,

703
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,773
<i>in the contents management department
at the new contents rights office.</i>

704
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,509
<i>It's fewer hours,
so it shouldn't be too tough for her.</i>

705
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,445
That's a relief.

706
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,815
That was my biggest concern.

707
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,885
I'm really glad.

708
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,253
Make sure

709
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
you don't try to apologize in person.

710
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,824
Is it that bad?

711
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,526
Of course, it is.

712
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,395
For her, what happened
with you is traumatic.

713
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,665
It might trigger flashbacks.

714
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,968
Have you seen
Hiromi Sugiyama's social media?

715
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,738
"My power-harassing superior
is coming back to the office."

716
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,739
"I want to puke."

717
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,574
That's horrible.

718
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,645
I'm appalled by your lack of sensitivity
in sharing this with her.

719
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,381
No, this isn't locked,
so anyone can see it.

720
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,482
This…

721
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,784
is even worse than facing her in person.

722
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,253
This is verbal violence.

723
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,554
I hear you,

724
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,958
but the company doesn't want
any more victims or perpetrators.

725
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,729
<i>I understand, but…</i>

726
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:09,167
Saying whatever you like on social media
and blocking anyone you don't like.

727
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,468
This trend irritates me.

728
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,271
Maybe staying
in the Showa era has changed me.

729
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,439
Things here aren't much better, though.

730
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,242
The deputy principal took a bully
to the victim's house

731
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,878
and had them apologize in person.

732
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,381
Seriously? What kind of show is that?

733
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,284
Not only that, he gave
a passionate speech at a PTA meeting.

734
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,587
The bullied must share
some of the blame as well.

735
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,391
Please talk about it at home.

736
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,425
That's terrible.

737
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,494
Living in the Showa era is tough.

738
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,529
I want to go back to Reiwa!

739
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,599
I want a salad sushi roll
from Sushiro while watching <i>LOVE It!</i>

740
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,669
Well, let me share a few cases
I had to deal with today.

741
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:45,570
Yeah.

742
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,272
"We got a complaint about
the lack of women in the <i>Sentai</i> series."

743
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,641
"They claimed
it's a remnant of patriarchy."

744
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,443
"Should we also include homosexuals?"

745
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,344
What?!

746
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,614
"Should we copy streaming sites
and avoid showing men's nipples?"

747
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,515
Are you kidding?

748
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,817
"I'm being accused
of harassment by an assistant director,

749
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,485
but it's completely unfounded."

750
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,222
"When I said it was harassment harassment,

751
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,856
they claimed that was harassment."

752
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,259
"In other words,
harassment harassment harassment."

753
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,560
"Now I'm facing countercharges."

754
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,461
No!

755
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,729
I can't stand Reiwa!

756
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,065
What's wrong? Are you okay?

757
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,969
-Sorry, could you hold this for me?
-Sure.

758
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,637
Maybe there's a rat.

759
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,006
I keep hearing
a rattling noise in the toilet.

760
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,843
Can we agree both Showa
and Reiwa are tough to live in?

761
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,578
They're both tough to live in.

762
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,913
And neither are tolerant.

763
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,214
Totally!

764
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,216
Tolerance isn't the same as indifference.

765
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,151
The kid-glove treatment isn't it either.

766
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,520
I hate informal events
and drinking parties.

767
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,189
No matter what someone did to you,

768
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,959
to say "I want to puke"
about another person isn't right.

769
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,194
Totally!

770
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,096
We're not smartphones.

771
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,731
We're humans.

772
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,799
So even if one person
couldn't get an update,

773
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,336
as long as the other is tolerant,
we can still get along!

774
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,638
Tolerance!

775
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,740
We need more tolerance!

776
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,310
<i>I have been nagging</i>

777
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,712
<i>And complaining</i>

778
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,248
<i>But at the end of the day</i>

779
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:10,821
<i>Both the old and the young</i>

780
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,158
We should be more tolerant!

781
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:20,364
<i>There is no such thing as perfect equality</i>

782
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:24,068
<i>Reiwa and Showa, men and women</i>

783
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,638
<i>Differences in looks, personality, taxes</i>

784
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,540
<i>If they're slight differences</i>

785
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,108
<i>Let's put up with them</i>

786
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,011
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

787
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,246
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

788
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,481
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

789
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,116
<i>Let's be accepting</i>

790
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,954
<i>I'm not you</i>

791
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,092
<i>So I can't understand you 100%</i>

792
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,329
<i>If there's a 2% or 3% difference</i>

793
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,531
<i>Let's hold back</i>

794
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,499
<i>From making comments</i>

795
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,868
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

796
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,070
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

797
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,238
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

798
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,474
<i>Let's turn the power off</i>

799
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,178
<i>No matter what you say, you get bashed</i>

800
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,079
<i>Bashed!</i>

801
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:12,116
<i>Stay quiet and you get criticized</i>

802
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,486
<i>Because that's how the world is</i>

803
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,321
<i>More than poison</i>

804
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,925
<i>Tolerance is important</i>

805
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,426
Important!

806
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,529
<i>Woman, you're so competent</i>

807
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,664
Woman?

808
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,667
<i>Wake me up at six tomorrow</i>

809
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,037
<i>Don't wake me until nine</i>

810
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,774
<i>I'm not your alarm clock</i>

811
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,875
<i>Let's be tol--</i>

812
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:38,776
No!

813
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,511
Tolerance isn't indulgence!

814
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,183
<i>Saying woulda coulda shoulda won't help</i>

815
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,554
<i>Just stay focused on the future</i>

816
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:55,793
<i>Look behind you every once in a while</i>

817
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,397
<i>Yield the way when you need to</i>

818
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,498
<i>And</i>

819
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,300
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

820
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,370
<i>Let's be Forbearing</i>

821
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,975
<i>Is seventeen an adult?</i>

822
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,109
<i>Or still a kid?</i>

823
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,413
<i>We get all dizzy with risky romances</i>

824
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:19,150
<i>Only drink alcohol after you hit 20</i>

825
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,085
<i>If not in this life</i>

826
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,953
<i>In the next life, I</i>

827
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,526
<i>Will give you a hug from behind</i>

828
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,460
So lame!

829
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,597
<i>If they're slight differences</i>

830
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:37,601
<i>Let's put up with them</i>

831
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:41,439
<i>Diverse perspectives</i>

832
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,474
<i>Embrace them</i>

833
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,744
<i>With an open heart</i>

834
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,113
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

835
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,314
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

836
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,983
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

837
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,352
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

838
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,388
<i>More than winning</i>

839
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,356
<i>Tolerance is important</i>

840
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,258
<i>Love still wins</i>

841
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,260
<i>But tolerance is also important</i>

842
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:07,131
<i>It won't fill your stomach</i>

843
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:12,503
<i>But tolerance is important</i>

844
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,171
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

845
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,973
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

846
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,741
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

847
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,543
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

848
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:26,851
<i>Let's be forbearing</i>

849
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,378
Hey.

850
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,382
Your company's matching app…

851
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,583
You mean Un-MAY?

852
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,186
It's useless.

853
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,087
Huh?

854
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,722
Why?

855
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,858
It keeps suggesting you.

856
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,261
COMPATIBILITY 99.9%

857
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,398
And it's really annoying
how you're backlit.

858
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,633
Sorry about that.

859
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,801
Try turning off location services.

860
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,336
Huh?

861
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,806
Are you saying
it's suggesting the closest guy?

862
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,709
I mean, my app keeps suggesting you too.

863
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,978
What? No way.

864
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,881
COMPATIBILITY 99.9%

865
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,384
This photo is way too edited.

866
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,319
Shut up.

867
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,156
I mean, how come
our compatibility is showing as 99.9%?

868
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,162
Huh?

869
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,631
My preferences have been changed.

870
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,767
"Works at a TV station."

871
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,801
"Divorced."

872
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,102
"Single mom."

873
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,571
"Loves comedy."

874
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,039
"In her early thirties."

875
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,440
"Within a kilometer radius."

876
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,176
"An app development salesperson."

877
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,145
"Recently heartbroken."

878
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,446
"Has an overweight father."

879
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,048
"Enjoys cooking."

880
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,784
"In his late twenties to early thirties."

881
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,152
"Within a kilometer radius."

882
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,020
You did this.

883
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,455
No, it must have been you.

884
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,890
How could I have done this?

885
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,326
I didn't know your father was overweight.

886
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,331
Can it be?

887
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,138
Sorry, I dozed off.

888
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,974
It was Mr. Ogawa.

889
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,208
It's got to be.

890
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,477
He's the only one
who'd pull something like this.

891
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,948
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

892
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,589
So,

893
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,791
what do you think?

894
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,561
What do you think?

895
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,631
Should we try dating?

896
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,300
Are you sure?

897
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,267
Yeah.

898
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,737
If Mr. Ogawa's behind this,

899
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,738
it's worth a shot.

900
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,610
I guess Mr. Ogawa is
more trustworthy than an app.

901
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,679
Well,

902
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,682
I just feel like
having someone close to me right now.

903
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:12,950
Still…

904
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,885
If you say no, I'll sing "Dried Flower."

905
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:15,986
Please don't.

906
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,789
You sing "Dried Flower"
when you get dumped. It's how it is.

907
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:19,823
But…

908
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:23,827
think about it.

909
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,531
Didn't your dad and my mom…

910
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,801
have a thing going on at one point?

911
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:43,947
And here we are, their children.

912
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,751
Our compatibility…

913
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,320
can't be that bad, right?

914
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,226
Just in case,

915
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:57,995
scan this QR code.

916
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,496
It's for a sexual consent app.

917
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,867
I guess you never know…

918
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,370
what might happen.

919
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,673
ASK YOUR PARTNER
TO SCAN THIS QR CODE

920
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,446
Do you want to come over?

921
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,055
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

922
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,123
Happy New Year.

923
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,492
-Happy New Year.
-Good luck.

924
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,793
Happy New Year.

925
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,362
-Good morning.
-Happy New Year.

926
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,764
-Good morning.
-Hey, Yasumori.

927
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,499
Let's have a good year.

928
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,367
Congrats on becoming vice-principal.

929
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,002
It's nothing to celebrate.

930
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,371
I only got the position
because he became the principal.

931
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,574
Hey, your skirt is so short!

932
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,609
You can't complain if someone gropes you.

933
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,511
Hey!

934
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,113
-Uh…
-Huh?

935
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,015
PRIVATE TUTORING

936
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,025
RESULT: C

937
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,661
Kiyoshi!

938
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,630
Kiyoshi!

939
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,703
You're Kiyoshi Sakisaka!

940
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,973
Student number 19.
The Mysterious Transfer Student.

941
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,010
No way.

942
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,478
Are you Sako?

943
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,847
Yeah, I'm number 20.
Tsuyoshi Sako.

944
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,150
I've been wanting to see you!

945
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,453
Me too.

946
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,588
You haven't changed one bit, Kiyoshi.

947
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,491
It's crazy how much you haven't changed.

948
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,728
But Sako…

949
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,297
you've changed.

950
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,167
I've been searching for you for so long.

951
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,102
I wanted to thank you.

952
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,014
You should go to school.

953
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,450
School…

954
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,287
is where you learn

955
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:07,958
there are people in this world
you just can't get along with.

956
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,228
You spend three years there

957
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:16,266
confirming that everyone
except you are crazy.

958
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,604
But if you manage to find

959
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,840
one or two friends there,

960
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,177
then you'll never have to see the others
for the rest of your life.

961
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,050
I'm glad I met you, Sako.

962
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,786
And it's all because I went to school.

963
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,957
You get to connect
with people you click with,

964
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,392
and avoid the ones you don't.

965
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,664
Lots of convenient things
like that will pop up

966
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,499
if you hang in there a little longer.

967
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,506
Sako showed up.

968
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:57,741
-It's Sako!
-No way.

969
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,742
-Shh!
-Where?

970
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,347
Act normal.

971
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,514
-Act normal.
-I know.

972
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,451
Happy New Year.

973
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,620
Happy New Year.

974
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,388
<i>You were right, Kiyoshi.</i>

975
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,423
After failing once, I entered high school.

976
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,461
And I started an online gaming company
with a friend I made there.

977
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,397
I connected with programmers
from all over the world.

978
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,398
And now I'm a CEO.

979
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,534
My!

980
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,370
What can I say?

981
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,039
I'm so impressed.

982
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,309
That's why I've been wanting
to repay the favor.

983
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,978
I'll do anything to help you out.

984
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,651
Can you do something
for Inoue instead of me?

985
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,986
-Inoue?
-Masakazu Inoue.

986
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,888
The one with a buzz cut and glasses.

987
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,690
He studies time machines.

988
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,458
He's looking for a sponsor.

989
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,328
That's funny.

990
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,564
Listen.

991
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,767
You're the only one I can turn to, Inoue.

992
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,968
Entering Sophia

993
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,836
and hanging out at AGU clubs.

994
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,073
Or entering AGU
and hanging out at Sophia clubs.

995
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,741
Which would be more fun?

996
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,312
Let's get accepted first.

997
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,080
At this rate, she will get accepted.

998
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:10,981
And…

999
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,951
she'll get married in college,
have a daughter,

1000
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,085
and move to Kobe.

1001
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,788
Junko and I will become estranged.

1002
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,523
That's why I need you

1003
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,859
to travel back to 1995 from the future.

1004
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,695
As someone from the future,

1005
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,831
you must warn everyone in Japan
that a major earthquake is imminent.

1006
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,533
Hey, are you listening?

1007
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,769
I'll give up on the time machine.

1008
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,238
"Give up"?

1009
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,673
I want to become a big leaguer.

1010
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,607
Hold on, Inoue.

1011
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,176
You don't have a talent for--

1012
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,344
They're popular, right?

1013
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,281
To marry a female announcer,
that would be the easiest way.

1014
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,182
Hang on a second.

1015
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,384
You saw a bus disappear
the other day, didn't you?

1016
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,220
<i>What did you make of that?</i>

1017
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,825
-It made me realize that…
-Uh-huh.

1018
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:58,028
the time machine already exists.

1019
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:58,996
No, you're wrong!

1020
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,497
You're the inventor!

1021
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,398
You invented it!

1022
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,666
You're being noisy!

1023
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,369
Fine.

1024
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:06,803
I'll do it.

1025
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,105
Are you sure?

1026
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,674
I'll become a big leaguer
and invent the time machine.

1027
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,610
Forget baseball!

1028
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,946
SCHOOL 6 GRADUATION CEREMONY

1029
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,515
TO THE FUTURE

1030
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,983
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1031
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,352
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1032
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,554
Quiet, please!

1033
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,525
The vice-principal has something to say.

1034
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,426
Come in.

1035
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,228
Hey!

1036
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,998
Congratulations on your graduation.

1037
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,537
I feel sorry for you,

1038
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,773
being born in this age.

1039
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,609
The smell of cigarettes is everywhere.

1040
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,778
You get spanked for things
someone else did.

1041
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,513
And finally, you're graduating.

1042
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,715
But don't worry.

1043
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,651
Your future is going to be interesting!

1044
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,289
Inappropriate and violent teachers like me
will be a thing of the past.

1045
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,559
If you use a sleek gadget
to order an Uber,

1046
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,461
you can enjoy a Big Mac right at home.

1047
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,966
But even in that future age,
adults will tell kids,

1048
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,470
"I feel sorry for you
for being born in this age."

1049
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,975
You don't have to listen
to adults like that!

1050
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,814
Instead, today,
I have a special surprise for you.

1051
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,617
I'll let you listen to music
from the far, far future.

1052
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:29,786
Go ahead!

1053
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,024
Who are they?

1054
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,865
-What's that?
-What's going on?

1055
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,438
"NIDONE"

1056
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,669
You're trending again.

1057
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,939
"Seeing Mr. Yashima naked is
perfect for a Saturday afternoon."

1058
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,141
Really?

1059
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,510
Maybe you can book
a Green Car seat for my next--

1060
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,478
Hey, Hamura! What's up?

1061
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,180
Nagisa, listen.

1062
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,381
The drama starting tomorrow,

1063
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,751
the actor playing
the protagonist's father got COVID…

1064
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,819
I can fill in for him.

1065
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,781
Excuse me.

1066
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,562
It's been a while.

1067
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,964
Yeah.

1068
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,666
You seem well.

1069
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,601
You too.

1070
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,069
Yeah.

1071
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,472
I got a boyfriend.

1072
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,075
I got a boyfriend too.

1073
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:33,877
I see.

1074
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,047
Are you trying for a baby?

1075
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,649
I stopped.

1076
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,119
He wants it to be just us for now.
He said kids can wait.

1077
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,189
I see.

1078
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,695
I'm happy for you.

1079
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,932
You too.

1080
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,878
<i>Let's be tolerant</i>

1081
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,880
You're late!

1082
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,983
Couldn't you have texted at least?

1083
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,451
Yeah, my bad.

1084
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:16,419
Okay!

1085
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,054
It's Daddy!

1086
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,522
Here we go!

1087
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,058
Let's go to Daddy, Machato.

1088
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,394
Sorry, he's pooping.

1089
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,263
Change his diapers later.

1090
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:30,267
Seriously, you really don't have
a knack for parenting.

1091
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,102
It's me, Matchy!

1092
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,940
Excuse me. I'm Masahiko Akitsu.

1093
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,676
Listen.

1094
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,245
You're free to date
whomever you like, but…

1095
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,781
Well then, be a good daddy.

1096
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,682
Bye!

1097
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,550
Shouldn't you hear him out?

1098
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,152
It's fine.

1099
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,394
-What do you feel like eating?
-Um?

1100
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,095
Let me think.

1101
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:04,834
Hey!

1102
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,037
Wake up, ugly!
It's the entrance ceremony today!

1103
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,139
I know that! Shut up!

1104
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,421
Geezer.

1105
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,457
Cash, please.

1106
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,562
For crying out loud.

1107
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,931
She was only good until her entrance exam.

1108
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,468
And university sure isn't cheap.

1109
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,338
Even if I work hard to cover her tuition,

1110
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,707
she's just going to have
hanky-panky with some guy.

1111
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,608
Are you listening, Barkeep?

1112
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,810
A rat?

1113
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,814
KYOKO KOIZUMI
"KOGARASHI NI DAKARETE"

1114
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,521
Mr. Ogawa!

1115
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,056
Sorry?

1116
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,058
It's me, Inoue.

1117
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,694
Your student, Masakazu Inoue.

1118
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,163
I finally made it!

1119
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,464
I finally got to see you!

1120
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,100
You're Inoue?

1121
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,603
You're old, though.

1122
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,204
You're the same Inoue?

1123
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,172
Yes.

1124
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,342
I've come from 2054.

1125
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,311
I discovered the time tunnel.

1126
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,581
Thanks to Sako sponsoring me,

1127
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,917
I was able to do lots of research.

1128
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,788
Unlike the bus,
you can go to any era you like.

1129
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,490
I don't get it.

1130
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,427
Huh?

1131
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,472
That hole…

1132
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,773
did you dig it?

1133
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,811
Come, let's go to any era you want!

1134
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,796
No way.

1135
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,676
This production features
inappropriate dialogue.

1136
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,145
But in keeping
with the nature of this drama,

1137
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,981
we purposefully presented
the expressions of 2024 as they are.

1138
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,182
