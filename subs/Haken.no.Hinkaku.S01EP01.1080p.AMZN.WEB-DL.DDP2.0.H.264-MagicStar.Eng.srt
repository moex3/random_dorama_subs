After a long recession,
in an attempt to scale down,

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,233
it became common for companies
to seek to outsource.

8
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,066
As a result, the number
of non-regular employees,

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:30,100
particularly of temp workers,
saw explosive growth.

Temp workers are paid hourly

and with no transportation
expenses included.

every three months.

Yes, very possible.

172
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,700
It's basically the same thing.

173
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,400
We just cannot call it
a job interview.

174
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,000
I previously worked in HR.

175
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,100
Ask me anything
about outsourcing.

176
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,867
Enough with bragging.

177
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,333
Come with me.

178
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,033
Yes, I'll follow you until the end.

179
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,100
Satonaka.

180
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,433
You come, too.

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,433
She's just finished university,

182
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,834
so she doesn't have many skills.

183
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,233
But she's a hard worker.

184
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,500
Right?

185
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:08,767
Yes.

186
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,233
Can you use Word?

187
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,000
What? Sure.

188
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,467
Excel?

189
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,734
Yes.

190
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,066
Power Point?

191
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,400
Yes, I can.

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,467
She can work right away, then.

193
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,233
Yes, you can count on me.

194
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,433
By the way, you got
Haruko Omae, right?

195
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,600
Yes, we've got her.
Consultation is with her tomorrow.

196
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,734
Okay.

197
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,333
Since Ms Omae will be back,...

198
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,066
this lady can join us.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,700
We have a new section.

200
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,867
You'll join our Marketing Section.

201
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,700
Great, I'll do my best.

202
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm Chief Satonaka.

203
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,934
Great to have you.

204
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,300
Thank you very much.

205
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,266
Sir.

206
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,233
Who's Haruko Omae?

207
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,100
"Marunouchi"

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,266
Sometimes you meet someone,...

209
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,266
and you become
a completely different person.

210
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,100
Who is that person for me?

211
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,333
Haruko Omae gave a great impact...

212
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
on my life.

213
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,600
And...

214
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,266
she taught me something
very important.

215
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:08,266
She taught me that
working is living.

216
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:19,367
"The Pride of The Temp"

217
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:23,734
"A super temp worker makes
an appearance"

218
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,233
Really?

219
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,100
Sorry for the wait.

220
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,467
Some tea?

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,100
Great to see you.

222
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,066
Hi there.

223
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
We proudly present Haruko Omae,
a Special A Rank temp worker.

224
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,066
So this is her.

225
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,900
Nice to meet you.

226
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,867
I'm Satonaka from Marketing.

227
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,166
What's wrong?

228
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,533
Sit down.

229
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,667
I'm the Chief of Sales.

230
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,734
But I'm here on behalf
of our director.

231
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,900
Since you're a temp,
your job is assisting the chief...

232
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,467
and running errands.

233
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,867
Where did you work before?

234
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,033
Was my voice too soft?

235
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,433
You heard it, right?

236
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,266
Where were you before?

237
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,166
Hello?

238
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,834
I'm not sure who's the one
doing consultation now.

239
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,033
I'll answer for her.

240
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,367
I'll explain the conditions.

241
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:32,734
Conditions?

242
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,266
The contract is for three months.

243
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,433
Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00
p.m. with one-hour lunch break.

244
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,967
Extension of contract
is not allowed.

245
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,066
No work outside
of the assigned section.

246
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,100
No work on weekends
or overtime.

247
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:52,900
That's all.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,066
Wait a minute.

249
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,900
So many "Nos".

250
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,433
Why don't you say anything?

251
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:09,467
Even if you're a temp, we expect you
to do overtime if we're busy. Right?

252
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,834
Sure.

253
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,567
It depends on the situation.

254
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,400
But basically this is how she works.

255
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:18,900
That's it.

256
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,467
Director Kirishima has requested
her to start working today.

257
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,900
Is Kirishima serious
about hiring her?

258
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,533
That's crazy.

259
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,033
She doesn't even blink.
Is she alive?

260
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:35,867
She moved.

261
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,333
Is this some kind of a joke?

262
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,767
What's with the attitude?
Say something.

263
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,200
This is terrible.

264
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,867
You will not regret hiring me.

265
00:13:56,533 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll work hard for the three months
I'm being paid.

266
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,700
Hourly wage?

267
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,767
- Here she comes.
- She's the one?

268
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,233
The Special A Rank temp worker.

269
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,200
Hey.

270
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,700
Well...

271
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,333
Marketing Section's here.

272
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,934
Good morning, everyone.

273
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,166
Good morning.

274
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,467
I'm Miyuki Mori with Haken Life.

275
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,433
Nice to meet you.

276
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,967
I'm also new to this section.

277
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,400
Let's do our best.

278
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,400
Please use this desk.

279
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,467
- Okay.
- Chief.

280
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,900
Is this everyone?

281
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,066
Yes. Thank you, Asano.

282
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,800
Just me, with one year's experience
and the temp workers.

283
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,600
What a scratch team.

284
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,900
That's not true.

285
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,800
We have an experienced member,
Ogasawara.

286
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,233
Ogasawara.

287
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,567
Glad to have you.

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,633
Thanks.

289
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,333
Nice to meet you.

290
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,700
Marketing Section
was recently created.

291
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,900
I'm not sure
where we should begin myself.

292
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,667
But let's work together
and build a good team.

293
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,667
Can you give a word, too, Omae?

294
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,533
I'll help you out.

295
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,333
You don't need to get
to work right away.

296
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,900
Get used to the office for today.

297
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
Omae, you don't
need to do anything yet.

298
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey.

299
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,133
Has she been like that?

300
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:48,900
Yes.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well...

302
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,867
Did I upset you?

303
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm just following the chief's order
to do nothing.

304
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,500
Problem?

305
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Oh, I see.

306
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,934
Here's your ID.

307
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,567
You seem to have a lot of free time.

308
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,767
Can you help me out with this, Temp?

309
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,600
What?

310
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,066
What's up with her?

311
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,400
It's her first day.

312
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,467
Hey.

313
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey.

314
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,633
We're paying you, so work.

315
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,000
Not like that, Shoji.

316
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,767
First impression is the key.

317
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
Or she'll underestimate us.

318
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,100
Chief, this crazy curly hair
is not my boss.

319
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,967
Crazy curly hair?

320
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,800
Nobody says that.

321
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,800
I see.

322
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,700
You ignore everyone else?

323
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,967
- Yes.
- Kidding me?

324
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,000
My name is Haruko Omae.

325
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,400
She's useless.

326
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,633
Never mind.

327
00:16:58,734 --> 00:16:59,667
Sorry.

328
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,734
It's not you.

329
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,000
- Yeah.
- Hey.

330
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,800
I'd be happy to do it.

331
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh yeah, we have her.

332
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,000
- You're Mori, right?
- Yes.

333
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,400
- Good with computers, right?
- What?

334
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,166
Yes, I am.

335
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,066
This is the revenue by region.

336
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,100
Compile them by product.

337
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,066
With sales offices and branches.

338
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,066
Sure.

339
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,200
Right away.

340
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,600
Take your time, do it roughly.

341
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,100
Okay.

342
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,100
Darn.

343
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,266
For you, Omae...

344
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
Can you make us some tea?

345
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,967
It's noon, so see you later.

346
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,600
Hey.

347
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,567
Again.

348
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,133
She looked at my hair.

349
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,367
Watch out for Chief Shoji.

350
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,734
He's good at his job, but
he doesn't like temp workers.

351
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,767
He doesn't hesitate to fire ones
he doesn't like.

352
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,967
Nice.

353
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,567
What are you looking at?

354
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,467
It appears that...

355
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,467
they're talking about us.

356
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,900
Enough.

357
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,066
Don't get attached to a temp.

358
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,233
This is a secret,

359
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,433
but our director's wife was a temp.

360
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,500
That's rough.

361
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,000
So was it not her?

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,934
Wait.

363
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,633
No, it has to be her.

364
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,300
Are you okay, Ken?

365
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,100
What should I do?

366
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,433
That temp.

367
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,567
She's the worst
of all the ones I've seen.

368
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,700
But Kirishima wanted her?

369
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,667
Yes.

370
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:59,467
Maybe she's blackmailing
the director.

371
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,667
- Oh.
- What do you mean?

372
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,467
You guys have a great imagination.

373
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,233
Sir...

374
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,533
Don't be stupid. No one can ever
blackmail our director.

375
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,967
Are you done eating?

376
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll clean it for you.

377
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,000
Sorry.

378
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,567
Satonaka?

379
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,567
Yes.

380
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,767
Do a market research on rice
before next Wednesday.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,900
Sure.

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,133
First task for
the Marketing Section.

383
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,900
You'll present it
at the product meeting.

384
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,500
Okay.

385
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,467
Work hard...

386
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,433
and get good results.

387
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Yes, I'll do my best.

388
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,467
Thank you.

389
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,266
Welcome.

390
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,767
Please share the table.

391
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Hi there.

392
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,500
That looks good.

393
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,633
Same thing for me, please.

394
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,266
Brown or white rice?

395
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,600
White rice.

396
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,233
Here you go.

397
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Excuse me.

398
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,066
Wait.

399
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,467
Yes?

400
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,567
- One person.
- I'll get this.

401
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,233
No thanks.

402
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,400
But...

403
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm retired and now I work
as a part-time worker...

404
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:25,333
but I still make enough to buy
a temp worker lunch.

405
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,500
No, thank you.

406
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,500
Accept other people's kindness.

407
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,667
- No, thank you.
- You're stubborn.

408
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,867
I don't want to sound patronising,

409
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,834
but I know that life isn't easy
with your low-paying job.

410
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,834
After lunch and transportation,
not much would be left.

411
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,633
Please don't worry about it.

412
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:56,066
What are you trying to prove,
you poor temp worker?

413
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,800
We'll present this next Wednesday.

414
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,934
We need to research first.

415
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,967
Where's Omae?

416
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,433
That's thoughtful.

417
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:21,734
Thanks.

418
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,233
You asked me to make tea
before lunch.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,567
Oh yeah, that's right.

420
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,433
For me, too? Thank you.

421
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,600
Is this new tea?

422
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:39,300
No, it's the same tea I found
in the kitchen.

423
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
It's very good.

424
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,166
Worth paying 3,000 yen per hour.

425
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,400
What?

426
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Someone from General Affairs told me
that she worked for them before.

427
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,266
Her rate is 3,000 yen per hour.

428
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,433
Three thousand yen?

429
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,400
Are you okay?

430
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,700
Get a cloth.

431
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,433
It's so hot.

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,433
- Hot.
- Hold on.

433
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,467
Hot.

434
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,300
"To understand what kind of
rice dishes are eaten..."

435
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,867
"New products"

436
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:13,967
Omae?

437
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,233
Well...

438
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,533
It's done.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,633
What?

440
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:23,567
What?

441
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,567
What's this?

442
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,000
Look at that.

443
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,333
"Presentation strategy"

444
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,567
I see my name in it.

445
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,266
What should I do?

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,367
You'll sort internal references.

447
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:39,867
Okay.

448
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,000
Ms. Temp?

449
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,000
Are you finished?

450
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,033
Sorry, I'm not done yet.

451
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,500
But it's been hours.

452
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,133
What? It's so sloppy.

453
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,066
I can't use this.

454
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,000
You mentioned that you can use
Excel and Power Point.

455
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,033
Sorry.

456
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,700
Sorry? Is that all you can say?

457
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,700
Did you lie?

458
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,200
No, right?

459
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,800
You didn't, did you?

460
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,066
This is unacceptable.

461
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,900
That's not a proper way
of communicating.

462
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,000
What?

463
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,467
Who are you talking to?

464
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,734
Earlier, you told her not to rush
and do it roughly.

465
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,300
So what?

466
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,500
You told her it's okay to take hours
and make it sloppy.

467
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,834
No, I would never be okay
with that.

468
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,333
What's with you?

469
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,567
That's all.

470
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,233
Do it all over again.

471
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:42,667
Okay.

472
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:45,834
Prove that you weren't lying
or you'll be in trouble.

473
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,066
Can you help me out, Asano?

474
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,900
Let's take the trash out.

475
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:55,834
Oh yeah!

476
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,767
We should do a welcome dinner.

477
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,567
All of us.

478
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,633
That sounds good.

479
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,967
You should come too, Omae.

480
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll leave office on time.

481
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,233
Please sign this for approval.

482
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,700
What do you think of your team?

483
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,000
You might find the members
not very capable.

484
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,000
You're right.

485
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,500
What?

486
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,834
If you need help, I can
possibly add more employees.

487
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:39,333
No, thank you. They're useless.

488
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,834
What?

489
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,333
If you're hiring,

490
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,300
please add temp workers
with high computer skills.

491
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,567
You don't have rights to decide.

492
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:52,000
All right, I'll consider it.

493
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,266
- Thank you.
- What?

494
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,166
Sir...

495
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,600
That's unacceptable.

496
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
We use temp workers in order
to reduce labour costs.

497
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,233
That's common sense.

498
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:10,567
Just for three months.

499
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,400
You should get rid of her.

500
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,433
She's just not used to the job.
It's fine.

501
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,633
Maybe Omae can help her out.

502
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,834
No way.

503
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,600
She'll never help her out.

504
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,567
Why?

505
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:42,033
She complained and asked
to hire someone who's more skilled.

506
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,567
She did?

507
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,900
So the new temp girl
can be replaced.

508
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,667
Manager.

509
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
The division policy.

510
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Azukama, Sekiguchi,

511
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,166
- get quality evaluation done.
- Sure.

512
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:59,133
Takahashi, let's have a meeting
when I get back.

513
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:00,600
Check this.

514
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Shoji.

515
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,400
You're busy now, right?

516
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,967
It's okay.

517
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,000
You're in my way.

518
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,967
Hey, you temp!

519
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,166
Pick these up.

520
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:20,000
I can't stand that woman!

521
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,433
Look at this.

522
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,667
My hair is getting all curly!

523
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,633
You look fine.

524
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,233
You think so?

525
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,233
You shouldn't be the one
picking them up.

526
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
But thanks.

527
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:37,000
Sorry that I got upset.

528
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,867
What's going on, Ken?

529
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:41,900
Well...

530
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,433
My team doesn't seem to be together,
so I was thinking of having...

531
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,400
a welcome dinner.

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,266
That sounds good.

533
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,000
That's important.

534
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,600
Everyone has to be there.

535
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:58,033
But Omae said she'll leave on time.

536
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,500
That's the biggest problem
that you have now?

537
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,667
Pull yourself together or
she will have everything her way.

538
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,333
But she is very competent.

539
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,500
Still, she needs
to listen to her boss.

540
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,433
All right.

541
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,600
I'll make it work.

542
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:27,133
Hi. Thank you for
your continuous support.

543
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,967
Haruko Omae?

544
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,834
Satonaka, her boss,

545
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,100
is at a loss
with how to handle her.

546
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,867
Hitotsugi,...

547
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,800
we may stop taking
temp workers from your agency.

548
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,934
Wait.

549
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,500
What do you mean?

550
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,333
"Questionnaire on rice"

551
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,800
"Please see the attached
questionnaire and..."

552
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,500
The welcome dinner is tonight.

553
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,166
I've been looking forward to this.

554
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,367
Where will we go?

555
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:18,800
About that...

556
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,734
- Omae...
- It's fine.

557
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,600
I spoke with Hitotsugi.

558
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,433
You love work dinners, don't you?

559
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,066
Don't drink too much.

560
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,266
Got it.

561
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:30,967
Leave it to me.

562
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,266
I'll leaving now.

563
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,100
See you tomorrow.

564
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,066
Marketing Section.

565
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,133
Omae?

566
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,934
It's Hitotsugi.

567
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:45,633
What did you mean?

568
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:47,133
- Just wait and see.
- What is it?

569
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,133
You guys will have fun tonight.

570
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,967
I understand, Hitotsugi.

571
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,333
If I have to go to this dinner
and pour drinks for people,...

572
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,433
I'd rather be fired.

573
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,133
Please end my contract right now.

574
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,867
Please tell that to
Director Kirishima. Bye.

575
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,500
No way.

576
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,200
Omae.

577
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,567
I'm so sorry...

578
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,333
for my stupid employees.

579
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,600
Those idiots...

580
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:18,200
need to party
to get energy for working.

581
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:22,767
I'll make an exception and pay
extra three hours for overtime.

582
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:24,533
So please join them.

583
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,100
Overtime?

584
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,834
Why, for a temp?

585
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:28,800
Shut up!

586
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,934
Okay.

587
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,333
As I mentioned first,
I don't do overtime.

588
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,266
"Tokyo STB Trust Bank"

589
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,633
"Tokyo Central Trust Bank"

590
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:01,166
"Tokyo Central Trust Bunk
Declares Bankruptcy"

591
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,900
I don't know too much
about Haruko Omae.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,667
She has many
high-level certifications.

593
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:22,533
She works for three months
and disappears for three months.

594
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,867
She's exceptionally competent.

595
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,266
Don't feel bad.

596
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,533
Please don't quit. Okay?

597
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,266
Not before the contract ends.

598
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,066
What if they fire me?

599
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,333
That's even worse.

600
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,600
"Cafe Cantante"

601
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,734
I'm back.

602
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:53,800
Welcome back.

603
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,300
Welcome back, Haru.

604
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,867
I'll be here again for three months.

605
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,533
Only three months again?

606
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,667
Yes, I'll leave once
my contract ends.

607
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,100
Help yourself to this.

608
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:15,600
Haruko.

609
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,500
A song?

610
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:20,333
Okay.

611
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,400
"Bushido"

612
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
"Dangerous substance exam"

"Pasco Flamenco"

614
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,367
Who's this?

615
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:46,700
Hello?

616
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,533
This is Miyuki Mori.

617
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,133
Sorry to bother you on your day off.

618
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,800
Hitotsugi gave me your number.

619
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,467
Omae?

620
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,300
I'm sorry.

621
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:03,000
I...

622
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,900
At the consultation,...

623
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,467
I told them a lie.

624
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm sure everyone is aware
of that by now.

625
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,166
So what?

626
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,367
I'm truly sorry.

627
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
I'll try my best in the future,

628
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,400
so please don't get me fired.

629
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,567
That's up to them to decide.

630
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,567
I have nothing to do with that.

631
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,300
I...

632
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,367
You're the only one I have.

633
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,233
Please delete my number right away
and never call me again.

634
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,166
You wanted to see me?

635
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,633
This.

636
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,200
So many mistakes.

637
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,166
I've had our temp worker
redo everything.

638
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,667
Here.

639
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm sorry.

640
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,433
I mentioned this
to Director Kirishima.

641
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,967
Here you go.

642
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,333
Omae?

643
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,567
Can you help Mori?

644
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,133
We only have two days till
our presentation.

645
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,734
We still have two days.

646
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,200
You don't want to help her?

647
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,100
It's fine, I'll work faster.

648
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,533
She says it's fine.

649
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,934
Never mind.

650
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,967
She makes
all the temp workers look bad.

651
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,367
That's right.

652
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,100
Sorry.

653
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,500
It's not about you.

654
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,667
I'm really fine. I'll do my best.

655
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,900
See you later.

656
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,467
See you later.

657
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,367
Mori, right?

658
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,834
I was in the consultation with her.

659
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,900
She's got a lot of problems.

660
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,200
If you don't think
you can help her out,

661
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,333
it might be better to let her go.

662
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:34,033
You're asking a temp worker
to help out another temp.

663
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,133
Don't you find that a problem?

664
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:41,500
You and your opinions.

665
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:48,834
Bye.

666
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,066
See you later.

667
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:53,834
This isn't good.

668
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,500
There's no way I'll finish in time.

669
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,300
Oh yeah.

670
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,200
- He looks exactly like Shoji.
- Really?

671
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,700
- Mori?
- Yes?

672
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,867
You're still here.

673
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,233
I just finished.

674
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,233
Okay.

675
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,100
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

676
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,066
See you later.

677
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,667
See you tomorrow.

678
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,166
Wait.

679
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,166
"User error"

680
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:45,667
What?

681
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:48,767
This doesn't make any sense.

682
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,066
"User error"

683
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,133
What should I do?

684
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,300
Seventy-five days left.

685
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:31,033
Can someone please help me?

686
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,900
Wow, it's so late.

687
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,066
What should I do?

688
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,133
To S and F in Marunouchi.
Please hurry.

689
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,066
Here is fine.

690
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,367
I made it. I'm so relieved.

691
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:56,467
Here you go.

692
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,000
Hi there, Ms. Temp.

693
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:00,800
You took a taxi?

694
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,867
Kuroiwa.

695
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,433
Thank you.

696
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,934
Good morning.

697
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,567
Your hair is all messy.

698
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,433
Where did you come from?

699
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,033
I overslept.

700
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,266
I was running late.

701
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:15,800
You've got bed head.

702
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:29,166
Omae...

703
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,200
Do you by any chance have
a hair product?

704
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,133
No, I don't.

705
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:35,700
How much can you do before tomorrow?

706
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,033
Oh no.

707
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,467
What is it?

708
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:45,300
The reference material I input
for the presentation...

709
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,900
I left it in a taxi.

710
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,934
You left it?

711
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,800
I often do that, too.

712
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,700
Did you get a receipt?

713
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,333
Which company?

714
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,667
Which taxi company?

715
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,567
I'm not sure.

716
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,066
Calm down, Mori.

717
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,100
It's for tomorrow morning.

718
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,166
You can re-enter everything.

719
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:07,867
Where's the disk?

720
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:10,700
Well...

721
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:11,900
That, too.

722
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,734
It was in the paper bag
that I left in the taxi.

723
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:16,934
What?

724
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:18,433
I...

725
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,734
I'm truly sorry.

726
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,633
I'll go look for it now.

727
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:23,767
Hey, wait.

728
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,166
I'll check taxi companies.

729
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,100
Yes, do that.

730
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,266
Sorry.

731
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:41,033
Has anybody turned in
a red paper bag?

732
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,100
She took it to Marunouchi.

733
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,533
I don't remember.

734
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:48,033
Next one.

735
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,633
Why did you let a temp worker
take home

736
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:57,066
such important data?

737
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:58,867
I didn't know about it.

738
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,333
But it's my fault.

739
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,500
This is a huge deal.

740
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:05,734
It's something a temp did.

741
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,767
It's the agency's responsibility.

742
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,834
I'll deal with the damage claim.

743
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:10,900
That's right.

744
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,433
We'll for sure fire her.

745
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,567
But it's more serious than that.

746
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,867
It was my lack of supervision.

747
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,667
What are you still doing?

748
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm working. Problem?

749
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:30,367
Remember?

750
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,567
She has to leave office on time
today as always.

751
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,033
What's up with you?

752
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,166
Omae.

753
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,767
What should we do?

754
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,767
I have nothing to do with this.

755
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,700
- What?
- Hey.

756
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:48,166
What makes you a Special A Rank?

757
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,834
You're not good at all.

758
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:54,600
You might be good with computers
but you have no social skills.

759
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,400
Bad attitude, no manners,

760
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,633
no team work, not adapting.

761
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,967
When there's someone like you,
it lowers everyone's motivation.

762
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,433
If you're not happy
with my attitude,

763
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,600
tell that to my manager Hitotsugi.

764
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,900
Saying stuff like that
is not acting properly!

765
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,066
Do you even...

766
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,266
consider a temp a person?

767
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't answer with questions.

768
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:23,967
As a temp worker, you just do
whatever an employee tells you.

769
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,967
That's not right.

770
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,066
I'm panicking.

771
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,867
I don't know what to do.

772
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,700
Omae.

773
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,900
Please.

774
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,100
Please help us.

775
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,266
What?

776
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,600
Where are you going?

777
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,767
She went for lunch
because it's noon.

778
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,100
See, Ken,...

779
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:10,800
she only thinks about lunch
even in a time like this.

780
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:13,066
She's no good.

781
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,166
Hello?

782
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:40,667
Did you find it?

783
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,367
Well...

784
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,300
we managed to find the taxi company,

785
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,133
but the taxi was scrapped.

786
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:49,734
Scrapped?

787
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,600
A truck hit the car right after
Mori rode in it.

788
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,233
The driver is in the hospital.

789
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:55,967
And the disk?

790
00:42:56,667 --> 00:43:00,100
It was sent to the scrapyard
with the car.

791
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:08,567
Excuse me. Is anybody here?

792
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,100
Anybody here?

793
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,367
Satonaka.

794
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,467
I'm truly sorry.

795
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,533
There's still hope
if it's not scrapped yet.

796
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,300
Silver car.

797
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,033
Silver car.

798
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,200
I found it.

799
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,533
I found it. It's that one.

800
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,200
The presentation...

801
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
is first thing
tomorrow morning, right?

802
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:18,900
Hey!

803
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,867
Mori.

804
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,300
Are you okay?

805
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,667
- You want to die?
- Are you all right?

806
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,700
Look at you.

807
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:42,300
Here.

808
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,233
Omae?

809
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:36,200
Get out of my way.

810
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:37,900
Omae.

811
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,700
Let's go.

812
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,200
Here it is.

813
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,367
I found it.

814
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,533
It's here, Omae.

815
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,567
Where are you going, Omae?

816
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,100
I'm going for lunch.

817
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:45,400
Welcome.

818
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,100
Hi.

819
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm very sorry...

820
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,233
for all the trouble I caused.

821
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:04,900
I'm just dragging everyone down,...

822
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,266
so I'll quit.

823
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:11,333
Thank you for all you did for me
while I was there.

824
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,333
What can I get you?

825
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,867
Since it's my last day,
can I join you?

826
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:29,233
I got rejected by 23 companies.

827
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,433
So for eight months
after I graduated from college,...

828
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:37,533
I had several part-time jobs.

829
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,567
My parents in Gunma
told me to come home,...

830
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:46,467
but I thought there would still be
a chance for me in Tokyo.

831
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,367
When I visited this company,

832
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,567
working in a nice company
like that seemed great.

833
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,266
I got a bit too excited.

834
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,834
That's why I told them a lie.

835
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:07,767
But some people are just no good
no matter what they do.

836
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,533
If I could work at
a company like that,...

837
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,166
my life would've been different.

838
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:24,033
That's a big mistake.

839
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:29,133
You could still get laid off...

840
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,867
and they could go out of business.

841
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:34,700
Like the Titanic that sank.

842
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,800
Sorry?

843
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,066
Still, people give everything
they have to the company.

844
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:44,100
Is that...

845
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,100
Waste of time.

846
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,400
All of that.

847
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,934
Even with a 100-year recession

848
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,367
or an economic crisis,
I'll still survive.

849
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,867
A temp should trust...

850
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,100
only themselves and money.

851
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,333
With techniques
and skills to survive,...

852
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:09,834
you can live however you want.

853
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,867
Are you by any chance trying
to cheer me up?

854
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:17,166
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

855
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:18,166
Tea, please.

856
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:22,834
In any case,...

857
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,033
thank you for coming
to my rescue earlier.

858
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,834
I didn't come to your rescue.

859
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,934
It's part of my job.

860
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,033
Besides, you're not safe.

861
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,767
You'll be fired.

862
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,300
After today.

863
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:46,934
You should never take work home.

864
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:52,133
- Sorry.
- Apologising to me does nothing.

865
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:55,767
I'm sorry.

866
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:08,166
For the rest of the day,
work hard for your hourly wage.

867
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,900
That's what I'd do.

868
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:15,834
Thank you.

869
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,567
Chief.

870
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,600
Please give me another chance.

871
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:01,433
Since we have the disk back,
I'll not report this to my boss.

872
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:04,767
As a penalty,...

873
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:06,700
do some unpaid overtime.

874
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,400
Okay.

875
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:11,600
Good luck.

876
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:23,633
You looked quite impressive today.

877
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:26,266
I had no idea
you had a crane licence.

878
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:27,967
I didn't know, either.

879
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:29,100
So what?

880
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,000
So you'll keep the temp?

881
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:55,533
You're so easy on them.

882
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,667
You're right.

883
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,066
When we first joined the company,...

884
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:07,000
the older lady told us
how to answer phone calls...

885
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,100
and Chief Kawasaki often
treated us to dinner.

886
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,233
Remember that?

887
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,367
Yeah.

888
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:17,400
I wonder how they are now.

889
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,100
Everyone got laid off.

890
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,600
Now it's just temp workers
who are strangers to us.

891
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,667
Can you accept that?

892
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:37,567
For me,...

893
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:42,166
I wanted to keep working with them.

894
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,233
We shared meals together,...

895
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,166
we cried and laughed,...

896
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:50,767
like a family.

897
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,700
I thought we'd be together forever.

898
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:00,066
It doesn't make sense.

899
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:05,100
It's like the space invaders game.

900
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,233
Shoji.

901
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,834
That makes you sound old.

902
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,667
Don't get shot down, okay?

903
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,700
Omae.

904
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,533
- Good morning.
- Morning.

905
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,834
Morning.

906
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,266
- Good morning.
- Morning.

907
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,600
With Mori's help,
we managed to finish.

908
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:36,900
We stayed until 11:00 p.m.
last night.

909
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,467
How is it possible to spend
that many hours on that?

910
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,200
I'll follow you forever, Omae.

911
00:54:58,567 --> 00:54:59,567
Good tea.

912
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,200
We the Marketing Section...

913
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:10,867
did our own market research
on processed rice products.

914
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,133
We did a food service industry
research on restaurants...

915
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,266
Nice work.

916
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:29,567
I was so nervous.

917
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:30,834
You did a good job.

918
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,100
Satonaka.

919
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,266
Yes.

920
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:35,066
Good job for your first task.

921
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:36,200
Thank you.

922
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:41,233
I'll take you to
somewhere nice tonight.

923
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:44,300
Thank you.

924
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,066
This way.

925
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,767
Over here.

926
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,934
Welcome.

927
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,467
I thought we were going to a club.

928
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,300
But flamenco? Really?

929
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,300
Ever been to a place like this?

930
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,333
- No.
- Hey.

931
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:08,533
Come sit down.

932
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:15,934
I've always wanted to see flamenco.

933
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:16,867
Thank you.

934
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,533
Flamenco isn't for watching
but for listening.

935
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,500
You know a lot about it.

936
00:57:11,266 --> 00:57:14,867
She makes fun of us
instead of making us look good.

937
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,300
What's the pride of a temp?

938
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,967
That's a stupid question.

939
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,734
It's a stapler battle.

940
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:23,266
What's more important than pride?

941
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:28,367
