1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,133
"Marunouchi North"

2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:10,667
Hello, Omae!

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,233
Haruko.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,934
Good morning.

5
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:16,934
Good morning.

6
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,500
It's so cold today.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Spring is still far away.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,100
I'll tell you this.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,333
I'm sensitive to cold

10
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,700
so I have wool underwear on.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,266
Wait, you too?

12
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:38,900
I shouldn't have to talk
about wool underwear with you.

13
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,333
Oh, come on!

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That was quite surreal.

15
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,533
I'm sure it was Omae.

16
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,100
Sir...

17
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,500
Good morning.

18
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,166
You two look zoned out.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,033
Well...thank you for last night.

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,633
It was quite impressive.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,567
Is he in a bad mood?

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,967
Maybe he didn't notice?

23
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,500
I couldn't believe my eyes.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,066
She wore a revealing dress and
danced flamenco like this.

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,567
Out of my way.

26
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,600
Good morning, Omae.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,333
Good morning,

28
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,000
Chief Satonaka.

29
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,333
Seriously?

30
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,333
Good morning.

31
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,100
Good morning.

32
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,166
I hate her so much.

33
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,767
Go, Ken.

34
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,033
Sorry.

35
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,166
Hi.

36
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,066
About last night...

37
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,233
What about it?

38
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:04,734
Omae,

39
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,900
your flamenco was great.

40
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,500
Flamenco? You mean the dance?

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,066
Please stop telling me nonsense.

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,367
Sorry.

43
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,467
Shoji.

44
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,000
It wasn't what we thought it was.

45
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,834
Of course, it was.

46
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:30,266
So you act like you don't know?

47
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:35,333
Was it something
we weren't supposed to see?

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,734
It doesn't matter
since you're a temp.

49
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,600
You can have any night job.

50
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,834
You danced like this,
flipping your skirt up.

51
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:45,767
Olé!

52
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,000
Have fun.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,066
What's that cold reaction?

54
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,567
Don't ignore us.

55
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,000
You want my attention that bad?

56
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,800
I don't care, Temp.

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,567
My name is Haruko Omae.

58
00:02:58,367 --> 00:02:59,200
Shoji.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Better to get back.

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,300
Don't make her angry

61
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,367
or she'll hang you up
with a crane.

62
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,467
A crane?

63
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,934
Omae uses any means necessary
to get what she wants.

64
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,300
Are you trying to scare me?

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,233
Hey.

66
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,700
Hey you, you can't do that.

67
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,533
It's the opposite end.

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,600
What?

69
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:21,667
For documents with
horizontal writing,

70
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,200
get 1 cm from the top,
1.5 cm from the left edge.

71
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,100
Staple at a 45-degree angle.

72
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,700
Like this.

73
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,166
Great to know.

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,567
Shoji had a part-time job
where he stapled different things.

75
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh really?

76
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,934
It's supposed to be a temp who
teaches these things to a temp.

77
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,000
By the way, staplers

78
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,667
were invented by
Benjamin B. Hotchkiss.

79
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,500
Stapler is an English word.

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,066
Normally you staple diagonally

81
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,200
but some bosses might prefer
different ways, so just be aware.

82
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,834
This is horizontal stapling.

83
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,467
This is vertical stapling.

84
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,734
And this is wall stapling.

85
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:07,834
That's funny.

86
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:08,934
No, it's not.

87
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,633
What?

88
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,800
You're doing wall stapling wrong.

89
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:14,900
What?

90
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,400
Wall stapling is when you use
staplers like wall pins

91
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,934
and pin things on walls.

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
"Be quiet during working hours"

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,333
I'll go pass these out.

94
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,000
OK.

95
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,166
Hey, you.

96
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,700
My name is Haruko Omae.

97
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,100
Hey, wait!

98
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Shoji, calm down.

99
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,100
I'll staple you horizontally!

100
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
Proud employees will have a fall.

101
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:00,233
Companies won't survive without
temp workers now.

102
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,066
For example, Haruko Omae here.

103
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,400
"Impossible" and "overtime"
are not in her dictionary.

104
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,033
She shuts down
troublesome human relationships

105
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:15,066
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

106
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,433
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

107
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,433
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

108
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:23,934
That's not clear yet.

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,367
"The Pride Of The Temp"

110
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,266
"Pride and Staplers"

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,066
I'll be back.

112
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,467
Hey, you.

113
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,700
Turtleneck sweater.

114
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,600
I'll go see a client.
Come with me.

115
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,600
I don't take tasks
from your section.

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,934
Ken,

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,266
bringing an arrogant person like her

118
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,633
actually helps with
my business negotiations.

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,433
Omae,

120
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:13,500
we're not busy today here,
so please go help Chief Shoji.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,333
Understood, Chief Satonaka.

122
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,166
Thanks.

123
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:22,066
I'll show her
how good a salesman I am!

124
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,633
"Robinson's"

125
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
You don't know this,

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,400
but I've been negotiating to be
in this store for half a year now.

127
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,066
Don't do anything, just be friendly.

128
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,400
Smile like a salesperson.

129
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,133
Sales smile.

130
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,200
Be friendly.

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,166
Manager Midorikawa.

132
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,600
Hello there.

133
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,433
We're still in discussion
with the corporate, so please wait.

134
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,333
Ms Omae?

135
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,133
It's Omae, isn't it?

136
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,133
Finally, I can thank you.

137
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:03,667
Your ground-breaking idea increased
the revenue of our store by 30%!

138
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:07,300
I was a chief back then,
but now I'm a store manager!

139
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,500
Congratulations.

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,433
What?

141
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,333
What brought you here?

142
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:18,433
This employee here told me to
not say anything unnecessary.

143
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,066
She is...

144
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,066
Hey, Shoji.

145
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:25,100
She's like Jeanne d'Arc to us.
She brought a revolution.

146
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,633
Thanks for bringing her.

147
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:27,900
Come to my office.

148
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,300
Do you like Mont Blanc cake?

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I'll get you some.

150
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,734
All of us want to thank you.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,467
Welcome back.

152
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,467
Hey.

153
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:52,667
Hey.

154
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,467
You could ruin this deal
that took me forever to set up!

155
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,367
You're the one who
told me to come with you.

156
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,734
Enough with that.

157
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,000
And call me Chief.

158
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,767
Say that, Chief Shoji.

159
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,600
Thank you very much.

160
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,166
Shoji.

161
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:11,867
Great job.

162
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,934
Manager Midorikawa just called.

163
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,667
They'll increase our retail space
area by 10 times.

164
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:20,867
Seriously?

165
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,934
You can go back to
your office now, Ms. Temp.

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,834
I guess my last push did work.

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,867
Thank you.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,233
Omae.

169
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:38,166
Manager Midorikawa
gave you his regards.

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,467
I see.

171
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,500
Congrats.

172
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,467
Thanks.

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,033
Omae.

174
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,333
Nice work.

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,333
Thanks. I'm tired.

176
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,200
"Coffee"

177
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,767
That turtleneck sweater.

178
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll get her fired in no time.

179
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,800
You think you can?

180
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
She's 100 times
more competent than I am.

181
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,834
Be proud of yourself, Ogasawara.

182
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,767
We're permanent workers.

183
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,166
Even the coffee server
stopped working.

184
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,400
This is weird.

185
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,667
The chief wants to see you,
Ogasawara.

186
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,533
I'll be right there.

187
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,734
Thank you.

188
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,000
- Hey, you.
- Yes.

189
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,467
Bring me some coffee.

190
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,734
- Sure.
- For Ogasawara too, so two coffees.

191
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:30,867
Sure.

192
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,834
What?

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,233
Is something stuck?

194
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:57,300
What do you think you're doing?

195
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Well...

196
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,467
I think it broke.

197
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not that it broke on its own.

198
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,967
You broke it.

199
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,333
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:10,667
You, again?
After losing those important data?

201
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,867
Good grief.

202
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,934
You bring us bad luck.

203
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:14,934
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,834
This is useless now.

205
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:20,567
What will you do?

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,667
I'll pay for it.

207
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,567
This is not cheap.

208
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,567
150,000 yen, at least.

209
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,533
That much?

210
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:34,200
You said you're going to
pay for this, right?

211
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,333
Well...that is...

212
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,233
Can I pay in instalments?

213
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,600
How many instalments?

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,433
Fifteen.

215
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,600
You're dumb, aren't you?

216
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,500
You're only here for three months,
so three instalments.

217
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm going broke.

218
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,000
Mori?

219
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,934
What's wrong?

220
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,567
Mori's in trouble again.

221
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,200
Where's my coffee, Mori?

222
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,066
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:12,767
I...

224
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,600
I...

225
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,900
- Haruko...
- Don't talk to me for 30 seconds.

226
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,667
Ms Omae.

227
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,533
As I promised you,

228
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,633
I got a temp worker with
high computer skills.

229
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,233
From which agency?

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,633
Hi, my name is Kon.

231
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:29,734
Yes.

232
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,867
Despite his looks, he has
advanced computer skills.

233
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,600
I see.

234
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,066
I'm counting on you.

235
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,867
I'm done with this.

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,133
Nice work.

237
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,100
See you later.

238
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:45,500
Omae...

239
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,367
The restaurant will get crowded
so I'm leaving.

240
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,767
Ms Haruko...

241
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,166
You broke a 150,000-yen
coffee server?

242
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm very sorry.

243
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,734
I'll work hard
for three months and pay.

244
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,934
Will you last that long?

245
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,767
Hitotsugi.

246
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,000
I...

247
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,900
I wonder if they won't
need me anymore.

248
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,767
Will I be replaced by
the new temp worker?

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,467
No, we don't know that yet.

250
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:25,900
There's only one way for a temp
worker with no skills to survive.

251
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,166
There's only one way?

252
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,166
Yes.

253
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,066
What is it? Please tell me.

254
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,467
To have unique personality.

255
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,033
Personality?

256
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,734
Be someone that the talented Omae
and Kon are not.

257
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,934
For example, someone who's friendly
who is easy to ask for things.

258
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,467
Make that personality
your selling point.

259
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,934
Be friendly...

260
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,533
Hey! Get in line.

261
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,533
Welcome.

262
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,333
Hi there, Haruko.

263
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,300
Thank you for saving my seat.

264
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,233
Who are you?

265
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,100
You're funny, Haruko.

266
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,700
Same thing, please.

267
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,367
One mackerel set meal.

268
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,100
Brown or white rice?

269
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,867
White rice.

270
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:21,967
You're quite impressive.

271
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,333
You don't change your attitude
even in front of our director.

272
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,967
You know what?

273
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:29,500
He and I joined
the company the same year.

274
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,867
We used to call each other
Kiri and Shige.

275
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,333
My first name is Shigeru.

276
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,100
You don't care?

277
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,700
You know...

278
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,200
life can be quite cruel.

279
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,967
That poor temp worker Mori

280
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:55,600
broke a 150,000 yen coffee server.

281
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,767
You're paid 3,000 yen per hour,
if I remember correctly?

282
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:02,934
Yes. So?

283
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,934
Well...

284
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,200
I mean...

285
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:12,033
Maybe you can do something to
help Mori?

286
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,834
It's none of my business.

287
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,734
I know that.

288
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,567
Checkmate.

289
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,867
I'm defeated.

290
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,233
Who broke this?

291
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,367
There's no coffee, Ms. Temp.

292
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,500
Drink some tea, then.

293
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,367
But we want coffee.

294
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:34,300
Go buy some.

295
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,567
That's not included in my contract.

296
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,500
They always say that.

297
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,934
Sorry, it's my fault, so
I'll go get coffee for you.

298
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,266
- Don't.
- Cafe latte.

299
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:44,700
- Blend.
- Iced coffee.

300
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,367
Double espresso.

301
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,433
Can you repeat that?

302
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:49,600
Cafe latte for me.

303
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,967
Blend coffee.

304
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:51,834
Iced coffee.

305
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,233
- Mori?
- Yes?

306
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,600
Are you OK?

307
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,934
Would you like a coffee, too?

308
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
No, thank you.

309
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,033
Here you go.

310
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:01,967
Thanks.

311
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,967
You ordered an espresso, right?

312
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes.

313
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,400
Here's your change.

314
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,467
300 yen.

315
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm out of cigarettes.

316
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Hey, you.

317
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,467
You don't look busy. Can you go
buy cigarettes? Seven Star.

318
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,467
Sure.

319
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,467
Mild Seven 1mg for me.

320
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,867
Marlboro Light for me.

321
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,266
Can you please repeat that?

322
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,100
Mild Seven 1mg for me.

323
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,333
Marlboro Light. Not the red one.

324
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,000
Alright.

325
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,300
Here you go.

326
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,333
"Ladies"

327
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,834
When you keep buttering up
to those employees,

328
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:44,100
it's us temps who will
get in trouble later.

329
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,967
They'll underestimate us and
will ask us to do things, too.

330
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,033
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,066
Don't you have pride?

332
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,934
I'd like to ask you for some advice.

333
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,600
Do you have time today?

334
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:19,867
No.

335
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,800
Please wait, Haruko.

336
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,667
Where do you always go rushing to?

337
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,133
School for new skills?

338
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,900
It's none of your business.

339
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,633
I want to be a temp worker like you.

340
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,633
Impossible.

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,200
Can you tell me one thing?

342
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,700
What's the pride of the temp?

343
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,100
That's such a stupid question.

344
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,800
"Bus stop: Marunouchi North"

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,934
"To Kayabacho Station"

346
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,200
Haruko...

347
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,500
"Cafe Cantante"

348
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:57,900
Welcome.

349
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:04,166
Is Haruko Omae here?

350
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't know where she went,
and I thought maybe she's here.

351
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,400
We've got another "stray sheep".

352
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,800
Are you a co-worker of Haruko?

353
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,166
- Yes.
- I see.

354
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,867
She hasn't been back yet.

355
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,934
But make yourself at home.

356
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,734
Are you Haruko's...?

357
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,934
I am like her mother.

358
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,467
This is my actual son.

359
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,200
His name is Ryuto.

360
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,266
Hi there.

361
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,266
Good evening.

362
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:38,767
Well...

363
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,133
did you just say I'm a stray sheep?

364
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,567
Yes, you're the 20th one we had.

365
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:51,800
I've spent half a year building
a connection with them.

366
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,433
I've completely lost my face.

367
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,767
In any case, you have a deal,
so that's great.

368
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,367
Why is it great?

369
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,233
My pride has been shattered.

370
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:06,500
She makes fun of us employees
instead of making us look good.

371
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,133
When I worked in HR,

372
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,066
I once saw a temp squeezing water
out of a rag into someone's tea.

373
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,133
She might do that same.

374
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,400
No way.

375
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,200
Omae makes good tea.

376
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,633
Are you falling in love with
that turtleneck sweater, too?

377
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
That turtleneck!

378
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,266
Haruko doesn't butter up to
permanent employees at all.

379
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,567
She refuses to do
what she doesn't want to do.

380
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,734
I admire her for that.

381
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,100
I'm no good, compared to her.

382
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,934
Oh, thank you.

383
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,600
I have no experience or skills.

384
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,533
I can't take pride in my work
like Haruko does.

385
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,033
I don't get to talk about my pride.

386
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:06,867
You know...

387
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,400
Haruko does take
pride in her temp jobs.

388
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:16,834
But she isn't proud
of herself at all.

389
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,266
- Really?
- It's true.

390
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,633
She gets rid of anything
that doesn't benefit her.

391
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,266
That's how she is.

392
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,367
- Right?
- True.

393
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,700
I messed it up again.

394
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,100
Stop there.

395
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,600
Right here.

396
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,066
Wow, awesome.

397
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,734
Thank you, Miss.

398
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,333
Mum.

399
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,066
- Hi there.
- I have gifts.

400
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,867
What are these cute things?
There are so many of them.

401
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,500
You can take one.

402
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,667
The arcade will go bankrupt.

403
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:11,633
Let me see.

404
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,500
By the way, your co-worker...

405
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,800
Was her name Midori? Miki?

406
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,033
- Miyuki.
- Yeah. She was here.

407
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,533
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

408
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,934
She reminded me
of how you used to be.

409
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,100
What?

410
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,433
What? She's genuine and clumsy
like how you used to be.

411
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,033
Thanks for last night.

412
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,900
I like that place.
The owner is nice.

413
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,700
They said you live upstairs.

414
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,266
Haruko?

415
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,300
What you just said...

416
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,767
delete that from your brain now.

417
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,233
What?

418
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,400
If you tell anyone,
I'll beat you up.

419
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,266
I won't.

420
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,934
I promise.

421
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,800
Chief.

422
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,266
The computer security
here is too weak.

423
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,300
What?

424
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,800
What do you mean?

425
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,600
It's quite easy to hack into.

426
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:20,467
See?

427
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,467
Oh no.

428
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,700
This isn't good.

429
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,533
- This is bad.
- Chief?

430
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,567
I thought you should warn
the system management team.

431
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:29,700
You did?

432
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,266
- Can you make a report?
- It's done.

433
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,433
This makes no sense to me.

434
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,934
Me, either.

435
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,133
She's right.

436
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,266
Can you come with me?

437
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,266
Sure.

438
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,300
Wait.

439
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,633
That's a permanent employees' job.

440
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
Stay out of this, Temp.

441
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,834
I'll go talk to them, Ken.

442
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,734
Nice work.

443
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,900
Hey, can you go get
a yakisoba bun for my lunch?

444
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,333
I'm too busy to go out.

445
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,633
Sure.

446
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:17,033
Go to Yaesu Bakery,
not a convenience store.

447
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,200
On the other side of the station.

448
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,633
I'm quite picky, you know.

449
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,767
A cutlet sandwich for me.

450
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Me, too. And cafe latte.

451
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,600
Cigarettes, too.

452
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,166
What kind, again?

453
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,734
Seven Star. Remember it already.

454
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,367
Sorry.

455
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,567
Here she goes again.

456
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:35,734
It's unbelievable.

457
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,000
Hello?

458
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,934
Hurry up.

459
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,133
Go, run.

460
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,567
It's noon, so see you later.

461
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,500
"Restaurant Yojiya"

462
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,734
Thank you.

463
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,867
Sorry.

464
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,967
I made it.

465
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:33,967
I'm sure she's working as a temp
to attract men.

466
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,467
She should be ashamed of herself.

467
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:37,834
It's disgusting.

468
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,500
The lunch break will end soon.

469
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,767
Make sure to get proper lunch.

470
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:46,867
Haruko.

471
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,300
I told you not to do it.

472
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,033
But Mr Hitotsugi told me

473
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,533
that the only way to survive for me
is to have a personality.

474
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,500
I also need to pay
for that coffee server.

475
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,633
All the excuses.

476
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:10,033
Coffee server, Hitotsugi,
and personality don't matter.

477
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:14,600
You're just making excuses for
not being able to say no.

478
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,233
You just don't have
the courage to say no.

479
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,367
Serving male employees,
and being hated by the girls.

480
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:28,633
You'll end up running errands
the entire time.

481
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,734
"It smells bad"

482
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,834
"Don't eat smelly food
at your desk"

483
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,133
Hey, you.

484
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,033
Did you get a call from
Manager Midorikawa?

485
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,133
No.

486
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,800
He's late.

487
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,934
- You sent it?
- Sales Division 2.

488
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:14,934
Please hold.

489
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,200
- Who is it?
- Manager Midorikawa.

490
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,500
Transfer it to me.

491
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,867
- What number?
- Not for you.

492
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:25,333
Omae, Manager Midorikawa would
like to speak with you.

493
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:26,266
OK.

494
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:27,967
Why not me?

495
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,033
Why not me?

496
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,934
This is Omae speaking.

497
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:36,967
Yes.

498
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,367
We sincerely apologise,
Manager Midorikawa.

499
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,867
It's his lack of experience.

500
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:45,600
What?

501
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,934
Manager Midorikawa.

502
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:50,467
- It won't happen again.
- Let me speak to him.

503
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,967
OK.

504
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm not sure about that.

505
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,734
- Let me.
- It's fine.

506
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:02,166
I'm aware of the retail space area.

507
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,533
- Understood.
- Now.

508
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:06,033
We're sincerely sorry about this.

509
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:07,100
Bye.

510
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,133
Don't hang up. Hey!

511
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,500
It was from Midorikawa.

512
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
Yes, I know that.

513
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,033
Is this intentional?

514
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,700
You should've let me talk.

515
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,667
The call was for me.

516
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,333
What did he say?
Report it to me.

517
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,000
You made a mistake in calculating
the retail space area.

518
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,600
It's 92 square metres.

519
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,633
He'd like it to be re-submitted
by tomorrow.

520
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,300
Wow, Shoji.

521
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,834
It's not like you.

522
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,333
Are you alright?

523
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:41,500
And what?

524
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,967
What else did he say?

525
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:44,967
Tell me all.

526
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:48,300
He asked if you were trustworthy.

527
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,500
So I said I wasn't sure. So?

528
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,467
- Who does she think she is?
- Seriously?

529
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,767
Don't be arrogant.

530
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,166
All I did was talk on the phone.

531
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:59,100
Kuroiwa, she's concerned
about our business.

532
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,767
A temp doesn't care
how our company is doing.

533
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,333
She just wants to stand out
so her hourly wage will go up.

534
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,934
Now, will you excuse me
if there are no more questions?

535
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,967
Hey, wait.

536
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:23,734
I'll let you off the hook today
but stay out of our territory.

537
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:27,500
You're only here for three months,
so you can't be responsible.

538
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,266
I told you from the beginning
that it was not my job.

539
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:34,300
I took you because I wanted
them to think I had a secretary.

540
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,967
Stay out of important discussions.

541
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:38,500
Why don't you focus
on not making mistakes?

542
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Shut up, turtleneck.

543
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,433
You've got a bad perm, too.

544
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,266
This isn't a bad perm.

545
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:44,633
It's my natural hair.

546
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,600
My natural hair.

547
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,533
- Calm down.
- Stay out of this.

548
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,333
I can't take it.

549
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,834
This isn't good.

550
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:55,266
Calm down, Chief Shoji.

551
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,500
Why don't we have some coffee?
That'd cheer you up.

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,767
It'd be nice.

553
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,133
Yeah, let's do that.

554
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,467
Here, take this and get coffee
for everyone.

555
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:07,400
- Sure.
- Thanks.

556
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:12,400
Mori?

557
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,033
Well...

558
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:15,734
I...

559
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,600
You broke the coffee server,
so go buy coffee.

560
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:21,934
Sure.

561
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,433
That's how a temp should be.

562
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,700
You're easy labour to us.

563
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,667
Easy labour, huh?

564
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,200
Yet you rely on temp workers.

565
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,367
Mr. Employee?

566
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
I told you to stop with that name.

567
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,767
I'll do that when you remember
the names of each temp worker.

568
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,300
Alright, let's go get coffee.

569
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,433
I...

570
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,700
I'm not going.

571
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,867
I'll go for her, then.

572
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,066
Ogasawara.

573
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,633
A regular employee
shouldn't do that.

574
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:09,734
You're encouraging other temps
to have arrogant attitudes!

575
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
OK, that's enough.

576
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:15,767
Get back to work, whoever you are.

577
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:20,033
I need to hand this out
to all employees today.

578
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,967
Omae,

579
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,767
can you work with other temp workers
and staple these?

580
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,700
Sure.

581
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,700
Sir,

582
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:32,233
I'll show her how this should
be properly done.

583
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,533
Properly done?

584
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,767
No need. Back to work.

585
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,133
I can't back down now.

586
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,967
It's a stapler battle.

587
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,400
What?

588
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,300
Do as you like.

589
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,633
What do you mean by a battle, Shoji?

590
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,967
If I win, apologise.

591
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,533
And if I win?

592
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,734
I'll shave my head and apologise.

593
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,567
I saw her smile
for the first time.

594
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,100
The battle will be held
at three o'clock sharp.

595
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,200
Understood.

596
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:07,967
I accept it.

597
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,033
The stapler battle
is about to begin.

598
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,800
Whoever staples
1,000 documents first wins.

599
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,367
- You can do it!
- I'm rooting for you!

600
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:29,700
Shoji, are you serious
about your hair?

601
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:31,500
Don't worry.

602
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,767
I'm number one at stapling.

603
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,734
As a student, I stapled
10,000 documents a day.

604
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,767
10,000 documents?

605
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,567
Please do your best.

606
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,834
I'm on your side.

607
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,400
Knock that guy down.

608
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,400
You won't be able to hold a stapler
for the next 30 years after this.

609
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Well said.

610
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,934
Quiet, please.

611
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,000
10 seconds...

612
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,734
Five,

613
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:56,800
four,

614
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,767
three,

615
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:58,767
two,

616
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,667
one.

617
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,834
Go!

618
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,734
Yes!

619
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,567
Keep going.

620
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:09,767
Here.

621
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,367
Go, go!

622
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,066
You can do this.

623
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:14,400
Great.

624
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,000
She's going fast.

625
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,867
Yes, keep it up.

626
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,166
You're doing good.

627
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:23,066
Just stay calm.

628
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,533
Yes.

629
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:25,900
Go.

630
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,967
Hey!

631
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,000
You're so slow.

632
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,667
We'll help.

633
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,367
Here.

634
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:37,700
Good.

635
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,567
Hurry.

636
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,734
Keep it up.

637
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,700
You're doing good.

638
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,266
Nice.

639
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,900
Here.

640
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,967
Yeah.

641
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:52,767
Nice.

642
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:57,633
- Ruler.
- Sure.

643
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,500
What is she doing now?

644
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:07,734
To avoid overlaps of stapler nails

645
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,233
she's hitting them flat.

646
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,000
That's impressive.

647
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,133
And you, Shoji?

648
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:14,166
No need.

649
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,834
I'm using
the latest flat clinch stapler.

650
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,300
That's not fair.

651
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,667
Don't be beaten by that loser.

652
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,900
Loser?

653
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,266
Here you go.

654
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:26,967
Go! Go! Go!

655
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,767
Here.

656
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,333
This is done.

657
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:33,100
Here.

658
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,433
She's quick.

659
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,834
Bring up the pace a bit.

660
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:41,467
Omae, Omae, Omae.

661
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:42,734
Last 50 copies.

662
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:43,834
Alright.

663
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,166
- Go!
- Chief Shoji,

664
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,166
you're running behind her.

665
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,934
I will win no matter what,
for our pride.

666
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,233
There you go.

667
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,567
Alright.

668
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,700
Nice pace.

669
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,066
Good.

670
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,467
Nice.

671
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,400
Here you go.

672
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,934
Almost there.

673
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,600
That's good.

674
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,000
Here.

675
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,600
Nice.

676
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:18,734
Almost there.

677
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:19,934
Keep it up.

678
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,233
Focus.

679
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,433
- The opponent is getting tired.
- Here.

680
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,900
Shoji, Shoji, Shoji.

681
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,166
Shoji, Shoji, Shoji.

682
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,066
Shoji, Shoji, Shoji.

683
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:39,333
Shoji, Shoji, Shoji.

684
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,467
Shoji, Shoji, Shoji.

685
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:42,934
Here's the last one.

686
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,066
I won.

687
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,934
Yes!

688
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,734
We did it.

689
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,734
Hey, are you guys done?

690
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,000
Hi there.

691
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,266
Director.

692
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,867
I won.

693
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,033
I won.

694
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,867
You got defeated?

695
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,100
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,333
It's my fault.

697
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,400
Haruko.

698
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,200
It's fine.

699
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,567
You did a pretty good job.

700
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,333
You were only one copy behind me.

701
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,834
I'll go pass these out
on each floor.

702
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:05,834
Yes, thanks.

703
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,734
She was just talking big.

704
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:14,233
Maybe now she'll know
how to shut her mouth.

705
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,000
Excuse me.

706
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,333
Ms. Temp.

707
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,433
Put it there.

708
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,900
Sure.

709
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,266
Excuse me.

710
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,367
Excuse me.

711
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,333
I...

712
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,633
I got courageous and
said no to errands.

713
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
So I wanted you to win, too.

714
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,033
Your defeat...

715
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,934
is the defeat of my future.

716
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,333
Omae.

717
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,400
I want to ask you something.

718
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Can I?

719
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:45,533
Earlier,

720
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,500
why did intentionally lose?

721
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,633
You lost intentionally,
didn't you?

722
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,066
Why was that?

723
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:08,667
Answer me.

724
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,166
That is...

725
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,934
because I'm a temp.

726
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Hurting a permanent employee's
pride in front of everyone

727
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,033
doesn't make me happy at all.

728
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:35,834
Shoji has...

729
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:41,400
all kinds of misconceptions
about you.

730
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:46,300
He thinks I don't mind
hurting other people's feelings.

731
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:47,667
But so what?

732
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,367
Are you OK with that?

733
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,100
Of course not, right?

734
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,667
It's fine.

735
00:38:58,633 --> 00:38:59,734
I feel better now...

736
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,900
that I said what I wanted to say.

737
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:08,600
Was there any other way for me
to handle it?

738
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,633
You lost and apologised.

739
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,633
That's not right.

740
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,300
Aren't you upset?

741
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,066
Don't you have pride?

742
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,166
Pride...

743
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,800
My pride isn't...

744
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,800
...the most important thing for me.

745
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:42,900
What's more important than pride?

746
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:50,500
What are the things
that are important for you?

747
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
That is...

748
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,100
to continue living as a temp.

749
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:15,867
To do that,

750
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:21,500
I have to coexist with arrogant
and proud permanent employees.

751
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,166
From now on,

752
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,200
ask me questions during my hours.

753
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,700
Omae.

754
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,333
Shoji.

755
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,033
Omae...

756
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,633
She's quite impressive.

757
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:11,500
What?

758
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,000
Look.

759
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,834
Not even an one millimetre shift.

760
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:20,033
It's like bookbinding.

761
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,233
You're right.

762
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,133
Watch out, Ken.

763
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,700
You're not capable of handling her.

764
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,333
I know that.

765
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:50,834
Yeah!

766
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,867
Not even a good morning?

767
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,400
Omae.

768
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:26,834
Good morning.

769
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,100
Chief Shoji.

770
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:42,834
Excuse me.

771
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,834
Hi there.

772
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,667
Sir.

773
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,800
It's nothing fancy,
but please take this.

774
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,500
Thank you,
but what's the occasion?

775
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:01,700
I heard that Mori broke
your precious coffee server.

776
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,133
I came to apologise.

777
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,500
Mori did?

778
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:07,367
No, it was me who broke it.

779
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,100
What?

780
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,100
Sir.

781
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:13,367
Is that true?

782
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:14,867
Two days ago,

783
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,400
it wasn't working well.

784
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:20,500
So I kicked it hard and it broke.

785
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:24,066
Why didn't you tell us that sooner?

786
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:28,367
Does that mean I won't have to
pay 150,000 yen?

787
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:29,467
Of course not.

788
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:32,000
I arranged to get it repaired.

789
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,367
That's great, Mori.

790
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,266
I'm happy for you.

791
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:37,500
Yeah!

792
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,900
This is great.

793
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,000
The coffee server
the director broke is now fixed.

794
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:48,567
Thank you.

795
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:52,367
Asano even made
a donation box for you.

796
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:55,133
Oh, don't mention that.

797
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What? You made that?

798
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,800
- Seriously?
- Everyone,

799
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,967
thank you very much.

800
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,834
Are you getting sick?

801
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:13,100
It's extra cold today, so definitely
say no to errands.

802
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,967
Chief.

803
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,266
You don't have
your wool underwear on today?

804
00:44:25,066 --> 00:44:28,200
What are you talking about?

805
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,000
Who wears wool underwear?

806
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,934
Don't worry, Mori.

807
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:33,800
We'll pretend we didn't hear it.

808
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,567
Why would you tell everyone that?

809
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:43,033
I'm so disappointed in you.

810
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:46,734
You weren't helpful at all
when I thought I was in debt.

811
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,700
You lost at the stapler battle.

812
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,567
You're Special A Rank?
It's not that impressive.

813
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:52,800
Yeah? So?

814
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,834
Besides, you're not
a very nice person.

815
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,900
I'll never want to be
a temp worker like you.

816
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,400
I never asked you to be.

"To be continued"

818
00:45:20,633 --> 00:45:22,734
A tuna filleting show sounds good.

819
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,100
I'll make it successful.

820
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,266
Please.

821
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:29,100
You shouldn't be asking this
to me. I'm just a temp.

822
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,800
I just want to help them.

823
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,567
