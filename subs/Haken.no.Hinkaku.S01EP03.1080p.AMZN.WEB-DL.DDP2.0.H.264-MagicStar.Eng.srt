1
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:03,967
On the supply and demand of
domestic tuna,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,800
we should apply our best efforts.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,500
We're proposing a project
called the Tuna Project.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,834
I think that's a good idea.

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,367
But the fishery department should
just stick to purchases.

6
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:15,300
What?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,300
You should leave the sales
to our department.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,667
That's no way to talk to
your superior!

9
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,333
We've put a lot of preparation
into this!

10
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,834
Tuna is...

11
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,767
Okay. Then let me ask this.

12
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:28,300
Who sells the tuna that you buy?

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
You should know who should
take the initiative!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,834
Tuna belongs to
the fishery department!

15
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,834
What are you talking about!

16
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,600
- Oh no!
-Hot!

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,967
- Hot!
- I'm so sorry!

18
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,233
Hot!

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,767
I'm so sorry!

20
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,834
My deepest apologies!

21
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,867
Be careful because it's hot, okay?

22
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,233
Okay!

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

24
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,767
Thank you.

25
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:55,600
Satonaka!

26
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,533
What are you looking at?

27
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,133
Come up with an idea
for the sales team.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,600
Yes, sir!

29
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,633
Fujii. Let's hear
what you have to say.

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,600
Okay.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,400
Putting together supply,
circulation, and sales,

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,567
we can control the soaring prices
and appeal to trading companies.

33
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,967
Who's the temp that made us tea?

34
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,200
Haruko Omae. She's from my section.

35
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,467
I blew it again!

36
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,500
Mori-chan. What happened this time?

37
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,433
Please don't ask!

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
Haruko...

39
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:40,233
Why am I always like this?

40
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,166
The more I try not to mess up,
the worse it gets.

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,700
Mihara and Miya tell me

42
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:53,100
that it's a debt
from my previous life.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,467
I don't get what you're saying.

44
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,000
Omae. Here are the documents.

45
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,200
Thanks for the tea earlier.

46
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,233
How about we grab lunch together?

47
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,233
What?

48
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,066
"Email from Kishino"

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,567
The meeting was boring so
I couldn't help but looking at you.

50
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,767
Hey!

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,133
Omae! You're so popular!

52
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,433
- Let me see!
- Look!

53
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,934
"I eat lunch alone"

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,667
Taking an upper-hand...

55
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,867
"Concentrate on meetings"

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,567
"You've got mail"

57
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,500
He replied.

58
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,867
The red sweater looks good on you.

59
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,300
I must be lucky to
have you spill tea on me.

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,467
By the way, I'm free tonight.

61
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,166
Hold on a minute!
You see that, Omae?

62
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,266
Aren't those all addressed
to Mori?

63
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,767
What? Me?

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,433
Then that'd make sense.

65
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,000
They were sent to me.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,100
"That's none of your business!"

67
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,300
Hey! Don't write that!

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,233
They'll think I'm a terrible woman!

69
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,934
It's a hassle to deal with
these misunderstandings.

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,433
Omae, please stop!

71
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,934
What?

72
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,734
Thank you for your hard work.

73
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,200
Full-time employee's pride
comes before a fall.

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,033
Companies can't run without
temp workers.

75
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,633
Take Haruko Omae, for example.

76
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,700
Impossible and overtime
aren't words in her dictionary.

77
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,934
She excludes all
complicated relationships.

78
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,600
When her three-month contract is up,

79
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,233
she dusts herself off
to somewhere else.

80
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,233
But why this extraordinary
temp worker, Haruko Omae,

81
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,834
decided to choose this temp life,

82
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,433
no one really knows.

83
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:57,367
"Pride Of The Temp"

84
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,300
Are you going to that restaurant
again today?

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,300
I actually can't eat by myself.

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Can I join you?

87
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,633
- Kon!
- Yes?

88
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,300
Can you eat lunch with me?

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,767
I'm sorry, I brought my lunch today.

90
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:16,934
Sorry.

91
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:21,834
Lunchtime!

92
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
Company cafeteria?

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,467
Meat and potatoes again?

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,767
Anything's fine.

96
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,433
I want curry rice.

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,667
What are you looking at?

98
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,367
I was thinking...

99
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,700
Maybe you also don't like
to eat alone?

100
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,633
What? That's absurd!

101
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,800
If you're okay with it,
would you eat with me?

102
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,066
Really?

103
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,633
What do you take me for?

104
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:52,500
I don't have time to eat lunch.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,767
I'm busy.

106
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,500
Rice ball from
the convenient store again.

107
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,667
Mori.

108
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,734
Want to eat at
the company cafeteria?

109
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,500
Chief, are you sure?

110
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,133
I'm so glad!

111
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,767
Let's go eat then.

112
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,133
Excuse me!

113
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,100
Oh! Good to see you!

114
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,066
Can I join you for lunch?

115
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,066
Of course!

116
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,033
Thank you.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,567
So you can't eat out by yourself?

118
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,834
It makes me nervous.

119
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,066
I feel like people are
watching me eat.

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,700
It must be tough to be a woman.

121
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:42,266
Some of them eat at diners
by themselves though.

122
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,367
Are you talking about Haruko Omae?

123
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,100
She's different from the rest of us.

124
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,834
It must be hard to work with her.

125
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,367
You can tell?

126
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,367
I don't get her at all.

127
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,367
By the way, as for Omae,

128
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,400
what does she do on her days off?

129
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,300
No one knows.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,300
I think she's backpacking abroad.

131
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:07,967
- Backpacking?
- Yes.

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,533
Travelling alone?

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,834
That must be lonely.

134
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,934
- Right?
- Loneliness...

135
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,166
is a special emotion to humans.

136
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:18,166
A lone wolf like her
wouldn't understand.

137
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,533
Truth be told, she is quite far out.

138
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,333
You've bottled this up for a while,
haven't you?

139
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:23,834
You get it, don't you?

140
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,100
Going alone on trips, karaoke,
movies, Korean barbecue.

141
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,400
If you get used to that,
you're done being a woman.

142
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,200
Omae doesn't seem to have
many friends.

143
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,734
No friends that are humans,
I'm sure.

144
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,633
Here. Please take this.

145
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,433
Thank you.

146
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,467
Since when?

147
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,200
What do you think, Kaori?

148
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,200
The new temp is after Satonaka!

149
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,166
- What?
- So...

150
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,400
we're going to let you
in our clique.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,900
You can eat with us
from now on.

152
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,533
Okay! Gladly!

153
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,533
I'm Mori. Nice to meet you!

154
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,633
We're going to have more
matchmaking parties this month.

155
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,166
I know it's sudden,
but there's one tonight.

156
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,767
So this group...

157
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,900
Our main events
are matchmaking parties.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,333
To find us husbands, of course.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Let me do your hair.

160
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:30,667
Omae!

161
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,633
They have the tuna meeting now.

162
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,100
And they want more tea.

163
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,467
You stink.

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Sorry. Is the perfume too strong?

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Yes.

166
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,033
I can't be like the lone wolf
like you are.

167
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,367
So I joined a group.

168
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,467
What's that got to do with perfume?

169
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,266
The group is very fashionable.

170
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,233
We're on our way to
find us husbands.

171
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,400
I didn't join for
that reason though!

172
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,667
Even so,

173
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,200
you seem ready for the part.

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,100
Oh, this? This is different!

175
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,100
They just wanted to do my hair!

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,934
Okay then.

177
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,500
The first Tuna Project joint meeting
is about to commence.

178
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,000
First of all, how do we sell
the tuna we purchase from fisheries?

179
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,066
Let's go from there.

180
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,133
The sales department suggests

181
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,500
we bulk sell to conveyor-belt
sushi shops.

182
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,266
I think that's a great strategy.

183
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,700
- Agreed!
- No objections!

184
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,033
It's decided then.

185
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,667
The marketing department
can do some more research

186
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,100
if you agree.

187
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Most sushi shops have their own
venue to acquire their fish.

188
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,800
And 75 percent of domestic tuna
is consumed at home.

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,166
The trend to eat tuna elsewhere
has decreased rapidly.

190
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Has decreased rapidly?

191
00:08:58,934 --> 00:08:59,967
Ogasawara.

192
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,633
If you have any ideas.

193
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,133
About raw tuna fish!

194
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,066
What is it?

195
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:08,400
I went to a shopping centre with
my grandchild on New Year's night.

196
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
There was a tuna filleting show
held by a tuna god, named Tsune.

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,500
I ended up buying five bags of tuna.

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,400
And the tuna was
absolutely delicious!

199
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
I'd understand if it were
the fattier part of the fish,

200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
but I was surprised that lean tuna
could taste that good!

201
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
I was utterly baffled.

202
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,500
That's all.

203
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:41,367
That's not a proposal
but your personal feedback.

204
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,767
Oh, my apologies.

205
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,200
That's brilliant!

206
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,066
Let's do a tuna filleting display!

207
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,166
What? What about
the conveyor-belt sushi shops?

208
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,734
Yeah, what about that?

209
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,967
Learn to switch gears, will you?

210
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:59,800
The trading business needs
a tuna filleting display!

211
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,800
We have a venue for that, don't we?

212
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,133
Oh, the department store that just
increased their selling area?

213
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:08,166
Representing the sales department,
I'm going to make sure we succeed.

214
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,834
Thank you, Ogasawara.

215
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:11,800
Not at all.

216
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,834
Thank you.

217
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,367
Thanks in advance.

218
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,967
We'd like to put on
a tuna filleting display.

219
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,700
"Display of a giant tuna
in front of guests"

220
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
Yes, that's what we have in mind.

221
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,467
"A tuna god selling 500 tuna a year"

222
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,734
Tsune is selling 500 tunas
a year?

223
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,900
That's amazing!

224
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,967
His schedule has been full
since half a year ago?

225
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,967
Hello? Hello?

226
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,934
They hung up.

227
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,000
Tuna filleting shows seem to be
popular these days.

228
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,300
Yes.

229
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't get a hold of him.

230
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,934
Just keep making calls.

231
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
- Shoji!
- Hey, chief.

232
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
Here's the proposal.

233
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

234
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,867
You're done here.
You can go home now.

235
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't need you to tell me that.

236
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:02,367
Excuse me.

237
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,300
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Going home!

238
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,133
Well done today.

239
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:08,867
Chief!

240
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,000
Can I leave early today too?

241
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,734
Thanks for your hard work.

242
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,400
Thank you!

243
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,600
Why did Mori join
that kind of flashy group?

244
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,633
Because people from Marketing
are old and boring.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,333
Speak for yourself.

246
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,567
Ogasawara!

247
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,900
Please call these places today.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
Woe is me!

249
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,834
Did you use to go to
matchmaking parties, Omae?

250
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,066
Used to?

251
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,700
Sorry about the question.

252
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
You look very experienced.

253
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,633
If you know the secrets

254
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,834
to matchmaking parties,
please tell us.

255
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,867
When comparing
who's wiser among fools,

256
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,300
there's no winner.

257
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,100
What?

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,033
What's she saying?

259
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,333
What was that?

260
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,033
There are no guys like you
at our department,

261
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,200
That's why we really looked forward
to today.

262
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,166
Really?

263
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Drink up! Cheers!

264
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,967
Tsune?

265
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,734
We're your diehard fans!

266
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,166
We all are!

267
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:19,734
Today's tuna filleting show
was brilliant!

268
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,300
Really!

269
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,600
"Mr. Tsune"

270
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,166
Please excuse me.

271
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,967
"Haruko Omae"

272
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,967
"Dialling"

273
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,867
Omae? You won't believe this!

274
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm at a matchmaking party.

275
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,066
And I bumped into him!

276
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,700
My office hours are over.

277
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,600
Hey!

278
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,700
Welcome!

279
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Have a seat.

280
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,300
The turtleneck isn't here.

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,467
Turtleneck?

282
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,800
Oh, nothing.

283
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,300
This is a nice place!

284
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,266
Tuna filleting display
is a great idea!

285
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,000
Glad you like it.

286
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Midorikawa from the department store
said the same thing.

287
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,133
Was that Omae's idea?

288
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,467
No, it was not!

289
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:31,200
We just put Ogasawara's idea
on paper.

290
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Well, you'd better use her
connections with the store manager.

291
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,133
Yes, sir!

292
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,667
Not me.

293
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:41,834
Thank you for waiting.

294
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,700
Looks like you've finished
this bottle.

295
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,233
- Can we get one more of the same?
- Sure thing.

296
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:52,367
Well, is the girl who danced
with a black dress here tonight?

297
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,200
Oh, she's not in the mood
to dance tonight.

298
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,567
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,033
I see.

300
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,767
Please enjoy.

301
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,800
Haru-chan! Don't do this.

302
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,667
I need to get this out tonight.

303
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,667
How can you stand that lone wolf?

304
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,166
Lone wolf?

305
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,533
Haruko Omae!

306
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:18,767
I called her here because
you both can't do your jobs!

307
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,266
What's so funny?

308
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,633
Nothing.

309
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,233
That's not nothing!

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,900
Sir,

311
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,367
didn't you say
at the new hire orientation

312
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,400
that the company is your home?

313
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,867
The employees are your family.

314
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:40,000
You said, "From today,
you are my family."

315
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,266
When I heard that,

316
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:46,033
I was so glad to be part
of this company.

317
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
I see.

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Temp workers are just strangers!

319
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,600
They don't care what happens
to the company.

320
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,600
They come and go as they please.

321
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
I want to work with family.

322
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,967
Stop being so rigid!

323
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,000
Times have changed.
Acknowledge it!

324
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,266
What's the world come to?

325
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,333
Maybe it's because we implemented
business principles from America?

326
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,433
Oh, so you get it.

327
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:18,667
And?

328
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,166
The business principles have to do
with employees

329
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:22,600
and more relaxed regulations.

330
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,367
Lowering the number of
full-time employees as possible.

331
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,767
By using temp staff, companies can
save a lot of money.

332
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,433
I'm not asking about something
so complicated!

333
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,800
Just how it got to be like this!

334
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,433
You've had a lot today, haven't you?

335
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,967
No, I haven't!

336
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,400
Sorry.

337
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,734
Hello, Mr. Asano? What's the matter?

338
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,700
Mori has just called the office.

339
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,667
Mr. Tsune that Ogasawara
spoke about?

340
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:53,800
He's at a party with his fans
in a restaurant in Ebisu.

341
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,934
The Tuna God?

342
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,800
Okay.

343
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,700
What?

344
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,934
Mr. Tsune is in Ebisu.

345
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,767
Okay! This is our chance!

346
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,066
Thank you for dinner!

347
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:05,600
Shoji!

348
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,834
Come on!

349
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,567
We'll go get Mr. Tsune!

350
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,467
I'm counting on you!

351
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,233
So Mr. Tsune is alive and well.

352
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,066
Please, I'm begging you!

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
People from my company
will be here soon.

354
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,667
Could you please at least
talk to them?

355
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:37,867
Mori!

356
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,033
Over here!

357
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,000
Nice to meet you.

358
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm Shoji from S &amp; F.

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,467
No need for the card.

360
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,667
If this is for an appointment,
I'm already swamped right now.

361
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I'm sorry, but could you find
someone else?

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,900
This actually isn't work-related.

363
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,600
We're also a huge fan of yours.

364
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:01,033
I'm sorry to intrude on you all
like this.

365
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,367
My subordinate said she spotted you.

366
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,367
And I really wanted to talk about
tuna with you.

367
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,834
I was at your tuna filleting show
during New Year's.

368
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,734
I bought five packs of tuna!

369
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,600
The fatty part was delicious
for sure!

370
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,667
- But the lean parts...
- He's just repeating Ogasawara.

371
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,367
I didn't know lean tuna
could taste so good!

372
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:25,567
It made me want people to know
about that lean tuna.

373
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,934
You're right!

374
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,233
He's right!

375
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,400
You understand, don't you?

376
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,367
I'm so glad to run into you!

377
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,500
If you're okay with time, why don't
we go to a different bar?

378
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,734
You're all welcome to join!

379
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:38,934
- Okay, group!
- Yes?

380
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:39,867
Let's go with them!

381
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,667
He's great at this.

382
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,033
All of you are our guests!

383
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,500
It's a treat from S &amp; F!

384
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,166
I had a really good sleep.

385
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,166
That's great. I had a lot of fun.

386
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,300
- This way, please.
- Okay.

387
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,200
Attention!

388
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,100
Let me introduce...

389
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,166
the Tuna God...

390
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,100
Mr. Tsune!

391
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,867
Nice to meet you!

392
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,467
Thank you.

393
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Could you get tea for us, Omae?

394
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,867
Okay.

395
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,266
As you can see,
I only have a slot on Saturday.

396
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,734
You're fully booked.

397
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,367
I'll start preparing right away.

398
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,667
Suzuki, the floor plan?

399
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:23,633
Oh, okay.

400
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:27,834
Excuse me.

401
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,166
Oh! Haru-chan!

402
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,433
What?

403
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,066
Do you know each other?

404
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,367
You see him?

405
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,567
The real Mr. Tsune!

406
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,667
All thank to you, Mori.

407
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
We wouldn't be here without you.

408
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,767
Thank you.

409
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,100
Chief...

410
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry for running out like that
last night.

411
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,400
It seems your values are
different from ours.

412
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,667
Who'd prioritize their jobs
over a matchmaking party?

413
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,900
Last night was just a coincidence.

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,233
Thanks for waiting. Let's go.

415
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,333
2,000 yen Italian detox course meal
at the Marui Building.

416
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,500
2,000 yen?

417
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,633
If it's good,
let's go there every day.

418
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,667
Who knows when this company
will go down.

419
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,667
Right?

420
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,367
Are you coming?

421
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:23,433
Sorry. Can you go ahead?

422
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,367
Sorry.

423
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,000
What should I do, Haruko?

424
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,367
I've been invited to
a 2,000-yen lunch.

425
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,734
If this continues everyday--

426
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:33,934
You'll be broke.

427
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,533
But if I refuse,
I'll become alone again.

428
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,166
I had just found some friends
to have lunch with.

429
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,834
Are you friends just because
you do the same things?

430
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,700
You poor thing.

431
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:49,133
Those aren't friends.

432
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,633
They're goldfish faeces.

433
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,967
Then what are real friends like?

434
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,467
Why do you ask such a dumb question?

435
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,433
Well, you don't seem to have
any friends.

436
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,633
So what?

437
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,567
So you don't know how I feel!

438
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,467
Then don't come to me for advice.

439
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,533
The second person was a joke!

440
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,867
- The one with glasses?
- Yes!

441
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,767
He's definitely a no.

442
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,734
Thanks for having me.

443
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,900
- Please invite me again sometime.
- And the way he eats...

444
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,100
- It was so nasty!
- Please excuse us.

445
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,266
- That's a major turnoff.
- A major turnoff.

446
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,233
That totally turns me off.

447
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,533
That gets to me too.

448
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:37,767
How about the guy next to him?

449
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,834
The guy to his right?

450
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,800
"Robinson's"

451
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Sir.

452
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,433
What do you think?

453
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,033
We didn't have much time,
so we made these in half a day.

454
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:50,166
It's fine!
Mr. Tsune really stands out.

455
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,233
Didn't think you'd be able to catch
such a big star like him.

456
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,166
I tried my best.

457
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,767
There will be many observers
from headquarters.

458
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,333
- Headquarters?
- Yes.

459
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:04,767
Mr. Tsune is really something!

460
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,734
By the way, where's Omae?

461
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,700
Omae?

462
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,934
- Who's that?
- Oh, come on!

463
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,266
Jeanne d' Arc! Ms. Omae!

464
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,266
Oh! Her!

465
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:18,000
That temp has nothing to do
with this project.

466
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,567
She's not coming on the day of?

467
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,300
Nope.

468
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,500
That's right.

469
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,367
Shoji.

470
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,200
Should I be worried?

471
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,166
What?

472
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,667
Of course not!

473
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,000
All your floors will be flooding
with people this Saturday!

474
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,233
Maybe you should clear up
some more space.

475
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,233
Are you sure?

476
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,600
Of course!

477
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,233
Why does everyone keep asking
about Omae? It's so annoying!

478
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,533
She likes to stick her nose in
full-time employee's business.

479
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,467
I think you've got her all wrong.

480
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:02,367
She's not that kind of a person.

481
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,567
What are you saying?

482
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you saying you know her
that well?

483
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,700
Why won't you say something?

484
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,834
She's a black hole!

485
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:15,467
She sucks the energy out of
others and uses it for her benefit.

486
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,934
You better watch yourself!

487
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,200
She's not like that!

488
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,400
Stop talking about her already!

489
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,934
I'm Omae.

490
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,200
You were saying?

491
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:30,500
I can't get away
no matter where I go!

492
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey!

493
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,834
Were you following us?
Were you eavesdropping?

494
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:36,900
It's not like that!

495
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,934
This is where you catch your bus,
isn't it?

496
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,867
Bus? Busses are for humans!

497
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,266
She can teleport, I'm telling you!

498
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,467
Anyway,

499
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:48,533
your hair looks like
the universe exploded.

500
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,367
What are you're talking about,
you black hole!

501
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,200
We've still got work to do!

502
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,367
Be careful of her, Ken-chan!

503
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,867
You never know when she'll teleport!

504
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,800
Teleport!

505
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,800
It's huge!

506
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,800
How heavy is this?

507
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,467
73 kilograms.

508
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,700
That heavy?

509
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:20,734
You can sell all of these?

510
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,133
Are you sure?

511
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,166
You don't trust my skills?

512
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,266
It's not that.

513
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,333
People from the department store
headquarters will arrive tomorrow.

514
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:34,533
I'll get in trouble
if I don't show good results.

515
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:35,900
You idiot!

516
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:38,467
- What?
- You've got it all wrong!

517
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,033
I sell tuna to make
the customers happy.

518
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:43,800
The headquarters?

519
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,000
Results don't matter to me.

520
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,166
Don't matter? I'm trying hard here.

521
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,033
I can see through you.

522
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,767
You say a bunch of nice things
when you want something.

523
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:54,967
I'm done here.

524
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,633
Please wait a minute!

525
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:57,800
Let go!

526
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,633
Mr. Tsune!

527
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,333
- Are you okay?
- Don't touch me!

528
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm sorry!

529
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,166
Ambulance! Are you okay?

530
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,800
Someone call an ambulance!

531
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Are you okay, Mr. Tsune?

532
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Hey!

533
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:18,934
What?

534
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,934
Broken right shoulder?

535
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,367
It happened under my watch.

536
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm so sorry.

537
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,734
What will happen to the show?

538
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:31,967
We have until tomorrow

539
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,967
to find a replacement for Mr. Tsune.

540
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,700
Midorikawa at the store
is helping too.

541
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,600
I see.

542
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,533
We have ten 70 kilogram tunas.

543
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,367
They will be shipped out by tonight.

544
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
We also made adverts.

545
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,900
We can't back out now.

546
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,433
And?

547
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:50,800
Are you okay with this?

548
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:54,800
I'll make it happen.

549
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:55,767
Okay.

550
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll go to the main company
and catch up later.

551
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,033
Sorry about this.

552
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,867
Are you sure we can pull this off?

553
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:10,300
We can't find a replacement
for Mr. Tsune by tomorrow.

554
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:11,600
What are you talking about?

555
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,066
If we say we're doing something,
we do it!

556
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,500
I was opposed from the beginning!

557
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:19,166
We should've just bought
frozen tuna.

558
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,400
You guys are terrible!

559
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:25,200
You all bail when the ship
is sinking?

560
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:34,967
Okay.

561
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,467
Do your own work.

562
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,633
I'll be fine on my own.

563
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,567
Shoji.

564
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,500
The marketing department
will support you.

565
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000
- Let's do this.
- Thank you.

566
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,667
Yes, sir!

567
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:51,900
Omae?

568
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,867
Can you help too?

569
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,767
If it's during office hours.

570
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:56,767
Ken-chan.

571
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,233
Don't ask her.

572
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,233
I don't plan on asking for her help.

573
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,166
Shoji...

574
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,367
Whatever he said.

575
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,567
We should reach out to sushi chefs.

576
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,266
Or whoever we can to help.

577
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Shoji.

578
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,333
I'm so sorry, Ken!

579
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,767
Don't worry about it.

580
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,767
- Let's go!
- Okay.

581
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,433
See you tomorrow.

582
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,433
Omae.

583
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:39,834
The tuna filleting display

584
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,266
is at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

585
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,100
So?

586
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,633
You must have something
up your sleeve.

587
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm moved by Shoji
and Satonaka's friendship.

588
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,100
- So--
- I'm also asking you.

589
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,467
Everyone.

590
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,300
Don't waste your breath.

591
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,133
She doesn't do overtime or work
on her days off.

592
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,767
Exactly. See you tomorrow.

593
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:04,700
Okay.

594
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,200
I'll help too. Let's do this.

595
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,033
Is this Sakauchi?

596
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,433
This is S &amp; F calling.

597
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:18,600
Here!

598
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,133
- Please help us.
- Please.

599
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:22,567
I'm busy here. Go home.

600
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,767
Please, we really need your help.

601
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:26,633
Please!

602
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:28,066
I said, go home.

603
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,633
I'm busy tomorrow.

604
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:31,967
Please, we need your help.

605
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,633
Please!

606
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,500
We know we're asking a lot.

607
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
It's Saturday, so can't do.

608
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,900
Please!

609
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:40,867
Please!

610
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:41,800
We have no one else to ask.

611
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,300
This tuna looks amazing!

612
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,166
You're still here?

613
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,000
I can't get my mind off tomorrow.

614
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,767
Should we unload these?
You're Nakazato?

615
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,133
- I'm Satonaka.
- Oh, Satonaka. Here.

616
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,300
Ready?

617
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,367
Who's replacing Mr. Tsune?

618
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
- What?
- That...

619
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:10,433
What kind of person is he?

620
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,367
Hey!

621
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,900
You haven't found anyone yet?

622
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,066
I'm so sorry!

623
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:24,967
We'll be fine.

624
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,867
We still have 12 hours.

625
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:30,533
Nakazato.

626
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:33,734
Tell him.

627
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:35,767
It's not just his head on the line.

628
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,633
They'll have my head too!

629
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,367
Too bad.

630
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,400
They were out of yakisoba rolls.

631
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,200
No one's open at this hour.

632
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,033
Here.

633
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,900
I may be done for.

634
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,100
It's too soon to give up!

635
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,633
You've been through times like this.

636
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,767
And you've always come out on top.

637
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,700
Let's try Tsukiji!

638
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,333
I'm sure we'll find someone there.

639
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,633
I know you're trying hard, Ken.

640
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,266
But I'm not giving you credit
for this.

641
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,100
Let's go, Shoji!

642
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:52,233
Shoji?

643
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,934
Those men from your office
the other day.

644
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,900
Which one would you fancy?

645
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,233
What about you?

646
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,333
Me?

647
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,734
If you ask me...

648
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,633
They have to be good-looking.
I like good-looking men.

649
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,233
Then maybe Satonaka?

650
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,433
He's cute but not a good worker.

651
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,266
How about the ugly one then?

652
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:22,700
The one with the crazy perm?

653
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
He is good at his job, but...

654
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:27,867
has prejudice against temps.

655
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,266
That's shocking to hear.

656
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:31,867
Who are you talking about?

657
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:34,834
The one with the perm, of course.

658
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,934
He's not good-looking at all!

659
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:39,667
- Really?
- Well, beauty is subjective.

660
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,333
- True.
- I guess.

661
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,400
The crazy perm, huh?

662
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,667
Sorry for the sudden visit.

663
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:06,266
The one that's not my type.

664
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,600
Sorry?

665
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,834
Hello, Satonaka.

666
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,800
Is Omae here?

667
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:34,767
Omae.

668
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:37,133
I've come to ask for a favour.

669
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,633
The tuna filleting show
has been cancelled.

670
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,667
We couldn't find

671
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:46,700
anyone to replace Mr. Tsune.

672
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
This will be a huge loss
for the department store.

673
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,700
I'm on my way there to apologise.

674
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,667
I heard that the store manager
trusts you.

675
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,133
Would you mind coming with me?

676
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,467
I...

677
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,400
From the time I joined the company,

678
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:14,567
Shoji has taken care of me.

679
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,367
I want to return the favour.

680
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,367
What a beautiful friendship.

681
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:27,266
But...

682
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,700
I don't think that's something

683
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,433
you need to ask from a temp like me.

684
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,633
Stop blurring the lines between
business and personal life.

685
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:41,367
Omae.

686
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,300
I'm begging you.

687
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,467
Please leave.

688
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:55,567
Shoji.

689
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,367
I've made up my mind.

690
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,166
"Letter of resignation"

691
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,633
Please! Omae!

692
00:33:08,734 --> 00:33:10,367
When I say no,

693
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:12,867
it means no.

694
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,734
He's about to resign!

695
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,467
No one loves the company
more than he does.

696
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,433
I just want to help him somehow!

697
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,867
Please leave.

698
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,300
I'm sorry for raising my voice.

699
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:02,233
I'll be going now.

700
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,000
Are you sure about this, Haru-chan?

701
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,533
Yes.

702
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:38,967
Hello?

703
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Haru-chan?

704
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,000
Mr. Tsune?

705
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,900
I kind of messed things up.

706
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:48,967
And I'm getting old.

707
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,333
I think it's time for me to retire.

708
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,834
Mr. Tsune.

709
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,333
"Robinson's"

710
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,066
We're deeply sorry!

711
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,166
The tuna filleting display today
has been cancelled.

712
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,667
What?

713
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:11,700
We're truly sorry!

714
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,700
We're very sorry!

715
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,567
Sorry!

716
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:17,734
We're sorry!

717
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,767
We're deeply sorry!

718
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,734
We are very sorry.

719
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:26,500
My company will take
full responsibility.

720
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:27,567
No time for that!

721
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:31,166
Just think of how to
get through this!

722
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,200
Oh, it's senior manager!

723
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,100
Mr. Kirishima.

724
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,333
What's going on here?

725
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,367
Sir.

726
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,900
About today,

727
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,166
I'm truly sorry...

728
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,667
What's going on?

729
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,433
We are deeply sorry about this!

730
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,633
We're very sorry!

731
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm so sorry!

732
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,300
May I have your attention, please.

733
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,066
From now,
at the basement sales corner,

734
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,867
on the special stage,

735
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,734
a tuna filleting display
is about to begin.

736
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,633
What's going on?

737
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,467
What?

738
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:41,600
Haruko?

739
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:43,834
Omae?

740
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,367
It can't be her.

741
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,367
Now...

742
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:58,200
at the basement food corner,

743
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,400
Haru's tuna filleting display
is about to begin.

744
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:13,400
Come one, come all!
Loosen your money purses!

745
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,800
Let's begin!

746
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,800
Look at this tuna!

747
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
It's big, isn't it?

748
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,233
It's a 73 kilogram tuna!

749
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:24,133
I cannot wait to fillet this tuna!

750
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:27,767
Let the show begin!

751
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,200
Take a good look!

752
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,734
Isn't this fresh?

753
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,600
Aren't you excited?

754
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,533
Yes!

755
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,033
If you're excited, then I'm excited!

756
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:15,000
Happiness needs to be shared.

757
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,233
Take a bite of this tuna
and you'll know what happiness is!

758
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,567
Even when you're down and out,
happiness will come.

759
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,734
Okay!

760
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,300
Like this leftover flesh.

761
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,033
This part is absolutely delicious!

762
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,367
Your luck will begin to turn
after bad things go away.

763
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,266
The 100-yen deal
is only good for today!

764
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:39,467
Who wants some?

765
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,834
Me!

766
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,867
Me!

767
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,066
I want some!

768
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,834
Paper, rock, scissors then?

769
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,867
I'm going to be paper.

770
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,433
Paper, rock, paper!

771
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:58,300
I really put out paper!
Okay, one more time!

772
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Paper, rock, paper!

773
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,066
You all look so worried.
One more time!

774
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,166
Paper, rock, paper!

775
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,300
Excuse me.

776
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,934
Is Mr. Tsune out of the hospital?

777
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,900
Yes.

778
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,467
Do you know where he is?

779
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:32,967
He's over there.

780
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,066
Thank you.

781
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,066
Thank you very much.

782
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,133
Come on, Mr. Tsune.

783
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:45,166
Be careful not to overwork yourself.

784
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,600
I see you're working hard.

785
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:50,967
Since that time.

786
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,834
You were always so hard working.

787
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,433
Even on stormy days,

788
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,500
or snowy days,

789
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,800
you didn't complain at all.

790
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,533
Haruko.

791
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,734
You were my best pupil.

792
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,734
Mr. Tsune.

793
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:12,233
You should listen to your pupils.

794
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:13,567
What?

795
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,967
We can work again
when your injury is healed up.

796
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:20,667
There are many people
who want to see you perform.

797
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,667
Okay?

798
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,734
I guess you're right.

799
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Maybe I can put in a little more.

800
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,433
Yes, you can.

801
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,033
See you around, Mr. Tsune.

802
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,467
Sure.

803
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,066
Take care of yourself.

804
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:35,967
Okay. See you.

805
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:36,967
See you.

806
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,734
Omae!

807
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:52,700
Don't be startled.

808
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,300
Thanks for your help.

809
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,533
Thank you very much.

810
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:01,367
Kirishima will compensate you
for special overtime.

811
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:03,834
You can name your price.

812
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,567
I'm sorry,

813
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
but I don't want compensation.

814
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,233
Why not?

815
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Because I wasn't working.

816
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,400
I didn't do that for S &amp; F.

817
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,066
I did it for a friend.

818
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:23,467
A friend?

819
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,467
Yes.

820
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,600
A fellow temp worker,

821
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,467
Mr. Tsune.

822
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,400
But I thought you were a lone wolf.

823
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:39,633
Mr. Tsune and I
cannot allow sick days.

824
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,266
It's like walking on blades
every day.

825
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:49,200
It's natural for people like us
to help each other.

826
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,433
That's all I have to say.

827
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,867
What's taking her so long?

828
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:10,300
- She's late.
- The line's going to be long!

829
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:13,900
You're late.

830
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:15,700
I'm sorry.

831
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,567
I...

832
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I won't be going.

833
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:23,000
I've tried blending in with you all.

834
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,333
But I can't afford to be eating
2,000-yen lunches.

835
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:28,867
The truth is.

836
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:33,633
I was just lonely and didn't want to
eat lunch by myself.

837
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,633
But I'm going to try that from now.

838
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:47,867
Thanks for waiting.

839
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,100
Kuroiwa.

840
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,266
What are you treating us to today?

841
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,266
What should we eat?

842
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:53,066
- Thanks again.
- Chinese, maybe?

843
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,633
Hey...

844
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,633
I just want to thank you.

845
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:09,533
But...

846
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,100
Even before that,
I have to apologise.

847
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,800
I misunderstood you.

848
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:18,834
I mean...

849
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,033
My lack of trust for temp workers.

850
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,233
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:26,834
Please forgive me.

852
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,000
You saved me.

853
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,934
As I told our manager,

854
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:40,700
that wasn't work.

855
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,834
I heard from the manager.

856
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:47,033
He said that
you refused compensation?

857
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,166
If it wasn't for money...

858
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:55,567
Then...

859
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,233
I don't know why...

860
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,233
you'd go out of your way like that.

861
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,166
It got me thinking.

862
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,200
Maybe...

863
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,000
You did it for me?

864
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:20,500
No...

865
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:21,900
Anyways...

866
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,900
Thank you.

867
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,700
That's my bus.

868
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:18,433
"To be continued..."

869
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:24,300
The workplace is no place
for romance.

870
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,900
You know the girls
I've dated before.

871
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,600
She the total opposite.

872
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:32,600
So you're saying temp workers
will always stay poor?

873
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,200
Hold it right there, Miyuki Mori!
