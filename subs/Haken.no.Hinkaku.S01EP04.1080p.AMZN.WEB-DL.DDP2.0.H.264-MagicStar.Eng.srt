1
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:03,400
Excuse me.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
"Marunouchi North"

3
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:19,567
Sorry.

4
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm getting on.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,166
I'll call you.

6
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,567
Oh, I don't have your number.

7
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,166
Haruko.

8
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,533
Tomorrow is payday.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,567
Yes. So?

10
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,433
It's my first payday,
so I'm already excited.

11
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:56,433
My parents did so much for me.

12
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:59,300
So I think I'll send them a gift.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,734
I wonder what I should get them.

14
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,433
Mori, you care about your parents
a lot.

15
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,300
You'll face the reality tomorrow.

16
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,467
- What?
- The reality of a temp worker.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,467
The reality of a temp worker?

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,300
I'm so jealous of Satomi.

19
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,467
She must be
in her wedding dress by now.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You're in my way.

21
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:18,967
Sorry.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I'd like to hear your opinion

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,767
on marriage between an employee
and a temp worker.

24
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,734
Don't get married on a weekday.
It causes inconvenience to others.

25
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:29,633
Totally agreed.

26
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,633
That's not what I'm asking.

27
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,400
The venue only had an opening today,
and it's a lucky day today.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,934
So love between a permanent employee
and a temp...

29
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,700
You're in my way.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Sorry.

31
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,166
Ms Omae doesn't seem to like
this kind of topic.

32
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,867
Any woman past 30
hates this kind of topic.

33
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:55,967
You're in my way!

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Satomi, the bride, graduated
from Yamato Junior College

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
with outstanding grades.

36
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,567
She now works as a temp worker
for Global Staff Service.

37
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,400
She's building up her career
at various different companies.

38
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,367
- Such as S&amp;F...
- A temp?

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Masaki.

40
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,767
You never told me that.

41
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,433
We approved this marriage

42
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,834
because we thought she was
a proper permanent employee.

43
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you looking down on her?

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Your son, a permanent employee,

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
approached our daughter!

46
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,033
You're the MC, do something.

47
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,734
Do something? Like what?

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,367
It just started.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,367
All right.

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,333
You're the one who did...

51
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:36,567
Well...

52
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,367
It has been a wonderful reception.

53
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,166
But there's a change
in the programme.

54
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,500
The bride will now
go change her dress.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,300
So she'll step out for a bit.
Thank you for your understanding.

56
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,166
No!

57
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:54,767
I...

58
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,767
I don't want to go back in.

59
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,000
Satomi...

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,166
Let's talk after the reception.

61
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:03,767
- No, no, no!
- It'll all be fine.

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,533
The bride is crying
and refusing to come back in.

63
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:12,667
What do we do?

64
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:16,133
I can't believe this.
The reception will end soon.

65
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,633
Oh, good. They're here.

66
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,400
Huh?

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
She looks quite plain now.

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,967
Yeah, not even a dress?

69
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,033
Wait.

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,266
She looks familiar.

71
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,500
What?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Could it be?

73
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:52,900
That's Omae.

74
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,166
Omae.

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Turtleneck.

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,433
She's coming here.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,667
Is she angry?

78
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,433
She didn't need to come here.

79
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,834
What?

80
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,834
- Sir.
- Yes?

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,367
Here's the estimate
of the social expenses due today.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,834
Please approve and stamp this.

83
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,233
Sorry, but I don't
have my stamp with me.

84
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,200
I took it from your desk.

85
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,033
Please.

86
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,633
Sure.

87
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,400
Excuse me.

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,367
Thank you.

89
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:39,934
Oh, no.

90
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,400
She's coming this way.

91
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,533
- I'm sorry.
- Chief Satonaka?

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,700
- Yes?
- It's almost 6.

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,867
- Okay.
- Can I go home now?

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,834
- Sure.
- Please.

95
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,266
Excuse me.

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,033
Proud employees will fall.

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,834
Companies won't survive
without temp workers now.

98
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,667
For example, Haruko Omae here.

99
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:15,367
"Impossible" and "overtime"
are not in her dictionary.

100
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,934
She shuts down
all troublesome relationships

101
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,166
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,667
But why did the super temp worker,
Haruko Omae,

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,133
That's still a mystery.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,367
"The Pride Of The Temp"

106
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,300
The reception was a disaster.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
"Love and hourly wage"

108
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,066
So Takahashi didn't tell his parents
that he was marrying a temp?

109
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,333
Maybe he couldn't.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,233
His parents are brand-conscious.

111
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,834
He knew that they wouldn't
approve of the marriage.

112
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,767
Wow, this is shocking.

113
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,767
I had no idea temp workers
were seen that way.

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,734
We're just co-workers,
no one is superior than others.

115
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,133
That's right.

116
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,133
That's a naive way of thinking.

117
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,900
We live in a stratified society.

118
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:16,133
Employees look at the temp workers
who don't get bonuses

119
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,934
and feel better about themselves.

120
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,367
You don't want to go there.

121
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,100
I don't get a bonus, either.

122
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,533
Oh, wait.

123
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,800
What about you, the girl
with a 3,000-yen hourly wage?

124
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,867
Apparently, now she's getting paid
3,500 yen after the tuna incident.

125
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,800
What?

126
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,967
Inequality, superiority,
it doesn't matter.

127
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:37,700
Thanks to lazy permanent employees,
we temps get to work

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,066
and get to pay for our food.

129
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,300
Any problems?

130
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Come on, guys. Work.

131
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,166
Don't worry about it.

132
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:56,967
Was that about me?

133
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,333
Good morning.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,633
Good morning.

135
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,166
Did Takahashi manage to leave
on his honeymoon?

136
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:08,500
Yes, it appears that way.

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,166
That's good to hear.

138
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,367
Omae? Can you come here?

139
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,166
Yes?

140
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,467
About the tuna fileting show...

141
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,667
The executives heard about it.

142
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,100
They think it'd be a shame
to let you go after three months.

143
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:29,033
I also would like you to continue
working with us here.

144
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,834
As I explained at the beginning,

145
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,000
there will be no extension
to my contract.

146
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,767
Can you at least give it a thought?

147
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,166
At one point,

148
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,734
we want to hire you permanently.

149
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,166
It's not a bad idea for you, right?

150
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,800
I decline.

151
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

152
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,100
I don't want to be a slave
and be tied up to a company.

153
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,867
Is that everything?

154
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:00,667
Sure.

155
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,734
Excuse me.

156
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,500
Slave? She meant us?

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,700
She called us lazy earlier, too.
She says whatever she feels like.

158
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,467
She doesn't understand
the situation at all. Am I right?

159
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,767
- Right!
- You should go and yell at her.

160
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,400
Yeah, go for it.

161
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,633
What a snob.

162
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,433
All right.

163
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,233
Yes. That's our man.

164
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,834
All right.

165
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,500
Haruko Omae.

166
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Yes?

167
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,333
You know...

168
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,767
What?

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,667
You know what?

170
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,100
Just tell me what you want.
I'm busy.

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,934
That's fine if you're busy.

172
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,800
Hey, what's going on? Shoji?

173
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
What are you doing?

174
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,400
She said she's busy.

175
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,800
You go back to work now!

176
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,633
Everyone is so lazy here.

177
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,900
Why are we the ones
getting yelled at?

178
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,633
Welcome.

179
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,667
The croquette set menu, please.

180
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,200
Same for me, too.

181
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,467
Sometimes it's nice to eat
at a cheap place like this.

182
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,066
If you want to talk to Omae,
go ahead.

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,100
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,967
Oh, Turtleneck is here.

185
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,834
Don't pretend to act cool.

186
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,333
What?

187
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:48,700
Sorry.

188
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,967
But I saw it.

189
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:52,967
Saw what?

190
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,233
What do you mean, "what"?

191
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:55,800
You know...

192
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,133
You and Omae at the bus stop.

193
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,400
I don't know what happened.

194
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,900
She did the tuna fileting show,
which really saved me.

195
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,567
So I went to thank her.

196
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,467
Then...

197
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,300
it was like I was drawn to her.

198
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,300
Before I knew it,

199
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:20,333
I was doing that.

200
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,333
I see.

201
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,900
What?

202
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:26,367
Is that sexual harassment?

203
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:28,467
She's leaving.

204
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,767
Oh, hey.

205
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:32,934
You're here.

206
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,500
Omae.

207
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,100
- See you later.
- Hey.

208
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:38,533
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,400
I wanted to call you, but
I don't have your number.

210
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,567
Wait.

211
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:45,734
Could it be...

212
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,333
that you're angry at me?

213
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,400
Don't worry about it.

214
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:51,734
Okay, good.

215
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,633
That's good to know.

216
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,800
I'll give you my number.

217
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,066
It's hard to talk at work,

218
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
so call me.

219
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,834
Please don't worry about it, really.

220
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,667
Thank you.

221
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,767
I don't get it at all.

222
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,133
You know the type of girls
that I've dated, right?

223
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,800
Elegant girls who made me
look good.

224
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,633
Girls who had nice smiles.

225
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,934
She's the complete opposite.

226
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,734
That's right.

227
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,467
It's something new.
I'll make her mine.

228
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,266
Shoji.

229
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,367
Is that how you really feel?

230
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:51,700
Why are you mad?

231
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,967
Are you into her, too?

232
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,367
No, I'm not.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,033
Sixty days left...

234
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,867
I wonder how much money I got
for my first salary.

235
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,133
"Wage, Haken Life, 103,200"

236
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,400
No way.

237
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,533
You received your first salary?

238
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,600
Congrats.

239
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,033
I'm not happy.

240
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,767
What should I do?

241
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,467
That usually happens
in the first month.

242
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,567
We had many holidays
in January, too.

243
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,100
You knew that temps
get paid hourly, right?

244
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes, but after rent and utilities,

245
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,900
I won't make it to the next payday.

246
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,166
What should I do?

247
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,633
Samples will arrive at 4.

248
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,266
- Check it.
- Okay.

249
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,100
Here's your tea.

250
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,967
The Russian company, Michka,
will be here tomorrow at three.

251
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,533
Finally.

252
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,533
Omae.

253
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,033
Can you be my secretary tomorrow?

254
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,300
It's very important.

255
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,500
Please.

256
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,433
Understood.

257
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,767
I'll be in charge of the meeting.

258
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,567
You just need to sit there.

259
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,066
Look through this.

260
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,567
Do you need an interpreter?

261
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,734
No need.

262
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,633
I worked in Moscow for two years.

263
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,033
I see.

264
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,900
Haruko.

265
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,266
I have a favour to ask.

266
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,433
I decline.

267
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,834
I haven't said anything.

268
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,133
You don't have to say it.

269
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,467
Please.

270
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,333
Lend me some money.

271
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,200
I knew it.

272
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,600
I promised my landlord
that I'll pay after payday.

273
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,266
Then keep that promise.

274
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,333
But if I paid my rent,
I won't have money to live.

275
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll really go broke.

276
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,467
Then go broke.

277
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,467
How is it going?

278
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,467
How are Omae and Mori
from our agency?

279
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,633
Very good.

280
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,633
They're doing a great job.

281
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,300
Especially Omae.

282
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Glad to hear that.

283
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,767
About Omae...

284
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,633
Does she speak Russian?

285
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,767
One moment, please.

286
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,133
She doesn't have
certificates on Russian.

287
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:37,834
Okay.

288
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:38,800
That's fine.

289
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,133
What?

290
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,600
Well...

291
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,533
she tends to get bossy in fields
she's good at.

292
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,967
Not making us look good.

293
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,000
Sorry.

294
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,000
Please.

295
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,633
She hasn't called me.

296
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:57,700
What?

297
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,233
Can you give me her number?

298
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,033
I want to talk to her about work.

299
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,000
Well...

300
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,200
Sorry, but I can't.

301
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,166
It's personal information.

302
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,467
You can call me if it's urgent.

303
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:11,166
Should I call her?

304
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,900
Don't worry about it.

305
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,266
Okay.

306
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,166
How old is she?

307
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,967
I can't tell you.

308
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
- Please.
- Come on.

309
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:26,333
You know,
the harder you try to hide it,

310
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,967
the more I want to know.

311
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,700
Don't go too deep into this.

312
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,834
The most common problem with
temps is the pay.

313
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,567
And the second one

314
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,300
is erotic dramas with employees.

315
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,433
Are you all right, Hitotsugi?

316
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,600
[Foreign language]

317
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:50,467
[Foreign language]

318
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,433
[Foreign language]

319
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,066
You're serious about this.

320
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,266
Oh, yeah?

321
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,533
I haven't spoken
Russian in three years.

322
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,667
You need to impress Omae.

323
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,700
Oh, come on.

324
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,600
It's Azuma.

325
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,066
Hello?

326
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,333
What's up?

327
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,300
Do it tomorrow.

328
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:20,767
I'll hang up now.

329
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,734
Seriously?

330
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,367
Shoji?

331
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,300
Aren't you actually...

332
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,033
jealous of her?

333
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:34,867
What? Why?

334
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
When you see her,

335
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,300
it makes me question if
everything that I built until now

336
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,000
meant anything.

337
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,934
You know what I mean?

338
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,100
Yeah.

339
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,033
It feels like she's destroying

340
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,166
You're fine.

341
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,233
Competent girls like Omae

342
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,867
will surely find competent guys
like you attractive.

343
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,266
You're cheering me up?

344
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,734
If you're serious,

345
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,433
I've got your back.

346
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,734
Good luck with
the negotiation tomorrow.

347
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:24,734
Thanks.

348
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:28,567
Shoji.

349
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,867
Here are the samples.

350
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,500
Keep them in the freezer and
serve them in the meeting.

351
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,400
- Sure.
- Shoji.

352
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,333
Yes?

353
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,967
This is a research
on the Philippines.

354
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,834
The data is outdated.

355
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,166
I won't need it.

356
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,166
Thanks.

357
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,700
Put these in a locker.

358
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,734
Okay.

359
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,800
What are you doing?

360
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,834
- I'm sorry.
- The contract.

361
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:53,967
Find the contract.

362
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,800
Here it is.

363
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,033
- I'm sorry.
- Careful.

364
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,400
- I'm sorry.
- Clean this up.

365
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,400
It's time.

366
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,600
- Let's go meet them.
- All right.

367
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,567
Let's go.

368
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,600
- Omae, too. Let's go.
- Sure.

369
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,734
- Shoji, are you ready?
- Yes.

370
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,767
Let's go.

371
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,233
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,467
It's fine.

373
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:15,400
It's mixed up.

374
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,767
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,734

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,300
so put them in the shared locker.

384
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Understood.

385
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,467
- Here's the key.
- Okay.

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,066

- Yes.

Sure.

Omae is busy today.

- Sure.
- Thank you.

Shrimps from the Philippines
are that expensive?

They're saying that
our prices are very high.

402
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,300
This might get a bit tricky.

403
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,100
You only get 1,200 yen?

404
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
Why don't you sign up to my agency?

405
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,533
They might have higher paying jobs.

406
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,567
Can I do that?

407
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,800
Everyone does that.

408
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,000
- Right?
- Yeah.

409
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,233
Really?

410
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,333
I'm signed up with three agencies.

411
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,900
Are you really?

412
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:06,533
To the USA and Europe, we sell them

413

for 10 dollars per kilogram.

414
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:12,066
If you want to have business
with Russians,

415
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:17,400
you need to also consider
the domestic selling prices there.

416
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,834
It's fine.

417
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,266

418
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,633

Can you serve them coffee again?

00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,433
- Sure.
- See how it's going.

427
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Okay.

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,633
That's not possible...

429
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,266
The purchase price must
be a lot cheaper.

Our price includes human labour
and transportation.

companies out here.

No need for tea.

It's 6, so I'll leave now.

I was going to send them a gift,
but they're still helping me out.

Are you only working
with Haken Life?

I have one body, so one is enough.

462
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:40,133
Apparently they pay less
than other agencies.

463
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,033
You're complaining like
a real temp worker now.

464
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:49,734
You're lucky because you're so
skilled and have a high rate.

465
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,867
But getting certified costs money.

466
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,433
I don't have that kind of money.

467
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:59,900
I won't get a raise
anytime soon, either.

468
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,867
A poor temp worker can't
get out of being poor.

469
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:06,967
What?

470
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,000
Anything you want to say?

471
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,500
You're pretty but
you have terrible luck.

472
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,533
What?

473
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,133
Welcome.

474
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,767
Mori?

475
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,734
Hi there.

476
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,433
Wow, incredible.

477
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,200
This is no good...

478
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,066
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

479
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,166
Hey.

480
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,400
There's a guy who's my type.

481
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
A guy with curly hair.

482
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,266
I'll go upstairs now.

483
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,900
Haruko, Chief Satonaka
is asking for you.

484
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,166
I'm finished for the day.

485
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:37,066
It seems quite important.

486
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:41,734
Omae.

487
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:42,867
Please sit.

488
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,266
It's outside of my work hours.

489
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,433
What do you want?

490
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,600
Well, we wanted to
thank you for today.

491
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,266
I had no idea you speak
perfect Russian.

492
00:24:56,867 --> 00:25:00,600
Hitotsugi said that you didn't
have any Russian certificates.

493
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,633
I have so many certificates that
I couldn't list them all.

494
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,567
Is that so?

495
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:10,033
I did it as a part of my job.

496
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,600
There's no need for you to come here

497
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,233
and thank me for it.

498
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,967
Well...

499
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,233
You're right.

500
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,600
Omae...

501
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Shoji wanted to personally
thank you for it.

502
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:26,333
That's why he came.

503
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,533
Even outside the office,

504
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,600
we can still interact as people.

505
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,633
To be honest,

506
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,033
it's waste of time.

507
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,567
Really?

508
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:39,233
Shoji was waiting for you
to call him.

509
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,467
He wanted to see you.

510
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,400
Ken.

511
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,934
Instead of here,

512
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,767
can we talk outside?

513
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,467
I wanted to talk to you.

514
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,467
You always go home quickly

515
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:04,500
like you're running away.

516
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,734
Why didn't you...

517
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,467
It's cold, so I'll skip some parts

518
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,533
to the conclusion.

519
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:20,867
Do you like me?

520
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:22,467
Or no?

521
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,767
It's not about liking you
or not liking you.

522
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,000
What?

523
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,467
Let's ask a temp out
because they'll quit soon.

524
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,500
If it gets complicated, dump them.

525
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,300
I've seen many employees like that.

526
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,767
You think I'm like that?

527
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,800
Exactly.

528
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,900
Why are you like that?

529
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,233
Why are you so depressing?

530
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,967
You never smile at work.

531
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,467
But that actually makes
me more interested.

532
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,934
You know.

533
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,367
Open up to us more.

534
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,633
You told me that
I had no social skills.

535
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:03,500
Yes, I did. It's true.

536
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,200
So work on that.

537
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,867
Don't expect that on a temp.

538
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,266
- Why?
- Companies hire us temporarily

539
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,834
and buy our labour
in small quantities.

540
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:16,200
Being nice to people and smiling
are for permanent employees.

541
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,467
Are you serious?

542
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,400
Yes.

543
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,266
What the heck?

544
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,867
You're so twisted.

545
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,100
Who are you to say?
You're anti-temp.

546
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,100
Yes, I do hate temp workers.

547
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,633
But you're good.

548
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,567
You're a super temp.

549
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,500
I want to do good work with you.

550
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,300
Working together with someone

551
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,633
is the same as living with someone.

552
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:55,967
What are you talking about?

553
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,867
I'll be gone in two months.

554
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,333
So what?

555
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,700
My feelings might get
stronger in two months.

556
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,700
It's so cold.

557
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,800
They already emailed me.

558
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,667
"New job openings"

559
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,500
It's a job as a receptionist.

560
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,700
"Receptionist job"

561
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,600
It pays 1,800 yen per hour?

562
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,900
What should I do?

563
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,767
"1,800 yen per hour"

564
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,467
Hi, is this Kaori? It's Mori.

565
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,500
I was introduced to a job
with a great pay.

566
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:02,467
But the consultation is tomorrow.

567
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,734
I have to go to work,
so what should I do?

568
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:09,633
You can come up with an excuse
and take a day off.

569
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,500
Everyone does that.

570
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,400
Seriously?

571
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:20,033
1,800 yen per hour, huh...

572
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,333
All right.

573
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:26,467
Hello?

574
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,166
Everything okay, Mori?

575
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,567
Actually, my mum back home
suddenly fell ill.

576
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:34,567
Okay.

577
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:38,266
I want to go back to Gunma tomorrow.

578
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,266
Can I have a day off?

579
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,200
It's true. Please believe me.

580
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
I understand.

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,233
I've worked with many people.

582
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,000
I know you would never skip work.

583
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,367
You must be worried, then.

584
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,667
I'll call Chief Satonaka for you.

585
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,700
Sickness of family.

586
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,867
That was the sixth one I had today.

587
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,433
This isn't good.

588
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
So Mori will be taking
a day off today.

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,900
Should I send someone?

590
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,367
No, it's okay.

591
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,767
Omae is here.

592
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,266
Okay, thank you.

593
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,834
- Bye.
- You're good.

594
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,367
Omae.

595
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,967
Mori's mother fell ill.

596
00:30:59,066 --> 00:30:59,700
Really?

597
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,233
Fell sick, huh?

598
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,967
So please cover Mori's tasks today.

599
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,166
Thank you.

600
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,000
Understood.

601
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,767
That's Mori's seat.

602
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,734
What am I doing?

603
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,533
Sir, Chief Shoji is out sick today.

604
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay.

605
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:46,433
They have lots of sick days.

606
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:47,734
Sales Division.

607
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:49,633
Hello?

608
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:51,767
Omae?

609
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,233
It's upside down.

610
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,500
What am I doing?

611
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,133
Please wait just a second.

612
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,867
Director, it's Tatiana from Michka.

613
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,800
She keeps saying "Shoji, please."

614
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,734
She doesn't speak English
or Japanese.

615
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,800
Omae?

616
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,533
Please.

617
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,533
Hey!

618
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,633
Hello?

619
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:27,967
[Foreign language]

620
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,000
[Foreign language]

621
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,300
[Foreign language]

622
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,200
[Foreign language]

623
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:34,400
What?

624
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:38,800
She has to go back to Russia
right away,

625
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,400
so they want to sign the contract
by 3:00 this afternoon.

626
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,600
They'd like to get
the required documents.

627
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
That's not nice.

628
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,767
This is a huge deal.

629
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:49,800
Contract!

630
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,467
Hey.

631
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,166
- You have everything?
- Wait.

632
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,400
We're missing the invoice.

633
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Call Shoji now.

634
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,333
His phone is turned off.

635
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,934
Why is the invoice missing?

636
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,000
Look for it.

637
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,867
Oh, wait.

638
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:10,500
What is it, Satonaka?

639
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Maybe, back then...

640
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:15,233
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

641
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:16,633
Please.

642
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,967
It might be with old documents.

643
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,433
Mori has the key.

644
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,533
What?

645
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,333
It's at her desk.

646
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:36,700
We have no time.

647
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,333
Where is it?

648
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,300
It's not here.

649
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,233
It's not here.

650
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,433
Maybe she took it home.

651
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,700
Her, again?

652
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:46,433
Look for the spare.

653
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,734
Yes, the spare.

654
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,100
"Mr Hitotsugi"

655
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,300
Hello?

656
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Is this Mori's residence?

657
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,867
I'm Hitotsugi from Haken Life.

658
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,300
Is Miyuki there?

659
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,467
There's an emergency
at the company she works for.

660
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,633
I'm sorry to bother you
when her mother is ill.

661
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:37,867
You're her mother?

662
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,233
You're fine?

663
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,533
All right, I see.

664
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,834
I wonder how Mori's consultation
is going.

665
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,433
It pays 1,800 yen per hour.

666
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,633
Receptionists are that well paid?

667
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:55,166
So that's what this is about.

668
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,767
Hi, Omae.

669
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,867
Where's the company
that pays 1,800 yen?

670
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,967
Tell me!

671
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,266
I'll borrow this.

672
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,367
Hey!

673
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,834
Wait!

674
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,700
My name is Miyuki Mori.
Nice to meet you.

675
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,934
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

676
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:28,600
Miyuki Mori there.

677
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:29,934
Wait.

678
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,233
Haruko?

679
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,367
I have a consultation now.

680
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,767
Please don't stop me.

681
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
The key.

682
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,066
The key?

683
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:45,000
You have the key of the locker,
right?

684
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,200
Hand it to me.

685
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,567
Now!

686
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:48,633
Okay.

687
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,767
Well...

688
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,934
Here it is!

689
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:55,700
Haruko?

690
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,233
You're burning up.

691
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,467
You're running a high fever!

692
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,367
Haruko!

693
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,233
Omae.

694
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,567
Where have you been?

695
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,200
Out of my way.

696
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,200
It's the key.

697
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,033
It opened.

698
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,333
What?

699
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,767
This is it.

700
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,767
Yes, the invoice!

701
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,100
All the documents are here now.

702
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,867
Yes!

703
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:06,867
Yes! We did it!

704
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,700
They're here.

705
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
This way, please.

706
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:19,967
Welcome.

707
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:21,900
This way.

708
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:28,967
Didn't you pass my car?

709
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,033
Yes. So?

710
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Hey, Mum?

711
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,400
Thank you for the money.

712
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Hello?

713
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:51,467
Miyuki.

714
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,467
What are you doing?

715
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,900
What?

716
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,367
I'm just working.

717
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,266
Earlier, I got a phone call
from your agency.

718
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,633
Mr Hitotsugi called me.

719
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,433
I'm sorry for making up that lie,
Mum.

720
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:17,100
But everyone does it.

721
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,300
Miyuki.

722
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:20,400
Are you healthy?

723
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,467
Are you eating well?

724
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,533
I'm worried about you.

725
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:31,800
If it's too hard for you,
you can always come home.

726
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,133
Omae.

727
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:52,433
Nice work today as always.

728
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,333
Nice work.

729
00:38:58,467 --> 00:38:59,467
Mori.

730
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,333
Is your mother okay?

731
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,066
I'm sorry.

732
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:10,700
That was...

733
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,000
actually a lie.

734
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,200
What?

735
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I'm sorry.

736
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Haruko?

737
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,066
You had a high fever.
Are you okay now?

738
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:31,467
Omae.

739
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:36,967
- Haruko.
- Omae.

740
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,767
Ms Haruko, are you okay?

741
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:39,834
Omae!

742
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,000
She's such a troublesome girl.

743
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,433
She went to work
with a 39-degree fever.

744
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,934
I'm sorry for the trouble.

745
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,033
No problem.

746
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,767
If Omae didn't come to work,

747
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,600
it would've been a disaster.

748
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,066
It's my fault.

749
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,166
I made her work so hard.

750
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,367
What am I doing?

751
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:15,433
Miyuki.

752
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,800
Don't be so hard on yourself.

753
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,934
Haruko, too,

754
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:25,500
started with a cashier's job
that only paid 600 yen an hour.

755
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,233
What?

756
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:31,300
What do you think she did
to get to this point?

757
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,433
Never in her life,

758
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,266
she has broken promises.

759
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,233
No matter how hard her job was,

760
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,934
she never ran away from it
during the three months contract.

761
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,834
She often said,

762
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,700
"Once you run away,

763
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,533
you will always run away
from your problems."

764
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:00,500
"Curly Hair's phone number"

765
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,934
Working together is the same thing
as living together.

766
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:11,233
My feelings might get stronger
in two months.

767
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,467
Haruko.

768
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,000
Are you feeling better?

769
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,934
You need to get better on weekends,
or you'll lose people's trust.

770
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:39,834
Understood.

771
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,667
And your 1,800-yen
receptionist's job?

772
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:46,000
I didn't take it.

773
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,700
They refused you?

774
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,834
That's not true.

775
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:55,700
It was stupid of me to do that
because I thought everyone did it.

776
00:42:56,967 --> 00:43:00,800
Temps are looked down upon
because they do things like that.

777
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,800
I'll work hard for 1,200 yen.

778
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,467
My goal is a contract renewal
in two months.

779
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,934
You look like you're in bad shape.

780
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:21,100
Are you all right?

781
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,433
I caught something terrible.

782
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:26,166
Good morning.

783
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:27,967
- Morning.
- Good morning.

784
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,967
Good morning.

785
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:31,800
Omae.

786
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,433
While I was out sick,

787
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,533
I heard that you managed
to get the contract signed.

788
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:45,367
It was Director Kirishima
who got the contract signed. So?

789
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,333
Well...

790
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:49,200
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

791
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,834
The first meal we'll share together.

792
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,333
How about puffer fish?

793
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:00,567
Puffer fish?

794
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:01,633
You hate it?

795
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,300
I love it to death.

796
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:04,600
That's good.

797
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,133
- So...
- I don't want to eat it with you.

798
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:08,133
What?

799
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,967
Why?

800
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,967
I just don't want to, even if
I'm paid 30 million yen per hour.

801
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,166
Wait a minute.

802
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,200
Just so you know...

803
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,433
that thing happened between us,

804
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,834
and you said you weren't angry.

805
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,734
If there's a fly, flying around

806
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:27,834
and it happens to land on your lips,

807
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,066
would anyone be angry with the fly?

808
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,133
- A fly?
- Yes.

809
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
A fly.

810
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,633
Wait!

811
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,967
If I was a fly,

812
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:51,000
you'd be a telephone pole.

813
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:52,433
I just happened to

814
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:55,500
bump into a telephone pole.

815
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:56,667
Calm down, Shoji.

816
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:57,633
Don't stop me.

817
00:44:57,834 --> 00:44:59,200
She said I was a fly!

818
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,767
Nobody likes you.

819
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,300
You, Turtleneck!

820
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,567
Telephone pole!

821
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,200
- Are you all right?
- Of course not!

822
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:07,967
Fever's going up.

823
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:15,667
That idiot.

824
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:24,033
Turtleneck is beating up Ogasawara!

825
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:25,900
His contract won't be renewed.

826
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:27,000
Ogasawara?

827
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,834
A temp can't tell me to fire him.

828
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:30,333
It was their decision.

829
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:34,000
Taking care of a lost old man
isn't included in my contract.

830
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:35,300
Turtleneck!
