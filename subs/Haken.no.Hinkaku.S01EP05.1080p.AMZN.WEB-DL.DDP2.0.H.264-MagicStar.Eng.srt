1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,633
"Toshima Ward"

2
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,066
Hey.

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,333
What are you doing, Haruko?

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,533
I just woke someone asleep. Problem?

5
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,233
- What?
- Shoji!

6
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:36,567
Can I talk to you?

7
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:37,867
What?

8
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:41,800
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,266
Oh, look.

10
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,400
Ogasawara is using a computer.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Maybe he's half-asleep?

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,500
- What are you doing?
- No, I'm not half-asleep.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,934
HR told me there's an email.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,934
Or something like that.
How does this work?

15
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,900
You've never checked
internal emails?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,533
Not at all.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,367
Ogasawara.

18
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,433
Let's turn on the computer first.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,133
Oh yeah, I need to turn on
my computer first.

20
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:11,467
- No.
- I see.

21
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,333
- Don't do it.
- Hey, Mori?

22
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:16,700
How can I turn on my computer?
Can you tell me?

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,533
Sure.

24
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,533
Here's how you do it.

25
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,266
This is it. You press here.

26
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,133
Oh, you press there?

27
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,667
Wow, great!

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,900
Shige...I mean Ogasawara

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,367
used to be a great salesman.

30
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:37,200
We joined the company
the same year.

31
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,900
We inspired each other
to work harder.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,800
We were like

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,834
you and Shoji.
We hung out together all the time.

34
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,633
He's really a great guy.

35
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,300
Yes.

36
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,100
But a company needs
more than a nice guy.

37
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,266
We won't renew his contract
that's coming up next month.

38
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,433
Hard for me to tell him,

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,700
so you tell him as his chief.

40
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,133
Sir.

41
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,200
Please.

42
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,066
At least for another year?

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,166
HR has decided it.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,400
Hurry.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,100
People from the NTA are here
with the accounting team.

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,600
It's so complicated every year.

47
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:34,700
Yeah.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Is everything okay, Shoji?

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,066
No problem.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,867
Satonaka.

51
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,200
Do what you need to do, okay?

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,467
Yes...

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,166
What's up?

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Well...

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,166
- It looks--
- Shoji!

56
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,433
- Yes.
- Let's go.

57
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,367
Okay.

58
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,500
We'll talk later?

59
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,066
Click there!

60
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,567
To this part,

61
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,600
please move the mouse.

62
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,133
Ogasawara?

63
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,100
I'm moving my mouth.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,734
Stop that or I won't teach you.

65
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,333
Oh, sorry.

66
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,967
I want to move it a little higher.

67
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:17,967
In that case...

68
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,667
Go! Make an attack! Move forward!

69
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,533
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,834
Sorry, Haruko. I'll pick them up.

71
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,834
This is not a computer
class for the elderly.

72
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes, you're right.

73
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,367
But please be easy on me.

74
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,133
Proud employees will have a fall.

75
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,967
Companies won't survive without
temp workers now.

76
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,867
For example, Haruko Omae here.

77
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,266
"Impossible" and "overtime"
are not in her dictionary.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,333
She shuts down all
troublesome relationships

79
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:04,367
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

80
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,967
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

81
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,667
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

82
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,233
That's still a mystery.

83
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:23,367
"The Pride Of The Temp"

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,900
"Hourly wage invader &amp;
Mr. Sea Cucumber"

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,934
Being a temp must be easy.
No need to deal with taxes.

86
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey.

87
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,533
I saw you bullying
Ogasawara earlier.

88
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:40,700
What?

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,867
If he's asleep, wake him up gently.

90
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:48,266
I'm not a certified home care nurse.

91
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,633
I'm not asking you to be his nurse.
Just treat him with respect.

92
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:56,900
Did your parents throw erasers
at you to wake you up?

93
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,500
Why so quiet?

94
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,266
Why not do the usual?

95
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,066
I'm Haruko Omae.

96
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,767
What are you doing?

97
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,100
All by yourself.

98
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,100
Do things like that on your own.

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,667
I don't have time
to play with a fly.

100
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,433
Don't you ever call me a fly!

101
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,066
I'm going to grab you by
your turtleneck sweater.

102
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,266
Shoji.

103
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:25,266
Is this a good time to talk to you?

104
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:31,500
Kirishima and HR
are being too cruel.

105
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,333
Why Ogasawara, and not a temp?

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,967
Shoji.

107
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,300
I...

108
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,467
I don't know what to do.

109
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,200
Pull yourself together.

110
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,900
We can't lose another
senior colleague.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,633
If you see a promising project,

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,367
give it to him.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,734
Get results no matter what.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,433
We need to prove that Ogasawara
is indispensable

115
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,133
to this company.

116
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,133
That's all you can do.

117
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,433
You're right.

118
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,100
A promising project, huh?

119
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:40,333
Sorry, I woke up late and
didn't have breakfast.

120
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:43,900
Crab and mayonnaise?

121
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:47,667
That's such a strange thing to put
in a rice ball.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,567
The best rice balls are
the ones with just salt.

123
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,066
My grandpa loves that, too.

124
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,900
Me, too.

125
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,767
Right? But you can't
find them easily at stores.

126
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:02,433
There're usually strange ingredients
inside, like mayonnaise.

127
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:05,633
I'm picky, so those are no--

128
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:09,133
Sorry, I'm being loud.

129
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,200
Did you manage to
check your emails?

130
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,000
No, not yet.

131
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,000
Alright.

132
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,133
Stop right there.

133
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,433
That's it, Ogasawara.

134
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,633
Let's do that.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,567
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,900
Salted rice balls.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,033
Let's make a proposal.

138
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,200
I see.

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,100
When I eat rice balls with fillings
and side dishes

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,166
I sometimes can't tell
what I'm eating.

141
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,333
With salted rice balls, we can set
the price low as there's no filling.

142
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,533
Instead, we use
high grade rice and salt

143
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,600
to differentiate from others.

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,767
Let's do a research.

145
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,533
A research on rice balls?

146
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,467
Exactly.

147
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,600
Can you go with him, Omae?

148
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,367
I'm working on something else now.

149
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,166
You can do that later.

150
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,433
Asano and I'll check
convenience stores.

151
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,900
You two check department stores.

152
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,033
Understood.

153
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,133
Let's go.

154
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:58,700
Ogasawara.

155
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:00,433
- Let's do our best.
- Yes.

156
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,700
Let's go.

157
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,867
Alright!

158
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,500
Department stores are fun.

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,433
It's not fun for me.

160
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,433
This one.

161
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,233
Are you still angry at me?

162
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,300
I like this.

163
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,600
Nice.

164
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,367
Well, I honestly...

165
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,867
can't bring myself
to trust computers.

166
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:35,767
In the old times, we used to write
everything down by hands.

167
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,834
I liked that because it really
felt like we were doing a job.

168
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:39,667
I see.

169
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,266
Up to about 10 years ago,

170
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,533
we wrote everything by hand,
including sales slips.

171
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,433
I liked those times.

172
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:53,033
People felt connected, not
in a superficial way like now.

173
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,667
Now, even toys for kids
look like this.

174
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,433
My grandkids love these things.

175
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:03,767
Welcome.

176
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,133
Ogasawara?

177
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,066
Why isn't he here?

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,066
Cool.

180
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,333
I'll send you a quote
once we get back.

181
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,300
- Thank you.
- Haruko Omae.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,033
Haruko Omae.

183
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,300
This is an announcement
for a lost person.

184
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,333
Shigeru Ogasawara,

185
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,400
62 years old

186
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,100
is waiting for you
at the service counter.

187
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,400
Hey.

188
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,133
Go back to the office.

189
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,367
Alright.

190
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,266
Hey.

191
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,033
Why aren't you looking for
Ogasawara?

192
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm doing my job.

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,133
is currently lost.

196
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,233
Please come to the service counter
on the second floor right away.

197
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,600
Why aren't you going?

198
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,066
Taking care of an lost old man
isn't included in my contract.

199
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,367
Don't call him old.

200
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,433
Ogasawara...

201
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,300
is in trouble now.

202
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,100
Never mind.

203
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,500
It's none of your business.

204
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,200
Okay, I've got work to do,
so will you excuse me?

205
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,266
Tell the lost man
that I left early.

206
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,200
Bye.

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,500
This is done.

211
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,400
Already?

212
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,166
Thank you.

213
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,133
Omae?

214
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,567
Ogasawara isn't back yet.

215
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,133
I had a task to finish
so I left before him.

216
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm back.

217
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,500
Welcome back.

218
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,567
I got lost in the department store.

219
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,500
What?

220
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
You got lost?

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Shoji came to my rescue.

222
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,400
He's very nice, unlike this lady.
He helped me out.

223
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,467
Ken.

224
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,967
She didn't do anything about him
and left early.

225
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,467
She didn't do anything?

226
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,633
You need to act fast.

227
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,967
Yeah.

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Here's Ogasawara's proposal.

229
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,567
I'll show it to the director.

230
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,400
It's looking good.

231
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:47,834
Just hurry, okay?

232
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,100
Mori, have you finished entering
the convenience store data?

233
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,300
Yes, it's done.

234
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,233
You can work much faster now.

235
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,900
- That's true.
- No, I'm not fast at all.

236
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,433
It's easy for young people
to remember things.

237
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,700
Some do forget, though.

238
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:03,967
Hey, that's enough.

239
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,433
Don't worry, she's right.

240
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:11,333
At this rate, you guys will treat me
like an oversized garbage

241
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,233
and throw me out on a trash day.

242
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,333
What are you talking about,
Ogasawara?

243
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,600
That's not true at all.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
Because he got lost,
I didn't get to eat.

245
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,667
My stomach is growling. Problem?

246
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,367
Sorry, I didn't notice it.

247
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,567
Go get lunch.

248
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay.

249
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,266
Omae.

250
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,934
I'm going to lunch now.
Can I join you?

251
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:47,767
Sir.

252
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,834
Can you take a look at
this proposal right away?

253
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:51,800
Alright.

254
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,200
You come with us, then.

255
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:54,967
Sure.

256
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,800
Alright.

257
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,700
Help yourself to anything.

258
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,233
I'm not eating here.

259
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,700
Why?

260
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,867
For permanent employees,
the curry is 350 yen.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,633
But for us, it's 700 yen,
which is double.

262
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,367
Why didn't you say that sooner?

263
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,266
I'll pay for your food here.

264
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,266
No, thank you.

265
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:25,800
By the way, sir.

266
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,367
What do you want?

267
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,166
It's just between you and me.

268
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,800
What do you think of Ogasawara?

269
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Are you asking a temp
to evaluate an employee?

270
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,767
For you, who's from outside,

271
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,133
you can give us objective opinions

272
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,734
without getting emotional.

273
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,133
It's not my concern.

274
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,000
But if you want
my opinion as a temp,

275
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,400
Ogasawara is...

276
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,367
nothing but a burden
to our Marketing Section.

277
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,567
I see.

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Sir.

279
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,133
Is that all you wanted to ask?

280
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,133
I'm so hungry that
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

281
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,967
Please excuse me.

282
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:22,600
Sir.

283
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,133
Please take a look at this.

284
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,166
It's Ogasawara's proposal.

285
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,800
"New Product 'Salted Rice Balls'"

286
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,300
I understand how you feel.

287
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,400
But it's better to tell him soon.

288
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm sure that they'll approve
your rice ball proposal.

289
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,734
I'm sure my grandpa would love it
once it's launched.

290
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,600
I hope so.

291
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,000
I love my grandpa.

292
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,333
And he reminds me of you a little.

293
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,533
Is that so?

294
00:14:55,867 --> 00:15:00,467
You're like my granddaughter, too.
I'm happy I get to work with you.

295
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,900
Let's take good care of ourselves.

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,834
Yeah,.

297
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,600
Ogasawara.

298
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,800
Never retire.
It'd be cool not to.

299
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:13,233
I can't say that
I am good at my job.

300
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,934
But I can say that
I love this company.

301
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,333
See you later.

302
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,567
See you tomorrow.

303
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,767
Bye.

304
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
She's an invader
pretending to be a temp.

305
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,934
Ogasawara is
an experienced worker.

306
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,767
Why is a temp asking us to fire him?

307
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,700
It's unacceptable, Ken!

308

"Cafe Cantente"

309
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,033
Not dancing tonight?

310
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,300
I've got a bad feeling.

311
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,333
Really?

312
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,433
Welcome.

313

Thank you for the other day.

314
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:47,834
The other day?

315
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,066
Well...

316
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,533
Come on.

317
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,500
We're not drinking tonight.

318
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,700
Hey.

319
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,633
Shoji.

320
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,133
Talk calmly.

321
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,300
That seems impossible.

322
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,934
He has some sort of a grudge
against me.

323
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,900
A grudge? About what?

324
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,934
I can't dare to say that.

325
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:08,934
Hey.

326
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,166
Don't make it sound
like you turned me down on a date.

327
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,867
Is that what happened?

328
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,066
What's so funny?

329
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,500
I don't like you.

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,500
Shoji.

331
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,233
Okay, be calm.

332
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,500
These are on the house.

333
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
No need to do that.

334
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,433
Please have a seat.

335
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:26,767
Thank you.

336
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,100
I'll just have one glass.

337
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,300
Let's make a toast.

338
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,033
Nobody seems to be up for a toast.

339
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,400
You're ripping us off with
your 3,000-yen plus hourly wage.

340
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,867
That's why Ogasawara
is going to be laid off.

341
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,767
Also, what did you say
to Director Kirishima?

342
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
The company is laying off people?

343
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,066
- Yes.
- I knew it.

344
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,133
You knew it?

345
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,100
If Ogasawara is a burden,

346
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,333
you're an wage invader.

347
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,300
Yes, I am. So what?

348
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,834
A temp should just do their job.

349
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,266
Stay out of the HR matters
of employees.

350
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,834
Permanent employees
are so hard to deal with.

351
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,066
Yeah,. Can you make these flies
go away?

352
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,867
Don't flirt with each other
when I'm talking seriously!

353
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,333
He does have a grudge.

354
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,967
Can't you feel empathy for others

355
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,367
or be sad for others
when they're sad?

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,433
Can't you do that at all?

357
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,633
So?

358
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,533
If you were ever dying,

359
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,066
there'd be nobody in the world
who'd save you.

360
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,500
It's fine. I can live by myself.

361
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Right, because you're
a telephone pole standing alone.

362
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,800
That's enough!

363
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,133
Shoji.

364
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,200
Why are we here for?

365
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,367
Tomorrow, I'll have to

366
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,967
give Ogasawara the news.

367
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,700
That his contract won't be renewed.

368
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,066
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,300
This won't be a problem

370
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,567
for people like you
who can live alone.

371
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,333
But Ogasawara has a family.

372
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,166
He told me the other day,

373
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,867
that he hates rush hours

374
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,500
but it doesn't feel bad when
he thinks about his family.

375
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,800
He's a great person.

376
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:32,333
You don't have a right
to call him a burden.

377
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,967
As a temp,

378
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,900
every three months

379
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,567
we face the fear
of getting laid off.

380
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,233
He thought the company
would be easy on him

381
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,967
and didn't push himself harder.

382
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:54,934
Maybe, next time

383
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,800
you might be the ones
getting laid off.

384
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,033
Haruko.

385
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,834
When you're arguing with those two,

386
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,400
you seem to be having fun.

387
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,600
Impossible.

388
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,100
What is this about, Chief?

389
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:50,567
Official meetings like this
make me nervous.

390
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,400
- Please sit.
- Thanks.

391
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:58,734
Ogasawara.

392
00:19:58,834 --> 00:19:59,700
Yes?

393
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,867
This is all due to my inadequacy.

394
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,934
They didn't approve
the salted rice ball proposal?

395
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:10,100
It's fine, don't worry about it.

396
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,433
You have a lot on
your shoulders, Chief.

397
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,633
You're so young and
you're in a managing position.

398
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,033
If you ever want to talk,

399
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,867
talk to me anytime.

400
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,233
Thank you.

401
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
Despite how I might appear to you,

402
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,467
with Kiri...

403
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,934
I mean with Director Kirishima,

404
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,867
we have strong friendship.

405
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Ogasawara.

406
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,567
We won't be able to renew
your contract.

408
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,433
What?

409
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,400
Are you talking about me?

410
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,233
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,767
Okay, so that's what this was about.

412
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,834
I wasn't expecting this.

413
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,233
It's fine.

414
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,867
Please raise your head.

415
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, wow.

416
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
This was so unexpected
that now I'm hungry.

417
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:19,033
It's a bit early, but can I take
a lunch break now?

418
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,400
- Sure.
- Great.

419
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,967
Please excuse me.

420
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,166
Excuse me.

421
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,233
Satonaka.

422
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,967
I heard that
Ogasawara is leaving.

423
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,667
Ogasawara is?

424
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,767
Is that true, Chief?

425
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,233
He'll stay until his contract ends.

426
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,700
So until the end of this month?

427
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,333
This can't be helped.

428
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,734
He's getting old.

429
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,333
And he hasn't been very helpful.

430
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,500
That's true.

431
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:23,266
With this many temps, it leaves
no tasks for Ogasawara.

432
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,300
Haruko.

433
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,867
Is this my fault?

434
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:47,367
Is it because I've been taking over
Ogasawara's tasks?

435
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,333
Is that why?

436
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,533
Don't be arrogant!

437
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,000
He never got anything done.

438
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:57,633
You all need to learn some skills
to keep your job at this company.

439
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,967
You're all like sea cucumbers.

440
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,867
Sea cucumbers?

441
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,233
What did she just say?

442
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,567
Shoji.

443
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,500
Yes?

444
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,033
We're in trouble.

445
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:12,867
Come to Accounting with me.

446
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,300
It's the NTA?

447
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,066
True.

448
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:20,633
Omae isn't all wrong.

449
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,700
What?

450
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,700
He's just sitting around all day and
getting paid double of what we get.

451
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:27,900
Double?

452
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,233
Or even more,
compared to you.

453
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,900
Really?

454
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,200
Yeah,.

455
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,100
Ogasawara is impressive.

456
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,767
But he's like a sea cucumber.

457
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,133
Welcome.

458
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,100
Are you not feeling well?

459
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:05,600
Your white rice

460
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:06,967
is getting cold.

461
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,166
What?

462
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,400
No, I'm feeling fine.

463
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, let's eat.

464
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,200
We need the delivery receipts for
the flour deal we had in 1999.

465
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,400
What? Now? That's impossible.

466
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,100
What are we going to do?

467
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,600
It should be somewhere,
so look for it.

468
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,667
Tax inspectors are here.

469
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,033
This is like a movie.

470
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,834
Yeah, they've been here for
an inspection since yesterday.

471
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,567
It's about the settlement in 1999.

472
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,333
They're suspecting a fraud.

473
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,567
Slips were hand-written

474
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,467
and were put away somewhere.

475
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,233
We need to submit it to
Accounting by five o'clock.

476
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,300
They're panicking.

477
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,367
It doesn't concern us at all.

478
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,767
- I like this.
- You guys are awful.

479
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,967
Who is she to tell us that?

480
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:12,266
In our section, please continue
your tasks as usual.

481
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,700
Okay.

482
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,033
Ogasawara.

483
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,767
Where did he go?

484
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,200
I...

485
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:33,100
I feel better just by looking at
Ogasawara sitting there.

486
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,400
Me, too.

487
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,133
He did a lot for me
when I joined the company.

488
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,834
When I broke the coffee server,

489
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,834
he was very worried for me.

490
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,300
When I'm working with Ogasawara

491
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,967
I forget that I'm a temp.

492
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,467
He's nice to everyone regardless
of their employment status.

493
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:58,734
Chief?

494
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,367
Can you do something about it?

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,700
Ogasawara told me that
he loves the company.

496
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,934
I haven't given up, either.

497
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,300
Before his contract ends,

498
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:16,567
if Ogasawara can do something
that will change the HR's mind...

499
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:18,767
Chief.

500
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
That's right.

501
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,400
Enough with talking.
Get back to work.

502
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:23,967
Seriously?

503
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,400
Omae.

504
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Nothing is guaranteed for anybody.

505
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,500
We all need to protect ourselves.

506
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,633
That's why Chief did
what the director told him

507
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,734
and told Ogasawara
about his contract termination.

508
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:39,900
But I want to help him.

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,033
Chief?

510
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,266
If you can't do anything,
then just sit there.

511
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,967
Until retirement,

512
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,100
protect only yourself.

513
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,367
That seems to

514
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,667
fit you perfectly.

515
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,867
Being an employee isn't easy.

516
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Thank you.

517
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,867
Welcome.

518
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,633
Haruko.

519
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,033
The lunch break

520
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:25,400
is over now.

521
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,567
Wait.

522
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,166
What are you doing, Omae?
Stop that.

523
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,567
Ken.

524
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,900
We still can't find the receipts.

525
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,300
Can you help us?

526
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,667
Alright, let's go.

527
00:27:58,767 --> 00:27:59,934
- Let's go.
- Basement.

528
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,934
All of you.

529
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,066
Okay.

530
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:07,633
Hitotsugi.

531
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,967
What's going on?

532
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,000
Chief Satonaka.

533
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,467
We're in trouble.

534
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,066
What happened?

535
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,467
I'm sorry.

536
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,867
Omae...

537
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,400
Omae? What about her?

538
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:22,333
Omae is now completely
out of control!

539
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,400
Please calm down.

540
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:26,233
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,500
Of all things, I witnessed her
assaulting Ogasawara.

542
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,700
then dragging him into an elevator.

543
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:36,300
What?

544
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,834
This must be a mistake.

545
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,934
Assault? In an elevator?

546
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm terribly sorry.

547
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,233
She got off on
this floor but I lost her.

548
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,533
What is she, a rebel?

549
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,333
I knew something
like this would happen.

550
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,767
They're not on this shelf.

551
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,667
Just where are they?

552
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,033
Ogasawara? Are you okay?

553
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,667
Where are you?

554
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:00,600
Ogasawara!

555
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,233
Answer me, Turtleneck.

556
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
- Ogasawara.
- No violence.

557
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,633
Hurry up. We'll be out of time.

558
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,800
Turtleneck is beating up
Ogasawara.

559
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Turtleneck!

560
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,600
- Turtleneck!
- Ogasawara

561
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,066
Omae, please stop.

562
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,166
Turtleneck.

563
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:26,300
Here are the receipts from
the flour deal we had in 1999.

564
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,533
What?

565
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,166
In the old days,

566
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,900
I used to come down here often.

567
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,967
What?

568
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,900
Why is everyone here?

569
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,300
Ogasawara.

570
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,767
Are you working here?

571
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:43,400
When she dragged me down here,

572
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,166
I didn't know what to do.

573
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,667
Here.

574
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,367
You need these, right?

575
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,400
"Delivery notes"

576
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,533
You're impressive, Ogasawara.

577
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,133
- Ogasawara.
- Ogasawara.

578
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,867
Now, will you excuse me?

579
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,834
Shoji.

580
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,233
Let's hurry.

581
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,734
Thank you very much.

582
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:12,700
You're welcome.

583
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,433
Sort them by months.

584
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,333
I'll verify with the total.

585
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,066
We only have one hour. Let's do it.

586
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes.

587
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:29,266
Hey, you. This isn't correct.

588
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,233
The total should be this.

589
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,800
You can't read
handwritten documents?

590
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,700
Can you check this, too?

591
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,934
Sure, let me see.

592
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,066
Alright.

593
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:38,967
In 1999...

594
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,967
Sort these by month, too.

595
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,700
Here you go.

596
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,000
There.

597
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,300
We did it.

598
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah,.

599
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,967
Alright, Ken.

600
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,900
Bring it to the 10th floor.

601
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,834
Okay.

602
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,967
Ogasawara.

603
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,033
Yes?

604
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,967
Come with me.

605
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,500
No, I shouldn't come.

606
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,100
They might have questions.

607
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,400
Only you know the answers.

608
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,000
It has to be you, Ogasawara.

609
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,166
Understood.

610
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's go.

611
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,834
Chief Satonaka.

612
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,633
Thank you for making the last days
of my career so wonderful.

613
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,433
Not the last days.

614
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:56,967
Ogasawara, you are...

615
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,667
needed at this company.

616
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:01,900
Well...

617
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:05,500
For us, too.

618
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,367
You mean a lot to us.

619
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:21,967
That box.

620
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,533
Can I carry it?

621
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:25,967
Of course.

622
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,567
It's stopped?

623
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,800
It is stopped.

624
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:52,834
What?

625
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,033
What's going on?

626
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:58,667
Excuse me.

627
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:00,433
Excuse me.

628
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:02,667
What's going on?

629
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,200
The two are trapped in the elevator.

630
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,400
What?

631
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,667
The repairing company
is on their way.

632
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,400
It'll take another 30 minutes.

633
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,133
We won't make it in time.

634
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,233
Let's go check.

635
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,200
Yeah,.

636
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,300
Please wait for 30 minutes.

637
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:23,100
Our employees are trapped in
an elevator with the documents.

638
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:24,600
Is it another fraud?

639
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
No, it's not.

640
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,200
You can go look.

641
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:31,033
Five o'clock is your deadline.

642
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,867
If you can't provide us with
the documents by then,

643
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,467
we'll report you to the police.

644
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,200
How much longer will it take?

645
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,400
What are you doing?

646
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,700
Sorry.

647
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
Hey!

648
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Control panel errors?

649
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:52,567
We haven't checked it yet.

650
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,834
"Elevator 1"

651
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,834
"16th floor Elevator Hall"

652
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,900
Give me the key to
the emergency exit.

653
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,000
Where are you going?

654
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,433
Hey!

655
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,567
We don't have much time until five.

656
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,467
Isn't the repair company here yet?

657
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,800
Omae!

658
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,033
Are you...

659
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,367
...also a certified ninja?

660
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,467
Stop talking and do what I tell you.

661
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,400
Does she have a certificate
on handling elevators?

662
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,233
Yes, she has
the elevator inspection certificate.

663
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,133
Thank you.

664
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:47,700
Be careful.

665
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay.

666
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,033
I made it.

667
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,133
Throw the rope down.

668
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,834
Okay.

669
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,233
Alright.

670
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,233
Lift it up.

671
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,200
Okay.

672
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,533
This is great.

673
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,300
We made it.

674
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,834
Chief Satonaka.

675
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,567
Deliver it to them.

676
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,500
Ogasawara.

677
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,567
Yes?

678
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,233
You should deliver
the receipts yourself.

679
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,166
What?

680
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,633
Those documents

681
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:33,133
hold an important meaning
for your career.

682
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,734
I was a hard working salesman
10 years ago.

683
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Hurry.

684
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,967
Thank you for your
consideration, but...

685
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,433
I'm scared, so I'll pass.

686
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:48,333
Is that okay?

687
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,266
I'm not used to
doing things like this.

688
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,467
Please pull it up, Chief!

689
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:54,500
Alright.

690
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,700
Here I go.

691
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,834
Will I be okay?

692
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,166
Are you okay?

693
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,834
Don't look down, okay?

694
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,633
I made it, Omae.

695
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:12,934
Please throw the rope down.

696
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,567
We don't have time.

697
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,533
Okay.

698
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,800
Throw the rope!

699
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:21,467
Rope!

700
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,033
Rope!

701
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,567
Don't worry about me. Quick!

702
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,533
Ogasawara!

703
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
Shigeru Ogasawara!

704
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,133
What am I doing?

705
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:12,100
I don't know who you are

706
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:13,767
but thank y--

707
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:14,800
Be careful.

708
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:17,333
Watch out!

709
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,600
You.

710
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,066
You're heavy.

711
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,700
Let me go, then.

712
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
Don't be silly.

713
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,934
I don't need your help.

714
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,967
You're so not cute.

715
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,233
Oh yeah.

716
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,166
You can live alone, right?

717
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,767
You're heavy, so come up now.

718
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,500
This wasn't necessary.

719
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,567
Same thing goes to you.

720
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,367
We only needed the receipts.

721
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:48,233
But you helped Ogasawara, too.

722
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,533
I was just doing my job.

723
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:53,967
That isn't included
in your contract.

724
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,200
Be a little more honest.

725
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,066
We barely made it alive.

726
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:09,033
I'm glad you're safe.

727
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Say something.

728
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,066
My hands are dirty.

729
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:20,633
I'll go wash my hands.

730
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,734
Hey.

731
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,467
Say "Thank you very much,
Chief Shoji."

732
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,800
If you're not happy
about my manners,

733
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,967
please communicate that to
my manager, Hitotsugi.

734
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,000
What?

735
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:41,967
Do you think you can do this?

736
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,033
Your parents must be awful people!

737
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Hey!

738
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,767
Clean up the rope.

739
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,000
Nice work, everyone.

740
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,767
As for fraudulent accounts,
they found no discrepancies,

741
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,200
so they went back.

742
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,066
Yeah,!

743
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,967
It's all thanks to Ogasawara.

744
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,200
Wow, thanks.

745
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,734
Great job.

746
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,667
Sir.

747
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,600
Shige,

748
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,266
you're staying.

749
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,734
I see.

750
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,633
I'm so happy for you.

751
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,233
Thank you.

752
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,834
Satonaka.

753
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,500
Let's celebrate.

754
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,834
Let's go to Shige's favourite pub.

755
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,767
All of Marketing Section.

756
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,033
Okay.

757
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,767
Please let me join, too.

758
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:37,867
Great.

759
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,266
- You...
- I'm not going.

760
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:40,200
I didn't ask.

761
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,066
It all worked out.

762
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:50,867
Yeah,.

763
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,300
With that woman...

764
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,967
her words and her actions
are not matching up.

765
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,233
What's the matter?

766
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:08,734
I...

767
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,700
I wanted to protect Ogasawara

768
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,333
but I couldn't do anything.

769
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,300
That can't be helped.

770
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,500
Our life is based on this company.

771
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,567
We can't change who we are.

772
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,600
But she's different.

773
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,467
After all...

774
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,567
we can't change her.

775
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,934
Stop that, Ken.

776
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
She's an invader.

777
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,633
If we act like her

778
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
we'll for sure be defeated.

779
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,467
We'll be thrown out.

780
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,867
Let's drink until we pass out.

781
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,367
Yeah, let's drink.

782
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:22,767
I'll take care of you.

783
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:24,100
Thank you.

784
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,166
Shige.

785
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,266
Do you want to go singing?

786
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,700
How many decades has it been
since we went karaoke together?

787
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,567
- See you later.
- Bye.

788
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,066
See you tomorrow.

789
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,500
Haruko.

790
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,367
This stays between us,

791
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,467
but I've decided that

792
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,266
I won't renew my contract.

793
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:31,000
It's not my concern.

794
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
But why?

795
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,367
Everyone made the last days
of my career so wonderful.

796
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,767
That was all I needed.

797
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,500
Old soldiers should leave.

798
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,367
It's about time.

799
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,033
Ogasawara.

800
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,400
you're a sea cucumber,
so don't act cool.

801
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,834
Sea cucumber?

802
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:02,066
Are you talking about me?

803
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:05,633
Leaving a company without hesitation

804
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,467
is reserved for temps.

805
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,533
If you're a permanent employee,

806
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,300
you should cling on to your company.

807
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Haruko.

808
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,400
You should get going

809
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:26,567
or you'll get lost again.

810
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:50,967
Ogasawara.

811
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:53,133
Hi.

812
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,633
What are you doing?

813
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,100
What's going on?

814
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,467
Did she bully you again?

815
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,700
- No.
- What did she say?

816
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,500
I'll pay her back for this.

817
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,133
It's fine.

818
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,567
Let's go.

819
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,800
Yeah, let's go.

820
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,033
So are we going to karaoke?

821
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:18,533
"To be continued..."

822
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,433
February 14 is the best day of
the year to take that chance.

823
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:26,900
As a temp, should
I hand out chocolates?

824
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,133
We're not here to cheer up
unpopular permanent employees.

825
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,300
Are you...

826
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,066
I'm Haruko Omae, a midwife.
