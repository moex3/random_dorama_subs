1
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:09,767
Here it comes.

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:12,400
It's coming.

3
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,400
- You mean, Shoji?
- He's not here.

4
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,967
An earthquake.

5
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:21,300
Don't tell me that
you can even predict earthquakes.

6
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,033
Here it comes.

7
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:30,934
It's big.

8
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,900
It's big.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,667
Get under your desks!

10
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,700
Stop working, Omae.

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,333
Hurry.

12
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,400
- Mori!
- Watch out!

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,467
Don't move.

14
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,734
Until it stops shaking,

15
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,367
stay under your desks.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,900
Are you okay?

17
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,633
Mori?

18
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,967
Yes.

19
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,066
I'm fine.

20
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,467
Can I talk to Nanako?

21
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,300
Hello? Is this Nana?

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,033
It's Dad.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,500
It was scary, wasn't it?

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,100
I had no idea he had a kid.

25
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,433
Hey.

26
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,967
Are my beetle larvae okay?

27
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:40,400
Hi there, it's me.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,467
How's everything?
Is everything okay?

29
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,066
Your phone is ringing.

30
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,900
Oh, yeah, sorry.

31
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,433
Hello? Mum?

32
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,400
It was so scary.

33
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,867
- Hello?
- Ken? Are you all right?

34
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,667
It was a big one.

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,767
Yeah. Are you okay, Shoji?

36
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:02,934
I hate earthquakes. I got so scared.

37
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,300
By the way, how's Turtleneck?

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,834
Was she also scared?

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,934
Well, actually...

40
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,734
Not at all.

41
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,200
She kept on working as usual.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,767
What?

43
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,300
I bet she has nobody to call
even in times like this.

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,834
That's so sad.

45
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:27,900
Sir.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,300
I finished the rough bookkeeping
of Sales Division.

47
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,734
Nice work.

48
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:38,500
That was quite a big one.

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,700
Anybody hurt?

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Are you all right?

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,233
Sir.

52
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,900
I need to leave on time,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
so please check it
as soon as possible.

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,133
All right.

55
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,300
Sir.

56
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,867
She acts like this
even after an earthquake.

57
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,400
Why is she so particular
about leaving on time?

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,166
Working overtime shows
how motivated an employee is.

59
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,433
You guys still have
a lot of work left.

60
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,400
Let's clean up and work overtime.

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,266
Yeah!

62
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,867
I've been meaning to ask you this.

63
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,033
Why can't you work overtime?

64
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,100
Overtime is for useless employees
who work slow.

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,367
It's for them to get extra money.

66
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:17,300
What?

67
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,266
It doesn't show
how motivated an employee is

68
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,633
but how lazy they are at work.

69
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,333
Excuse me.

70
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,133
Wait.

72
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,867
Who do you think we are, Turtleneck?

73
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,633
Bye.

74
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,000
- See you later.
- See you.

75
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,400
Good,
you'll get more overtime money.

76
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,667
Hey, wait.

77
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,567
Proud employees will have a fall.

78
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:50,066
Companies won't survive
without temp workers now.

79
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,767
For example, Haruko Omae here.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,300
"Impossible" and "overtime"
are not in her dictionary.

81
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:00,400
She shuts down
all troublesome relationships

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,467
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,033
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

84
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,867
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

85
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,533
That's still a mystery.

86
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:23,166
"The Pride of the Temp"

87
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,433
Good morning, Marketing Section.

88
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,734
Good morning.

89
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,767
This spring, S&amp;F had collaborated
with Sils Mario,

90
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,700
the famous chocolate shop,

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,633
and we're going to launch
a chocolate gift all over Japan.

92
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,133
Before the launch,
to promote and to do research,

93
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,800
we'll have an Valentine's event.

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
Stop that and listen to me.

95
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
It's her daily routine.

96
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,533
It's not 9 yet.

97
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,867
She makes strange noises.

98
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:53,100
This is Chief Shoji's project,

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,333
but our team
will be in charge of it.

100
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,300
Here.

101
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,734
You'll organise the event
and do research on customers.

102
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,500
Chief!

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,300
Don't jump into the conversation.

104
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,867
This is a large venue, so please get
six temps for selling the products.

105
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,834
- Sure.
- Don't be so bossy.

106
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,300
- I'm--
- I'm Haruko Omae.

107
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,834
She said it, finally.

108
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,266
She does that every time.

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,300
It's Valentine's Day, after all.

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,700
Stop fighting.

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
It doesn't concern her.
Right, Turtleneck?

112
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,867
Look, she teleported.

113
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,266
The meeting isn't over yet.

114
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,533
You said that it doesn't concern me,
so I'm doing something else.

115
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,200
Is that a problem, Curly Hair?

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
"Curly Hair"?

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,834
Did you hear that?

118
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,700
- No, she didn't say that.
- Yes, she did.

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,133
She said "Curly Hair".

120
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,367
- No, she didn't.
- Don't just call me Curly Hair.

121
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,033
It's Chief Curly Hair.

122
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,467
Never say that to me.

123
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,000
They're fighting, after all.

124
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,567
I think I'll stay in the office.

125
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:55,600
Hi there.

126
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,166
Nice to see you.

127
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,066
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

128
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,166
- Here's the name list.
- Okay.

129
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,633
Please be quiet.

130
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:04,734
Quiet, please.

131
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,967
Hello, I'm Satonaka
from Marketing Section.

132
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,200
Nice to meet you.

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,667
- Nice to meet you!
- He's so cute!

134
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:14,734
Quiet, please!

135
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:20,533
Sorry, I gathered them in a hurry,
so they're not trained.

136
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,500
No problem.

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,467
These two will be organising
the event for two days.

138
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,033
Ms Omae and Ms Mori.

139
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,066
Nice to meet you.

140
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,266
Wait, I know her.

141
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,066
She's so bossy
and has a terrible attitude.

142
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,700
I don't like to work under her.

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
You don't?

144
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,734
Aida.

145
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,700
She has a terrible attitude.

146
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,633
What?

147
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,700
What?

148
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:55,100
We'll meet at the venue at 9.
Please don't be late.

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,734
Okay.

150
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,767
- Here you go.
- Oh, wait.

151
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:00,600
You're also a temp from Haken Life?

152
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,333
Yes, I'm still new,
so this is my first big job.

153
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,433
You seem so enthusiastic about this.

154
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,433
But you know about temps
retiring at 35?

155
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,767
What?

156
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,500
The life of a temp
ends at the age of 35.

157
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,700
I'm 36 years old right now.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,500
They stopped giving me jobs.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,367
I don't even get consultations.

160
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,467
We only get these urgent jobs.

161
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:31,633
Temps are for running errands,
so they only want young, cute ones.

162
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,266
Looking forward to working with you.

163
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,633
See you.

164
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,900
Thank you.

165
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,633
"Cafe Cantante"

166
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,900
You're here again?

167
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,667
Should I keep working as a temp?

168
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,667
This is not a therapy room
for temps.

169
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,333
Looking at those ladies
made me worry.

170
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,166
It's because of me.

171
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,934
It's because I'm a temp.

172
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,033
For temps who say that
and make no efforts,

173
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,133
their life is over.

174
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,367
That's harsh.

175
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,166
It's easy for you because you have
jobs everywhere you go.

176
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,934
But for regular temps,

177
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:16,166
we're always worried
that we won't find a job.

178
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:17,567
Miyuki.

179
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,166
Listen.

180
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,333
The mortality rate for humans
is 100 per cent.

181
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,400
What?

182
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,600
Whether you worry or not,
someday you'll die.

183
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah, you might die tomorrow,
so stop worrying.

184
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,600
Good for you.

185
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,200
You guys have
a Latin way of thinking.

186
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,667
Sorry about that.

187
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,333
I'm a girl from Gunma,
so I worry a lot.

188
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,133
- I'll go dance now.
- Okay.

189
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,467
I have another thing
that I'm worried about.

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,133
Should I hand out chocolates
on Valentine's Day?

191
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,867
Ogasawara, Kon, Asano...

192
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,033
Director Kirishima and Chief Shoji.

193
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,934
That'll be a lot of money.

194
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:03,734
You forgot one person.

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,700
What?

196
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, yeah.

197
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,767
Yes, Chief Satonaka.

198
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,233
Sorry, I forgot.

199
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,633
Wait.

200
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:15,100
You're blushing.

201
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,200
No, I'm not.

202
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,767
In any case,

203
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,133
nothing is more wasteful
than handing out chocolates.

204
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,367
If you have that kind of money,

205
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,500
save for your retirement.

206
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,200
All right.

207
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,867
- Please change in the back room.
- Okay.

208
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:36,934
That way.

209
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,800
This apron isn't in my size.

210
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,767
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,834
- We only have one size.
- Really?

212
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:44,934
Who's the announcer?

213
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,467
It's her, Sanae Murase.

214
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,433
Read this script.

215
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,233
I wrote it, so read it with care.

216
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:54,633
Okay.

217
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,266
Ouch.

218
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:02,934
Ken.

219
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,600
I've never seen anyone who looks
so awkward with a heart.

220
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
You think so?

221
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:10,867
She looks cute.

222
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,700
Ken.

223
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,300
Are your eyes okay?

224
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,266
Please.

225
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,467
- We have to express our feelings.
- For Yamamoto and Nakamura...

226
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,667
- Take the chance.
- Here, please.

227
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,567
- One bite and it'll captivate you.
- For Aida...

228
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,200
- Sils Mario's chocolate.
- Here, please.

229
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,800
Last year, I only got
one chocolate from my sister.

230
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,934
This year,
I hope I'll get more chocolates.

231
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,800
That's so sad.

232
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
You only get one from your wife,
right?

233
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes, but that one chocolate
is a lot more meaningful than yours.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
You guys are at such a low level.

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,033
Chocolates from family members
don't count.

236
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,467
- What about you?
- Love at first sight.

237
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,066
Please accept my feelings.

238
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,533
What?

239
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,567
Thank you.

240
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,000
But I can't do this right now.

241
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,266
But I've only got two days
to work with you,

242
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,834
so I rushed.

243
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,100
I like you.

244
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,200
Please go out with me.

245
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:14,567
Well...

246
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,967
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,734
I'm flattered...

248
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,567
but please focus on your job now.

249
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:26,500
Don't slack off.
Everyone, get to work!

250
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,867
Enough with the drama.

251
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,467
Read the script now.

252
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,533
Look at her.

253
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:33,266
That Special A Rank
is getting so arrogant.

254
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,233
She acts like a permanent employee.

255
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,300
I knew something was missing.

256
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,967
For the announcer,
I got this heart hat.

257
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:42,800
Here.

258
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,900
Take this.

259
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:50,000
There isn't enough chocolate.
Get a big pile of them here.

260
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,100
- Okay.
- Okay?

261
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,333
Please take a look.

262
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,867
Welcome.

263
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:03,100
If you pile them up here,
all the chocolate will melt.

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,533
It's fine. We just took them out
of the refrigerator.

265
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,200
I made them. They're going to melt.

266
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,033
What?

267
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,500
Are you an S&amp;F employee?

268
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,600
No, I'm a temp.

269
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Talking to you
won't get me anywhere.

270
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,433
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Well...

272
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,500
Madam.

273
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,633
How can I help you?

274
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,934
Are you an employee?

275
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,200
All the employees
are currently unavailable,

276
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,033
so I'm here to help you.

277
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,700
Are you a temp too?

278
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,333
Call the person in charge.

279
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,867
Hi there, President Hashidate.
Did they do anything to you?

280
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,467
Shoji, you're not treating
my chocolate right.

281
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,000
You can't pile them up
and cast them with lights like this.

282
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,066
Our chocolate is alive.

283
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,433
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you doing?

285
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,100
The chocolate is alive.

286
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,233
I apologise
for our ignorant temp staff.

287
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,200
This is President Hashidate
of Sils Mario.

288
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,433
We're very sorry.

289
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,066
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,600
- Put them back in the fridge.
- Okay.

291
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,934
Quick.

292
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:21,367
It was Chief Shoji
who told me to pile them up.

293
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,200
Why are we the ones apologising?

294
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,266
He blames temps for bad things

295
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,433
and takes credit for good things.

296
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,734
That's just how he is.

297
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,600
You're a temp, after all,
even if you're Special A Rank.

298
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,200
Society doesn't trust temp workers.

299
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,066
She was so scary.

300
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Look.

301
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,834
That looks good.

302
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:45,800
Thanks.

303
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,066
We're in trouble.

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,100
What's going on, Hitotsugi?

305
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,633
- What's going on?
- Sorry.

306
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:55,834
Murase, the announcer,
ended her contract and disappeared.

307
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:56,633
What?

308
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,100
The one who asked Ken out?

309
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,166
Oh, yeah.

310
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,200
She's heartbroken.

311
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,100
Yes, that's exactly right.

312
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,867
She's so heartbroken that she can't
stand wearing a heart-shaped hat.

313
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,600
I tried to convince her,
but to no avail. I'm sorry.

314
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,633
It's not your fault.

315
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,500
I was being insensitive.

316
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,100
I told her that
in front of everyone.

317
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,533
Nobody should just quit their job
after a heartbreak.

318
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,633
This is why I don't trust temps.

319
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,800
See?

320
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,834
Chief Shoji.

321
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,333
Everyone here is against you now.

322
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Asano.

323
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:33,667
Don't get intimidated.

324
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:35,667
What should we do
about the announcer?

325
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,100
I was looking at this.

326
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:40,233
Omae,

327
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,767
according to your job history,

328
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,400
you were an announcer
for election campaigns.

329
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,767
You got three Parliament members
elected.

330
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:50,500
Yes. So?

331
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,333
Three Parliament members?

332
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,934
You can do anything then.

333
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,600
Why don't you do the announcement?

334
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,567
No, thank you.

335
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,867
Omae.

336
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,500
Don't be so selfish.

337
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,567
You don't like the hat?

338
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,700
You're saving us.

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,033
Thank you.

340
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,734
Smile. You look too unfriendly
for an announcer.

341
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,166
Smile. Smile.

342
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,500
With feelings.

343
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:33,900
Okay? Thanks.

344
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Welcome.

345
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,133
You have to express your feelings.

346
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:44,533
February 14th is the best day
of the year to take that chance.

347
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,533
When you have a bite,

348
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,734
you'll be captivated
by our chocolate.

349
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,567
Give Sils Mario's chocolate

350
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,700
and you will surely captivate
your loved one.

351
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,100
Her voice is cute.

352
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,967
Love comes in different forms.

353
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:04,300
Chocolates that you hand out
to your co-workers and bosses,

354
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,533
the ones that you give
to your friends,

355
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,633
and the ones you give

356
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,533
to people who've gone through a lot
in their lives.

357
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,433
Now,

358
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,133
why don't you try
Sils Mario's chocolate?

359
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,500
Limited number available.

360
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,333
You need to express your feelings.

361
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,200
February 14th is the best day
of the year to take that chance.

362
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,767
When you have a bite, you'll be
captivated by our chocolate.

363
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:39,734
Thank you.

364
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,633
Give Sils Mario's chocolate

365
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:46,734
and you will surely captivate
your loved one.

366
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Ones that you give to your friends.

367
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,767
- Thank you for waiting.
- And ones you give to people

368
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,633
who've gone through a lot
in their lives.

369
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:55,567
This way, please.

370
00:16:55,667 --> 00:17:00,433
- Try Sils Mario's chocolate.
- It's a simple questionnaire.

371
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,667
Limited number only.

372
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,533
Please go take a break, Omae.

373
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:11,767
No, we need to sell everything
before 6:00 for me to leave on time.

374
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,867
You need to express your feelings.

375
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,400
February 14th...

376
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,066
- The fridge is empty now.
- Really?

377
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,600
We're very sorry,
but we're sold out for today.

378
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:39,900
What?

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,100
Thank you.

380
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
We're very sorry.

381
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,867
Please come back tomorrow.

382
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,734
Everything is sold out now.

383
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,233
Thank you.

384
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,533
It's thanks to Omae.

385
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,266
She's so impressive.

386
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,200
Chief.

387
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:53,934
Can I go home now?

388
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,033
Sure.

389
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,133
Nice work.

390
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,367
See you tomorrow.

391
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,533
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

392
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,734
See you tomorrow.

393
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,633
I'll go make an additional order
at the factory.

394
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,533
At this rate, we'll sell out again.

395
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,066
That's true.

396
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,367
Should I come too?

397
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,633
It's fine,
I'm close to their president.

398
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,200
Come with me, Asano.

399
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,133
Sure.

400
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,533
- Thanks.
- Sure.

401
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,467
- Hey.
- Yes?

402
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,033
The contract said that
the job ends at 7.

403
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,700
We're done
because the chocolate is sold out?

404
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,667
We'll get paid until 7, right?

405
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,567
I'm not sure about that.

406
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,033
You're not sure? What?

407
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,433
Don't worry.

408
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,400
We'll pay until 7:00.

409
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,066
Okay, that's good.

410
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,433
Great.

411
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,767
I'll see you tomorrow.

412
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,533
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

413
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,767
We can't depend on her at all.

414
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
Who forgot this?

415
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,533
Excuse me.

416
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,166
What?

417
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:17,567
"Haruko Omae"

418
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,734
"Certificate"

419
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,633
I'm not cut out for this.

420
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,467
I can't lead Aida and everyone.

421
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,567
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,333
That's not true.

423
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,133
You did a great job today, Mori.

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,533
Chief...

425
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,100
Someday, I want to be a super temp
like Haruko.

426
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,767
I see.

427
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,533
I know I need to work hard,

428
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,133
but I'm not sure
what to work on or how.

429
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,400
I feel so small,
and it makes me even more anxious.

430
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,667
Sometimes I just want to scream.

431
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,200
I have to change something.

432
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,834
Mori.

433
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,767
I also feel anxious
just as much you do.

434
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

435
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Don't rush.

436
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,266
Every day, set a small goal.

437
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,367
And we'll do our best.

438
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,266
Work hard
on what's in front of you now

439
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,800
and you'll eventually
get to a higher level.

440
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,633
That's what I believe.

441
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,900
Let's believe in ourselves.

442
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,033
Yeah, let's do that.

443
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,233
Chief.

444
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,333
Thank you.

445
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,300
See you tomorrow.

446
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,300
See you.

447
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:01,734
Mori?

448
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,100
- Yes?
- Do you have any plans

449
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
tomorrow night?

450
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,667
- No.
- Keep it open then.

451
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,967
I want to ask you something.

452
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,800
Sure.

453
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,700
See you tomorrow.

454
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,066
On Valentine's Day?

455
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,233
No way, that can't be.

456
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,900
Ouch.

457
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
It hurts.

458
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,433
Everyone wanted your chocolate.

459
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,100
They were sold out by 6:00.

460
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,166
We'll probably sell
even more tomorrow.

461
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:43,166
Can we please add 500 to our order,
Hashidate?

462
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,667
Everything is hand made
at our store,

463
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,000
so we can only make
what you ordered before.

464
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,533
Even my pregnant daughter
is helping us out now.

465
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,734
Okay.

466
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,066
Thank you.

467
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,767
We can't handle
any additional orders.

468
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,667
Please don't say that.

469
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,133
I'm begging you.

470
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,633
We'll do our best
for our spring launch.

471
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,200
We'll help with anything,
even packing in boxes.

472
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,834
You can use this guy here.

473
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:09,967
- Please.
- Please.

474
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,667
Let's take the order, Mum.

475
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,633
What?

476
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,467
All right, fine.

477
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,734
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

478
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,233
Thank you.

479
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:56,500
What brings you here today?

480
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,734
To deliver this.

481
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,033
How could I have done that?

482
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
Sorry.

483
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,700
I didn't know whose it was,
so I looked inside.

484
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,066
I was surprised.

486
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,900
Those are all licences?

487
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Thank you for bringing this.

488
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,600
- Please excuse me.
- Omae.

489
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,066
Tomorrow,

490
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,667
we want to have
a party after the event.

491
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,166
- Please come.
- No.

492
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,667
Please join tomorrow.

493
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll go home on time.

494
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,767
Everyone in our section

495
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,333
wants to be friends with you.

496
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,867
I do too.

497
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,633
Is your company
where you go to make friends?

498
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,900
I don't believe in companies,

499
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,300
so I don't expect to find friends
there.

500
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,400
That's how you feel?

501
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:55,200
As for me,
I like the people on my team.

502
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,734
Okay. So?

503
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,633
Well...

504
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:02,934
Omae,

505
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,600
you have so many certificates,

506
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,400
so why are you working as a temp
at a company like ours?

507
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,867
Jobs with the least amount
of overtime

508
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,834
are usually temp office work.

509
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,133
I want to completely
separate work from my personal life.

510
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,533
I see.

511
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,033
But tomorrow--

512
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,600
Please don't make me
repeat the same thing.

513
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,633
After my working hours,

514
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,667
I don't want to see
any of your faces.

515
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:34,800
Excuse me.

516
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,233
Excuse me.

518
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,934
You're quite skilful.

519
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:14,033
If you ever get fired,
join our shop.

520
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,667
Thank you.

521
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,600
Good for you, Asano.

522
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:32,834
Here you go.

523
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,033
Here we go.

524
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,100
Nice work, everyone!

525
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
Nice work.

526
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,533
Hey, you.

527
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,667
We had to work extra hard
because of you.

528
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,834
I won't forgive you
if these don't sell out.

529
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,400
Everyone joined to help out,

530
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,100
and we managed
to get everything done.

531
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,200
That's great to hear.

532
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,533
Don't forget to do the research
on the new product.

533
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,667
Yes, sir. I'll be back.

534
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:08,800
Shoji.

535
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,266
Here.

536
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you for the chocolate
every year.

537
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,367
You're welcome.

538
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,667
I expect a gift
that's three times pricier.

539
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,633
Understood.

540
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,200
I'll come check on the event later.

541
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,734
Okay, I'll give you a discount
if you're buying.

542
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.

543
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,333
See you later.

544
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,400
You have to express your feelings.

545
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,767
- February 14th is...
- I need to go to the restroom.

546
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,700
Once you have a bite,

547
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,600
- you'll be...
- Try Sils Mario's chocolate!

548
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,266
- Sils Mario's chocolate...
- Only for Valentine's day!

549
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:51,433
It's only sold at this event.
Please come and try.

550
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,433
Did something good happen to you?

551
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,934
No, not really.

552
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,834
Would you like to try
Sils Mario's chocolate?

553
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,066
Chief Shoji?

554
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,667
Thank you always.

555
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,967
Please make sure
to renew my contract.

556
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,600
Chocolate won't do anything,
but I'll take it.

557
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,567
Thanks.

558
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,600
Chief Satonaka.

559
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,133
Here. I stayed up all night
to make this for you.

560
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,200
Thank you.

561
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,567
I was wondering
if you're free tonight.

562
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,567
Sorry, I have a very important plan.

563
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,200
I see.

564
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,367
Don't get too deep into this.

565
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,433
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:31,800
Let's go.

567
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,333
What's the important plan, chief?

568
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,667
You should join too.

569
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,767
What? Asano, too?

570
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,433
What's wrong?

571
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,633
No, nothing.

572
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,467
Mori, can I talk to you?

573
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,700
Actually...

574
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,367
Love comes in different forms.

575
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:04,934
Chocolates that you hand out
to your co-workers and bosses.

576
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:07,266
The ones that you give
to your friends.

577
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:14,100
Now, why don't you try
Sils Mario's chocolate?

578
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:18,300
Limited number only.

579
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,633
Hey. You skipped a line.

580
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,133
"And the ones you give to people

581
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:25,934
who've gone through a lot
in their lives"?

582
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,300
It's stupid, so I cut it.

583
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,734
It's not stupid.
It's the most important.

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,934
Also, the way you read
doesn't have any emotions in it.

585
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,233
Put some emotions into it.

586
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,166
- Do it yourself then.
- Give it to me.

587
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:40,333
I'll show you how.

588
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,867
You have to express your feelings.

589
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,033
February 14th is--

590
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,000
Stop it. Stop.

591
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,033
I can't wear something like that.

592
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,133
What about the wig you have on?

593
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,200
This isn't a wig.

594
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,467
It's my natural hair.

595
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,266
You thought I wore a wig?

596
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,333
People are looking.

597
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,667
She thought I wore a wig.

598
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,967
Omae. Let's take a break
in the staff room.

599
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,667
Excuse me.

600
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,233
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

601
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,133
I'm upset and I'm also hungry.

602
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,934
Oh wait,
someone gave me a chocolate.

603
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,700
I'll eat this chocolate.

604
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,000
It's so cute.

605
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,867
Ken, as a temp,

606
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,433
don't you think she should hand out
chocolates to her co-workers?

607
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:40,734
For temps, Valentine's day
is when we feel glad

608
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:46,433
that we're not permanent employees.

609
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,266
Why is that, Omae?

610
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,800
Unlike female workers
who stay at one company forever,

611
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,633
we don't need to hand out
chocolates.

612
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,333
She doesn't get it, Ken.

613
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:59,033
Valentine chocolate is like
lubricating oil for a company.

614
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,367
It's 500 yen well spent.

615
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,467
It's like throwing 500 yen
in a ditch.

616
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
We give back gifts
that are three times pricier.

617
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah? Lame handkerchiefs?
Those are useless, and...

618
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,033
What's wrong with that?

619
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,800
And what?

620
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,200
Temps are not guaranteed

621
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,000
that they'll be at the company
a month later.

622
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,767
They don't know it's on.

623
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:22,367
So what?
You're a temp by choice, right?

624
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,400
Not everyone choses to be.
It's all different for everyone.

625
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,467
A battle between an employee
and a temp. It's so interesting.

626
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,767
Please turn off the microphone.

627
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,934
Do you have a grudge against us?

628
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,734
What about you?
Do you have a grudge on temps?

629
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,934
Please don't fight today.

630
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:41,000
You never work overtime.
You don't get to talk like this.

631
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,800
I finish all of my tasks
before I go home on time.

632
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,133
You're right.

633
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,800
You work very fast.

634
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,767
Whose side are you on?

635
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,567
Going home on time?
You're so selfish.

636
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,767
If I accept to work overtime once,

637
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:56,033
you'll be more dependent on temps
to make your job easier.

638
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,133
You're so annoying.

639
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,567
It's because you didn't sleep.

640
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,033
I don't need a temp like you.

641
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:02,667
Shoji.

642
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,967
Okay, I understand.

643
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,467
You don't need me.

644
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,233
No.

645
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,734
We can't afford to lose you.

646
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,700
You're way more competent than I am.

647
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,266
You're so cocky!

648
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:16,133
So a temp can't be more competent
than an employee?

649
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,633
The sad truth is...

650
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,400
temps with a lot of experience
are the first ones to be fired.

651
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,767
"I'm a temp,
so nobody will trust me."

652
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,300
"Working seriously
wouldn't get me anywhere."

653
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,767
Only temps who have that kind
of attitude will remain at the end.

654
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,567
This actually makes your job
much more difficult.

655
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,600
Shoji.

656
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,300
Please take back what you said.

657
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:52,567
All right.

658
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,600
But...

659
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,200
why don't you learn skills
that make you more like a human?

660
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,533
Like being thoughtful, for example.

661
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,867
Do you so desperately want
chocolate from us?

662
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,100
Of course I do.

663
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:14,767
Shoji.

664
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,433
Without providing any benefits,
don't expect anything from us.

665
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:19,734
In any case...

666
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,834
we're not here to cheer up
unpopular permanent employees.

667
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,367
Unpopular?

668
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,700
You always say something
that I can't stand.

669
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll get back to work now.

670
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,767
Hey, wait.

671
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,133
The mic is on.

672
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,333
Temps don't need to butter up
to the employees?

673
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,266
Chocolate can be expensive.

674
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,734
Let's not buy it.

675
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,667
I won't give this.

676
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,200
I'll return this.

677
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,033
- It's stupid.
- Please wait.

678
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,633
What should we do?

679
00:32:57,033 --> 00:33:00,367
I had no idea there were this many
temp workers.

680
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:01,667
Don't just get impressed.

681
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,600
I'll go advertise at the station.

682
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,767
You're in charge here.

683
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
What?

684
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,000
What happened here?

685
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:31,700
Why is there so much left?

686
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,133
We're sincerely sorry.

687
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,200
A temp worker wouldn't know
what she's talking about.

688
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:47,033
My chocolate.

689
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,200
Stay strong.

690
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,867
My poor chocolate.

691
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,333
Oh, look at that.

692
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:12,100
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

693
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,266
No, it was my fault.

694
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,767
I'm sorry.

695
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:16,900
Omae.

696
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,533
If they're upset with us,
what will happen to the new product?

697
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll go and apologise.
I'll fix this no matter what.

698
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,633
I'll be back once it's fixed.

699
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,233
I'll go too.

700
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,367
You're not an employee.
It's not your responsibility.

701
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,533
No, I'm coming.

702
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,867
Stay out of this, temp.

703
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,934
No, I will not stay out of this.

704
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,100
Stay here.

705
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,800
Haruko?

706
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
It's 6:00.

707
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:42,266
Here.

708
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,700
Thank you for your hard work.

709
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,767
Thank you.

710
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,100
Where's the Special A Rank?

711
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,600
She went back to the office.

712
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,033
Okay, tell her this.

713
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,200
Tell her what?

714
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,667
Listening to her arguing
with the permanent employee

715
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,500
actually cheered us up.

716
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,133
What?

717
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:02,633
I...

718
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
I'll be a serious temp again.

719
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Despite how I look,

720
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
I have bookkeeping and PC
certificates.

721
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,567
That's impressive.

722
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:17,066
If we keep putting ourselves down,
nothing will change.

723
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,567
I'll try again too.

724
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,266
You too. Work hard.

725
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,834
I will.

726
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,500
Good luck.

727
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,800
I'll work hard too.

728
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,700
We won't let the unsold chocolate
go to waste.

730
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,133
I'm sincerely sorry.

731
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,300
We're busy, so please go home.

732
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,233
Forget about the new product.

733
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,066
Please, Hashidate.

734
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,333
I'm begging you.

735
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:53,900
- Are you all right, Ayumi?
- Mum, it hurts!

736
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,767
You made her work all night.

737
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:59,900
The same thing happened
for her first child.

738
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:01,834
I'm sorry.

739
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,066
Are you okay?
Can you walk to the car?

740
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,767
The baby's coming out.

741
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,433
Don't push.

742
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,734
I can't do this anymore!

743
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,367
Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

744
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,367
Right away.

745
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,033
Excuse me.

746
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,033
Her water broke.

747
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:24,700
The ambulance will be too late.
You'll give birth here.

748
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,033
Give birth here?

749
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,667
- Are you...
- Just do what I say.

750
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,300
- Okay.
- Ayumi.

751
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,633
Can you move?

752
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,867
Bring a mattress here!

753
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,033
A mattress.

754
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,300
- Get a mattress.
- Okay.

755
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
That's impossible.

756
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,200
Get thread, needles, and alcohol!

757
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,834
And bath towels!

758
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:43,867
- What?
- Hurry!

759
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,333
Okay!

760
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,200
- There are people in the back.
- Okay.

761
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,767
Ayumi?

762
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,633
It's fine.
You'll give birth to a healthy baby.

763
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,800
Wait a minute.

764
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,700
Aren't you the temp from S&amp;F?

765
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,066
I'm Haruko Omae, a midwife.

Laying on your back must be hard.

769
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:19,567
Let's turn to the side.

770
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,533
Here you go.

771

Hurry!

Okay.

775
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,100
Good luck.

Ayumi?

777
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:35,000
Look into your mother's eyes.

Ayumi.

00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,367
It's all fine.

Don't push, okay?

782
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,200
Breathe out.

783
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,734
Breathe out.

00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:48,967
That's right.

Wow, look at her.

to tell you something.

He wants you to come back
to the company before going home.

Okay.

you were also a midwife.

So what?

833
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,200
I'll ask for you
when I have a second kid.

834
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,333
We heard it was a girl.

835
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,333
The same birthday as you.

836

with strong luck just like you.

00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:51,467
Also, earlier

838
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,333
Shoji called me.

839
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:56,567
We can launch Sils Mario's
new product.

840
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,667
It doesn't concern me.

841
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,967
In any case, nice work.

842
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,367
It's your first time
working overtime, Haruko.

843
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
- Not willingly.
- Yes.

844
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,834
Come on, let's make a toast.

845
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,166
Yeah, let's do that.

846
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:12,900
Please take a glass.

847
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
Here.

848
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:16,700
All right.

849
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:20,767
To Omae's health
and future success.

850
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,133
Cheers!

851
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,066
Cheers!

852
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,500
Please stop!

853
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,734
This is a fire hazard.

854
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:33,200
Be careful.

855
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,533
This cake is a gift from Mori.

856
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,467
I saved money
by not buying chocolate.

857
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,567
- It's wasteful.
- What?

858
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,700
Birthday cakes are more wasteful
than Valentine's chocolate.

859
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,433
Haruko.

860
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:56,233
We get older
whether we like it or not.

861
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,934
And what's up with that hat?

862
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Sorry.

863
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:08,767
I didn't know
how I can celebrate this.

864
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,333
So I wore this.

865
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,767
Your meddling...

866
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,667
is honestly creepy.

867
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:21,166
Do you always consider
other people's feelings

868
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,533
when you interact with them?

869
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,967
No wonder
you're out of Sales Division.

870
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:33,934
You're right,
but isn't that a bit too harsh?

871
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:37,633
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

872
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,567
You might yell at me again...

873
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,033
but we all wrote this.

874
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,333
You did this during your work hours?

875
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,834
It's quite shocking.

876
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,367
To me, it's like S&amp;F

877
00:42:56,867 --> 00:43:01,133
is throwing their money
into a ditch.

878
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:01,934
That's all.

879
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,166
"Omae,

880
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:46,533
I can be sloppy.

881
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,233
Thank you always for your help."

882
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,433
"Kensuke Satonaka"

883
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,166
"Haruko,

884
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:56,266
I'm sorry for always troubling you."

885
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,567
"Miyuki Mori"

886
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,500
"Ms Omae,

887
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,233
I want to see you smile sometimes."

888
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,266
"Tsutomu Asano"

889
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,133
"I respect you."

890
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:09,233
"Kosaku Kon"

891
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:11,133
"Turtleneck,

892
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,000
by the way, how old are you?"

893
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,266
"Wavy tough guy"

894
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,633
"Haruko,

895
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:23,400
you're actually a nice girl,
aren't you?"

896
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,600
"Shigeru Ogasawara"

897
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:40,667
"Happy birthday!"

898
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,400
"Happy birthday"

899
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:08,934
"Happy birthday"

900
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,734
Temps can't even make proposals?

901
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:24,734
Right.

902
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:27,834
- Can you protect Miyuki Mori?
- I will.

903
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:30,567
What are you doing,
making a temp look good?

904
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:33,367
You get more energy
with a guy you like?

905
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:35,400
- Exactly.
- You're an idiot.
