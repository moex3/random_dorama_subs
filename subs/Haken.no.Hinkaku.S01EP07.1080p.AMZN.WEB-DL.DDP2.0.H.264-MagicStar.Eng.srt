1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,433
Managing director
of Takarada Transport.

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:12,767
Mr Tamura...

3
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,667
Oh, come on.

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:17,433
Next.

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:21,734
Sumibishi Trading, Food Department.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,166
Director.

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,467
Good job, sir!

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,934
- Keep going, sir!
- Amour Store, Managing director.

9
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:30,667
There it is.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,266
Asada Spice.

11
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,867
Sir!

12
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,867
Internal newsletter is done.

13
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,066
What are you doing?

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,567
Hey, Turtleneck!

15
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,400
The director is busy. Don't make him
play such a stupid game.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,200
Stupid?

17
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:49,700
Here it is.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,633
- It was his idea.
- What?

19
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,200
Organising cards normally is boring.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,333
How interesting.
This is a wonderful idea.

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,266
Look how manly and great you look
in these photos.

22
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,433
The title is "Director's Holiday"

23
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:07,000
It should be changed
to "Director's Dignity".

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,100
Here it is.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,333
I love Japanese fencing. I've been
going to a dojo since last week.

26
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,900
Now I'm totally into martial arts.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,166
- Here it is.
- Oh no!

28
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:18,000
You're distracting me.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,633
I can't concentrate.

30
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:21,266
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

31
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:22,467
Shoji!

32
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,934
Instead of hanging out here,
make a proposal.

33
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:25,967
Proposal, huh?

34
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:27,333
Here it is.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,667
Yeah!

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,266
Good job.

37
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah!

38
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,500
Nice.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,767
Here it is.

40
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:38,767
Omae...

41
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,600
She might intentionally lose again.

42
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,500
Intentionally?

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,533
No temps would be so
considerate of others.

44
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,166
Here it is.

45
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,867
Yeah!

46
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,166
Awesome!

47
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,000
Go!

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,767
Here it is.

49
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,934
"Omae: 49, Director: 49"

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,934
"Shoji Hamada, Takao Yamada"

51
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,166
"Shoji Hamada"

52
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,166
"Takao Yamada"

53
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:19,834
Kasumino Foods.

54
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,567
Managing...

55
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:39,166
Information Management Department.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,934
Mr Masashi Hamada.

57
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:45,867
You lose.

58
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,667
What am I doing?

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,934
You lose.

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
Mr Kirishima got 50 cards.

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,100
Mr Omae got 49 cards.

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,333
Impressive, sir!

63
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,767
Incredible!

64
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:00,400
I knew it.

65
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,066
Yes, I lose.

66
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,633
It was only a matter of one card.

67
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,467
You're not bad at all.

68
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,734
Would you like to play again?

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,000
Sir.

70
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,800
Thank you for helping me organise
business cards.

71
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,533
Now, it's time for you to
work seriously. See you later.

72
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:22,133
How dare you talk like that
to our director, Turtleneck?

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,667
Proud employees will have a fall.

74
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,367
Companies won't survive without
temp workers now.

75
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:31,266
For example, Haruko Omae here.

76
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:35,500
"Impossible" and "overtime"
are not in her dictionary.

77
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,834
She shuts down all
troublesome relationships

78
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,033
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

79
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,767
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

80
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,767
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

81
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,233
That's still a mystery.

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,900
"The Pride Of The Temp"

83
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,667
"No drama allowed
at proposal competitions"

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
"Proposal title : Rental cook"

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,633
"Proposal title: Metabolic pasta"

86
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,233
"Proposal title: Italian rice"

87
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:14,500
Everyone,

88
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,867
the deadline for proposals
is in two days.

89
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
It's for our 80th anniversary.

90
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,367
A big competition.

91
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,633
Give it all you have.

92
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:22,834
Yes.

93
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,133
That looks good.

94
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,600
You added the photo of the chef.

95
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,433
Yeah, Mario is a skilled chef
and he's good looking.

96
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,633
Ladies will like him.

97
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,867
Great.

98
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:37,066
It appears that the director
likes Ms Kuroiwa's proposal.

99
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:40,567
I haven't shown
my proposal to him.

100
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,033
What's yours about?

101
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,000
Well...

102
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,066
Omae!

103
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,767
Well...

104
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,467
Can you give me feedback on this?

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,800
Hey, Ken!

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,867
Omae is an expert
on making proposals.

107
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,200
Please.

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,567
"Rice Plastic"

109
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,667
- No.
- You didn't even read it.

110
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,567
Can you tell me why it's a no?

111
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,300
Sorry.

112
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,700
- Speed reading.
- I've never seen that before.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,333
Too long. Write important parts
in one page,

114
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,633
summarise in 2 to 3 sentences.

115
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,834
If you add notes,
list them up as bullet points.

116
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,333
Good to know.

117
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,033
You shouldn't use kanji
for every single word.

118
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,000
Less than 30% of words
should be in kanji.

119
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,667
That's all for writing a proposal
that's easy to read.

120
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,433
Alright.

121
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,333
I'll do it over.

122
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,633
Don't let a temp teach you
how to write a proposal.

123
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:47,467
There are three important parts
when writing a proposal.

124
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,600
Title, theme,

125
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,133
and laying the groundwork.

126
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,700
I'll need to correct you.

127
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,700
The third one is timing.

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Not laying the groundwork.

129
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,300
Laying the groundwork
is also important, you idiot!

130
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,333
- You're fine.
- Title...

131
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,367
Theme, and timing, huh?

132
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,567
That's strange.

133
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,166
Chief?

134
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,000
What is rice plastic?

135
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,834
We'll make eco-friendly plastic
from old rice.

136
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,567
It's still work in progress.

137
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,700
Is it a bad idea?

138
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,567
It's not the content

139
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:28,166
but your timid attitude
that makes your proposal weak.

140
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,900
No proposal will be accepted
like that.

141
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:31,800
Alright.

142
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,633
Who are you to talk about
other people's attitude?

143
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't worry, Ken.

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,133
See? Now he looks
like a lost puppy again.

145
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,133
Temps can't participate in
this competition, so stay out of it.

146
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,767
No, that's not true.

147
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,233
Here, it says that anyone can submit
their proposals.

148
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,934
This is actually not true.

149
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,934
Proposals from temps
surely won't be selected.

150
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,433
Chief Tokairin.

151
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,066
Are you talking about me?

152
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,266
That's not how you read my name.

153
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,266
You think I'll submit a proposal?

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,667
Yes.

155
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,800
I won't waste my energy on that.

156
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,367
That's good to know.

157
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,934
Now, please leave.

158
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,400
And please get out of my way,
Chief Tokairin.

159
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,967
That's not my name.

160
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,867
I don't even know
why I'm always here.

161
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,000
- Shoji.
- Goodbye.

162
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,934
Shunko Daizen.

163
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,166
I'll never come back.

164
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,967
He says that, but he'll be back
in no time.

165
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,400
Everyone,

166
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,467
let's do our best as a team

167
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,033
and make good proposals.

168
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,767
Sure.

169
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,567
Title, theme, timing...

170
00:07:58,834 --> 00:07:59,834
Good morning.

171
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:00,967
Good morning.

172
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,266
Haruko?

173
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,467
I tried to write something.

174
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,467
Here it is.

175
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,333
Can you check it before
I show it to the chief?

176
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,166
A proposal?

177
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,800
Throw it away.

178
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,734
What?

179
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,400
Never show that to an employee.

180
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,133
Omae.

181
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,266
Why would you say that?

182
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,367
What is it about, Mori?

183
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,500
Well, never mind.

184
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,834
Shoji!

185
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,233
Takeshi Shoji!

186
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,300
I'm very honoured.

187
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,900
System Management Department
thanks you.

188
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,967
Thanks to your report,

189
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,934
they were able to
promptly review our security.

190
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,100
Thank you.

191
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,400
But I pointed that out.

192
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,667
It was Haruko
who made the report.

193
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:47,700
Yeah.

194
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,367
Best guy in Japan.

195
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,800
As a permanent employee,

196
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,133
I just did what I had to do.

197
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,000
Great job, Shoji.

198
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,233
- Incredible.
- Back to work.

199
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,567
Work.

200
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,367
Thank you.

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,333
This is so frustrating.

202
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,400
Yeah, that curly hair.

203
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
He'll be back.

204
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,467
What?

205
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,433
Hey, you!

206
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,767
Did you say something about me?

207
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,834
I think I heard you say something.

208
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:16,767
About my hair.

209
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,000
Shoji.

210
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,767
Ones who pointed out
about the security first

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
were Omae and Kon.

212
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,567
Let's tell that to the director.

213
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:25,633
Is that true?

214
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:28,900
Sorry that I was the only one
who got credit for it.

215
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,233
I'll treat you dinner later.

216
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,433
No, thank you.

217
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,300
The only thing we expect
is our hourly wage.

218
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,200
We're professionals. We don't expect
to receive anything in return.

219
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,600
So you can be right sometimes?

220
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Yes, thank you.

221
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,433
I don't think that's true.

222
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,400
I believe when we're recognised
by other people,

223
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,633
we become better people.

224
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,834
Only employees grow
at their companies.

225
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right.

226
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,467
So you do get it.

227
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,567
Sorry, I don't understand.

228
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:57,900
So...

229
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,433
does that mean that temps can't
submit proposals?

230
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,367
No.

231
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,266
Omae, you're a temp yourself.

232
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,300
So why do you say
these things to Mori?

233
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,066
Because it's not our job to
make proposals.

234
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,333
It's not, is it?

235
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
I can't believe how well
we get each other today.

236
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,000
Right, Omae?

237
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,934
I'll be with General Affairs.

238
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Omae?

239
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,600
Mori.

240
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,834
Don't listen to what she says.

241
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,266
Chief, Mori said she wrote
a proposal.

242
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
Really?

243
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,934
Can I see it?

244
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:31,967
Chief...

245
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,066
It might not be useful at all.

246
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,500
Thank you.

247
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,100
"Temp's Lunch Box"

248
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,133
Yes, if there were lunch boxes
for temps workers

249
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,233
that were cheap and healthy,
that'd be great.

250
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,233
Mori...

251
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,400
This is amazing.

252
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,266
Really?

253
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah.

254
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:00,233
You just need to add data
and specific examples.

255
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,667
Make an updated version
by the end of the day today.

256
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,500
- OK.
- Mori,

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,433
let me know if I can help.

258
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,133
Thank you.

259
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,100
Good luck.

260
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:13,633
Thank you.

261
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Alright.

262
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:22,567
They wouldn't even look at proposals
submitted by temps.

263
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,667
You think so?

264
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,266
The lunch box idea...

265
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,367
only a temp could come up with that.

266
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,934
I'm sure her idea won't be chosen.

267
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll tell you this.

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Submit her proposal as yours.

269
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:36,967
Why?

270
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,100
Because...

271
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,467
Hi.

272
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,433
Omae.

273
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:44,333
Do you think I should talk to her
about my proposal?

274
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,367
Sure.

275
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:52,333
When we change our ideas
180 degrees, we'll get along.

276
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,734
Why don't we team up?

277
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,100
What?

278
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,266
If we win the competition, I'll ask
the director to give you a raise.

279
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,567
This idea has been on
my mind for a month.

280
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,400
Actually, this wouldn't
work without you.

281
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,867
You're talking too much.

282
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,333
Alright.

283
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:11,967
I'll tell you.

284
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,734
Title is...

285
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,900
Tada!

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,834
Who fillets fish better,
Tsune or Haru?

287
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,667
- What do you think?
- No.

288
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,533
- Why?
- The title is not clever at all.

289
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,000
"Temp's Lunch Box"

290
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,667
Mori?

291
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,200
About this proposal,

292
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,100
you should talk to my restaurant.

293
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,867
They have many female customers
who are office workers.

294
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,500
That 500 yen restaurant?

295
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,400
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

296
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,734
They'd be perfect.

297
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,600
Their white rice is very good, too.

298
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,567
Great.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,400
They have that price because
the owner's family has a rice farm.

300
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,533
How do you know that?

301
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,767
The owner has a child who
is the same age as my daughter.

302
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,800
I see.

303
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,000
I had no idea.

304
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Let's use your connection,
and go ask the restaurant.

305
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,166
Can we?

306
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,333
Chief?

307
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,867
Kon, you're willing to help
Mori's proposal,

308
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,166
right?

309
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,734
- Right?
- Sure.

310
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,233
Thank you.

311
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,367
Let's go.

312
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,333
Let's go.

313
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,367
Right now.

314
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,533
Thank you, guys.

315
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:23,667
We'll be back.

316
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,667
We'll be back.

317
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:25,734
Bye.

318
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,266
Omae.

319
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,467
As part of the research
for Mori's proposal,

320
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:33,867
everyone went to a restaurant.

321
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,400
OK, so?

322
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,433
The deadline is tomorrow morning

323
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,200
so we want to finish it today.

324
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
If you could support her,

325
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,000
that'd be great.

326
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,533
OK. So what?

327
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,333
You can do this task tomorrow.

328
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,233
Please.

329
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,367
Is that a work order?

330
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,567
Yes.

331
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,100
Understood.

332
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,367
His name is Monta?

333
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
He's so cute.

334
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,467
So where do you buy vegetables from?

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,900
Why is S&amp;F asking a small restaurant
like us such questions?

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Well, we're...

337
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,166
in love with your amazing dishes
served at this restaurant.

338
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,266
Please.

339
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm sorry.

340
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:27,633
Here.

341
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,000
You guys.

342
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't make Monta cry.

343
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
Who is this lady?

344
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,734
Hi, Monta's Mum.

345
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,633
Hi, Nana's Dad.

346
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,667
Please don't bring weird people.

347
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:43,033
Monta's sensitive and shy.

348
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,367
Go home.

349
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,667
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,533
But can we talk a bit longer?

351
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,400
Just leave.

352
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,533
Haruko.

353
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,633
Welcome.

354
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,900
Haruko...

355
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,033
Amazing.

356
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,066
What's that song?

357
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,000
Nothing.

358
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,300
It's the sounds in wombs.

359
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,867
I made it into a song.

360
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,066
I just did it quickly.

361
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,200
You can just do that?

362
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,500
Incredible.

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,166
Do the research now.

364
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,100
Oh yeah.

365
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:58,333
First of all, tell us where
you buy vegetables from.

366
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,934
Maybe writing it in kanji makes
it look too stiff and formal?

367
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,900
You think so?

368
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,166
I personally like it.

369
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:09,967
What about using katakana?

370
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,200
In katakana?

371
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,834
It might make it more trendy.

372
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,934
What do you think, Mori?

373
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:16,900
Oh yeah.

374
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,266
"Temp's Lunch Box"

375
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah, that gives more of
a friendly feeling.

376
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,000
It's done.

377
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,367
What?

378
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Did you type up the proposal for me?

379
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:37,567
Can I see?

380
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,900
Whose name should I put on this?

381
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,767
Mori, right?

382
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,100
What?

383
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,967
But you all have
been helping me out.

384
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,767
How about we just say
"Marketing Division"?

385
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,333
What about this?

386
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,667
Miyuki Mori and Marketing Division's
team members.

387
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,500
I don't want to be part of this.

388
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,500
OK, what about this?

389
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,934
Miyuki Mori and Marketing Section's
fellow staff

390
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,834
(excluding Haruko Omae).

391
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:11,800
Too long.

392
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,433
This is perfect.

393
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,367
Ms Mori came up with the idea.

394
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,700
So please put her name.

395
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,967
That's not necessary, Chief.

396
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,967
Do you want this proposal
to be selected or not?

397
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,900
Of course I do.

398
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,834
I see.

399
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,600
I sent it.

400
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,800
I forwarded it to you, too.
Please check.

401
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,333
You forwarded it to me?

402
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,900
She put Chief's name.

403
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,233
I think that works.

404
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,700
He's in charge of
Marketing Section, after all.

405
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,367
Yes, I agree.

406
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,100
Mori...

407
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,633
It should be your name.

408
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,000
Haruko.

409
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,834
Thank you.

410
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,900
You made such a perfect proposal.

411
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,500
We might actually win this.

412
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,567
The idea that I had

413
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,934
might get recognised by the whole
company under Chief's name.

414
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,600
That'd be amazing.

415
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,700
Look at you.

416
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:26,400
You can push yourself hard
if it's for a man you like?

417
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:27,967
Yeah.

418
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,900
Idiot.

419
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,767
Falling in love with your co-worker

420
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,867
and getting motivated to
work harder at work.

421
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,133
It's so typical of
an unexperienced temp.

422
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,433
Really?

423
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't fall down and cry.

424
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,500
Hey!

425
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,066
"Cafe Cantante"

426
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,100
I'll be out for a while.

427
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,533
You're in charge of the store.

428
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,100
- No problem.
- Yes.

429
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,266
Bye.

430
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,433
What?

431
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,533
I don't know.

432
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,934
Hi Mr Satonaka. Welcome.

433
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:05,934
Hi.

434
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,567
Welcome.

435
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,400
This is a place
to enjoy flamenco.

436
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,767
Depressed customers are
not allowed.

437
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,567
Sorry.

438
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,567
It just doesn't make sense.

439
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,300
It was Mori's idea.

440
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,967
Temps will only stay for three
months, they can't be in charge.

441
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,467
If this Temp's Lunch Box idea

442
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,667
gets selected at the competition,

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,567
Mori will be recognised
and her contract will be renewed.

444
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:44,066
She can execute her idea herself.

445
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,166
It's not that easy.

446
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,033
You think it's all easy.

447
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,333
You think so?

448
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,533
Omae...

449
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:59,066
you said that it's only employees
who grow at companies.

450
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,166
Those words

451
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,000
are stuck in my mind.

452
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,567
So you think you can help
Miyuki Mori grow as a person?

453
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,100
Yes, Mori, Kon...

454
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,567
and you, too.

455
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,467
Me, too?

456
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:18,066
We can help each other

457
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,233
and encourage each other

458
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,200
and become better people together.

459
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,400
Can you protect...

460
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:31,834
Miyuki Mori?

461
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,133
I will.

462
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,533
It's not that easy.

463
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,567
That's what I'm talking about.

464
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,533
You can't protect temps
or Miyuki Mori's proposal.

465
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,934
That's why I put your name.

466
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,700
No.

467
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,667
I can't accept that.

468
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,700
Excuse me.

469
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,133
Check, please.

470
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,934
No worries. You only had water.

471
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,600
Thank you.

472
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,633
Thank you.

473
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,500
"Temp's Lunch Box"

474
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,767
"Miyuki Mori"

475
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,500
"Send"

476
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,166
Ken?

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,967
Still working on rice plastic?

478
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,200
Yeah.

479
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,367
I'm no good.

480
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:05,133
I can't come up with anything,
like I'm out of battery power.

481
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,200
The director left

482
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:13,100
to go to a restaurant with
Kyoko to talk about her idea.

483
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,367
This doesn't make sense.

484
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,700
When you think about it,

485
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:23,433
since Turtleneck joined,

486
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,033
I've been having such bad luck.

487
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,967
When I was the director's
favourite employee,

488
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,467
I was confident and proud,
but now it's gone.

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,900
Shoji.

490
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,633
Can you help me out on rice plastic?

491
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,400
Let's work on it together

492
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,800
and submit it with our names.

493
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,033
Really?

494
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:59,934
I need you aggressive attitude
for this proposal.

495
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,000
Ken.

496
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,533
Thank you.

497
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,567
What are you doing?

498
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,166
You're the only one who says
he needs me.

499
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,767
OK, I get it.

500
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,900
Temp's Lunch Box?

501
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,834
Right.

502
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:39,767
Young people come up with
such interesting ideas.

503
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,767
If that kind of lunch boxes existed,
I'd want to be a temp, too.

504
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,900
Do you think you'll last
as a temp?

505
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:51,266
Being a temp is a tough job.

506
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,500
But I heard that
there are so many of them.

507
00:23:57,734 --> 00:23:59,633
Temp's Lunch Box, huh?

508
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,734
This is Kirishima.

509
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,066
The results are already in?

510
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,900
Top five?

511
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,834
Our proposal?

512
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:13,467
Really?

513
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:18,500
What? That must be
some kind of a mistake.

514
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,734
We don't have an employee

515
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,333
with that name.

516
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,233
Oh yeah.

517
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,633
Can this be placed on hold for now?

518
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:28,600
Excuse me.

519
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,367
Sir?

520
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,333
Sir?

521
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,000
There's a proposal submitted
under the name of Miyuki Mori.

522
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,200
What's going on?

523
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,900
Do you mean Temp's Lunch Box?

524
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,934
It's one of the top five.

525
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,533
We did it!

526
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,233
You're amazing.

527
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:51,900
Mori.

528
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,100
Congrats.

529
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,667
But we submitted it under your name.

530
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:03,633
I changed it and resent it
under your name last night.

531
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,433
Chief.

532
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,166
Satonaka.

533
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,200
Come with me.

534
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:10,934
Sure.

535
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,200
Chief Satonaka is amazing.

536
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,233
I'm so happy for you.

537
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,934
They selected a proposal
submitted by a temp.

538
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,834
This company isn't
so bad, after all.

539
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,166
Really?

540
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,934
They selected a temp's proposal?

541
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,133
Really?

542
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,567
This is terrible.

543
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,533
So, you're a big shot now?

544
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:34,700
We couldn't dare to submit proposals
under our names.

545
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Ken shouldn't be making
a temp look good. Right?

546
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,667
Exactly.

547
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,033
I knew it was a bad idea.

548
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,567
I don't consider it my proposal.

549
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:49,166
I just wanted to help
Chief Satonaka.

550
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,100
Hey, you.

551
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,967
Don't act like a good girl.

552
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,066
I did it for Chief Satonaka.

553
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,667
For Chief Satonaka?

554
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,166
Seriously?

555
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,633
A love confession?

556
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,433
If that's the case,
say that in front of him.

557
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:05,834
Enough.

558
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,433
- She'll cry.
- Let her cry.

559
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,300
OK, fine.

560
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:13,467
You knew that you're in no position
to submit a proposal, right?

561
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:18,967
So if it's selected, we'll have to
work on a temp's project?

562
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:22,133
A temp's project?
I wouldn't be able to stand that.

563
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,767
Temp's Lunch Box, huh?

564
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:24,900
Mori...

565
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:29,433
I'm sorry for doing
what I wasn't supposed to do.

566
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,000
Mori!

567
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,934
Hey.

568
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,233
She's gone.

569
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,667
That's so loud.

570
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm doing my job.

571
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,066
Why don't you

572
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,667
go talk to her?

573
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,467
An employee should do that.

574
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,633
What?

575
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:55,100
You let your frustration out
on a temp

576
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,767
because you lost to a temp.

577
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,567
You guys are terrible.

578
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,400
The executives insisted on keeping
Temp's Lunch Box.

579
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,400
That means...

580
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,567
we could get strong support
from them.

581
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,433
It's likely to
be selected at the end.

582
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,166
I made Corporate
Planning Department wait.

583
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:25,433
Submit the proposal again
under your name.

584
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
But sir...

585
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,967
I can't do that.

586
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:33,734
Satonaka.

587
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:36,467
You should...

588
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:39,233
be more responsible
as an S&amp;F employee.

589
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:42,734
You should have never
submitted it under a temp's name.

590
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,333
Is that so?

591
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,867
Sir.

592
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,200
He doesn't understand me.

593
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,600
Explain it to him for me.

594
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,433
I told you many times.

595
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,700
If I used my name,

596
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,967
it's the same thing as
stealing Mori's idea.

597
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,734
It's just a boss using
a worker's idea.

598
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,266
That's all.

599
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,166
An employee needs to be
better than a temp.

600
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:22,133
This is our
80th anniversary competition.

601
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,233
A temp winning the competition
is unacceptable.

602
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:30,300
At least you get that, right?

603
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,233
No, this is wrong.

604
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,967
That temp...

605
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,800
she started to cry.

606
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,467
Mori?

607
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:46,767
In any case,

608
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,333
the more you try to protect her,

609
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:52,200
the harder things get for her.

610
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,867
Miyuki Mori!

611
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,066
Come out!

612
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:06,700
Haruko?

613
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,400
Wait until the lunch break to cry.

614
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,734
You still have 45 minutes.

615
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,600
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:16,567
But...

617
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,467
I can't stop crying.

618
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,767
I'll forcibly open this door!

619
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,867
During the work hours,

620
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,367
make sure to turn off your phone.

621
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,033
I'm sorry.

622
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,567
Hello? Mr Hitotsugi?

623
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:47,567
Where are you, Mori?

624
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,900
In the company restroom.

625
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,433
You've been there for a while?

626
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:56,333
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,400
It's fine, I understand.

628
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,567
People cry in a restroom stall
the most when getting bullied

629
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,967
and when there's drama
with employees.

630
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,967
Don't worry. It happens.

631
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:14,900
It's an emergency,
so I'll ask you directly.

632
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,767
Do you have feelings for
Chief Satonaka?

633
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,066
I'm so sorry.

634
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,767
I understand. Can you hear me?

635
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,367
In any case, stop feeling bad
and go back to work.

636
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,333
I'm on my way, too.

637
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,066
Good. You stopped crying.

638
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,767
If it was really your proposal,

639
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
don't let those men crash you.

640
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,700
You did it for Chief Satonaka?

641
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,300
I don't believe that.

642
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,567
Kuroiwa?

643
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,433
I apologise for the trouble
Miyuki Mori caused to your company.

644
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,500
She told me

645
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:15,433
that she wants to fully focus
on her work going forward.

646
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
It appears...

647
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,500
that she doesn't
fit in our company.

648
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:27,700
Well, she's been a temp
for only two months.

649
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,367
I'm sure she'll fit in eventually.

650
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,200
If anything, she's very motivated.

651
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,734
She is motivated,

652
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,667
but not in the direction
that we would like her to go.

653
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,166
She's not a good match for us.

654
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,734
So...

655
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:45,867
Can you...

656
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,066
please arrange something for her?

657
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:50,867
Sir.

658
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,700
Please reconsider.

659
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Sorry for making you come
all the way to see us.

660
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,867
Sorry, Hitotsugi.

661
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,400
I feel sorry for her.

662
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,300
Whose decision was it?

663
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:35,767
Mine.

664
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:40,433
You want to say something?

665
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:45,233
You already knew
this would happen, right?

666
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:48,800
Yes.

667
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,233
With your dignity,

668
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:52,867
personality,

669
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,433
character...

670
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,934
Given all that I know about you,

671
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,533
I knew this would happen.

672
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,934
Excuse me.

673
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,633
Sorry, let's go.

674
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,367
Sir!

675
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,967
Is it true that you're firing Mori?

676
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:27,433
Hitotsugi will take care of it.

677
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,967
Don't do anything.

678
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,700
Please wait.

679
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,600
Please explain what's happening.

680
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,033
Is it because of the proposal?

681
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,567
Sir!

682
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,000
I understand.

683
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:49,533
I'm sorry...

684
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,100
for all the trouble I caused you.

685
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,533
When a temp is fired,
60% of the time,

686
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,567
it's because they don't fit in.

687
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:00,600
That's just...

688
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,066
false accusation.

689
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,567
I believed in this company.

690
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,967
I'm disappointed with
Director Kirishima.

691
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:15,934
Hitotsugi...

692
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,300
Please don't be so upset.

693
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,900
It's all my fault.

694
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,734
I'll try finding
your next job quickly.

695
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,333
Please cheer up.

696
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:35,967
Sure.

697
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
Let's do our best.

698
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:39,900
Both of us.

699
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:44,900
Sure.

700
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,533
How did this happen?

701
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,934
I didn't know this could happen.

702
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,266
I will withdraw Mori's proposal.

703
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:00,633
Do you seriously think you could
bring her back by doing that?

704
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,633
I warned you many times.

705
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,033
Shoji.

706
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:06,934
Tomorrow,

707
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,500
I'll go talk to the director.

708
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,934
Tell me where his dojo is.

709
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,300
Don't do it.

710
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,266
I'm serious.

711
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't do it. Oh!

712
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,734
Wow, Turtleneck.

713
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,767
You teleported again.

714
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,734
Were you eavesdropping?

715
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:25,133
You talk loud, so I can't help
listening even if I don't want to.

716
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:27,800
Omae...

717
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:31,867
- I will--
- He said that he'd protect Mori.

718
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,834
But look what he's doing.

719
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,133
That's how much a temp means
to a company.

720
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,533
Once there's a problem,
they're fired.

721
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,233
No.

722
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,533
I haven't given up yet.

723
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,133
Getting fired just because
the proposal got selected.

724
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,166
That's unacceptable.

725
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,367
To protect someone,

726
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,000
risk your body or your life.

727
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,166
Or risk your job.

728
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,633
You can't do that, can you?

729
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:01,934
Ken did it.

730
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,867
He argued against the director
and now he's also in trouble.

731
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,467
Do you know how hard it is
to be an employee?

732
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,600
I don't want to know.

733
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,567
Problem?

734
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:13,934
Omae.

735
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,433
Please.

736
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,734
Please tell me how

737
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,367
I can protect Ms Mori.

738
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:21,133
You can't do it.

739
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,100
If you're just nice,

740
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:24,967
you can't protect anyone.

741
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:27,400
I...

742
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,400
I'll show you how.

743
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,400
Omae.

744
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
What?

745
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,633
Did she say that she'll
show you how?

746
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,567
This is Haruko Omae.

747
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,066
I'm not available.

748
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:00,667
Hello?

749
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,033
This is Miyuki Mori.

750
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,433
They terminated
my contract as of today.

751
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:12,667
I'm sorry that I kept causing
you a lot of trouble.

752
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,900
I thought I could work harder
for a man I like.

753
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,133
That was so arrogant of me.

754
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,300
Next time, I'll try just for myself.

755
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:43,967
Three.

756
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,033
Four.

757
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,800
- Five.
- Louder.

758
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,033
Seven.

759
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,033
- Eight.
- Sir.

760
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,133
Nine.

761
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,200
Ten.

762
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:52,233
Good morning.

763
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,967
Why are you wearing a suit today?

764
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm not here for the practice.

765
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,266
Seven, eight.

766
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,266
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:03,967
He really wants to talk to you.

768
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:04,967
Three.

769
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:07,433
I'm sorry to bother you
on your day off.

770
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,133
I know what you want.

771
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:10,567
Go home.

772
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,467
Sir!

773
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,033
If you're going to fire Ms Mori,

774
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,767
our section will withdraw
the proposal.

775
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,800
Five, six.

776
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,367
Seven, eight.

777
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,867
What an idiot.

778
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,734
I don't have time for this.

779
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,600
I won't leave until you talk to me.

780
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,033
- Ken.
- Sir!

781
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,066
Excuse me.

782
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,266
Omae.

783
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:51,600
What's going on?

784
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,800
Sir.

785
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:55,033
Please have a match with me.

786
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,100
Do you play Japanese fencing, too?

787
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
I'm only at level four.

788
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,100
Mr Kirishima.

789
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,734
- She looks strong.
- Please have a match!

790
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,266
Please have a match!

791
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:06,867
Please.

792
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:09,867
Put your protective gear on.

793
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:11,300
Right away.

794
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,467
Now.

795
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,467
Let's begin.

796
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:31,533
Alright.

797
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,834
Now...

798
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:36,800
Begin!

799
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,934
You're not bad.

800
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,633
- No way.
- Mr Kirishima's getting defeated.

801
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:08,734
Go! Go!

802
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,033
Don't fire Miyuki Mori.

803
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:15,700
Here.

804
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,133
If you don't want to get humiliated
in front of these kids,

805
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,533
don't fire Miyuki Mori.

806
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,600
It's not over yet.

807
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,300
What are you doing?

808
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,867
I'm tired so make an attack.

809
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,467
That's it.

810
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,867
Yay!

811
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,667
It looked like she intentionally
let him win.

812
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:08,767
Yay!

813
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,767
I've got a terrible feeling tonight.

814
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:37,767
What?

815
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,433
Welcome.

816
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,433
Look at that.

817
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,367
So this is Haruko's bar.

818
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,600
You brought a lot of people tonight.

819
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,300
They're throwing me
a farewell party.

820
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,300
Omae.

821
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,233
Chief Satonaka will join later.

822
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,500
Please take a seat.

823
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,967
Let's sit down.

824
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,834
Chief Satonaka's late.

825
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,567
Why don't we start without him?

826
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,633
That sounds good.

827
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,233
OK, then, a word from our guest
of honour, Ms Mori.

828
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:13,867
- Yeah!
- Mori.

829
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:14,867
Go ahead.

830
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Well...

831
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,200
It was such a short time,

832
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,467
but thank you for everything
you did for me.

833
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:28,100
This way.

834
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:29,133
OK.

835
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,633
Are you OK?

836
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,100
Hurry.

837
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,700
I didn't have a welcoming ceremony

838
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:40,200
or welcoming party
when I became a temp.

839
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
But...

840
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:45,867
I met such wonderful people

841
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,734
who'd throw me a party like this.

842
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,667
I'm very happy.

843
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,066
Mori...

844
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:55,100
Say no more.

845
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,967
When you're old,
things make you cry easily.

846
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,100
Mori.

847
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,600
Hitotsugi.

848
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:03,967
Chief, too.

849
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:05,900
Why are you here?

850
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,200
Mori...

851
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,600
You don't need to leave.

852
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,200
What?

853
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,433
Director Kirishima just called me.

854
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,834
He'd like you to continue working
until your contract ends.

855
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:19,867
No way.

856
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,734
Why?

857
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,066
I'm not sure.

858
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,033
But he suddenly changed his mind.

859
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,266
Really?

860
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:32,333
I wonder why? What a surprise!

861
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:34,200
It's no longer a farewell party

862
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,934
but a celebration!

863
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:36,900
Let's make a toast.

864
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,033
Come on.

865
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,600
I'm so relieved.

866
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,834
I still have my job, then.

867
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:48,333
Two more glasses and
a bottle of wine, please.

868
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:49,767
Let's drink.

869
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm happy that finally I get to
have a drink with you.

870
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,800
Can you pour me a drink?

871
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,300
I'm drinking by myself.

872
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:01,066
Problem?

873
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,867
"Temp's Lunch Box"

874
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:09,300
Sir.

875
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,133
I'll update this proposal

876
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,367
and make sure it'll get selected.

877
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:15,867
Satonaka and I'll do it.

878
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:16,967
Not him.

879
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,533
He doesn't understand.

880
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:22,433
For this proposal,

881
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:24,900
you're in charge.

882
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:30,800
Understood.

883
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,600
Let us see it.

884
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,734
I'll do it.

885
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,367
Omae.

886
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,533
Thank you for doing that
for Mori.

887
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,033
It's not necessary for you
to thank me.

888
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm not giving up.

889
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:52,934
about Temp's Lunch Box.

890
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,033
You're still saying that?

891
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,600
"To be continued..."

892
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,133
An arranged marriage?

893
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,367
You still have time.

894
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,233
Here, take this.

895
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,500
Finally, she's opening up to me.

896
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:14,100
Satonaka will be transferred.

897
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,834
He doesn't contribute
to our division.

898
00:45:15,934 --> 00:45:17,233
So you'll just give up?

899
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:19,967
Make it happen.
