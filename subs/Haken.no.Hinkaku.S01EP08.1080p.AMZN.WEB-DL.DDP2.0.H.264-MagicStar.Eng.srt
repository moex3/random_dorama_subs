1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,100
This is fun, it's like
we're going on a road trip.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,066
You're right.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,767
Why don't we sing a song together?

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,100
Chief.

5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,734
This stupid girl

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,266
is getting field trips

7
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:16,400
mixed up with business trips.

8
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:18,266
Stupid girl?

9
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,333
As part of my job,

10
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,533
I came along to see
rice plastic production site.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,233
You can't make me sing songs
on the way back.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,734
Sure, but let's try to have
a good time.

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,200
About rice plastic...

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,433
I thought maybe we can use it
for the Temp's Lunch Box.

15
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,567
But it'd be hard
if each piece cost 100 yen.

16
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,000
Not him.

17
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,033
He doesn't understand.

18
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,300
For this project,...

19
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:51,467
you're in charge.

20
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:54,533
Don't tell Satonaka yet.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,367
Also,

22
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:58,934
watch out for Haruko Omae.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,433
Oh!

24
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,100
Don't glare at me
through the mirror!

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,033
You're scary.

26
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,467
You usually talk nonsense nonstop

27
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,533
but today you're so quiet
that I thought you were dead.

28
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,633
I am alive. Don't think I'm dead.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,166
You seem down, Shoji.

30
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,100
What's wrong?

31
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,333
Nothing.

32
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,166
Don't do your weird exercise
in the car.

33
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,934
I'm checking safety. Problem?

34
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,000
There are no cars around.
No way you'll get into an accident.

35
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,266
If you're not happy,
get out of my car.

36
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,166
Just start the car.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,834
How much longer
do you need to check?

38
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,700
The car's not moving.

39
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,066
Is it broken?

40
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,166
What's going on?

41
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,033
What do we do?

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,700
What happened?

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,533
Oh, Haruko, maybe you are

44
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:11,166
a certified auto mechanic, too?

45
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,633
Oh yeah.

46
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,367
You're an elevator mechanic.

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,700
This should be easy.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,367
You can repair this, right?

49
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,433
Haruko?

50
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,667
Please.

51
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:21,767
Please.

52
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,567
Hurry up, Turtleneck.

53
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,567
- Hey.
- Be quiet.

54
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,333
Don't talk to me.

55
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,967
You've done something irreparable.

56
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,867
That can't be right.

57
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,633
For Haruko, nothing is impossible.

58
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,266
But you don't need
to take apart the car.

59
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,834
Just fix what's wrong with it.

60
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:49,633
Hey.

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,200
Are you sure you're okay?

62
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,633
Do you really have
a certificate in this?

63
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:55,834
No.

64
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:56,767
Problem?

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
What?

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,300
I never said I had a certificate.

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,500
So what?

68
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,834
Omae...

69
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,100
Chief.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,367
I've never fixed a car.

71
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,767
But as you can see,

72
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,000
I've done everything I could do.

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,066
Unfortunately,

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
it's six o'clock, so I'm leaving.

75
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,767
Hey! Clearly you don't think
this is unfortunate.

76
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,633
You'll just leave this and go home?

77
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,033
Please call JAF.

78
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,500
Say that before you take
the entire car apart.

79
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:35,500
Hey! Wait!

80
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,633
- So there are things...
- You're in charge of this.

81
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,000
Haruko can't do.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
- That's a company car!
- Proud employees will have a fall.

83
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,867
Companies won't survive
without temp workers now.

84
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,467
For example, Haruko Omae here.

85
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:53,467
"Impossible" and "social skills"
are not in her dictionary.

86
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,967
She shuts down
all troublesome relationships

87
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:01,166
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

88
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:05,433
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

89
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,834
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

90
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,433
That's still a mystery.

91
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,200
"The Pride Of The Temp"

92
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:24,100
"A marriage proposal to a temp!?"

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,834
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,567
I want to get myself fired up.

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,166
Let's do our best, Mori!

96
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:34,567
With Temp's Lunch Box.

97
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,033
Why don't you join us, Mr Ogasawara?

98
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,500
Would it be good for my back?

99
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,100
Does that mean I should also
do this?

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,700
Let's do Omae Exercise together,
Chief.

101
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,200
No, thanks.

102
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:52,400
You can continue,
but can I have your attention?

103
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,834
For Temp's Lunch Box,

104
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:59,166
I think it's important to hear
the temp workers' opinions.

105
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,633
Let's do a questionnaire.

106
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,800
We'll set the menu and price
according to that.

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
What do you think?

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,367
Stop copying me.

109
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't give my exercise a name

110
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,934
or copy my movement!

111
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,500
Okay, the exercise.

112
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,834
Good morning, Marketing Section.

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,066
What's up, Shoji?

114
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,600
About the lunch box project

115
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,867
you guys are no longer in charge.

116
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,767
I'll be in charge on this,
representing Sales Division.

117
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,834
Again?

118
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,867
You said again?

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,734
This was Mori's idea.

120
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,900
I can't let a temp worker be
in charge of the final presentation.

121
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,333
Sorry about that, Ken.

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,867
You don't mind, right?

123
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,700
- But...
- By the way, Ken...

124
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,133
we had quite a day yesterday,
didn't we?

125
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,967
Good for you, Turtleneck,
because you can teleport.

126
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,033
We were in trouble after you left.

127
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,567
JAF was shocked.

128
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,367
This is a director's order.

129
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:01,667
Come with me.

130
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:04,700
Director's order?

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
She's going to help me out
on the project that I'm promoting.

132
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm the chief.

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,734
Don't ignore me.

134
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Omae...

135
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,900
please go and see.

136
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,100
Okay.

137
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,266
I'm your boss now.

138
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,934
I'll straight up
your twisted temp ideas.

139
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,433
Chief Shoji.

140
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,800
You're obedient.

141
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,133
You can tell me that

142
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:35,166
after you get your twisted
headpiece straightened.

143
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,266
As I said, this isn't a headpiece!

144
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,367
Did you say I should
get it straightened?

145
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,467
That's the word
I never wants to hear.

146
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,300
Mori.

147
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,133
It's fine.

149
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,166
You don't need to apologise.

150
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,533
This won't work, Miyashita.
Do it again.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,867
What's going on with
the Mitsuboshi Bento chains?

152
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,500
They're putting together
a quote for us now.

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,834
I'm waiting for them.

154
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,100
Don't just wait. Go and negotiate
to lower the price.

155
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,834
Five days until the presentation.

156
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:12,467
Okay.

157
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:14,700
- This is finished.
- That was so fast.

158
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,900
I thought you'd say no to this.

159
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,567
I was curious to see
whose side you would take.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,367
We temps only does
what we're told to do.

161
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,033
We don't take sides.

162
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,500
I see.

163
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,300
Anyway,
the executives love this project.

164
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
So it has to be perfect.

165
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,166
I'm counting on you.

166
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,433
Shoji.

167
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,133
Can I talk to you?

168
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,100
An arranged marriage?

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,300
For me?

170
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,567
She's the daughter
of Taiyo Bank's president.

171
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:55,000
We talked to them at
the golf competition the other day.

172
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,300
Excuse me.

173
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:58,934
Wow.

174
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,467
She is the president's daughter?

175
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,200
She is interested in you,

176
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
or rather, in your jokes
and wants to see you.

177
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,367
You'll see her, right?

178
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,500
It's Taiyo Bank.

179
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,367
Thank you.

180
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,867
That's awesome, Shoji.

181
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,166
Hey, Satonaka.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,700
Are you okay about him
taking the project?

183
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,567
Yeah.

184
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,533
Now he might possibly marry
the daughter of an executive.

185
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,000
He's moving up in the world.

186
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,100
Shoji.

187
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,233
Our team would like to help
with your presentation.

188
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,767
We can have 1,000 people
take the questionnaire.

189
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,800
You don't have to do that.

190
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,667
But I want to.

191
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,533
You'll go for the girl?

192
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,033
Well...

193
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,266
it was suggested by the director,

194
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,300
so I can't say no.

195
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,033
Turtleneck.

196
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,400
Bring tea to the meeting room,
Turtleneck.

197
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm still on my break.

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,834
In that case...

199
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,734
I just want to talk.

200
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,667
I...

201
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,800
I got a possible proposal
for an arranged marriage.

202
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,734
I don't know what to do.

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,367
Any reactions?

204
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,000
So it's not too late.

205
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,667
What?

206
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,033
If you'd like...

207
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,867
before you see her...

208
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:28,967
this.

209
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:31,900
Please call.

210
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,834
Could this be...

211
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,066
her number?

212
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,233
It must be.

213
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,200
She's finally opening up to me.

214
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,600
What? Why do you look sad?

215
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,667
Open it.

216
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Oh yeah.

217
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,633
What's this?

218
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,700
"Hair salon - to straighten hair"

219
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,200
What's this?

220
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,700
It's one o'clock.
Get out my way, I'm making tea.

221
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
Hey.

222
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,967
Don't you ever talk to me
about hair straightening.

223
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,433
- I...
- Shoji.

224
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,800
I tried it before.

225
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,767
- Shoji!
- It didn't work.

226
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,633
For the Temp's Lunch Box,

227
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,166
let's do what we can do
as a team.

228
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,433
I upset Chief Shoji
and now I'm off his project.

229
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,433
What?

230
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,800
He told me to get out when
I used the word "straight" again.

231
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,467
Alright.

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,934
Please help us
make the questionnaire, then.

233
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,667
Our goal is to get answers
from 1,000 temp workers.

234
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:38,967
Chief.

235
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,834
Why are you doing this much
for Chief Shoji?

236
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,266
Even if you get along with him,
I'd never want to be his friend.

237
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,667
Calm down.

238
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,567
Mr Shoji is...

239
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,433
not a bad person.

240
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,767
He gets blinded when his promotion
is on the line, though.

241
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,567
That's what we call a bad person.

242
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,033
Excuse me...

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
but why are you doing this?

244
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,233
Mori.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Can I be a bit selfish about this?

246
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,567
I want to make

247
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,266
products that make people happy
when they eat.

248
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,266
That's why I joined this company.

249
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,133
This project reminds me
of why I wanted to join the company.

250
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
Temp's Lunch Box

251
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
is exactly
what I've been wanting to do.

252
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,166
It doesn't matter
who does the presentation.

253
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,633
The most important things
is to make it happen.

254
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,800
So please

255
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,166
give me your support.

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,433
Sure.

257
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,900
Let's do the questionnaire.

258
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,467
Omae, anything you want to say?

259
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:52,400
You sound like an essay written
by an elementary school kid.

260
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,900
Working at a company
isn't that easy.

261
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,800
But if it's my job, I'll do it.

262
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,667
Thank you.

263
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:10,100
Chief Satonaka
is a wonderful person.

264
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,834
- Okay.
- Really.

265
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,667
I won't be distracted anymore.

266
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm very happy that I get to work
under a boss like him.

267
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,333
There are only two types
of employees.

268
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,600
First,

269
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,133
the type that works for promotions.

270
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:32,934
Second,

271
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,900
the type that works for others.

272
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,033
Chief Shoji must be the first type.

273
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,800
The second type is liked
by their subordinates

274
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
but the company treats them
like idiots.

275
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,033
I can't bear to look at them.

276
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,133
We're on a ship made of mud.

277
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,033
Made of mud?

278
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,166
I hope that until our contract ends,

279
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,000
the ship stays afloat.

281
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,734
What are you doing, Shoji?

282
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,400
Counting steps to your promotion?

283
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,100
Yeah, sure.

284
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,133
It doesn't make sense to me.

285
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,600
After all, the project belongs to...

286
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh well...

287
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,633
we can't go against our director.

288
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,500
If the presentation goes well,
maybe you'll be a section chief.

289
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,834
You'll then marry a daughter
of a bank executive.

290
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,200
Not only a section chief,

291
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,000
but maybe even an executive?

292
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,166
Sure.

293
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,333

"How much do you want to spend
on a lunch box?"

297
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:08,100
Where they eat their lunch
is also very important.

298
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,934
Some might eat alone at their desk

299
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,533
while others might go to a park
with friends.

Yeah.

301
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,100

- Sure.

Hey.

Why wouldn't I be good at it?

You have an intense aura.

Excuse me, this is a questionnaire
about your lunch.

Could you answer it?

313

We're doing a questionnaire.
Are you temp workers?

00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,667
- Mori.
- Yes.

337
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,767
It's six now, you can go home.

338
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,800
I'll stay a bit longer.

339
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,033
Excuse me.

340
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,667
This is a questionnaire
about your lunch.

341
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,500
Can you answer it?

342
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:54,567
Excuse me.

343
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,200
Can you please answer
our questionnaire?

344
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,533
Thank you.

345
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,166
Please help us
with our questionnaire.

346
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,333
Mori?

347
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,333
Hitotsugi!

348
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,100
Six hundred people have answered.

349
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,834
Four hundred more to go.

350
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,834
Hi there.

351
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,767
Hitotsugi.

352
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,800
If you guys are doing this,
please let me be part of it.

353
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,834
We're doing a skill-up training
at our agency today.

354
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,934
We need your feedback
to make our lunchboxes.

355
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,266
Thank you.

356
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,667
Thank you.

357
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,133
Lunch Box of the temps,

358
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,567
by the temps, and for the temps.

359
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,133
Please spend some time
answering the questionnaire.

360
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,133
Thank you for your cooperation.

361
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,033
Thank you.

362
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,467
Are you a temp, too?

363
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,300
Yes.

364
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,166
This was her idea.

365
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,600
I'm excited to see
how the lunch box turns out.

366
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,533
Thank you.

367
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,867
I like that it's written
in katakana.

368
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:57,500
I was the one who changed it.

369
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,033
Thank you.

370
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you.

371
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,734
Great.

372
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,967
You have a puppy?

373
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,033
Speaking of puppies,

374
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:16,567
I have a friend who looks like
a lost puppy when he's down.

375
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Like what?

376
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,433
Like this.

377
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,934
Oh wow.

378
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,533
That's so cute.

379
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,200
You think it's cute?

380
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,633
We have a troublesome temp worker.

381
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:29,333
Turtleneck is always insulting me.

382
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,467
Turtleneck?

383
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,633
Yeah.

384
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,667
What's wrong?

385
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,600
Say something funny.

386
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,066
Okay.

387
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,500
Something funny?

388
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh, the president.

389
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,000
Welcome.

390
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,433
You're alone tonight?

391
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,533
That's rare. come in.

392
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,467
Please leave.

393
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,233
Wow.

394
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,000
So scary.

395
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Why? So sudden.

396
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,400
I have a scary face. Problem?

397
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,767
Alright.

398
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,900
Let's not fight today.

399
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,667
I was on a date with that girl

400
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,100
and I feel happy now.

401
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
You went on a date without
straightening your hair?

402
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,133
As I said before--

403
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,767
Reiko would never say mean things
like that.

404
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,667
Reiko is the president's daughter.

405
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,200
Is he here to brag about his date?

406
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,100
If I marry her,

407
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,567
I'll be a winner for sure.

408
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:08,734
You're right,
except for your headpiece.

409
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,467
This is my natural hair.

410
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:16,133
They say rich people don't fight.

411
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,567
Ken's not here to stop me though.

412
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,767
His hair is straight,
and so is his heart.

413
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:25,967
You know what?

414
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,867
You said that you don't take sides.

415
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,600
But you're on Ken's side.

416
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,967
Compared to you, Chief Satonaka

417
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,834
is better as a person.

418
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,367
Keep talking.

419
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:44,834
I'm sure you have more.

420
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,767
The director's suck-up.

421
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,700
Interceptor.

422
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,800
An idea thief.

423
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,700
Actually, I've heard enough.

424
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Oh yeah.

425
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,967
I have one compliment for you.

426
00:19:58,867 --> 00:19:59,800
What?

427
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,834
That is...

428
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,667
that you care about
your friends a lot.

429
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,667
But right now,...

430
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,000
you've even lost that.

431
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,600
But I'm a winner.

432
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,333
That's right.

433
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,667
I'll tell you this.

434
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,900
You can't be arrogant much longer.

435
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,433
The gap is widening.

436
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,500
Even with your skills,

437
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,233
your future as a temp is dark.

438
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,633
I don't need you
to be worried about me.

439
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,734
Hey, wait.

440
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,266
What did you come here for?

441
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,467
To talk about our future.

442
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,367
About the gap, again?

443
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,367
No, that's not it.

444
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,433
I...

445
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,867
I think I'll decline
this arranged marriage.

446
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
You don't mean that.

447
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,934
For someone who likes
being tied to the company,

448
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,000
it's the perfect offer.

449
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
True.

450
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,600
You're right.

451
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,667
You...

452
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,266
you've always won by clinging
onto Director Kirishima.

453
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,800
If you go against him,

454
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,266
you won't survive at that company.

455
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,300
That's also true.

456
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,266
Going against the boss

457
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,066
is something a loser does.

458
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,967
That's right.

459
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,500
After all,...

460
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,900
you'll marry her because
your director told you to.

461
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,166
That's annoying.

462
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,033
A temp can't tell me who to marry.

463
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,000
Why is an employee asking a temp
for advice about marriage?

464
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,266
That is...

465
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,066
You exhaust me.

466
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,066
No, listen to me.

467
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,934
You're the one I want to marry.

468
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,200
Because of the arrange marriage,

469
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,266
I want your answer quickly.

470
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,700
That's crazy, like your hair.

471
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,567
I'm serious.

472
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,867
Check, please.

473
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,700
It's fine.

474
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,867
- Don't worry today.
- Here.

475
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm a winner.

476
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,000
Haruko.

477
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,333
- What will you do?
- What an idiot.

478
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,633
Thirty one more days to go.

479
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:17,767
Good morning.

480
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,166
Good morning.

481
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,133
Please wait.

482
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,533
Shoji.

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,667
Yes?

484
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,900
It's the president calling.

485
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,934
Do you want to take this?

486
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,967
Please give me a second.

487
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,567
Hey.

488
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,700
Give me an answer.

489
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,867
- Answer.
- Yes?

490
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,133
Not that kind of answer.

491
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:44,967
About last night.

492
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,066
- Shoji?
- Hurry.

493
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,400
Shoji.

494
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,266
What are you doing?

495
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,800
Okay.

496
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,100
She gave me feedback.

497
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,166
What?

498
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,567
She said, perfect.

499
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:02,200
You'll accept it, right?
I already told him so.

500
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,100
Good job.

501
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,166
Thank you.

502
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,266
Keep it up,...

503
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,333
and win that presentation tomorrow.

504
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,633
Yes.

505
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,967
He couldn't be happier.

506
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,500
Shoji.

507
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,767
Congratulations.

508
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,734
You're going straight to success.

509
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,066
I'll follow you for life.

510
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,500
Shoji.

511
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,100
Tomorrow is the presentation.

512
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,166
Let's do this.

513
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,300
Yeah!

514
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,667
- Good morning.
- It looks like it's a done deal.

515
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,333
Is that true?

516
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,166
The most requested

517
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,367
is tasty rice.

518
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:51,767
Yeah, Japanese people love
white rice, after all.

519
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,100
Many like brown rice, too.

520
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,433
Omelette was the most liked
among side dishes.

521
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,734
They would spend up to 500 yen.

522
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,667
It can't be more than 500 yen.

523
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,033
Everyone.

524
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,667
You all did a great job.

525
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,166
Nice job.

526
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,100
Hitotsugi,

527
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,867
thank you for your help.

528
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:09,900
No problem.

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,033
It really helped us.

530
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,533
I'm glad to help.

531
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:17,700
I've never seen a temp's idea being
selected in my entire career.

532
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm proud of you, Mori.

533
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,667
The company treats it
as Chief Shoji's project.

534
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,734
Is that so?

535
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,333
- Not Chief Satonaka's?
- No.

536
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,934
- Chief Shoji?
- Yes.

537
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,767
Here it is.

538
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,033
Mori.

539
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,333
You're so good at drawing.

540
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,834
You're a good artist.

541
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:40,967
It's pretty.

542
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,600
- It looks tasty.
- It's our lunch box.

543
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,567
Did you draw one, too?

544
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,000
Look at that.

545
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,533
Did you draw it seriously?

546
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,166
It's like my daughter's drawing.

547
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,700
That's her weakness?

548
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,667
That's our important questionnaire.

549
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,800
Please calm down, it's fine.

550
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,266
This won't be in your resume.

551
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,066
I'll go deliver this.

552
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,734
- Thank you.
- I'll be back.

553
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,100
Thank you.

554
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,934
Alright.

555
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,233
What am I doing?

556
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,767
"Temp's Lunch Box"

557
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,333
"Shoji Takeshi"

558
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,967
Please check this, sir.

559
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:27,867
Excuse me.

560
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:28,900
What's up, Ken?

561
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,200
Here you go.

562
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,333
Feedback from the 1,000 temps

563
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,000
and the analysis results.

564
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,066
- You really asked 1,000 people?
- Yeah.

565
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,000
Use this for the presentation.

566
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:46,133
This is the kind of lunch box
temp workers are looking for.

567
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,900
It's so idealistic.

568
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
We can't achieve this price.

569
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:54,900
Our division decided to collaborate
with lunch box store chains

570
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,266
and let them figure everything out.

571
00:26:57,834 --> 00:27:00,133
That'd be just like
a regular lunch box,

572
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,000
But this isn't realistic.

573
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,834
That's enough, Satonaka.

574
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Sir...

575
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:10,633
Go back to your section

576
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:12,333
and work.

577
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,300
See you tomorrow.

578
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,266
Omae.

579
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,600
Yes?

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,467
The questionnaire...

581
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,266
they didn't take it.

582
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,734
I wanted to make our customers happy

583
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,100
so I made the questionnaire.

584
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,066
But they said it wasn't realistic.

585
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,066
Okay. So?

586
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,300
What was I doing?

587
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,233
Everyone worked hard...

588
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:02,066
and I feel bad for them.

589
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,934
More than anything...

590
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,066
I feel bad for the 1,000 temp
workers that we talked to.

591
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,166
You're always like this.

592
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,500
You didn't do anything...

593
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,333
but you always feel guilty.

594
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,767
All you do is being depressed.

595
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,200
You haven't done anything yet.

596
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:35,166
They said that it was unrealistic,

597
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:36,967
so you'll just give it up?

598
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,433
If it's unrealistic,...

599
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,200
then make it realistic.

600
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:56,667
Alright.

601
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,433
Thank you.

602
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

603
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,600
See you.

604
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,734
Nice work, guys.

605
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:02,934
Don't be late tomorrow.

606
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,033
Of course.

607
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,533
He's unbelievable.

608
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,800
I'll talk to him.

609
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,233
Shoji.

610
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:18,633
Yes?

611
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,333
Satonaka will be transferred.

612
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,400
He's not contributing
to our sales department.

613
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,233
He'll go to our subsidiary.

614
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:29,867
Sir...

615
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,100
Satonaka will be transferred.

616
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,800
He's not contributing
to our sales department.

617
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,000
He'll go to our subsidiary.

618
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh.

619
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,767
You're still here?

620
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,133
You want coffee?

621
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:18,767
Shoji?

622
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm sorry, Ken.

623
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,133
About the questionnaire?

624
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
It's fine.

625
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,600
I know that 500 yen isn't realistic,

626
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,300
but with reasonable producers...

627
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,934
Please stop now.

628
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:49,967
I knew it.

629
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,367
I knew you would...

630
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,533
let me have your project.

631
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,633
You've always been like this.

632
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,333
Ever since we joined the company,...

633
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,967
you let me take the credit.

634
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,500
What's going on?

635
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:19,600
What happened?

636
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,033
Why are you worried about me?

637
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,800
Why aren't you angry with me?

638
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:31,700
That's why the director...

639
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,500
What is it?

640
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,500
We've always worked
under our director.

641
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,867
If he fired us,...

642
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
we'd have nowhere to go.

643
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
But...

644
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,433
this is the only way I know.

645
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,467
You should be better than this.

646
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,500
I can't.

647
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,767
I can't be like you, Shoji.

648
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,934
You're right.

649
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,433
Shoji?

650
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Why are you so upset?

651
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,066
You can talk to me about anything.

652
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,834
I'm so sick of this.

653
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,433
I'm sick of
stupid people-pleasers like you.

654
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:37,066
I finally understand
why you take temps' side.

655
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,667
Because you're a loser like them.

656
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,667
Shoji.

657
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,467
Shoji, you were

658
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,934
saved by Omae in a pinch.

659
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,734
You don't get to call her a loser.

660
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,867
Take advantage of temps,
and then throw them away.

661
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,800
Are you serious?

662
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,633
Yes.

663
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,967
You know...

664
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,066
I don't care about Temp's Lunch Box.

665
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,200
Thanks to you,
I'll be promoted again.

666
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,533
No hard feelings.

667
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,033
It's your fault that you're used
as a stepping stone.

668
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,533
Finally, you're angry.

669
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,166
By the way,...

670
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,934
do you like Turtleneck?

671
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:43,967
What if I do?

672
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
I...

673
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,900
I like her.

674
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,300
I knew it.

675
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,000
Why didn't you say anything?

676
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,433
Why did you say that
you'd back me up?

677
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
That's the part
I hate the most about you.

678
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Why do you always let me
have everything?

679
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,433
Shoji.

680
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,600
You're being easy on me.

681
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,066
It's not like you.

682
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
If you want to fight,
do it seriously.

683
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,667
You!

684
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,734
We shouldn't have done this.

685
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,934
I had no idea
you're this strong, Ken.

686
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:21,266
Shoji, you are...

687
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,066
just too weak.

688
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,300
What?

689
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,300
Ouch.

690
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,767
I've never seen this place this way

691
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:40,100
in my eight years.

692
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:43,967
Just...

693
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,200
what are we doing here?

694
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:53,433
There is someone else
that we should be beating up.

695
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
What?

696
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,266
Who are you talking about?

697
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,567
That darn director, Kirishima!

698
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,834
The company!

699
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,934
Shoji...

700
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,900
you sound...

701
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,433
like an drunk man.

702
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,667
This isn't good.

703
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,867
Kirishima will yell at me tomorrow.

704
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,200
Shoji.

705
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,767
You'll give a presentation
like that?

706
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,266
You, too.

707
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,700
Look at your face.

708
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,000
This isn't good.

709
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,600
Alright.

710
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,333
Please head back.

00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,266
What? No way.

713
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,333
Hello?

714
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,567
This is the first time

715
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,233
you called me.

716
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,100
What's going on so late?

717
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,567
Come over now.

718
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000

719
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,700
Sure.

720
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,700
Burdock roots, 10 grams.

721
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,033
Seven kilo calories.

722
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,100
Seven.

723
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,000
Fifty grams of eggs.

724
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,533
Seventy five kilo calories.

725
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,633
Fifty five grams of mackerel.

726
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:37,600
We throw 40 percent of it,
so 80 kilo calories.

727
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,500
Eighty kilo calories.

728
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:41,967
Here you go.

729
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,266
By the way, as for mackerel,

730
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,066
it was ranked 18th
and they prefer grilled with salt.

731
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:53,000
Mackerel cooked with miso
is low calories and well balanced.

732
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,000
It's perfect for temps.

733
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,567
We can't lose that.

734
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,266
Okay.

735
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,367
It's done.

736
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,233
It looks great.

Good morning.

Good morning.

741
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:43,767
What happened to your face?

742
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,266
I was in a fight.

743
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,600
A fight?

744
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
What's this?

745
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,000
This cost 1,000 yen a piece.

746
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,266
It's your job to reduce the cost
to 500 yen.

Shoji's late.

749
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,567
What is he doing?

750
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,567
Call him.

751
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,233
Okay.

752
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:50,033
What happened?

753
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,867
It's a big presentation day.

754
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,066
What happened to your face?

755
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,033
Sir.

756
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,633
Good morning.

757
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,133
Everyone is waiting.

758
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,400
Hurry.

759
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,667
Chief, we've just received here.

760
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,633
A lunch box?

761
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes.

762
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,233
They said it's for you.

763
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,500
This is the best Temp's Lunch Box.

764
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,533
If you think you can match this,
bring it on.

For S&amp;F's 80th anniversary,

770
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:01,033
we'd like to begin
the final presentation.

771
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,333
First is Temp's Lunch Box
from Sales Department.

772
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,166
The planner of the project,
Chief Shoji will present.

773
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,433
Shoji.

774
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:17,633
Chief Shoji?

775
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:19,633
Chief.

776
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm very sorry,...

777
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,433
but I can't present this.

778
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,433
Because Temp's Lunch Box...

779
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,166
was not what I proposed.

780
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,200
What?

781
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,834
What are you talking about?

782
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,300
Take that back.

783
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,433
I won't.

784
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,033
Sir.

785
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,333
Chief Shoji.

786
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,500
Please explain what's going on.

787
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,934
This project...

788
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,633
belongs to Kensuke Satonaka...

789
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,100
and Marketing Section.

790
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
- What?
- Director Kirishima?

791
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,066
Explain.

792
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,967
What is he talking about?

793
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,667
What's happening here?

794
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,300
What should we do now?

795
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:54,467
Let's start our lunch box
taste test.

796
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:55,133
Great.

797
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,066
Let's eat.

798
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,633
Haruko cooked that mackerel.

799
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,633
Really?

800
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,567
You can't draw, but you have
many other talents.

801
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,767
The fish market wasn't open,
so I went fishing, so?

802
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,033
Thank you.

803
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
It's good.

804
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,800
You said it so softly,
I couldn't hear.

805
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,967
"I don't want to marry
the temps' enemy"

806
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:18,000
She thinks a temp can do this to me?
