1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:02,867
You're the one I want to marry.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,266
I can't present this.

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,266
- What are you saying?
- This project...

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,667
belongs to Kensuke Satonaka...

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,133
and Marketing Section.

6
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:20,567
"Questionnaire on marriage"

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,166
You think you can do this
to me, Temp?

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,367
This isn't good.

9
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,567
Who's throwing trash here?

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,567
"Questionnaire on marriage"

11
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,533
What?

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,166
What is this all about?

13
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,033
What are you looking at?

14
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,667
I found it in the lobby.

15
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,533
It says "Would you like to marry
Takeshi Shoji?"

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,767
What?

17
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,800
"Example of search system"

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,233
What's going on?

19
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,400
What's this?

20
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,600
The reply shows "No".

21
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,367
State the reason.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,367
"I don't want to marry
the temp's enemy"?

23
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,166
Did Chief Shoji propose to someone?

24
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,967
He got rejected.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
I see.

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,066
Should we go ask him?

27
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,867
He's not back from his presentation.

28
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,967
I wonder who the other person is.

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,467
There's a phone number written here.

30
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,367
Oh yeah.

31
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,367
Everyone, let's get to work.

32
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,066
Yeah, back to work.

33
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,100
Should we call that number?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,400
- Please don't.
- Let's call it.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
We should make things clear.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,033
True.

37
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,834
Okay, I'll call the number
since I found the paper.

38
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,133
Yes, please.

39
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,767
What are you doing, Mori?

40
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,233
A shredder?

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,233
Why did you do that?

42
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,233
What?

43
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,333
What?

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,400
What?

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,633
Marketing Section.

46
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,033
Sure. Chief?

47
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,100
It's Director Kirishima.

48
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,400
Okay.

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,867
Satonaka.

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,467
Come right away.

51
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,000
You want me to be there?

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,100
Could the person
who Chief Shoji proposed to be...

53
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,066
Mori?

54
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,066
No way.

55
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,200
It's not, right?

56
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,600
What's wrong if it was me?

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,934
She admitted it.

58
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,567
What's going on?

59
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,633
Were you going out
with Chief Shoji?

60
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,066
Impressive.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Okay, understood.

62
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,767
The large meeting room? Okay.

63
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll be right there.

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,000
We've got a problem.

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,567
I have to do the presentation
on behalf of Chief Shoji.

66
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,100
Please hurry, Chief.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll be back.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,266
So it was her?

69
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,867
Not her, but her?

70
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,133
Wow, now you have my respect, Mori.

71
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,900
Tell us how you got him to propose
in just two months?

72
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,100
Tell us.

73
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,667
You're surprisingly good
at this, Mori.

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,500
So what if I was?

75
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,400
You, hourly wage thieves

76
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,400
and salary thieves!

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,433
Get back to work now!

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,600
Here she goes.

79
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,333
But...

80
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,000
you said no, right?

81
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,767
All right, calm down, Asano.

82
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:32,834
Let's get coffee.

83
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:33,767
Yeah.

84
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,166
She said no.

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,133
Haruko.

86
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,734
Was I helpful to you at all?

87
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:48,400
I have my phone turned off
when I'm at work so it won't ring.

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Problem?

89
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,633
Of course.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,100
I was desperately trying to
protect your personal information.

91
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,900
You were no good at first...

92
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,266
but you've grown up in two months.

93
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,100
Proud employees will have a fall.

94
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,166
Companies won't survive without
temp workers now.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,266
For example, Haruko Omae here.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,400
"Impossible" and "social skills"
are not in her dictionary.

97
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,600
She shuts down all
troublesome relationships

98
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,867
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,500
But why did the super temp worker
Haruko Omae

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
decide to be
a non-permanent employee?

101
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,200
That's still a mystery.

102
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:47,367
"The Pride of The Temp"

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,667
I'm Satonaka from Marketing Section.

104
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,100
"Super Temp's Past"

105
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:58,400
We in Marketing Section

106
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,867
want to make our customers happy.

107
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,900
So we had 1,000 temp workers
answer our questionnaire.

108
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,700
Please see the document
in front of you.

109
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:18,934
Chief?

110
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,600
Did it go well?

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Yes.

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,100
Our lunch box project
passed the final presentation.

113
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,533
We'll have a sales event
next weekend.

114
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:30,600
What?

115
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,467
Chief Shoji gave the project
to our team.

116
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,567
With our hands,
we can realise this project.

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,533
Chief!

118
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,967
That's amazing, Mori.

119
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm so happy.

120
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,800
Let's celebrate.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,633
That curly hair...

122
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,500
I don't like him, but he's not bad.

123
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:51,734
Satonaka.

124
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,100
Yes?

125
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,233
As for this project,

126
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,233
you'd better get results.

127
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,166
Yes.

128
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,567
I'll do everything I can.

129
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,000
Also...

130
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,133
about Shoji...

131
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,667
He suddenly...

132
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,567
submitted a letter of resignation...

133
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,400
and disappeared.

134
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,600
He threw the presentation
in my face.

135
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,467
It was humiliating to me.

136
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,667
It feels like my own dog has
bitten my hand.

137
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,333
Sir,

138
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,767
please put the letter on hold.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,767
Please.

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,567
"Takeshi Shoji"

141
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,433
Did you hear about it?

142
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,500
Yeah, Temp's Lunch Box
got selected, right?

143
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,900
Apparently, Chief Shoji handed
the project to Marketing Section.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,433
Why? He seemed so motivated.

145
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:56,266
When we actually made
the lunch box, it cost 1,000 yen.

146
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,433
That's too much.

147
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,533
Chief.

148
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:01,467
Please go see a nurse
if the wounds on your face hurt.

149
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,633
Since you're a midwife,
are you also a nurse?

150
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:05,700
Yes. So?

151
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,700
No.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,166
It's fine.

153
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,033
Any idea for the sales event?

154
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,700
There were 10 different side dishes
in Omae's lunch box.

155
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,734
Everything was great.

156
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:21,133
Of course it tastes great, since
she's the one who made it.

157
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,467
Ten side dishes are a bit too many.

158
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,066
Even my wife's lunch box doesn't
have that many.

159
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,667
Her love for me
makes up for it, though.

160
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:30,834
No bragging, please.

161
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,166
To reduce the price to 500 yen...

162
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,300
How many should we pick from these?

163
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,533
If it had the same thing every day,
we'd get bored.

164
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:40,900
That's not true.

165
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,500
You're not normal, though.

166
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,633
You must have miso mackerel!

167
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:46,600
Haruko.

168
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,567
You really love miso mackerel,
don't you?

169
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,967
I have an idea.

170
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,867
Out of these 20 options,

171
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,767
they can pick three of them.

172
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:56,834
What do you think?

173
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,133
That way we can reduce the price.

174
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,066
Chief, the proposal
for the sales event is done.

175
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,867
I'll make copies.

176
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,834
By the way,
Curly Hair is not in today.

177
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,233
He should be here by now.

178
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,100
I like that it's so quiet.

179
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:18,834
Asano?

180
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,233
Hey there.

181
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,800
Nasuda. What are you doing here?

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,166
I'll join this company in April
as an employee.

183
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,834
You barely graduated.

184
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,433
Don't worry.

185
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,734
That's not important.

186
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,266
Is working fun?

187
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,166
She must be a mean lady.

188
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,633
No, she's not.

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,567
Haruko Omae, a temp.

190
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
What's a temp?

192
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll take a lunch break, Chief.

193
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,000
Go ahead.

194
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:45,967
Out of my way.

195
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,066
What?

196
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Satonaka.

197
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,567
Hey there!

198
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,867
Shut up.

199
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,633
Did you hear about Shoji?

200
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,467
Yeah.

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,233
Take a lunch break now.

202
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,367
Come with me.

203
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,500
You're super cute.

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,667
I'll be an employee starting April.

205
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,133
Please throw a welcome party for me.

206
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,800
I'll probably be gone by then.

207
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
You'll be married?

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,834
No.

209
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,467
She's a temp worker.

210
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,033
What's a temp?

211
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,934
A worker sent from a temp agency.

212
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,066
I don't really get it, but

213
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,700
not a permanent employee?

214
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,734
Can I at least have
your email address?

215
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,834
Masuda.

216
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,266
You want a tour of the company?

217
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,100
- It'd be quick.
- Come, let's go.

218
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
It won't take long.

219
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,600
Let's go.

220
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,433
How did he pass the interviews?

221
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,934
An employee, huh?

222
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,533
Mori.

223
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,700
I hope your contract
will be renewed.

224
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,200
I want to make Temp's Lunch Box
with you.

225
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,233
I've been calling him, too.

226
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,700
But no answer.

227
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,600
I...

228
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,500
I'll punch him next time I see him.

229
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,367
Kuroiwa.

230
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,767
Because...

231
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:21,367
he submitted the resignation letter
without telling any of us.

232
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,133
Resignation letter?

233
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,367
Chief.

234
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,033
Is that true?

235
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,467
"Cafe Cantante"

236
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,400
The economy is better this year

237
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,200
so it's much easier to find
a job than last year.

238
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,533
My friends all told me that
they found jobs too.

239
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,734
Okay. So what?

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,133
I can't believe how unlucky I am.

241
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,400
Haruko.

242
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:54,100
Why is the world so unfair?

243
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,166
That's such a stupid question.

244
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:57,900
Well...

245
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,166
Like the guy Asano knew,

246
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,967
some people find a job
without making much effort.

247
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,734
He clearly had a connection
with the company.

248
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:10,066
I feel bad for employees who will
have to deal with that idiot.

249
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
Good evening.

250
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,133
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

251
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,467
Hi there.

252
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,834
Is the curly hair guy not coming?

253
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,433
He submitted a resignation letter
and went missing.

254
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,567
What? Missing?

255
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,000
We can't get a hold of him.

256
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,233
He left no clues.

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Did he...

258
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,000
by any chance call you?

259
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,867
No. So what?

260
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,767
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,600
But can you call Shoji?

262
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,233
Why me?

263
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,200
That is...

264
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,600
Yeah, if you call him...

265
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,333
Oh yeah.

266
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,367
He said that he wanted to marry her.

267
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,300
I knew it.

268
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,133
He proposed to you, huh.

269
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:57,900
What?

270
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,500
It wasn't Mori?

271
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:00,800
It was Omae?

272
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,233
Oh... I had no idea.

273
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,400
Don't be shy, Haruko.

274
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,467
Call him.

275
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,800
He threw away my personal info
which got in someone else's hand.

276
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
He's less than a fly.

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,266
I don't care if he disappears...

278
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,834
or goes missing.

279
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,200
So this is Chief Satonaka.

280
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,900
This is the unlucky beauty Miyuki
who likes Chief Satonaka.

281
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:41,633
Asano is the boy who likes
the unlucky beauty Miyuki.

282
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,967
The curly-haired boy
is currently missing.

283
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,133
But he likes Haruko.

284
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,166
Although she rejected him.

285
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,233
Okay, so...

286
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,633
who do you like, Haruko?

287
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,800
Don't put me in that group.

288
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,867
Wow.

289
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,433
"Shoji"

290
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,233
Should we wait here
until he comes back?

291
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,000
He'll probably call us.

292
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,266
When we first joined the company,

293
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35,266
Shoji was constantly complaining.

294
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:36,767
That's true.

295
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,333
Whenever we went out for a drink,

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
he was always the organiser.

297
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,633
He said that he'd be the president

298
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,266
and told everyone to follow him.

299
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,900
He was the most loyal to the company
and now he's gone.

300
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:57,834
It's discouraging.

301
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,033
Sorry to bother you today.

302
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,533
Actually...

303
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,934
until Temp's Lunch Box
gets solidified,

304
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,667
S&amp;F would like you to continue
working at their company.

305
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,633
How long have you been my manager?

306
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,600
Yes,

307
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,867
I know well that you don't
accept contract renewals.

308
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,166
But for this time,

309
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,767
please reconsider, for Mori.

310
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,667
At the first consultation,

311
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,867
Director Kirishima told me that

312
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
they would take Mori
if they could also have you.

313
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,533
So...

314
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,834
if you could stay at the company,

315
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,433
Mori's contract would
also be renewed.

316
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,333
So Miyuki Mori is just an extra?

317
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,734
If that's the case, your job is to
educate her to be fully competent.

318
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,734
Understood.

319
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,266
However--

320
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,367
In any case,

321
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,667
I'll be gone after this month.

322
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:00,867
That's all.

323
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,800
Okay, if you ever change your mind,

324
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,133
call me.

325
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,200
Haruko.

326
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,333
Haruko.

327
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,300
You used to be like Miyuki, too.

328
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,567
You were clumsy.

329
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,233
You tried so hard
but it was all a fruitless effort.

330
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Why don't you help her?

331
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,066
Temps join an unfamiliar
company all alone...

332
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,433
and make a space for themselves...

333
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:48,967
and work on their skills alone.

334
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,533
I could keep going
because I had no one to rely on.

335
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,533
If I gave her a hand,

336
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,867
and she started to rely on it,

337
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,867
that'd be the end of her.

338
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,467
Excuse me.

339
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,600
Omae.

340
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,266
Good morning.

341
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:30,200
We've never taken the same bus
in the morning before.

342
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,567
A while ago,

343
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
you grabbed me by my necktie

344
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,934
and made me stand up from my seat.

345
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,700
Do you remember?

346
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,667
You know...

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,100
I already asked Ms Hitotsugi, but...

348
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,600
have you thought about
renewing your contract?

349
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,433
At least
until the project takes off.

350
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,967
I shouldn't have talked
about this on the bus.

352
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:20,133
You probably know by now
why I only stay for three months.

353
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,066
No.

354
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,533
Please tell me.

355
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,233
Because I don't want

356
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,633
employees to bug me
like you're doing now.

357
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,900
"Play the voice message(s)?"

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,867
"Calling"

359
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,166
You have one new voice message.

360
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,266
Hello? Ken?

361
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,200
Shoji!

362
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,400
Sorry I made you worried.

363
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,066
The company must be collapsing
without me.

364
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Or maybe not.

365
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,233
Were you surprised to hear
about my resignation letter?

366
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:05,667
I bet you were.

367
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,633
Actually, a different company
gave me a job offer.

368
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
And I accepted it.

369
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,967
I'm quitting S&amp;F,

370
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:16,834
and will try to reach
a higher level.

371
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,967
Also, this is between you and me.

372
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:25,367
But I proposed to Turtleneck
and got rejected.

373
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,133
Who does
she think she is to do that?

374
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,133
In any case, I'm fine.

375
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,166
I'm a tough guy with wavy hair,
after all.

376
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,667
I'll be busy so I won't call
for a while.

377
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,600
But I'm working hard now.

378
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,433
Good luck on Temp's Lunch Box, Ken.

379
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,300
Use Turtleneck if you need help.

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,100
She can do anything, except for
fixing cars and getting married.

381
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,367
Don't get too deep in love.

382
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:51,600
Bye.

383
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,400
Chief.

384
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Here's a quote for white
and brown rice for the event.

385
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,533
All right.

386
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,467
Thank you.

387
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,400
Shoji.

388
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,367
The presentation went well.

389
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,467
We'll see you at the event.

390
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,000
Here you go.

391
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,867
Haruko.

393
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
It's Haruko, right?

394
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,467
Long time no see!

395
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,667
It's been 10 years?

396
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,433
Maybe even longer?

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,567
I didn't know you work here.

398
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,600
Now that my kids are
in elementary school,

399
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,266
I started working as a temp.

400
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,100
How have you been?

401
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:10,133
I'm working, so will you excuse me?

402
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,934
What?

403
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,166
Haruko?

404
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm glad that you're a certified
food sanitation supervisor.

405
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,200
It's very helpful.

406
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,433
Please.

407
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,400
Any certificate wouldn't
surprise me anymore.

408
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,400
Right?

409
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,934
She's also a licenced chef.

410
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,734
That's no surprise.

411
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,066
Excuse me...

412
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,767
but can you come with me, Omae?

413
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,066
Sorry.

414
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,567
Well...

415
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,967
Wear this, like
the Valentine's event.

416
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,200
Don't get carried away.

417
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:25,767
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,367
Sorry.

419
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,700
This is the PR script.

420
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,834
You can rewrite it, of course.

421
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:48,900
Shoji...

422
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,567
Is he not coming?

423
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:55,900
It feels strange not to have
Chief Shoji argue with Omae.

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm happy that the annoying person
is gone now.

425
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,700
Problem?

426
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,100
Turtleneck!

427
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,233
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,633
Don't push yourself, Chief.

429
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,667
It doesn't suit you at all.

430
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,834
Everything is ready.
Please come take a look.

431
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,467
This way, please.

432
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:20,567
- Okay.
- Thank you.

433
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,633
Two side dishes...

434
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,867
White and brown rice.

435
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,066
Okay.

436
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Is everything okay?

437
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,100
Yes, it's fine.

438
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,033
I think it looks great.

439
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,066
Miso mackerel.

440
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,133
Hey, Curly.

441
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,166
Curly, wait.

442
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,500
Hey there!

443
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:43,767
What are you doing here?

444
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,000
Kirishima told me to come check out
your sales event.

445
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,967
Why did you bring a dog?

446
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:52,333
My family is on a trip, so I'm
the only one taking care of him.

447
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,900
He's been trained, so he's fine.

448
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,900
Sit down.

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,934
Nasuda,

450
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,266
you can't bring a dog
to a food event.

451
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,934
Really? Curly can't be here?

452
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,467
Chief Shoji?

453
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,133
- What?
- You just...

454
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,967
said Curly, right?

455
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,100
Yes, that's his name.

456
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:13,500
We named him that because his tail
was curly when he was a puppy.

457
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Isn't it cute?

458
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,133
That's so confusing.

459
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:19,567
Take him away.

460
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,500
That way.

461
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:23,967
What's wrong?

462
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,600
Let's go, Curly.

463
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,433
This way.

464
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:37,600
Come here.

465
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,066
I advertised it to other
temp workers.

466
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,166
Thank you very much.

467
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,333
Can you keep an eye on Curly?

468
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,133
What? Did you find Chief Shoji?

469
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:52,567
What happened to him?

470
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,834
I don't get this.

471
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,467
Everyone is so weird.

472
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,767
Here, take him.

473
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:58,900
What?

474
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:03,066
Hey, you can't just
leave a dog here!

475
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,133
Come here.

476
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,600
Hey.

477
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,333
"From Shoji"

478
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,166
Please give it a try.

479
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,166
This is Temp's Lunch Box.

480
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:41,033
Please try Temp's Lunch Box.

481
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,600
Please give it a try.

482
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,467
It's this way.

483
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Temp's Lunch Box, 500 yen.

484
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,233
Please try.

485
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:50,867
It's 500 yen.

486
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,800
Thank you. This is Temp's Lunch Box.

487
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:56,600
Please check out our lunch box.

488
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,600
You can't work hard as a temp
with a hungry stomach.

489
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,567
Today's lunch is so good
that I can't take it.

490
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:12,333
S&amp;F's Temp's Lunch Box.

491
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,767
Please come and try it.

492
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,667
We asked 1,000 temp workers

493
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,300
and found their 20 favourite
side dishes.

494
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,266
You can pick three dishes
out of the 20.

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,734
Shockingly, it only costs 500 yen.

496
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:33,800
If you are frustrated
about your contract ending soon,

497
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,100
we recommend Tofu Burger Lunch Box

498
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,633
that contains a lot of calcium.

499
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,467
For people who are health conscious,

500
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,567
we offer brown rice.

501
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:48,100
If you're upset about
a mistake you made,

502
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,367
get our Don't Mind Lunch Box.

503
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,100
If you want to go to Thailand,

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
get our Chiang Mai Lunch Box.

505
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,667
Did Chief Satonaka
really write this?

506
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,633
So he likes jokes, too?

507
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:06,867
Temp's Lunch Box,
made with lots of love.

508
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,667
Limited numbers available!

509
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:15,500
I've heard that expression before.

510
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,200
Omae,

511
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,700
was this script written by Shoji?

512
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,400
He sent a fax earlier.

513
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,266
Problem?

514
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,266
I see.

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,767
Shoji wrote this.

516
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:29,600
Chief?

517
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,200
Don't Mind Lunch Box
and Chiang Mai Lunch Box

518
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,567
are stupid, so can I cut them?

519
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,033
Well...

520
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,066
Shoji thought this through,

521
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,667
so please keep them.

522
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:47,600
You can't work hard as a temp
with a hungry stomach.

523
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,367
Today's lunch is so good
that I can't take it.

524
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:55,100
S&amp;F's Temp's Lunch Box...

525
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,834
Here's your shrimp
and broccoli stir fry.

526
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,033
Here you go.

527
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,467
Here.

528
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,266
There you go.

529
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,433
Thank you for waiting.

530
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,967
Miso mackerel is good, too.

531
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,000
I'll have the tofu burger, hijiki
and egg rolls, please.

532
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,233
Would you like white rice
or brown rice?

533
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,734
Please come and try.

534
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,233
If you're upset about
mistakes you made,

535
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,433
get our Don't Mind Lunch Box.

536
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:23,066
If you want to go to Thailand,

537
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,200
get our Chiang Mai Lunch Box.

538
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:29,233
S&amp;F's 80th anniversary...

539
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,467
We need this.

540
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,066
Understood.

541
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,633
Welcome.

542
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,166
Omae.

543
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,600
At this rate, we'll be sold out
before lunch break ends.

544
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,934
Please take a break.

545
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,166
Excuse me.

546
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,266
Is that Haruko Omae?

547
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,100
Yes, that's right.

548
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,533
Well, ah...

549
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,967
They were sold out so quickly.

550
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:11,467
Haruko is such a talented announcer.

551
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,367
Mori!

552
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,600
I'm sorry.

553
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,367
The dog that you left me with.

554
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,133
He disappeared.

555
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,667
- What?
- Curly did?

556
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:21,567
Curly?

557
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:22,934
Over there.

558
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,667
Curly!

559
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:25,667
Curly!

560
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,734
Curly!

561
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,266
Curly!

562
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:35,567
Haruko and I

563
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,233
joined Tokyo Central Trust Bank
at the same time.

564
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,633
But the bank had a merger,

565
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,934
and both Haruko and I got laid off.

566
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:47,567
I had no idea.

567
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,600
I got married right after that.

568
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:54,767
I heard rumours that
Haruko started working as a temp.

569
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,700
She looks so different now.

570
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,066
I was shocked to see her.

571
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,500
What?

572
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,533
Well...

573
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,934
What was she like back then?

574
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,000
She was very cheerful.

575
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,834
She loved karaoke.

576
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:13,700
You could always hear laughter
around Haruko.

577
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,066
When I made a mistake at work,

578
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,734
she put her tasks aside to help me.

579
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,934
Not just me.

580
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,400
Everyone one counted on Haruko.

581
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,233
Everyone counts on her now, too.

582
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, really. I knew it.

583
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,467
Sit.

584
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,367
Good boy, Curly.

585
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,467
Long time no see.

586
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:00,367
You still remember me.

587
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,667
You were terrible
when I trained you.

588
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,000
Good boy.

589
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:05,734
Good boy.

590
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,367
There, there.

591
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:08,300
Good.

592
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:10,700
Good boy.

593
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,500
Here you go.

594
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,533
Haruko.

595
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,166
That dumb dog is listening to her.

596
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,166
Oh yeah, I forgot

597
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,166
that Omae is
a certified dog trainer.

598
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,100
She trained police dogs

599
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,667
and seven dogs got awards
after getting trained by her.

600
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,633
- Awards?
- Seven of them?

601
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,333
She never stops surprising us.

602
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,533
So what?

603
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:43,934
Excuse me.

604
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,734
Our lunch boxes were sold out
in two hours at the event.

605
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,567
Our customers loved the lunch boxes.

606
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,834
Now we have to figure out
how to reduce

607
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,100
the 650 yen unit price to 500 yen.

608
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,500
I see.

609
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:01,100
Don't place the goal too high.

610
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,700
Be realistic.

611
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Try to get it launched
as soon as you can.

612
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,533
Understood.

613
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:13,767
What are you doing?

614
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:17,233
Director Kirishima told me to
clean up this desk.

615
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,233
Those are Shoji's,
don't throw them away.

616
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,367
What about these?

617
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,834
Please keep them.

618
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,467
What is Nasuda doing?

619
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,300
Chief.

620
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,734
Can I borrow this dumb dog?

621
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
What?

622
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:57,700
Curly.

623
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,000
On your feet.

624
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,567
Starting over isn't
as easy as I thought.

625
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:25,967
Maybe I'll be a temp.

626
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:29,700
Did I say, "temp"?

627
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,166
Oh, no.

628
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,467
This is terrible.

629
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:41,667
Wow!

630
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,367
What's happening?

631
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:44,867
What?

632
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:46,600
Stop.

633
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:54,300
Turtleneck.

634
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,033
What are you doing here?

635
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,333
Clean up after yourself.

636
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,467
You can quit all you want

637
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:06,100
but don't leave behind these nasty
things for other people to clean up.

638
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:08,800
I'm sorry.

639
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,000
Hey.

640
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Good job finding him, Curly.

641
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,867
Curly?

642
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:15,834
It's the dog.

643
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,934
The dog?

644
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:19,967
Curly is a dog that's
smarter than Curly Hair.

645
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
He scared me.

646
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,533
Don't give him a confusing name.

647
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:24,967
Tell that to the owner.

648
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:27,934
What do you want?

649
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,400
Sit.

650
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,166
You can't bring me back.

651
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,033
I...

652
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,333
I've been approached
by head-hunters.

653
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Stop trying to make yourself
look good.

654
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,533
Nobody would ever want
to hunt your head.

655
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,066
I'm not talking about my head.

656
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,600
They can't just hunt my head.

657
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,233
Then I'd be all bald.

658
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,867
You always have the last word.

659
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm telling you this.

660
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:56,033
Short-tempered people like you
wouldn't make it as a temp.

661
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,300
For you to keep your
curly hair forever,

662
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:02,066
you can only survive
at that company.

663
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,233
It's none of your business,
Haruko Omae.

664
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,400
I love my curly hair.
Leave me alone.

665
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
You also love your company.

666
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:12,533
For you, your company
is who you are.

667
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:17,200
You may think you made
a great escape from that company.

668
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,600
What were you thinking
with this script?

669
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,433
You clearly miss your job

670
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,100
and this script is too silly.

671
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,433
Did you cut
Don't Mind and Chiang Mai?

672
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:35,333
Chief Satonaka told me that
you thought it through

673
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,800
so he didn't let me cut it.

674
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,066
I see.

675
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,166
Chief Satonaka is

676
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:47,367
so worried about you that he looks
like a lost puppy every day.

677
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,133
I see.

678
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,233
Go back to your old nest,
Curly Hair!

679
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,533
You go back to your house!

680
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:01,967
Hey.

681
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,500
Wait there.

682
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:10,667
Turtleneck.

683
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:13,667
I'm not a dog.

684
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,734
I left Curly with you, Miyuki.
What's going on?

685
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,266
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,767
Nasuda,

687
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,166
where have you been?

688
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:33,900
I went shopping.

689
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,400
Mr Asano, do you think
I'll be in Marketing Section?

690
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
I wouldn't like that. You guys suck.

691
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,266
Miyuki's a temp so she'll be gone.

692
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,300
Nasuda.

693
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,867
You're out of line.

694
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,834
Apologise to everyone.

695
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:48,767
What?

696
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:50,100
Apologise to Mori, too.

697
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,533
It's fine.

698
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:52,800
She says it's fine.

699
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Nasuda!

700
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,100
Apologise properly.

702
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,700
That's what it means
to be a grown-up.

703
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,367
I'm sorry.

704
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,600
All right.

705
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:13,800
Go home, you're distracting.

706
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,166
All right.

707
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:24,433
Asano will no longer be considered
a new hire as of next month.

708
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Chief.

709
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,633
I found Chief Shoji.

710
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:32,834
He's at Uchibori Park.

711
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,000
How did you find him?

712
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm going to lunch now.

713
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll go for lunch, too.

714
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,500
I see.

715
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,834
You guys sold out?

716
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,233
Congratulations.

717
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,166
Thank you.

718
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:54,533
We only have three weeks left.

719
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,533
When I think about that,
I get so stressed out.

720
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:07,667
In three weeks,
everything will be over, right?

721
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,433
Temp's Lunch Box

722
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:12,633
and working with our team members.

723
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,567
Oh well.

724
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,266
After all,

725
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,533
I'm still jealous of Nasuda
who had a connection.

726
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,367
Is the world really unfair?

727
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,767
For a temp, your family,
your education, your GPA

728
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,867
are not at all important.

729
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:36,500
Employment exams
are like dice used for gambling.

730
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:39,600
People who manage to get hired

731
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,033
are tied to the company for life.

732
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,367
The ones who didn't pass the exams

733
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,934
find another path.

734
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,567
That's all there is to it.

735
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,400
Even if you fail,

736
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,533
it doesn't mean your life will
disappear from that point on.

737
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,033
Even if you pass the exam,

738
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,700
it doesn't mean you'll have
a bright future.

739
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,433
You haven't tried your luck...

740
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,133
just yet.

741
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:12,000
You have just...

742
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,166
made it to the starting line.

743
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,533
I've just made it to
the starting line?

744
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:37,333
Shoji!

745
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,100
Ken.

746
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:42,967
Shoji.

747
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,767
The resignation letter.

748
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,567
It's put on hold for now.

749
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,500
What?

750
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,700
Let's go apologise to him.

751
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:58,433
But it was you who's
been against our director.

752
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,467
You know...

753
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,033
this is all my fault.

754
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,333
Are you kidding me?

755
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:11,033
You're overthinking it.

756
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:15,700
In any case,

757
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,533
I read the script that you wrote.

758
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,300
It touched me.

759
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,233
Turtleneck hated it.

760
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:26,734
She said it was silly.

761
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,867
Shoji.

762
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,600
Let's work together.

763
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,133
You always told me...

764
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,333
that working together
is living together.

765
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:50,834
Ken.

766
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,266
Let's try once again.

767
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,033
What?

768
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,200
Seriously?

769
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,433
Turtleneck's phone number?

770
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,533
You didn't see the back side?

771
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,600
So what's her number?

772
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,233
I have no idea.

773
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,767
It got shredded.

774
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:38,934
Seriously?

775
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,734
Are you kidding me?

776
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,100
Omae...

777
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,000
Before she became a temp,

778
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,700
she worked at
Tokyo Central Trust Bank.

779
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,967
Really?

780
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,333
Her old co-worker told me

781
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,600
that she was cheerful
and loved karaoke.

782
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,633
Is that right?

783
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:02,767
Everyone counted on her even then.

784
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,000
Why did she quit?

785
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:09,800
She was laid off.

786
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,867
I see.

787
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,166
That's why she's all twisted now.

788
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:20,900
Well...

789
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,600
I don't think that's it.

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,633
At different companies,

791
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,266
she saw things we don't understand

792
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:34,667
and developed her own worldview.

793
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,166
Would that make her
that arrogant, though?

794
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,033
She's actually clumsy

795
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:45,800
and lonely, I think.

796
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:47,934
She's lonely?

797
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:52,600
You're glorifying her too much.

798
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:54,533
You think so?

799
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,433
Ken,

800
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,600
you were the kind of guy who would

801
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,233
always help out
a transfer student, weren't you?

802
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,533
Weren't you the kind of guy...

803
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,233
who bullied girls you liked?

804
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,767
In any case,

805
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,033
if I summarise my thoughts,

806
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,333
I don't understand her at all.

807
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,200
She's like...

808
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:33,333
a defeated soldier in armour.

809
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,166
She's always alone.

810
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:38,834
True.

811
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,633
She completely rejected me...

812
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,100
but you haven't tried yet.

813
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,166
If she's so lonely,

814
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,133
shouldn't you keep her from leaving?

815
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:29,200
Omae.

816
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,767
Can you...

817
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,567
come to karaoke with me sometime?

818
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,533
What?

819
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,033
Omae...

820
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,133
I assumed that you'd also
be a good singer.

821
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,333
You're saying that assuming
I'd say no, aren't you?

822
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:52,333
I...

823
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,367
I still...

824
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,100
don't know anything about you.

825
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,967
The reason why you're
not opening up to us...

826
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:06,967
is maybe...

827
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,000
so you won't get hurt anymore?

828
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,133
So what?

829
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,266
At different companies,

830
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,200
you must've gone through a lot.

831
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,633
I can't imagine how hard it was.

832
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,133
The reasons why...

833
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,033
you learned all of these
skills that you have...

834
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,033
I don't know why, either.

835
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,266
After only three months,

836
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,967
without getting to know each other,

837
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,300
I don't want us to go separate ways.

838
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:55,900
I suddenly felt that way.

839
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:05,633
Please don't go.

840
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:09,834
Please stay with us,

841
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:11,800
and work with us.

842
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,300
I...

843
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,567
I need you.
