1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,166
Please don't go.

2
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,400
Please stay with us

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,600
and work with us.

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,367
I...

5
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,700
I need you.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,367
98 companies...

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:25,900
What?

8
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,767
That's how many company
I've worked at...

9
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,433
as a temp.

10
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,367
That many?

11
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:37,767
That includes a company

12
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,600
that fired me in one hour
because of my attitude.

13
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,300
Out of those 98 companies,

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,367
I've never met a boss
who would tell me...

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,934
something like that.

16
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,667
You can be overly optimistic,

17
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,033
but you are a wonderful boss.

18
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,233
Thank you.

19
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,667
But I'll be gone after three months.

20
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,033
Why?

21
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,000
Because it's my rule.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,033
Rule?

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,967
Rules for me to keep living...

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,400
as a temp.

25
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:35,533
I get that you don't want to be tied
to a company as an employee.

26
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:36,767
However,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,033
you still refuse
to renew your contract

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,500
even though I'm begging you to stay.
Why?

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,500
First of all,

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
if I work for more
than three months,

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,800
because my skills are
incredibly high,

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,333
it will create a gap between
me and employees.

33
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:51,700
Secondly,

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,133
employees will start to rely on me
and become even more useless.

35
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,834
What?

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Thirdly,

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,767
asking this kind of question
is really not appropriate.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,066
For three more weeks,

39
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,433
I'll work hard enough
for my hourly wage.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,667
Proud employees will have a fall.

41
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:19,133
Companies won't survive
without temp workers now.

42
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,433
For example, Haruko Omae here.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,533
"Impossible" and "contract renewal"
are not in her dictionary.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,934
She shuts down all
troublesome relationships

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,100
and disappears after three months
when her contract ends.

46
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,800
However, the real reason
why the super temp Haruko Omae

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,633
always leave after three months

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,433
was something else.

49
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,400
"The Pride Of The Temp"

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,367
"The Final Episode"

51
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:53,834
Everyone,

52
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,467
we have the launch date
for Temp's Lunch Box.

53
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,633
"Contract ending!
Super temp's final skill"

54
00:02:57,734 --> 00:03:00,567
As a new launch product
for the first half of 2007,

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,633
we'll launch it on
Monday, April 2nd.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,567
If it's April, Mori and Omae
might be gone.

57
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,734
it's not "might,"

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,667
I will be gone.

59
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,033
Chief.

60
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,333
Can you move up the launch date?

61
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,433
If it's a corporate decision,
we can't change it.

62
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,333
That's true.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,266
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,400
More importantly,
did you solve the cost issue?

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
We'd still be in red
if we sold them for 500 yen.

66
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,767
If we're specific about healthy
ingredients and rice,

67
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,834
it'll cost at least 600 yen.

68
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,333
"Email received"

69
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,333
- But...
- Dear Ken,

70
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,266
Sorry I made you worry, but

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,567
I decided not to quit my job.

72
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,066
I'm from the corporate
Sales Department.

73
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,934
My name is Takeshi Shoji.

74
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,367
Nice to meet you.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,266
You know,

76
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,834
having someone from the corporate

77
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
might be intimidating.

78
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,433
But let's try to get along.

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,367
Nice to meet you.

80
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:09,667
Yeah.

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,767
Nice to meet you.

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,767
It hurts.

83
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,066
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,467
I've never talked to someone
from the corporate.

85
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,100
I couldn't help it.

86
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm working hard in Nagoya
like I'm made to do this.

87
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:28,300
You'd be in trouble
if Turtleneck leaves, right?

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,233
So,

89
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,100
I've come up with a plan
to keep Haruko Omae.

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,467
She loves miso mackerel.

91
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,834
Her body is made of miso mackerel.

92
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:41,100
Team up with Yojiya,
and make a free miso mackerel pass.

93
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:45,367
The pass should be valid from April
for an indefinite period.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,767
With that,

95
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sure she will
renew her contract.

96
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,834
"Free miso mackerel pass"

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,900
Thank you.

98
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,700
Will you use it?

99
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,266
Here.

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,233
- What's this?
- A gift for you.

101
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,567
Free miso mackerel pass?

102
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,934
Yeah, this is great.

103
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:10,967
So happy.

104
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,500
Awesome.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,934
Is that really?

106
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,300
Do you want some?

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,834
That looks good.

108
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,667
What's that?

109
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:21,834
"Email received"

110
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,000
I messed it up.

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,333
Ogasawara ended up with the pass
for some reason.

112
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,600
What are you doing, you stupid?

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,633
A subsidiary in Nagoya, huh?

114
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,300
I wonder if he's doing OK.

115
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,800
He just sent me an email.
He's doing fine.

116
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,867
Really?

117
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,767
Good to hear that.

118
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:50,000
It was so sudden, we couldn't even
throw a farewell party.

119
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:51,767
Yeah.

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
But Shoji will be fine.

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,433
He'll accomplish something wonderful
and come back here.

122
00:05:59,033 --> 00:05:59,834
Sure.

123
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,467
Dear Ken,
Here's the next plan.

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Turtleneck is very competitive
with permanent employees.

125
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,166
Stir up the competition, and she'll
surely renew her contract.

126
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:14,233
Now that I'm gone, only Kyoko
Kuroiwa can compete with her.

127
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,367
Use her.

128
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,133
Get Kyoko involved in your tasks.

129
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,900
Kuroiwa.

130
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,367
About the price of this seasoning...

131
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,433
Why is salt this expensive?

132
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,967
Omae worked on this quote.

133
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,100
It's natural salt with
a good balance of minerals

134
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,600
If you compromise, it would affect
the flavour of the food.

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,066
Problem?

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,567
I see.

137
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,433
Fine, we shouldn't compromise.

138
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,233
Here.

139
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,633
Take this.

140
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,166
It appears that Ms Kuroiwa
thinks highly of Ms Omae.

141
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,133
Apparently, their work styles
are similar.

142
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:05,800
Surprisingly,

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,166
Omae, who never smiles,
smiled at Kuroiwa.

144
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,600
What?

145
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,333
Turtleneck smiled?

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,233
What? She seems to be having fun
without me.

147
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,600
Hey.

148
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,667
You, Necktie!

149
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,934
You're getting paid a lot right?

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,433
So work.

151
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,000
First impressions are important.

152
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,767
Don't let him underestimate you.

153
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,033
True.

154
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,533
Let's start looking
for your next job.

155
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,934
Well...

156
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,934
It's fine.

157
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
If you can complete S&amp;F's contract,

158
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,000
that's a big step for you
who had no experience.

159
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,266
Be confident.

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Sure.

161
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,834
Yes. Hi there.

162
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,667
Yes?

163
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,100
Really?

164
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,433
Yes?

165
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,500
That's great.

166
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,300
Yes, we'd be happy to have
her contract renewed.

167
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,166
Thank you.

168
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,033
You can work there
for three more months.

169
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,400
What?

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,834
Chief Satonaka tried hard and
convinced Director Kirishima and HR.

171
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,233
- Chief Satonaka did?
- Yes.

172
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,200
Congrats on the contract renewal.

173
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,900
Thank you very much.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,100
- Great news.
- Chief.

175
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,533
Thank you very much.

176
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,600
No problem.

177
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,266
You have to be there
for Temp's Lunch Box.

178
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,433
Tada.

179
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,233
This is...

180
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
a celebration gift for you!

181
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,934
I hope you like it.

182
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,500
- It's for me?
- Yes.

183
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,734
I always talk about you at home

184
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,266
so my wife made it
so you won't be cold.

185
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,200
It's so cute.

186
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,633
It's a blanket?
Not wool underwear?

187
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,633
Please continue exercising.

188
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:06,100
My wife was trying to finish it
but now it's spring.

189
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,533
But you can use it
when it gets cold again.

190
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,800
She'd need to renew her contracts
so many times, then.

191
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,834
It's fine.

192
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,734
You're part of
Marketing Section now.

193
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,266
Asano.

194
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,166
Let's do Omae Exercise together.

195
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:22,166
Good idea.

196
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,266
Yeah.

197
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,867
I'll join today, too.

198
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,266
It's nine o'clock.

199
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,467
Are you OK, Chief?

200
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,133
We can't get ingredients
any cheaper.

201
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,934
Using rice plastic...

202
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,266
might not be possible.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,367
But that's the theme
you've been working on.

204
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,367
Kon.

205
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,734
That's it!

206
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,100
"Rice lunch box, my lunch box"

207
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,500
My rice box?

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,967
Is this another joke?

209
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,767
We'll have our customer buy
these for 100 yen.

210
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,800
Once customers pay the 100 yen,

211
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,600
we can sell the lunch
for 500 yen, excluding the box.

212
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
It's a reusable lunch box.

213
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,600
It's eco-friendly
and there'll be less trash.

214
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,800
We can achieve our cost now.

215
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,066
The director approved it.

216
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,734
I'll make an order
at our Nigata plant.

217
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,266
Let's go, Asano.

218
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Please go to the market tomorrow.

219
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:47,734
Tsune the tuna man will
negotiate with a mackerel broker.

220
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,734
Thank you.

221
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:52,834
Let's go.

222
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,000
We'll be back.

223
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,333
See you later.

224
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,266
Hey.

225
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,533
This way.

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Tsune.

227
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,967
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

228
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,834
No need to thank me.

229
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,734
It's Haruko's favour. I'll make
sure to find the best mackerel.

230
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,400
Hey.

231
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,200
They look great.

232
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,233
They're Haru's co-workers.

233
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,533
How about 1,000 yen per kilo?

234
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,100
1,000 yen?

235
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,834
They are Haru's co-workers.

236
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,533
Then... 1,200 yen!

237
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,300
Deal! 1,200 yen.

238
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,700
Thank you.

239
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,166
Thank you.

240
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,500
Ms Omae worked here for one year?

241
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:44,767
Yeah.

242
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,867
While she worked, she learned
how to handle tuna.

243
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,133
She also worked at the auction.

244
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,266
People here

245
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,367
can be rough
but also compassionate.

246
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,400
She fit right in this environment.

247
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,400
Why did she leave?

248
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:08,033
The employer had a problem
and she was suddenly laid off.

249
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:15,500
Haru lost her parents
when she was very young.

250
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,433
She was all alone.

251
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,667
Tsune...

252
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,000
I thought I could stay here forever.

253
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,266
I don't want to leave.

254
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,133
I don't want to say
goodbye to everyone.

255
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,367
I don't want to.

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,300
No.

257
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,166
Right then,

258
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,433
I realised that...

259
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,700
Haru is really
a compassionate person.

260
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,767
That's what I thought.

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,667
The reason why Ms Omae leaves
after three months

262
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,300
maybe because it'd be hard to say
goodbye if she stayed longer.

263
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
Why not become
an employee, then?

264
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,166
But she said that she doesn't
believe in companies.

265
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Hello, Hitotsugi?

266
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,333
This is Mori.

267
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,533
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,433
Well...actually...

269
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,900
I'm so sorry after you worked
hard to keep her here,

270
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:21,800
but Mori won't be renewing her
contract due to personal reasons.

271
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm very sorry.

272
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,567
My parents want me to move back.

273
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:34,834
Mori...

274
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,667
I'll come help for the launch
of Temp's Lunch Box.

275
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,400
Of course.

276
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,200
I understand.

277
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,233
For Mori,

278
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,867
let's make this project a success.

279
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,467
We'll need four gas burners
for this.

280
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,367
We'll need to reconsider
the kitchen-to-seating ratio.

281
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,900
What's in this space?

282
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,700
Too much oil.

283
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:13,900
Excessive calories.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,033
Please check.

285
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,667
It's not enough sake.

286
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a bit sour.

287
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,533
Sour?

288
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,266
This is the new design
for our poster.

289
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,600
What do you think?

290
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,233
"Opening on April 2nd"

291
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,600
Place that over there.

292
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,600
If I send this,
Ken may become worried.

293
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,233
Delete.

294
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,900
Hey, Necktie.

295
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,166
Nobody told me that
I was working night shift tonight.

296
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,700
- What?
- No "what" about it!

297
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,166
- Oh, no!
- What?

298
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,133
What?

299
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,433
What's going on?

300
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh no.

301
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,233
This is Marketing Section.

302
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,100
That voice. Is this Turtleneck?

303
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,567
Yes. So?

304
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,367
The last person I wanted to talk to.

305
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,567
Yes, this is the last person
you wanted to talk to.

306
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,633
What do you want?

307
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,600
Let me talk to Ken.

308
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,033
He's not here.

309
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,567
All the employees are out.

310
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,900
OK.

311
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,800
Can I talk to Miyuki Mori?

312
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Please hold.

313
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,066
This is Mori speaking.

314
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,166
How can I help you?

315
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:53,900
Is this Mori?

316
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,066
Your voice sounds different.

317
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,166
Do you think so?

318
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:03,200
What's going on, Chief Shoji.

319
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:06,500
Would you like to talk to Haruko?

320
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,567
Well...

321
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:09,934
It's fine.

322
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:14,967
I actually sent an email to Ken
that I wasn't supposed to send.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,133
Can you delete the email for me?

324
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,667
What?

325
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:22,100
An email you weren't
supposed to send?

326
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,767
Don't read it, just delete.

327
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,300
It can't be leaked out.

328
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,433
I'll tell you his password.

329
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,467
Alright.

330
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,533
The password is...

331
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,533
K-O-I-N-U

332
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,033
Koinu.

333
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,100
I understand.

334
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Chief Shoji,

335
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:47,667
are you sure you don't want to
talk to Haruko?

336
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,433
Does she want to talk to me?

337
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,800
Not at all. Bye.

338
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,133
Then don't ask!

339
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,400
"Enter password"

340
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,066
Dear Ken,

341
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,200
I...

342
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,633
Actually,

343
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,300
I feel unbearably left out
and humiliated.

344
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm the only employee here.

345
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,667
Those truck drivers call me Necktie.

346
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,967
They tell me that I'm cheeky
and bossy.

347
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,700
I feel like an unpopular
transfer student...

348
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,367
or a temp.

349
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,233
It's awful that now
I get how a temp feels.

350
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,433
What do you think, Ken?

351
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,333
Ken, you wouldn't leave me,
would you?

352
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,834
Right?

353
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,533
How pathetic.

354
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,700
"Delete"

355
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,100
- We're back.
- Hi there.

356
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,834
One day left.

357
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,200
Good morning.

358
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Good morning.

359
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,066
Finally, it's the last day of work.

360
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes. So?

361
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,033
The media is excited
about our lunch box idea.

362
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,900
Magazines and newspapers
will be there at the launch.

363
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
It'll be a good advertisement.

364
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,967
Yes, we'll do our best.

365
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,033
Good.

366
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,200
By the way, is it
Omae's last day today?

367
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes, Mori's too.

368
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,867
Sir, a new temp is here
for a consultation.

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,467
To replace Omae,

370
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,400
we might need five temp workers.

371
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,233
Everyone is quiet today.

372
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,266
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,533
I'm the only one
renewing the contract.

374
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:24,834
There are a lot to finish today,
so please don't talk to me.

375
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,433
OK.

376
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,166
Please finish your work
on time today.

377
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,533
For the farewell party,

378
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:43,000
I've reserved a place where
we can do karaoke and eat.

379
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,967
Great.

380
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,000
Chief.

381
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,967
Yes?

382
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,300
You've already thrown me
a farewell party, so it's fine.

383
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,233
Mori.

384
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,900
Don't say that. Please go.

385
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,433
Both Mori, and Omae as well.

386
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,100
I'll definitely come
help on April 2nd.

387
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,867
I'm definitely not coming. Problem?

388
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,900
Everyone,

389
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,100
thank you for everything
you've done for me.

390
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,333
It was only three months,

391
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:16,200
but you taught me the joy and
difficulties of working.

392
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,734
I'm sorry that I made
a lot of mistakes.

393
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,100
Haruko?

394
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,133
My contract has ended.

395
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,166
See you later.

396
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,033
Just like that.

397
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,533
Not even goodbyes?

398
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,467
OK, I'll get going, too.

399
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,033
Thank you for everything.

400
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,667
You waited until
the work ended.

401
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,333
Good for you.

402
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:47,100
You used to run into the restroom
during work to cry.

403
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,233
You've grown up a lot.

404
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,100
I...

405
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,834
I'm not going back to Gunma.

406
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,867
I said I would follow you forever.

407
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,333
But...

408
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,367
I realised that
it's not possible for me.

409
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,533
I...

410
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,033
I want to work there forever.

411
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
But...

412
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,700
at some point, I will have to leave.

413
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,333
They're wonderful people,
so it makes it even harder.

414
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,367
No matter how much
you work on your skills,

415
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,400
if you always feel this way...

416
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,633
So I'll stop working as a temp.

417
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,200
Nobody asked you to be a temp.

418
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:02,000
You go your own way.

419
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,567
You've learned how to be brave...

420
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,100
after working there
for three months.

421
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,033
It's fine now.

422
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
Be true to yourself.

423
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,567
Be brave and start walking.

424
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,834
Working is living.

425
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,600
Haruko.

426
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,500
Nice work.

427
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,367
Nice work.

428
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,734
Haruko. He's here.

429
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:17,266
My contract has ended.
What do you want?

430
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:18,834
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,767
Earlier,

432
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:26,166
I overheard you speaking to Mori.

433
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,900
Shoji used to say the same thing.

434
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,700
Working together is living together.

435
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,533
Yes. So?

436
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:46,567
I respect both you and Shoji.

437
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,500
You two are similar.

438
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:52,934
Both of you...

439
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,533
Just like you love your life,

440
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,700
you love your work.

441
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,900
Yes. So?

442
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,433
The one who's
facing oneself the least...

443
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,500
is you.

444
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,100
You still don't understand?

445
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:16,300
I think you're in love with Shoji.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,133
Satonaka.

447
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,233
Thank you for saying that.

448
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:30,000
Click, beep.

449
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:33,333
What?

450
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,734
Deleted.

451
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,567
What?

452
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,700
People at S&amp;F

453
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,633
are no longer in my life.
So I deleted them from my life.

454
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,934
You can delete me but not Shoji.

455
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,400
Who's that?

456
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,367
Omae.

457
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,433
Please never come back.

458
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,533
Haruko?

459
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:57,867
Let's drink.

460
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,567
Haruko's always like that
when her contract ends.

461
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,100
That's not true.

462
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,033
This time, it's different.

463
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,266
You think so?

464
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,200
She never worked overtime before,
but this time she did.

465
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,500
She also tried her best
to connect to you guys.

466
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
For the past three months,

467
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,133
the time she spent was
something special.

468
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,266
Really.

469
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,633
It was a special company for her.

470
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,166
You think so?

471
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's make a toast.

472
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,100
Alright.

473
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,266
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

474
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:45,333
It must've been tough for you
to work with Haruko.

475
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,333
"Curly Hair's phone number"

"Temp's Lunch Box"

477
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,033
Alright.

478
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,433
Good.

479
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,400
"Temp's Lunch Box"

480
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,433
Good morning.

481
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:42,166
Did you get the lunch boxes
from the factory?

482
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,367
They should be arriving soon.

483
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,367
I hope they will.

484
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:47,700
What?

485
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,467
You didn't see the news?

486
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:52,033
It's snowing heavily in Niigata.

487
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,066
Hello? This is Satonaka from S&amp;F.

488
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,700
Will the delivery be OK?

489
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,667
The road is blocked due to snow?

490
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,934
It's snowing heavily around Niigata.

491
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,166
The transportation is also
affected by this snow.

492
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,100
The Kanetsu Highway
between Yuzawa and Nagaoka

493
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,900
is closed due to snow.

"Bus ticket counter"

495
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,233
I heard about the heavy snow.

496
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,900
Are lunch boxes here?

497
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,166
Well...

498
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,300
At this rate, they won't
arrive by 11 AM when we open.

499
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,567
The media will be there.

500
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,834
We can't do this without
the rice plastic boxes.

501
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,033
But sir,

502
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,767
we can't disappoint our customers.

503
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,567
We'll use disposable containers
just for today.

504
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,567
Can you make it in time?

Sorry.

510

We can't do it today.

511
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,967
We need to cancel.

512
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,066
I'll call another one.

00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,900
I wish she was here
to help us in a pinch.

Haruko.

515
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,367
I wonder what she's doing now.

516
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,367
Probably travelling alone.

517
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,467
But I think...

518
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,133
she's actually lonely.

519
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:28,734
I'm sorry.

00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,266

When you work hard at your job,

581
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:04,600
one day, you'll see the light.

582

That's finally happening
to Satonaka now.

Being nice is
the only thing he's good at.

do you want Satonaka to dedicate
his entire life to the company?

587
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,533
Well.

588
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,233
He doesn't have any other choice.

00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:39,667

Well...

609
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:51,233
I thought I'd never receive such
a prestigious award in my life.

610
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,066
So I'm a bit taken aback.

611
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:59,066
I'm grateful for S&amp;F,
which helped me

612
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:00,900
realise this project.

613
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,266
Temp's Lunch Box was originally
an idea of a temp worker.

614
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:14,600
So...

615
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:18,467
The person who should be
awarded this

616
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,567
is Miyuki Mori, who was
a new temp worker back then.

617
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:26,133
Also,

618
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,433
Kosaku Kon who worked hard
to realise this project

619
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,967
as well as Haruko Omae,

620
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:39,834
who saved us countless times
with her incredible skills.

621
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,133
All three of them have left
the company.

622
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:52,433
After all,

623
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,767
I shouldn't be the only one
receiving this award.

624
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,934
Satonaka.

625
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,233
The true value of Temp's Lunch Box

626
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:13,100
isn't this kind of award.

627
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,667
It's the fact that employees and
temps overcame many difficulties

628
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,400
and worked together.

629
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,667
Thank you very much.

630
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,967

631
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:49,633
It was a great speech.

632
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
The lunch box is delicious, too.

633
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,133
Thank you.

634
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,800

I've only seen your face in photos.

639
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:12,633
Why do you think

640
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:17,033
Temp's Lunch Box became
such a success?

641
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,600
Come to our employee's canteen
and you'll know.

642
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,100
For employees, curry costs 350 yen

643
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,467
but for temps, it's 700 yen.

644
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Another thing.

645
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,266
Sure.

646
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:35,533
Do you believe that we should
introduce more temps to our company?

647
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:44,433
I don't know an answer to that yet.

648
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:47,667
However...

649
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,667
a temp worker once asked me

650
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,200
if we see temps as people or not.

651
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,433
We won't be able to work well
unless we see them as people.

652
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:04,567
Yeah.

653
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:05,967
Yeah.

654
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,233
Thank you for your time.

00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,734

658
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
A contract-to-hire
is like an arranged marriage.

659
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,367
One will work as a temp
for a short period of time.

660
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:29,300
If the company likes
what they're doing,

661
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,266
they could become
a permanent employee.

662
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,400
In your previous company,

663
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,500
what kind of things did you do?

664
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:40,533
Yes, I worked in Marketing Section.

665
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm sorry.

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Last time, I lied
at the consultation

667
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,033
so I decided to be honest this time.

668
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:50,767
You're too honest.

669
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,433
Don't mention losing important data.

670
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,834
I'm sorry.

671
00:41:57,233 --> 00:42:00,467
So you really want to be
a permanent employee?

672
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,133
Yes.

673
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:05,934
OK, this is the only way, then.

674
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:07,667
Let's do our best.

675
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,333
Yes.

676
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,233
Kon's next company

677
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,100
uses the Equal Labour,
Equal Pay System.

678
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,166
I'm from Haken Life.

679
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,533
My name is Kon.

680
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,667
It's an ideal job where there's no
gap between employees and temps.

681
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:31,066
Thank you.

682
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:34,166
10% of our pay now goes to temps.

683
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,000
It's so demotivating.

684
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:42,000
"Andalucía, Spain"

685
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:51,800
This is Haruko Omae.

686
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,066
I'm not available.

687
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,266
Haruko.

688
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,734
It's been a long time.

689
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:58,734
This is Miyuki Mori.

690
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,533
I went to S&amp;F today.

691
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:06,500
Everyone is doing well.

692
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,834
Kuroiwa is the new chief of
Marketing Section.

693
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,667
You're no longer a student, OK?

694
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,900
Understood?

695
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah!

696
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,300
It hurts so bad.

697
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,867
She's so scary.

698
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,867
I won't be easy on everyone
like the last chief.

699
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,734
- Understood?
- Yes.

700
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,166
- Yes.
- Yes.

701
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:36,900
Ogasawara can now use a computer
and he works hard.

702
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:40,633
Chief Satonaka received
a President's Award.

703
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,333
He's back in the Sales Department.

704
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:45,667
Both Chief Satonaka and Asano
are very motivated now.

705
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:46,934
I'm going to Kyoto tomorrow.

706
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,266
Let's get the deal today.

707
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:50,800
Yes, Chief.

708
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,967
Sir, I'll be off.

709
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,967
Alright.

710
00:43:55,767 --> 00:44:01,100
I tried to get a contract-to-hire
job while working part-time.

711
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Finally, I passed one of the exams.

712
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,233
The company is S&amp;F, where
I've been dreaming to work.

713
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:15,000
But within six months,
almost half of us

714
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,066
will be considered unfit for
the company and be laid off.

715
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,900
I'll try my best not to mess it up.

716
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:26,367
I'll become an employee
no matter what.

717
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,667
Too long.

718
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:29,967
Lastly, about Chief Shoji...

719
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,266
he's not back at the corporate yet.

720
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,633
I wonder how he's doing.

721
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:55,834
"Curly Hair's phone number"

722
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,467
Sometimes you meet someone

723
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,433
and you become someone
completely different.

724
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,033
Haruko Omae

725
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,100
brought a great impact on my life.

726
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:25,900
And...

727
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,500
she taught me something
very important.

728
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:33,900
She taught me
that working is living.

729
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,400
"Hiring drivers and admin staff"

730
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,433
"Person in charge: Shoji"

731
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:42,967
Excuse me.

732
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:44,000
Let's go?

733
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,000
Sorry.

734
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,700
Can you tell me where Shoji is?

735
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,934
I don't know.

736
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,300
Who knows?

737
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,233
Let's go.

738
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,133
"Temp's Lunch Box"

739
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:56,233
Ken is really impressive.

740
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,100
I didn't expect this to be this big.

741
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,333
President's Award, huh?

742
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:04,667
Tsuchiya.

743
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:06,567
Tsuchiya.

744
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:07,600
- What?
- You know,

745
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:10,834
you should be leaving to
go to Fukuoka now.

746
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:12,600
What?

747
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:14,800
Fukuoka.

748
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,266
You're so bossy.

749
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:19,800
I quit.

750
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,800
Let's work, Tsuchiya.

751
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,433
I can't work

752
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,133
for someone like you.

753
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:30,266
Hey.

754
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,467
Wait.

755
00:46:34,934 --> 00:46:36,900
Everyone. Wait.

756
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,000
Turtleneck.

757
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,400
Turtleneck.

758
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,500
What? Am I dreaming?

759
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,734
What are you doing here?

760
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,233
Long-time no see.

761
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,767
- You look fine.
- Yes. So?

762
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:09,967
It's been a while
since I heard that.

763
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:11,633
You haven't changed.

764
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:13,033
I'm Haruko Omae.

765
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,333
Wow. That's so moving.

766
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,500
Why are you here?

767
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:19,667
It doesn't matter.

768
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,033
It's been tough for me here.

769
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,166
Oh yeah.

770
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Let's get pufferfish and talk.

771
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:28,300
Pufferfish?

772
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
You love it to death, don't you?

773
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,633
- Let's go after work.
- No, thank you.

774
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,367
I can prepare pufferfish on my own.

775
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:39,300
What?

776
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,066
I'm a licenced pufferfish chef.

777
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,567
You've got a new skill?

778
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:47,500
You're such a hard worker,
I respect that.

779
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:49,400
If not pufferfish, then...

780
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,533
I'm also a hairdresser.

781
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:52,700
No straight perm for me.

782
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,033
It didn't work, right?

783
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,266
Don't say that.

784
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:57,033
Your skin needs care.

785
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,166
It's very smooth.

786
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,400
Any chicks you don't know
the gender?

787
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,533
I don't have any chicks.

788
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:03,734
Stiff shoulders?

789
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,233
You'll give me a massage?

790
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,667
Land mines and explosives?

791
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:07,800
What about the massage?

792
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,734
I'm also a midwife.

793
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:10,767
I already know that.

794
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,000
What about this?

795
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,633
Nuclear fuel?
You can even handle that?

796
00:48:14,734 --> 00:48:15,867
It doesn't make sense.

797
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,133
To me, either.

798
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:20,500
How many years did it take
to get all that?

799
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,433
- How old are you?
- 100 years old.

800
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,300
Don't tell me such an obvious lie.

801
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,867
Why are you here?

802
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,300
A consultation.

803
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,633
What?

804
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:34,467
I'll skip some of these,
as there are too many to show.

805
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:37,333
My contract will be
for three months.

806
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,200
Consultation? Really?

807
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,066
You won't regret hiring me.

808
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:45,166
What?

809
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:49,900
This place isn't for a temp
with a high hourly wage like you.

810
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,767
Omae.

811
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:56,100
I'll work both as a driver
and an admin staff.

812
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,834
My rate will be at least 3,000 yen.
Problem?

813
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:00,467
Wait.

814
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:03,467
Any company will hire you.

815
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:06,200
Why did you come
all the way here?

816
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:09,967
So that you'll be awarded
the President's Award.

817
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,433
I came all the way here for that.
Problem?

818
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,166
Would you hire me?

819
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,934
Of course.

820
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,533
Please.

821
00:49:56,934 --> 00:49:57,767
Ouch.

822
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,600
So your eyelashes are not curly?

823
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,300
I'll get to work now.

824
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,567
Wait a minute!

825
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:16,133
Don't pluck my eyelashes.

826
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:17,200
It hurt.

827
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,166
Apologise!

828
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:26,166
I don't have my manager now,
so if you're unhappy, deal with it.

829
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:27,834
Deal with it?

830
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,467
No, I can't deal with that. Wait.

831
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,867
You're here to pluck my eyelashes.

832
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,233
To check and see if they're curly.

833
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,233
- You're here for an experiment.
- Shoji.

834
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,266
- Calm down.
- Ken.

835
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,333
You're here. But not now.

836
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,300
She plucked my eyelashes.

837
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,300
Shoji, everyone is looking.
Everyone is.

838
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,266
Don't look!

839
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,400
What are you doing?

840
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,233
I'm going to Fukuoka.

841
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,233
Problem?

842
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm the boss here.

843
00:50:58,567 --> 00:50:59,433
Get off.

844
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:01,967
Out of my way.

845
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:04,033
Or I'll run you over.

846
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:05,867
You're so dangerous.

847
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,934
- Get off, Turtleneck.
- Shoji.

848
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,367
Let's go. It's not safe.

849
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:14,367
I'll work hard to receive
my hourly wage for three months.

850
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,600
Here she goes.

851
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:20,300
Hey.

852
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Turtleneck.

853
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,300
She's gone.

854
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:36,967
She's gone?

855
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:39,867
Or should we say she's back?

856
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:48,066
