TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
NAKANO BRANCH

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,176
It's unacceptable.

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,846
You said you'd leave it up to me.

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:16,149
I'm telling you to do things
the way they've always been done.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,785
Then nothing will ever change!

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,821
Banks have customary practices
that must be protected.

8
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,891
With all due respect,

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,095
they're not customary practices,
just old habits.

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,063
What?

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,133
I think it's important to
take on new ideas.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,067
However…

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,903
If I cancel now they'll charge me
a cancellation fee.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,738
-So it's okay, right?
-What?

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,042
And so,

16
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:47,414
this year's year-end party will be
a Christmas party at a fancy restaurant!

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,982
-Yay!
-Wait!

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,852
I haven't agreed yet! Stop celebrating!

19
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,257
-Good evening. Wow, how lovely.
-What a nice restaurant!

20
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,192
Good evening.

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,095
This kind of year-end party
is always welcome.

22
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,164
-Right?
-Good job, Mai.

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,368
Having to eat <i>chanko</i> hot pot every year
was so depressing.

24
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,470
I'll come here with my fiancé too.

25
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,172
How lucky.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,975
Damn you, Hanasaki.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,412
Why do I have to do this?

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,615
-Nice work, Soma.
-Deputy Manager.

29
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,254
Good news. It's not official yet,
but you're being sent to headquarters.

30
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,090
Thank you!

31
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,959
Continue to do your best over there.

32
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,595
-Yes!
-Hi, Hanasaki.

33
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,264
Good evening.

34
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,632
-Nice place.
-Thanks.

35
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,734
-Here's your bingo card.
-Thanks.

36
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,171
-You can choose your drinks over there.
-I'm so excited!

37
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,072
Yes!

38
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,344
Hanasaki.

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,247
This is the last time you get to

40
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,416
treat me this way!

41
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,987
APRIL 2014

42
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,493
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
HEADQUARTERS

43
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,596
Did you call me?

44
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,564
Hey, Soma.

45
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,000
-Have you settled in?
-Yes, thank you.

46
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,202
I'm sorry I made you go on inspections

47
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,104
for three months by yourself.

48
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,608
It wasn't so bad once I got used
to working by myself.

49
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,577
I finally found you a subordinate.

50
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,247
She'll be arriving today.

51
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,183
I see.

52
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,384
Thank you.

53
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,860
I had a hard time selecting
someone suitable,

54
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:45,632
but don't worry. She may be young,
but she's an excellent female bank clerk.

55
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,500
-Female bank clerk?
-Yeah.

56
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,170
Our bank needs to create a system
that will

57
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,339
be more open to accepting opinions
from female employees.

58
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,675
I think that's a great idea.

59
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,246
And who is this subordinate…

60
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,082
She was an excellent bank teller.

61
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,684
Bank teller?

62
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,388
A teller?

63
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,723
-Is something wrong?
-No.

64
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,525
When I was at the branch office,

65
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,061
I met a troublesome bank teller.

66
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,729
How so?

67
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,667
To put it nicely, she was a free spirit.

68
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,670
She was fearless
and once she got riled up,

69
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,639
even her boss couldn't stop her.

70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,042
She's here. Come in.

71
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,678
Excuse me.

72
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,021
Hanasaki!

73
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,724
Mr. Soma.

74
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,593
Long time no see.

75
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,761
Oh? Do you know each other?

76
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,297
Yes, we worked together
at the Nakano Branch.

77
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,400
Then we can skip the introductions.

78
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,237
You'll be working together with
Ms. Mai Hanasaki.

79
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,272
Yes, this is Mai Hanasaki.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,774
Thank you very much.

81
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,212
Being transferred to the headquarters
was a big surprise.

82
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,815
And I get to work with you again.

83
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,650
This is awful.

84
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,053
I guess fate is pulling us together.

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,788
Stop being ridiculous.

86
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,593
Good morning.

87
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,228
Good morning.

88
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,896
MANAGING EXECUTIVE OFFICER
TSUYOSHI SHINDO

89
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,832
I haven't seen you before.

90
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,735
I've been assigned
to the Branch Managing Department.

91
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,270
My name is Mai Hanasaki.

92
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,173
I see. Having an energetic young lady
like yourself will be

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,876
a breath of fresh air around here.
Good luck.

94
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,747
Thank you very much.

95
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,951
Who is that?

96
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,655
Mr. Shindo. The Managing Executive
and Head of Corporate Planning.

97
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,757
Candidate for the future president.

98
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,394
I see.

99
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,297
Who was that man?

100
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,700
-Soma from Branch Inspection.
-Branch Inspection?

101
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,203
He's my colleague,
but how can I explain it…

102
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,438
ASSISTANT GM OF CORPORATE PLANNING
NAOKI KODAMA

103
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,308
-He fell off the fast track.
-I see.

104
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,445
That female employee is a former teller
who came in five years ago.

105
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,547
A bank teller, huh.

106
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,350
They're not worth remembering.

107
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,284
Yes.

108
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,958
It's all men.

109
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,863
By the way, what will I be doing here?

110
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,037
Right here.

111
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,605
Branch inspection?

112
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,475
That's when you visit branches

113
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,244
with problems
and give them assistance, right?

114
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,748
Yeah. We're the branch inspectors.

115
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,553
I get to do such an important job?

116
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,487
Whoa.

117
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,464
It's just the two of us?

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,365
Is that bad?

119
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,568
No, but it seems a little lonely.

120
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,837
That's your desk over there.

121
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,105
What…

122
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,341
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

123
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,677
Oh, you're Hanasaki.

124
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,481
-Yes.
-I'm expecting a lot from you. Good luck.

125
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,915
Thank you.

126
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,352
Let's get down to business.
Please head to Mukojima Branch.

127
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,954
Will do.

128
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,455
-Thanks.
-Yes.

129
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,792
"Lost unused passbooks," huh.

130
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,329
Hanasaki.

131
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,432
-Let me make one thing clear.
-What is that?

132
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,668
Don't say unnecessary things
during the branch inspection.

133
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,569
What?

134
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,539
Think of it as a different company.

135
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,942
-Okay…
-Let's go.

136
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,179
What? Wait a minute.

137
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,481
Oh no!

138
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,791
MUKOJIMA BRANCH

139
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,027
Therefore, please be careful to
prevent such mistakes

140
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,228
in the future.

141
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,601
I'll be very careful.

142
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,504
But we're very busy over here.

143
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,575
Why would you come to give us guidance
over some missing passbooks?

144
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,213
Give me a break.

145
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,553
We'll be off now.

146
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,567
This is the job of a branch inspector?

147
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,534
Have some.

148
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,704
Our job is to solve and supervise

149
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,475
those types of small problems
that arise in various branches.

150
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,411
It's never fun for the branch offices

151
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,280
because they feel like they're
being nitpicked at by people

152
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,548
from headquarters.

153
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,750
They hate us.

154
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,354
Therefore, branch inspection is a job that

155
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,891
everyone hates, and no one wants to do.

156
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,593
No way…

157
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,430
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

158
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,966
I don't believe in
fortune-telling anymore.

159
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,468
This year was supposed to be
my lucky year,

160
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,170
but I've only had bad luck.

161
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,605
Is that so?

162
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,008
Yeah. My favorite plate and mug broke,

163
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,177
my laptop constantly freezes,

164
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,079
my lights keep flickering,

165
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,082
and when I go to the bathroom,
there's no toilet paper.

166
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,018
This morning I had a run
in all of my tights.

167
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,386
You were dumped too.

168
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,121
Dad.

169
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,393
-Maybe I'll quit.
-Stop that.

170
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,930
When you first started as a teller,
all you did was complain.

171
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,700
"A client made me cry," "my boss is mean,"
"I'm going to quit."

172
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,036
It was hard, but it was also fun.

173
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,171
And it was a job that made people happy.

174
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,108
So I learned to like it over time.

175
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,710
But compared to that, a branch inspector

176
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,412
is like nitpicking errors.

177
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,049
I wish I could've stayed as a bank teller.

178
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,090
NEW MESSAGE

179
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,660
Oh!

180
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,362
Aki.

181
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,233
<i>Mai, how's the headquarters?</i>

182
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,570
<i>There were lots of clients who were</i>
<i>sad to see you gone.</i>

183
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,115
I want to go back.

184
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,353
Oh.

185
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,722
Hello, this is Hanasaki.

186
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,891
Tomorrow is Kayabacho Branch.

187
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,093
Okay.

188
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,964
Listen up, Hanasaki. At the branch--

189
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,567
Don't say unnecessary things
at the branch office, right?

190
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,569
You were a teller so you may not know

191
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,237
but in the world of banking,

192
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,873
you can never regain status you've lost.

193
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,711
If you cause any trouble,
there will be no future

194
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,045
for you or me.

195
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,047
I understand.

196
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,453
-Your face says otherwise.
-No, I understand.

197
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,056
But sometimes, I can't control
what comes out of my mouth.

198
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,459
Let me give you some advice.

199
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,060
If you have something to say,

200
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,564
take a deep breath,
and swallow it along with those words.

201
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,302
I feel like I can do it.

202
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,971
Don't "feel like" you can do it.
Just do it.

203
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,906
I'll do my best.

204
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,809
Aside from that, just shut up and smile.

205
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,710
What?

206
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,978
Smile.

207
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,181
It's so awkward.

208
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,950
-Don't say--
-Breathe in.

209
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,921
Don't say that…

210
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,592
KAYABACHO BRANCH

211
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,197
Our branch does not require any guidance
from branch inspectors.

212
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,966
Right, Deputy General Manager?

213
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,834
That's exactly right.

214
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,672
There were five clerical errors last month

215
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,607
so we're here to inspect the cause.

216
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,176
-And to provide assistance.
-That's unnecessary.

217
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,344
BRANCH MANAGER YAJIMA

218
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,146
It seems like

219
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,349
headquarters have a lot of
time on their hands.

220
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,153
The issues you mentioned
have been resolved.

221
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:31,123
A teller named Satoko Nakajima
caused all of those errors,

222
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,225
so we gave her a strict warning.

223
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,327
-It was all caused by one person?
-Yes.

224
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,130
She has 13 years of experience,

225
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,833
so I don't know how she made those errors.

226
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,469
It's only a simple teller job.

227
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,204
-Only?
-Smile.

228
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,141
It's been a year since I came here.

229
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,477
We're finally seeing some results,

230
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,180
and it's been boosting the morale
of the employees.

231
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,283
Yet, all this for one incompetent teller?

232
00:11:59,018 --> 00:11:59,852
What a hassle.

233
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,821
Our Branch Manager is right.

234
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,190
There's nothing we require from

235
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,091
Branch Inspection.

236
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,027
May we talk with Ms. Satoko Nakajima

237
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,795
to gather some facts?

238
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,464
I told you,

239
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
it's not necessary.

240
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,303
It's necessary

241
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,539
in order for us to submit our report.

242
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,074
Please cooperate with us.

243
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,045
Please do so without interrupting
our business.

244
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,649
Only a simple teller job?
An incompetent teller?

245
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:31,550
Hanasaki!

246
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,154
Don't get riled up!

247
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,388
Don't worry.

248
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,326
Even so, did he have to be

249
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,528
so blatantly rude to us?

250
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,564
I told you, that's the job
of a branch inspector.

251
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,333
How can you stay so calm?

252
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,036
-He can just talk to you like that?
-You're just too transparent.

253
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,072
-Was it that obvious?
-Very much so.

254
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,743
I didn't notice, since I was too busy
trying to stay quiet.

255
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,578
Be careful.

256
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,480
You have a scary face.

257
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,215
How mean!

258
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,787
It seems like that Branch Manager
is favored by Mr. Shindo.

259
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,858
-The candidate for the next president?
-Yeah. Look at this.

260
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,261
It's almost impossible to raise

261
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,363
numbers this much in just one year.

262
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,768
He must be very determined to climb up
the promotional ladder.

263
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,539
Achievements and results, huh.

264
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,541
Are numbers all that matters?

265
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,342
That's banks for you.

266
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,312
Stop that scary look.

267
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,918
Ms. Nakajima.

268
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,721
You seem to be making many
clerical errors lately.

269
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,559
How is that possible for
someone experienced like yourself?

270
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,496
Incorrect account entry,
and stamp omission.

271
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,400
All of these are basic tasks.

272
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,735
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,840
What do you think is the cause?

274
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,980
Ms. Nakajima?

275
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,488
I think I became distracted
because I let my guard down.

276
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,524
It's all my fault.

277
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,595
I see.

278
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,331
Thank you for your cooperation.

279
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,701
That's it? Weren't you--

280
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,440
Please be careful not to make
these mistakes again.

281
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,542
Yes.

282
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,781
All right. We found out the cause
of the error and gave assistance.

283
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,951
We just have to write our report
and we'll be done.

284
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,853
What? That's it?

285
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,722
We don't really know the cause yet…

286
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,757
She said herself that she was distracted.

287
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,860
-That she let her guard down.
-You believe that?

288
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,829
That's usually what causes mistakes.

289
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,298
But Ms. Nakajima looked like
she wanted to say--

290
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,066
You're reading too much into it.

291
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,070
Write the report. I'm off to get coffee.

292
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,712
-Don't snoop around.
-I won't.

293
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,848
Sit down.

294
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,339
Please take a number and wait.

295
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,574
-Please double check.
-Sure.

296
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,116
Yes. I'll be right over! Yes.

297
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,352
Here you go.

298
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,822
Mr. Yamada, thank you for waiting.

299
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,724
I'll take your number.

300
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,295
Please confirm this amount.

301
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,499
Everyone here is younger
than Ms. Nakajima.

302
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,837
I apologize.

303
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,473
Please take a seat and wait one moment.

304
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,475
We will call you once it's ready.

305
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,445
Thank you.

306
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,047
Ms. Nakajima.

307
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,449
What should I do with this?

308
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,318
Put that in a separate deposit
for headquarters.

309
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,654
-And go get it stamped.
-Okay.

310
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,758
She's nothing like the Branch Manager
described her.

311
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,132
What are you doing? Hurry up!

312
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,600
Yes.

313
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,207
Go deposit this.

314
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,212
We're sorry for the wait.
It'll only be five more minutes.

315
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,947
Please wait just a while.

316
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,715
-Hurry up.
-Of course.

317
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,475
Hey, you!

318
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,411
What are you doing?

319
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,682
Stop doing unnecessary things!

320
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,552
I'm very sorry.

321
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,755
It was very busy so…

322
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,925
Is it a branch inspector's job to work
as a teller?

323
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,627
Not at all.

324
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,630
She overstepped her boundary.
We apologize.

325
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,505
There is something that
caught my attention.

326
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,773
Hanasaki.

327
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,710
Ms. Nakajima is an excellent bank teller.

328
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,681
In fact, everyone except Ms. Nakajima
is inexperienced.

329
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,118
Their level of performance is clearly…

330
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,453
What are you saying?

331
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,124
Breathe, Hanasaki.

332
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,964
Would Ms. Nakajima

333
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,767
really make such simple mistakes?

334
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,203
I find that hard to believe.

335
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,104
What?

336
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,806
Shut up.

337
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,609
Our branch has a detailed business manual.

338
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,947
With that in hand, anyone can do
the work of a teller.

339
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,616
There are things not included

340
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,686
in the manual that requires
teaching by someone.

341
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,922
Everyone was relying on Ms. Nakajima.

342
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,626
There's a lack of experienced tellers
in this branch.

343
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,162
Experience is nothing but
a number of years.

344
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,531
It doesn't increase their work level.

345
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,633
It just means extra expense.

346
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,338
With all due respect…

347
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,442
are female clerks just an expense to you?

348
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,244
Of course.

349
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,180
You are too.

350
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,449
And I am too.

351
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,253
Someone who has no knowledge of
branch management

352
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,822
has no right to criticize the way
we do things.

353
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,367
That damn manager gets me so mad!

354
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,504
-Watch it. He's the Branch Manager.
-So what?

355
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,640
"Anyone can become a bank teller"?

356
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:39,044
-Stop looking down on the female tellers!
-Lower your voice.

357
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,517
By the way, why are we standing
in line for lunch?

358
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,086
The tempura here is…

359
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,099
-Delicious.
-So good!

360
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,204
We finally agree on something.

361
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,006
It's my first time eating such

362
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,875
delicious soba.

363
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,810
We have to visit all the branches

364
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,313
we're assigned to nationwide,

365
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,382
but the perks of this job
are that we can enjoy

366
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,717
local specialties like this.

367
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,653
Crab in Hokkaido would be nice.

368
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,689
If you want crab, it's Kanazawa.

369
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,757
Wait, Fukui is good too.

370
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,793
Sounds delicious.

371
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,797
There's a place close to here
that has delicious deep-fried mackerel,

372
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,800
and a place with exquisite
hashed beef rice.

373
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,769
In that case,

374
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:38,770
let's come back.

375
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,774
I just can't believe that Ms. Nakajima

376
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,576
made those mistakes.

377
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,479
And there's something weird
about that manager.

378
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,983
No, our job is already done.

379
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,884
So don't say anything more.

380
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,886
And don't do anything either.

381
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,427
Why do you look so dissatisfied?

382
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,762
It's nothing.

383
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,899
-Good work.
-Thank you.

384
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,009
Nakajima.

385
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,812
How long do you plan to stay here?

386
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,216
There are many people who can replace you.

387
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,553
Make way for the young ones.

388
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,640
Ms. Nakajima.

389
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,676
Hello.

390
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,182
It seems like everyone was close.

391
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,921
Did all these people transfer
to a different branch?

392
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,957
No, they all quit.

393
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,230
That's why you were the only one
helping everyone else.

394
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,300
I was a teller too,

395
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,936
so I understand your struggle.

396
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,106
Ms. Hanasaki, you must have been

397
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,108
an excellent teller.

398
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,245
I wouldn't say that I was excellent.

399
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,614
Thanks for helping.

400
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,350
No problem.

401
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,925
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

402
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,963
Tellers, hurry up!

403
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,506
-It's balanced.
-Okay.

404
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,176
-It's balanced.
-Okay.

405
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,046
-It's balanced.
-Okay.

406
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,348
-Let's get going.
-Okay.

407
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,088
-Nakajima, the spreadsheet.
-Is something the matter?

408
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,357
-Oh, um…
-The cash is unbalanced.

409
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,760
-By how much?
-Not much…

410
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,728
One million yen.

411
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,099
NOT BALANCED

412
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,536
Oh… um… this is…

413
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,008
Hanasaki?

414
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,812
What are you doing?

415
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,148
Someone once threw away
an envelope of cash

416
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,416
at the Nakano Branch.

417
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,723
Where is the garbage collected?

418
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,791
I'll go get it.

419
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,472
Count it carefully.

420
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,174
-Please count.
-Yes.

421
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,377
Missing one million yen is unprecedented.

422
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,978
I'm very sorry.

423
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,080
Are you trying to ruin our branch?

424
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,483
How was it?

425
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,756
Manager, what should we do?

426
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,762
-We will inspect everyone's belongings.
-What?

427
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,564
You suspect your employees?

428
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,200
Everything at a bank needs to be balanced

429
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,336
down to a yen, but we're dealing
with one million yen!

430
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,672
We must find it no matter what.

431
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,807
-But…
-I'm very sorry.

432
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,942
It's my fault.

433
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,713
-Mr. Yoshida.
-Yes.

434
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,051
-Everyone, your belongings please--
-Excuse me, may I have a word?

435
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,154
Let's start by checking
the withdrawal slips.

436
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,857
There's a chance of overpayment.

437
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,125
What do you say?

438
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,431
Yeah… let's start by checking
the withdrawal slips.

439
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,435
-Check the withdrawal slips.
-Yes.

440
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,450
-This…
-Yeah?

441
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,485
What did you find?

442
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,588
This is a withdrawal slip
of 2.5 million yen.

443
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,390
-To a company called Yellow Chip.
-What about it?

444
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,393
Of the 2.5 million yen, he requested

445
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,530
600,000 in 1,000-yen bills and coins.

446
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,635
That means the rest of the 1.9 million
was paid with 10,000-yen bills.

447
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,371
1.9 million yen would equal

448
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,540
one bundle of one million yen.

449
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,642
But look here. It says two on here.

450
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,411
Which means two bundles of
10,000-yen bills were taken.

451
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,781
3.5 million yen was given

452
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,984
for a 2.5 million yen withdrawal.

453
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,185
-Yes.
-Let me see.

454
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,659
-It's an overpayment.
-Unbelievable.

455
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,727
How did this happen?

456
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,230
Mr. Yoshida, didn't you
check and confirm it?

457
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,698
What? Uh… well…

458
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,968
-There is no confirmation stamp.
-What?

459
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,137
Explain yourself.

460
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:16,107
He stepped away from his desk,
so I proceeded with the withdrawal.

461
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,209
Large withdrawals require

462
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,844
a second confirmation!

463
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,447
First a mistake,
and now a violation of procedure?

464
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,348
I'm very sorry.

465
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,151
Who came in?

466
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,786
President Mikami.

467
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,290
Call him and have him return the money!

468
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,725
Yes!

469
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,528
YELLOW CHIP INC.

470
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,464
Good evening.

471
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:44,169
I'm the Deputy General Manager Yoshida
from Tokyo Daiichi Bank Kayabacho Branch.

472
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,438
300,000 yen in 1,000-yen bills.

473
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,807
And another 300,000 yen in…

474
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,609
Hello, President Mikami.

475
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,812
Thank you for coming in today.

476
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,450
I'm very sorry to bother you with this,

477
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,818
but we made an error

478
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,521
and handed you more than
the specified amount.

479
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,592
Oh… what… but…

480
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,760
well…

481
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:13,164
I understand.
We will check it over once more.

482
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,766
Good bye.

483
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,370
He says that he didn't receive extra.

484
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,640
Stop that nonsense. How can that be?

485
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,175
What idiot would accept that as an answer?

486
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,878
-It's one million yen!
-I… I'm very sorry.

487
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,517
What kind of a company is Yellow Chip?

488
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,588
It's a small company that's been
with us for few years.

489
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,656
And their business?

490
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,925
They used to be doing well.

491
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,662
But lately, they've been in a deficit.

492
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,131
There's no doubt about it.

493
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,168
Their business isn't doing well,

494
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,171
and they unexpectedly received
an extra one million yen.

495
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,939
They're trying to keep that money.

496
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,109
Even though it's our error…

497
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,377
-Hey!
-Yes?

498
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:03,515
-Isn't there anything you can do?
-Well…

499
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,416
Um…

500
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,888
Why don't we check the security footage?

501
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,760
-It's hard to see. Can't you zoom in?
-Yes.

502
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,463
If the correct amount was given,
there should be

503
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,033
three bundles of 1,000-yen bills
and one bundle of 10,000-yen bills.

504
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,569
So there should be four bundles.

505
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:32,977
There's five.

506
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,247
I see five bundles.

507
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,149
That president lied to us!

508
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,652
Kawamoto and Yoshida, go get it back.

509
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,553
Yes!

510
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,059
How will you pay for this?

511
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,797
An accident with one million in cash
will affect

512
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,200
the performance of this branch!

513
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,039
We pay you good money,
and yet you're causing us trouble.

514
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,908
You're losing us money!

515
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,178
-That's not--
-Shut up, outsider.

516
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,849
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,301
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

518
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,008
-Sorry we're late.
-How was it?

519
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,345
Well…

520
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,848
President Mikami insists that
he didn't receive extra.

521
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,152
-What…
-That can't be!

522
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,953
So you just came back?

523
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,288
I'm very sorry.

524
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,191
Isn't there anything we can do?

525
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,426
You already know that

526
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,563
once cash is handed over,
no one can question the amount

527
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,998
that was paid out.

528
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,501
"Cash leaves no trail."
That's the principle.

529
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,009
-Kawamoto.
-Yes.

530
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,423
Poor Ms. Nakajima.

531
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,426
The Branch Manager is going to
do something again…

532
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,397
Excuse me…

533
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,667
What do you mean by "again"?

534
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,939
Is Ms. Nakajima

535
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,842
being treated badly by the Branch Manager?

536
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,010
Yes.

537
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,315
Branch Manager is very harsh
towards Ms. Nakajima.

538
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,184
He yells at her in front of everyone.

539
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,887
He blames her

540
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,224
for all of our mistakes.

541
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,393
Does that mean she's forced to
take responsibility

542
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,163
for mistakes she didn't make?

543
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,097
Yes.

544
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,372
Everyone can go home now.

545
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,242
We got an appointment with Mr. Mikami.

546
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,011
I'll go and have a talk with him.

547
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,647
-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

548
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,451
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

549
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:33,992
What happens if we can't get
that money back?

550
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,528
I've never heard of one million yen
missing in cash.

551
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,464
Both Ms. Nakajima and Branch Manager

552
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,333
will have to take responsibility for this.

553
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,503
You're right…

554
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,607
But I'm sure he'll get it back
no matter what.

555
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:55,446
One mistake will put an X-mark on your
career, and everything will be over.

556
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,447
That's banks.

557
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,588
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

558
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,159
I wonder if she'll get fired.

559
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,628
What? You're getting fired?

560
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,530
This isn't about me.

561
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,999
It's about a teller I met
at a branch office.

562
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,168
What did that person do?

563
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,672
I can't tell you that.

564
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,407
What?

565
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,511
But it's typical of you to
worry about someone

566
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,313
you only met today.

567
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,115
Because she's a teller,
and we work at the same bank.

568
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,118
And apparently,
the Branch Manager is very capable,

569
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,021
but he's a horrible person,
and he's so annoying.

570
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,991
Your tendency to worry about people,

571
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,659
is just like your late mother.

572
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,896
I'm not as meddlesome as Mom.

573
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,365
I see no difference.

574
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,268
It's a call for a reservation.

575
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,104
Hello, this is Hanasaki.

576
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,743
I hope they can retrieve the million yen.

577
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,378
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

578
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,915
You got it back?

579
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,352
-Count it.
-Yes.

580
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,493
I was sincere and persistent,
so he gave it back to me.

581
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,563
I guess Mr. Mikami felt a pang of remorse.

582
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,732
-I see.
-I'm so glad.

583
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,533
You're amazing.

584
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,604
It's one million yen.

585
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,008
We finally got back the million yen.

586
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,712
This is great news, Ms. Nakajima.

587
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,613
Yeah.

588
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,718
I apologize for causing such trouble.

589
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,288
-Not at all.
-I have a request to make.

590
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,027
Can you please overlook

591
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,596
this issue with the overpayment?

592
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,199
Are you telling me
not to report it to headquarters?

593
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,239
We will provide strict guidance

594
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,542
so that this will never happen again.

595
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,820
I understand.

596
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,325
-Let's go back to headquarters.
-Yes.

597
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,570
Ms. Nakajima, I'm glad it all worked out.

598
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,572
Yes.

599
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,217
What? Did Mr. Soma

600
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,052
leave without me?

601
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,926
-I'm so sorry.
-It's my fault.

602
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,128
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

603
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,429
YELLOW CHIP INC.

604
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,570
-Oh!
-What?

605
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,673
By any chance,

606
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,541
are you Mr. Mikami?

607
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,377
Yes.

608
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,715
I'm Hanasaki from the headquarters
of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

609
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,650
I'm very sorry

610
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,353
for causing you much trouble

611
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,056
due to an error on our part.

612
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,127
Um…

613
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,296
I came to close my account.

614
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,633
I don't want my bank to be treating me
like a robber.

615
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,338
I'm sorry if they have offended you.

616
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,174
The Branch Manager here is terrible.

617
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,644
Yes! I mean…

618
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,913
He blamed me for stealing a million yen,

619
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,949
so I denied it, but he wouldn't back down.

620
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,885
I couldn't take it anymore,

621
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,220
so I said that I'd call the police.

622
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,157
Then he finally shut up and left.

623
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,428
-Shut up and left?
-Yes.

624
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,765
So, did you end up finding the money?

625
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,369
The money?

626
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,337
The one million yen.

627
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,740
You overpaid it somewhere, right?

628
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,342
That's what the Branch Manager said.

629
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:22,413
What? Didn't you return the million yen…

630
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,015
What?

631
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,284
What?

632
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,188
-There was no overpayment?
-Yes, Mr. Mikami never received it.

633
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,223
He didn't get that extra million yen!

634
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,559
-I'm sure of it!
-But the manager.

635
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,627
He said that he got back the million yen.

636
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,997
Plus, the security footage showed
that he was overpaid.

637
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,569
But I don't think Mr. Mikami was lying.

638
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,870
Mr. Soma.

639
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,307
-I'm going to check that video again.
-What?

640
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,908
I might find something.

641
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,911
-I'll be off.
-Wait! Hanasaki!

642
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,880
-Ouch.
-Sorry.

643
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,382
-Bye.
-Where's she going?

644
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,717
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

645
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,476
Something feels off…

646
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:29,614
Hm?

647
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,008
Don't tell me…

648
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,846
Thank you very much.

649
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,813
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

650
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,426
Ms. Nakajima.

651
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,799
There was never an overpayment
to begin with.

652
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,906
I went through yesterday's
security footage again.

653
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,444
It was very busy when

654
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,213
Mr. Mikami came into the bank.

655
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,118
Ms. Nakajima, you offered an apology

656
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,820
and gave a packet of tissues

657
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,656
to all the customers that had to wait.

658
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,291
Yes.

659
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,229
But for some reason,
you didn't give tissues

660
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,698
to Mr. Mikami.

661
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,501
Even though you gave them
to everyone else.

662
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,973
That got me curious,

663
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:05,876
so I checked again.

664
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,248
At first glance, it looks like
there are five bundles of bills.

665
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,118
But one of them

666
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,721
is not a bundle of bills.

667
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,290
It's a packet of tissue, isn't it?

668
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,661
<i>You took out 3.5 million yen,</i>

669
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,398
<i>for the 2.5 million withdrawal request.</i>

670
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,870
<i>Then you took out one million yen</i>

671
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,074
<i>and handed 2.5 million yen to Mr. Mikami</i>

672
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,377
<i>together with a packet of tissues.</i>

673
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:46,917
You only gave Mr. Mikami
four bundles of bills.

674
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,352
He was not overpaid.

675
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,791
You took

676
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,962
the one million yen, right?

677
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,536
Yes.

678
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,177
Why?

679
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,314
This is illegal. Why did you do it?

680
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,983
You betrayed

681
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,553
everyone that you work with.

682
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,627
I…

683
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,863
love being a bank teller.

684
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,435
You're only with the customer
for a short while,

685
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,305
but they share all sorts of

686
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,142
personal and family

687
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:51,248
events with you, such as

688
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,084
entrance exams, school admission,

689
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,588
employment, marriage and childbirth.

690
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,027
It made me so happy

691
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,995
when they said, "Thank you."

692
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,199
Every day was a challenge,

693
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,000
but it was fun.

694
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,807
Is it not the same for you?

695
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,612
Ms. Nakajima!

696
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,852
I like being a teller too.

697
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,422
-Then why did you--
-I wanted to put an X-mark on him.

698
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,390
On the manager's career.

699
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,628
Is that…

700
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,297
The manager would have to
take responsibility

701
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,533
for an incident concerning
one million yen.

702
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,707
Was it to take revenge for his

703
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,442
harassment?

704
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,711
-But--
-I couldn't forgive him!

705
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,714
About those three that quit.

706
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,451
Three people?

707
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,887
It seems like everyone is close.

708
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,492
Were those three employees

709
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,561
treated badly by the manager too?

710
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,166
No matter how hard

711
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:21,372
the female employees worked,
the Branch Manager only saw us

712
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,774
as an unnecessary expense.

713
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,743
That's unacceptable.

714
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,444
You should've reported that!

715
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,180
But I know that it's useless to do that.

716
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,919
I would have been silenced
if I complained about the harassment.

717
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,387
If you went to the higher--

718
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,156
Who do you think will listen to us?

719
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,594
Who can make the manager
take responsibility?

720
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,864
There's no one who can do that!

721
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,705
In the end,

722
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,209
I even dragged Mr. Mikami into it,

723
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,278
but

724
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,281
the overpayment won't even be reported.

725
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,151
What?

726
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,989
Then where did the Branch Manager
get the million yen?

727
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,092
-He compensated it himself.
-No way.

728
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,596
He only thinks of being promoted,
so I wouldn't

729
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,130
put it past him.

730
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,005
Basically,

731
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,710
nothing will change even if I

732
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,346
fight back.

733
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,853
Today I will

734
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,290
return the money and apologize.

735
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,794
I'm ready to accept all responsibility.

736
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,716
Are you serious?

737
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,653
If that's true, it's a big deal.

738
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,322
But do you think
the Branch Manager compensated

739
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,523
the million yen?

740
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,559
That's unacceptable as a bank employee.

741
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,464
He probably attempted to cover it up

742
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,000
in order to prevent ruining his career.

743
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,202
But we have no proof.

744
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,606
Hello? Hanasaki?

745
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,345
Mr. Soma, there's something I want you
to look into.

746
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,247
What is it?

747
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,417
The three tellers who resigned from
Kayabacho.

748
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:47,985
What?

749
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,790
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

750
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,907
I won't forgive him.

751
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,546
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

752
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,215
It's all balanced.

753
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,219
Thank you for your hard work.

754
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,488
Thank you.

755
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,829
-What is that?
-One million yen.

756
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,264
I took it.

757
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,869
-What?
-I'm very sorry.

758
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,737
Ms. Nakajima took it?

759
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,439
That's horrible.

760
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,809
Please explain yourself.

761
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,646
Did you try to steal this money?

762
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,249
-Is that right?
-What have you done?

763
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,887
Do you have something against me?

764
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,089
What do you think will happen

765
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,258
when this gets out?

766
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,464
Are you trying to ruin my life?

767
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,469
Say something!

768
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,771
Hey!

769
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,842
Nakajima, say something!

770
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:57,047
Answer me, Nakajima!

771
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,081
Mr. Yajima!

772
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,929
What are you doing here?

773
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,065
Leave, this doesn't concern you.

774
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,801
You don't know why Ms. Nakajima

775
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,136
did this?

776
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,440
What? How would I know?

777
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,809
It's for revenge.

778
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,614
Ridiculous.

779
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,054
Since you came here a year ago,

780
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,289
Ms. Sachiko Tanaka,

781
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,359
Ms. Kaori Ishii, and Ms. Kiyomi Fujiwara

782
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,796
have resigned.

783
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,599
What they all have in common is that

784
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,301
they're all experienced clerks
with level one rank.

785
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,202
LEVEL ONE RANK CLERK

786
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:56,240
Level one clerks have high qualifications,

787
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,774
and high salaries.

788
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,380
Without them, paperwork becomes stagnant,
and errors increase.

789
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,917
But you decided to prioritize

790
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,753
this branch's sales increase,

791
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,422
by cutting costs.

792
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,260
That's why you made them quit,

793
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,462
by harassing them.

794
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,532
Stop this false accusation.

795
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,037
All of these women resigned voluntarily.

796
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,941
No, it was not voluntary.

797
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,478
Everyone said, "Branch Manager Yajima

798
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,712
made me quit."

799
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,187
I met and talked with all three
of the former employees.

800
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,827
Ms. Tanaka,
who had the most years of experience,

801
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,397
was the first target,

802
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,365
and she was offered a transfer.

803
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,734
-You've been transferred.
-What?

804
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,138
<i>For Ms. Tanaka who has a young child,</i>

805
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:05,342
<i>transferring was not an option,</i>
<i>so she had no choice but to quit.</i>

806
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,013
I tried to take maternity leave…

807
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,282
<i>As for Ms. Ishii's maternity leave…</i>

808
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,318
Don't you know how busy we are?

809
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:18,822
<i>She was told "This is why women are</i>
<i>a hassle. You cause extra burdens.</i>

810
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,292
<i>Your position won't be open when you</i>
<i>come back." So she quit.</i>

811
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,063
I have a chronic kidney disease…

812
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,332
<i>Ms. Fujiwara, who has a chronic illness,</i>

813
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,501
<i>was using her paid leave</i>
<i>to visit the hospital,</i>

814
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,804
<i>but she was accused of</i>
<i>taking many days off.</i>

815
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,340
<i>She was unable to cope with</i>

816
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,276
<i>the emotional pressure, so she quit.</i>

817
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,545
Everyone said…

818
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,782
"I wanted to continue working here.

819
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,184
I liked this workplace.

820
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,686
Until Mr. Yajima came here."

821
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,358
That's absurd.

822
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,761
They're saying that out of spite.

823
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,498
Listen, what Ms. Nakajima did was
embezzlement.

824
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:06,136
Of course, what Ms. Nakajima did
is unforgivable.

825
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,574
But she chose this as a last resort,
in order to place

826
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,975
an X-mark on your career.

827
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,379
By risking her own.

828
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,655
-He really did that?
-How horrible.

829
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,592
Are you saying that it's wrong to

830
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,128
increase the sales of a branch office?

831
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,098
Cutting off personnel who are not
worthy of the expense,

832
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,299
is for the bank!

833
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,472
With all due respect…

834
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,710
is it really for the bank?

835
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,380
Isn't it for your own promotion?

836
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,851
I don't know much about branch management.

837
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,320
But it's wrong to bully female clerks

838
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,423
in order to make them quit and cut costs.

839
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,491
-Shut up.
-No, I will not!

840
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,326
You just asked

841
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,497
"are you trying to ruin my life?" but

842
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,203
the same can be said for
these female clerks and Ms. Nakajima.

843
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,339
All of them

844
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,243
have lives that they need to protect!

845
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,548
Just because you're a boss,

846
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,119
doesn't give you the right
to ruin their lives.

847
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:39,930
Shut up.

848
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,301
What would you know?

849
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,204
As a banker,

850
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,172
I haven't done anything wrong.

851
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,616
Um, may I have a minute?

852
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:02,886
Mr. Soma.

853
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,988
Excuse me.

854
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,228
This is a copy of Mr. Yajima

855
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,164
and Mr. Kawamoto's accounts.

856
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,436
I'm sorry for taking the liberty to do so,
but I noticed

857
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,272
that both of you

858
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,509
withdrew money from the same ATM
this morning.

859
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,744
Mr. Yajima withdrew 700,000

860
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,881
and Mr. Kawamoto withdrew…

861
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,483
-300,000.
-Oh…

862
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,720
That adds up to one million yen.

863
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,926
It's the same amount as

864
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,929
the one million yen you said
you retrieved back

865
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,764
from the customer that was overpaid.

866
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,968
Is this a coincidence?

867
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,106
Did you both compensate this money,

868
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,342
in order to cover up the incident
at this branch?

869
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,326
When I became a bank teller,

870
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,262
this is what I was taught.

871
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:25,035
When the numbers do not add up,
an employee must never compensate it,

872
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,703
even if it's only one yen.

873
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,174
Branch Manager,

874
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,277
will you still claim that
you've done nothing wrong?

875
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:59,436
You always do as you please.

876
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,838
I'm sorry.

877
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,541
But you did too, Mr. Soma.

878
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:05,909
What?

879
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,412
You checked Mr. Yajima's
bank account, right?

880
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,715
Thank you.

881
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,286
I don't need you to thank me.

882
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,625
Um…

883
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,227
Ms. Nakajima.

884
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,597
Ms. Hanasaki.

885
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,334
-Thank you.
-It was nothing.

886
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:38,041
No one has ever spoken
to the Branch Manager like that

887
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,943
until now.

888
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,515
Thank you for defending
those three employees too.

889
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,554
Ms. Nakajima,

890
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,925
I was bitter because I had to leave

891
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,062
the job I liked as a teller
and become a dreaded

892
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,531
branch inspector.

893
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,736
Being a branch inspector opened my eyes
to things I never knew before.

894
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,040
Like the stuffy,
old-fashioned side of banking,

895
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,909
and the tension caused by

896
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,745
factions, organizations, and promotions.

897
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,113
That's all I see.

898
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,449
It's horrible.

899
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:22,652
But

900
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,489
I'm going to give it my all.

901
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,159
I'll work at this job the best I can.

902
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,834
I think you'll be able to change,

903
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,738
the stuffy, old-fashioned bank.

904
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,545
Good luck.

905
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,513
Yes.

906
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:20,276
Who would have thought that such a big
problem would arise during inspection.

907
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,280
They were able to solve the issue.

908
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,682
It should be fine.

909
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,118
But the Branch Manager
from the Shindo faction

910
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,153
had to be transferred.

911
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,654
Will everything be all right?

912
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,757
I think so.

913
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,393
PERSONNEL NOTICE

914
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,528
SHUNZO YAJIMA - CURRENT POST - MANAGER
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK KAYABACHO BRANCH

915
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,463
NEW POST - TOKYO FIRST ELECTRIC INC.

916
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:45,201
Yajima was transferred to First Electric?

917
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,337
Y… yes.

918
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,440
This transfer is

919
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,843
a one-way ticket with no chance of return.

920
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,413
What do you mean?

921
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,016
They couldn't cover up some minor scandal?

922
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,019
Well…

923
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,191
it seems like the branch inspectors
did something unnecessary.

924
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,325
-Inspectors?
-Yes.

925
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,229
They brought Yajima down?

926
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,403
How dare they mess around like this.

927
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,750
-Good morning.
-Morning.

928
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,021
Hey, what happened to everything
that was on this desk?

929
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,490
I put it together over there.

930
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:41,825
This is my desk,

931
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,927
so please keep things within your space.

932
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,033
Oh, and it seems like

933
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,769
Ms. Nakajima is looking for a new job.
I'm glad.

934
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,637
Don't get ahead of yourself.

935
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:58,608
Things just happened to work out
this time.

936
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,112
-You think so?
-Of course!

937
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,915
-The troubles at the branch--
-Listen.

938
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,018
Don't say a single unnecessary thing
at future inspections.

939
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,520
It wasn't unnecessary.

940
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,188
-Yes, it was.
-No, it wasn't.

941
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,190
I don't want to be dragged into things.

942
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:17,660
-With all due respect…
-Shut up.

943
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,028
No, I will not!

944
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,470
This is fraud!

945
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,807
That means our bank
was lending a hand to fraud.

946
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,642
50 million will be unrecoverable.

947
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,843
It's your fault!

948
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,144
What's going on?

949
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,347
-Wait!
-There's always trouble

950
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,982
wherever they go.

951
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:40,850
Kiss my ass!

952
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,286
