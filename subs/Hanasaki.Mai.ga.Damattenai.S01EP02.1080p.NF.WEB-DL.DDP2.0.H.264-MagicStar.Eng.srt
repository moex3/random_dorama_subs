1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,304
I finally found you a subordinate.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,539
She was an excellent bank clerk.

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,242
A teller?

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,478
-Is something wrong?
-No.

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,213
When I was at the branch office,

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,949
I met a troublesome bank teller.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,620
Hanasaki!

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,555
Mr. Soma.

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,657
Oh. Do you know each other?

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,894
Yes, we worked together
at the Nakano Branch.

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,162
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,400
That's when you visit branches

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,969
with problems and give them
assistance, right?

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,172
Don't say unnecessary things
during the branch inspection.

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,073
What?

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,776
Think of it as a different company.

17
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,247
Why would you come to give us guidance
over some missing passbooks.

18
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,283
That damn manager gets me so mad!

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,484
Watch it.

20
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,953
It's only a simple teller job.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,056
With all due respect…

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,757
Shut up.

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,359
I will not.

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,966
Thank you.

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,568
CONGRATULATIONS

26
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,471
-Mika.
-You're so beautiful.

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,239
Thank you.

28
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,574
Thank you.

29
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:23,283
-She's so lucky.
-Mika is adorable. She looks so happy.

30
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:28,388
She got herself a catch!
He's from the bank's Finance Department.

31
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,825
He's on the right track,
with the transfer to the New York Branch.

32
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,060
I was there at the party when they met.

33
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,162
-I wonder why--
-The next number is 48.

34
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,167
Bingo. I got bingo!

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,372
I'm not getting anything.

36
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,876
-Mai.
-Yeah?

37
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,847
I'm going to be crossing over…

38
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,716
to that side as well.

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,785
What? Why?

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,954
What's happening? How?

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,224
Of course she's here…

42
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,528
This is why I hate weddings
between bank colleagues.

43
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,796
BRANCH MANAGING DEPARTMENT
BRANCH INSPECTION KEN SOMA

44
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,431
It'll be downhill from here.

45
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,832
Right?

46
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,501
Before we got married,

47
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,669
my wife said, "I love how you're so tall,"

48
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,905
but now she says, "You're in the way."

49
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,175
I understand! Sometimes when I get home
earlier than usual,

50
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,544
my family starts sighing.

51
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,779
Soma, I'm so jealous of your single life.

52
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,916
Are you being sarcastic?
I've already got an X-mark.

53
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,152
With both work and marriage.

54
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,889
-Stop laughing.
-Next number is seven.

55
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,257
It's a lucky seven.

56
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,626
-Seven.
-I got it.

57
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,494
-I don't have it.
-I don't either.

58
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,429
What? A marriage agency?

59
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,267
Yeah. I couldn't bring myself to
tell other people until now,

60
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,271
but I've been actively looking
for a marriage partner.

61
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,273
I see. And then?

62
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:58,011
Honestly, I wasn't feeling any connections
with the people I was introduced to.

63
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:02,015
So I got tired of it all,
and I was ready to give up

64
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,318
but that's when I met "the one."

65
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,288
-I see.
-The next number is 15.

66
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,791
I got bingo! Bye, Mai!

67
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,594
I won!

68
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,896
I'm so behind.

69
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,965
By the way, I heard that you're

70
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,633
partnered with a young lady.

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
-Really?
-Yes, she's young

72
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,938
but she's no lady.

73
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,441
-How lucky. I only work with men.
-Me too.

74
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,476
I'd rather work with men than with her.

75
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,079
Next number is 31.

76
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,949
I got it!

77
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,083
-Bingo…
-Bingo!

78
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,818
-Bingo!
-What?

79
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,087
-Yay.
-Soma, you got bingo, right?

80
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,957
-What? No, I didn't.
-We have a bingo too!

81
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,826
-Stop it.
-We have a bingo.

82
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,928
Mr. Soma.

83
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,665
Stop it.

84
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,501
Congratulations. Here is…

85
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,569
your prize!

86
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,077
It's so big.

87
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,448
-It's so heavy.
-Excuse me.

88
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,884
-Can you take me to Monzen-nakacho?
-Sure.

89
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,386
Monzen…

90
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,189
Bye… I'll call you later.

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,957
Mr. Soma, I want a ride too.

92
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,060
What? Wait.

93
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,329
-Wait…
-I didn't want to ride the train.

94
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,465
-Not carrying this thing.
-Hold on.

95
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,069
I'm also heading to Monzen-nakacho.
What a coincidence.

96
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,005
Seriously?

97
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,440
Please take us to Monzen-nakacho.

98
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,542
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,880
This is your house?

100
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,848
Yes.

101
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,784
-This is your house?
-Hanasaki.

102
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:46,953
Seriously?

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,321
And you?

104
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,525
-That apartment.
-What?

105
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,896
You were living that close to me?
I had no idea.

106
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,798
If I knew I wouldn't have moved here.

107
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,168
-Hi Dad, I'm back.
-Hey, Mai.

108
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,338
-Welcome back.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Soma.

109
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,508
Nice to meet you. I'm Mai's father.

110
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,513
-You should've told me he was coming.
-What?

111
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,349
I have to prepare myself beforehand.

112
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,485
It's not like that.
Mr. Soma is from the bank…

113
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,622
Bank! Good for you, you're one step
closer to your dream.

114
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,691
-What?
-To become a wife of a banker.

115
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,659
What? That was never my dream.

116
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,861
-Stop saying weird things.
-Don't be shy.

117
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,030
It seems like he's a lot older.

118
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,133
-That's okay as long as there's love.
-It's not like that.

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,769
You're so lovey-dovey
with matching stuffed animals.

120
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,305
Lovey-dovey? It's not like that, Dad!

121
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,374
Dad? Did you just call me Dad?

122
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,009
-Uh…
-That makes me happy.

123
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,977
I've always wanted a son.

124
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,879
-It's not--
-I've wanted a son.

125
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,916
How old are you?
Maybe we're not so far apart in age.

126
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,652
-What year were you born?
-1971.

127
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,721
What year of the Showa era?

128
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,589
You've got it all wrong.

129
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,691
Got what wrong?

130
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,594
Mr. Soma is just my boss.

131
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,463
Boss?

132
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,631
I'm so sorry.

133
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,967
You should've told me sooner.

134
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,839
You weren't listening to me.

135
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,940
Ugh…

136
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,177
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

137
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,215
What? Pineapple-shaped cookies
and pancake mix?

138
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,717
Don't worry about bringing back gifts.

139
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,587
Concentrate on enjoying your honeymoon

140
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,123
and have a romantic time
with your husband.

141
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,629
Bye, have fun.

142
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,403
Hello, Mr. Shindo and Mr. Kodama.

143
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,537
Who are you?

144
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,940
-I'm Hanasaki.
-Hanasaki?

145
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,309
The Branch Inspector.

146
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,117
It seems like Yajima from
Kayabacho Branch caused you some trouble.

147
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,953
It's wrong to bully female employees

148
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,089
in order to make them quit and cut costs.

149
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,690
-Shut up.
-No, I won't.

150
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,626
Just because you're a boss,

151
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,630
doesn't give you the right to ruin
their lives.

152
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,837
I wouldn't say they caused us trouble.

153
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,838
Excuse me.

154
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,275
-Wait.
-Yes…

155
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,612
Is this yours?

156
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,449
Seems like you left it behind.

157
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,018
Sorry, I got it this morning,

158
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,921
but I was not reading this
during the meeting--

159
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,122
Goodbye.

160
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,991
Thank you.

161
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,132
Why did I drop this?

162
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,735
Did that female employee solve that

163
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,839
incident at the Kayabacho Branch?

164
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,976
It wasn't just Hanasaki,
since she was with her boss Soma.

165
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,077
Hanasaki.

166
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,680
I'll remember her.

167
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,785
BRANCH INSPECTION

168
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,887
HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS

169
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,424
HW BRIDAL ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

170
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,460
What? Enrollment fee?

171
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,530
It's 150,000? That's expensive.

172
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,165
How expensive.

173
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,670
You're so easy to read.

174
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,805
What?

175
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,508
Let me guess.
"I attended my friend's wedding,

176
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,409
and now I feel like I need to hurry."

177
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,479
That's not true. I was just taking a look.

178
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,215
What is it?

179
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,918
You don't have to be a banker's wife?

180
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,821
You heard that yesterday?

181
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,423
I heard it all because he was
talking so loud.

182
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,392
Please forget about what he said.

183
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,496
My dad was saying that,
but that's not what I'm looking for.

184
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,831
Oh no,

185
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,000
we got a troublesome case.

186
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,402
Can you go to the Aoyama Branch?

187
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,172
-What happened?
-We received a letter of protest.

188
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,074
Letter of protest?

189
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,943
Wait,

190
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,378
there are so many of them.

191
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,413
Yes, it's from female members

192
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,882
of a marriage agency called
Grand Marriage.

193
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,385
They're not being introduced to anyone.

194
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,987
But why are we getting that complaint?

195
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,291
The Aoyama Branch is
financing that company.

196
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,761
They're protesting to the bank
for financing them?

197
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,663
That's right, Soma.

198
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,899
Banks get that kind of protest?

199
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,367
It's very rare.

200
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,870
They're probably taking it out on us.

201
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,206
Please make sure there are no problems
with the details.

202
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,476
-Check the transactions and loans.
-Will do.

203
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,377
Oh,

204
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,348
the manager at the Aoyama Branch
is in the Shindo faction.

205
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,919
So please make sure you don't
do anything to upset him.

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,120
-Okay.
-All right.

207
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,423
I've got lots to do.

208
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,327
What? Two million yen enrollment fee?

209
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,531
Male member's annual income is
30 million yen.

210
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,366
Are they serious?

211
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,537
-It's obviously suspicious.
-I agree.

212
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,639
I can't believe women are willing to pay

213
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,709
two million yen in order to
marry someone of high status.

214
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,577
I can't believe they fall for this.

215
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,213
That's true
when you look at it objectively,

216
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,450
but one can lose their sense of judgement
when they're in a rush.

217
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,621
What is it?

218
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,389
It's okay, Hanasaki.

219
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,491
I'm sure you'll find a great man.

220
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,593
I'm not talking about myself. It's them!

221
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,529
But it's so vindictive of these people
to send

222
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,999
letters of protest
to the bank just because

223
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,900
they can't get married.

224
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,836
What?

225
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,838
-Hey, Hanasaki.
-Yes?

226
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,807
A marriage agency is where

227
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:46,345
they introduce you to
possible candidates for marriage, right?

228
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,215
-Yes, of course.
-That doesn't seem to be the case here.

229
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,182
Look.

230
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,523
"Not been introduced to a single person
for six months after enrollment"?

231
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,027
That goes for all 313 members
mentioned here by name.

232
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,429
That's awful.

233
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,132
This is a scam.

234
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,678
BRANCH MANAGER HAYAO NITTA

235
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,312
Mr. Soma.

236
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,782
What are you doing? Let's go.

237
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,888
AOYAMA BRANCH

238
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,893
We're Branch Inspectors
Soma and Hanasaki from headquarters.

239
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,795
-Branch Manager Nitta, please.
-Yes.

240
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,567
How very kind of the Branch Inspectors
to come here

241
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,302
from headquarters.

242
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,203
Not at all.

243
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,373
But I'm surprised to see you

244
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,009
doing this kind of a job, Soma.

245
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,178
I moved to headquarters three months ago.

246
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,549
The former ace of the Finance Department
is now a Branch Inspector, huh.

247
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,584
And your partner is a female to boot.

248
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,155
Now,

249
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,459
as for the details regarding
your loan to Grand Marriage--

250
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,829
They sent in claims
for the marriage agency to the bank?

251
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,098
They're barking up the wrong tree.

252
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,467
You guys must really have
extra time on your hands,

253
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,403
to be checking up on things like this.

254
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,838
Um…

255
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,743
But we can't simply ignore this amount of

256
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,944
protest letters.

257
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,647
These are just women taking their anger
out on us because they can't marry.

258
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,117
There are no problems with our loans.

259
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,518
With all due respect…

260
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,222
Sorry, but handle the rest
with Sugishita, since he's in charge.

261
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,158
I have plans, so I'll be leaving.

262
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,028
Wait. Wait a moment.

263
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,163
Excuse me.

264
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,901
I wasn't done speaking.

265
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,537
I'm very sorry.

266
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,872
No worries.

267
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,240
FINANCE DEPARTMENT SUGISHITA

268
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,208
Um… but

269
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,878
I don't think we have any problems
with our loans.

270
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,380
Their business plan was
properly made as well.

271
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,848
I'll take a look.

272
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,683
LOAN APPROVAL DOCUMENT

273
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,354
It's been about six months since
Grand Marriage started their business.

274
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,124
I think it will take time to start seeing
good results.

275
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,627
-That's not it.
-What?

276
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:20,032
The female members are not protesting
because they haven't found a match.

277
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,304
They're protesting the fact that they
haven't been introduced to a single person

278
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,305
for six months.

279
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,474
What do you mean?

280
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,878
Everyone who signed here, has paid

281
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,713
the enrollment fee but they haven't

282
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,116
been introduced to anyone yet.

283
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,185
That can't be…

284
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,822
If that's true,

285
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,757
this is a fraud.

286
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,525
Which would mean

287
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,662
that this bank gave a helping hand
to the fraud.

288
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,066
One moment.
I will go talk to Grand Marriage.

289
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,535
Mr. Soma, we should go too.

290
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,141
Mr. Sugishita.

291
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,911
-We'll go too.
-Thank you.

292
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,630
Grand Marriage was created six months ago
by Eiji Munakata

293
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,999
after he left a big consulting firm.

294
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,668
When he worked as a consultant,

295
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,238
he rebuilt companies
that were about to go under,

296
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,673
and successfully built new businesses.

297
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,343
-That's why we had hope in him.
-And the loan?

298
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,512
-Fifty million yen.
-I see.

299
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,418
Here it is.

300
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,389
What?

301
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,130
-What?
-That can't be!

302
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,699
Mr. Sugishita, where's the office?

303
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,067
Behind here.

304
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,506
What's happening?

305
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,476
Excuse me. What are you doing?

306
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,977
Who are you?

307
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,946
We're from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

308
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,583
We came to talk to Mr. Munakata.

309
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,251
There is no one here,

310
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,953
including Mr. Munakata.

311
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,690
I'm Shimamura from the police department.

312
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,559
Why is the police here?

313
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,629
This company has been charged
with alleged fraud.

314
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,900
-Fraud…
-It seems like Mr. Munakata

315
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,670
took 600 million yen from the members

316
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,638
and disappeared.

317
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,639
What?

318
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,955
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

319
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,823
What do you mean?

320
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,258
I'm very sorry.

321
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,530
Apparently, Grand Marriage

322
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,533
had gathered over 300 female members,

323
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,469
but they didn't have a single male member.

324
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,041
Therefore, it was a fraudulent scheme
meant to deceive its members

325
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,277
by taking their enrollment fees.

326
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,749
What's happening, Sugishita?

327
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,986
Weren't you in contact with Mr. Munakata?

328
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,421
I talked to him the other day,
but I had no idea…

329
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,057
How was the loan screening process?

330
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,425
There were no problems!

331
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,296
We screened the application according to
the business plan they brought.

332
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,031
It was done properly.

333
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,633
Then it would mean that

334
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,636
their business plan was fabricated.

335
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,474
Sugishita!

336
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,443
You were in charge.
How did you not catch that?

337
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,778
I'm very sorry.

338
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,448
The 50 million yen we loaned
will be unrecoverable.

339
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,251
If that happens,

340
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,986
it will wreck our branch.

341
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,556
Do you understand that, Sugishita?

342
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,564
It was my fault for putting you in charge.

343
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,735
-But Manager…
-What?

344
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,804
Never mind.

345
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,908
Listen.

346
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,612
You have to collect that 50 million yen
no matter what.

347
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,615
If you can't get it,

348
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,451
you have to take responsibility.

349
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,920
No way…

350
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,156
It's all about the results.

351
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,390
That's banking!

352
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,226
Yes.

353
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,141
He didn't have to say it in such a way.

354
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,544
"That's banking"? What does he mean?

355
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,345
Isn't that ridiculous?

356
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,548
That's who he is.

357
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,019
Mr. Soma, you know Mr. Nitta?

358
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,923
Six years ago,
when I was at the Marunouchi Branch,

359
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,791
Mr. Nitta was the manager.

360
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,160
I see.

361
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,697
He hasn't changed at all.

362
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,804
Oh, Mr. Sugishita.

363
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,439
Where are you going?

364
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,576
I'm going to Mr. Munakata's house.

365
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,277
-What?
-Um…

366
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,348
He ran away with 600 million yen.
I doubt he'll be home…

367
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,519
But I have to retrieve that
50 million somehow.

368
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,724
-Mr. Soma, I'll go with him.
-Hanasaki!

369
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,061
That's not your job. Our job is to--

370
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,030
To check if the loan was screened
properly or not, right?

371
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,800
We can't make that decision right now.

372
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,235
I'll be off.

373
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,769
Hey!

374
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,640
There she goes again.

375
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,409
Mr. Sugishita.

376
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,812
I'll go with you.

377
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,648
Thank you.

378
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,821
MR. MUNAKATA

379
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>The number you have called</i>

380
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,628
<i>-is no longer in business…</i>
-Damn it.

381
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,731
What's happening?

382
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,038
I think this is it.

383
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,015
There are no clues as to
where he might be?

384
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,350
Yes, nothing as of now…

385
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,188
It would be trouble
if he already left the country.

386
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,658
It seems like he's no longer here.

387
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,660
Yeah.

388
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,236
If Mr. Munakata never appears again…

389
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,240
It will be hopeless.

390
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,694
What?

391
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:30,662
That person…

392
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,499
PRESIDENT OF GRAND MARRIAGE
EIJI MUNAKATA

393
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,539
That man! Isn't he Mr. Munakata?

394
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,142
-What?
-That man.

395
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,615
Mr. Munakata!

396
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,719
What's happening? Please explain!
Mr. Munakata!

397
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,089
Mr. Munakata!

398
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,358
Ouch.

399
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,760
Wait!

400
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,229
What?

401
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,231
Wait!

402
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,034
I'm telling you to stop!

403
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,303
Hey!

404
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,143
Oh darn…

405
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,823
Ouch.

406
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,960
-Are you okay?
-Yeah…

407
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,428
Please use this.

408
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,100
Thank you.

409
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,103
We were so close.

410
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,506
He was right in front of us.

411
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,441
Yes.

412
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,878
We can't back down now.

413
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,382
Mr. Sugishita, do you know of any place
that Mr. Munakata

414
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,884
might go to?

415
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,452
No.

416
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,522
What about people that might know
where he'd be?

417
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,557
No.

418
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:09,895
Oh…

419
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,799
-You know someone?
-No.

420
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,134
You do, right?

421
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,503
-Mr. Sugishita!
-Ouch!

422
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,571
Sorry.

423
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,310
Um…

424
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,913
It's Branch Manager Nitta.

425
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,583
Mr. Nitta and Mr. Munakata
are good friends?

426
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,720
Yes, they often went

427
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,722
golfing and eating together.

428
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,725
I see.

429
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,037
In fact, the loan for Grand Marriage,

430
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,206
was an order by the Branch Manager.

431
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,209
What?

432
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:00,912
Mr. Nitta.

433
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,515
It's a new business so I think we need to

434
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,117
examine it more carefully.

435
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,619
What are you saying?

436
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,758
You know Mr. Munakata's abilities
from when he was a consultant, right?

437
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,061
It's his business. It won't fail.

438
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,131
But it's still
a new business transaction for us.

439
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,733
-An unsecured loan would be…
-It's fine.

440
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,404
We're financing Mr. Munakata's
abilities and future prospects.

441
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,407
Just hurry up and submit
the request for approval.

442
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,841
But manager…

443
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,379
Are you going to oppose the Manager?

444
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,989
Remember that I can easily decide

445
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,458
what to do with you at my own discretion.

446
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,698
Don't worry.

447
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,302
If something happens,
I'll take responsibility.

448
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,041
Yes.

449
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,479
He said that he'd take responsibility?

450
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,349
But he told you

451
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,251
that it's your responsibility.

452
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,754
What he's saying is the exact opposite.

453
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,826
Why didn't you speak up when he said that?

454
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,062
I had no choice.

455
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:28,934
He can easily ship people off
that do not listen to him.

456
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,068
But still…

457
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,408
I'm going to become a father soon.

458
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,846
I can't go against the Branch Manager.

459
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,081
Thank you.

460
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,834
I wonder what's going to happen.

461
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,138
Hey.

462
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,308
Mr. Soma!

463
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,777
What are you doing here?

464
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,547
Here's the ultimate turnip.

465
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,383
I've been wanting to eat this.

466
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,787
I've been curious ever since I saw
the sign for this the other day.

467
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,722
Thank you.

468
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,530
It's delicious.

469
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,498
That makes me happy, Mr. Soma.

470
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,367
Please stop by every day.

471
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,669
We epicureans have lots in common.

472
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,671
I'll definitely come back.

473
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,111
It seems like you two became close
in a short span of time.

474
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,947
I heard you were dumped on New Year's.

475
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,285
-Dad?
-It was a slip of the tongue.

476
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,387
How did you let it slip?

477
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,055
And I've told you.

478
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,091
-I wasn't dumped, we broke up.
-The outcome is the same.

479
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,961
It's completely different.

480
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,431
You're so lucky to have a dad like this.

481
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,999
Oh, really?

482
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,436
He nags, has a sharp tongue,
and can never keep a secret.

483
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,871
I'm sure it was hard

484
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,775
for him to raise a daughter like you
all by himself.

485
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,044
A daughter like me…

486
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,546
-You're right, Mr. Soma.
-Thank you.

487
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,183
My wife passed away when she was ten.

488
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,253
I had never done housework,
so I had to start from zero.

489
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,554
And you started to cook?

490
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,189
Yes, I didn't cook before that.

491
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,326
But that awakened me
to the world of cuisine,

492
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,162
and I opened this restaurant.

493
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,464
You're incredible.

494
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,468
Mr. Soma, I know that you and I will
get along very well.

495
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,436
Yeah!

496
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,907
-Please enjoy.
-Thanks.

497
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,845
I see. That's not good.

498
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,216
At this rate, our 50 million yen will be
unrecoverable.

499
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,887
You heard how Mr. Nitta said
the loan for Grand Marriage

500
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,423
was all Mr. Sugishita's
responsibility, right?

501
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,993
-Yeah.
-But that's not true.

502
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,030
The manager forced Mr. Sugishita to
submit the loan and put him in charge.

503
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,532
Then he said that
he would take responsibility.

504
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,303
So that's what happened, huh?

505
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:20,872
You knew?

506
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,942
It's something Mr. Nitta would do.

507
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,045
But isn't it unfair?

508
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:32,083
It's the Manager's fault,
but he's unscathed.

509
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,252
But Mr. Sugishita has to take the blame,

510
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,954
and he might be shipped off.

511
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,757
Credit goes to the boss.
Mistakes to the subordinates.

512
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,326
What is that unreasonable slogan?

513
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,428
That's common knowledge at a bank.

514
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,698
What? That's unacceptable.

515
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,800
Quiet.

516
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,736
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,004
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,009
First of all, I get a bad vibe
from that Branch Manager.

519
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,712
-What?
-It's the condescending way he speaks.

520
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,649
And he has such a flashy watch
even though he's a bank employee.

521
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,985
His watch… was flashy?

522
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,787
Yes!

523
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,257
Why do those people get promoted?

524
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,929
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. I'll do it.

525
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,532
Please sit down.

526
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,535
Sorry. Once she gets riled up,

527
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,970
she loses all reasoning.

528
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,971
Yes, I know.

529
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,141
Mr. Soma, she can be a handful

530
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,144
but please take care of her.

531
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,847
Uh… yes.

532
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,586
MARRIAGE AGENCY CHARGED WITH ALLEGED FRAUD

533
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,522
PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY HAS DISAPPEARED

534
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,094
Mr. Sugishita won't be forced to
take responsibility for this,

535
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,262
will he?

536
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:59,003
A loan is approved after many people sign

537
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,572
the proposal, right?

538
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,478
Yeah.

539
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,024
Oh?

540
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,995
Branch Manager Nitta
from the Aoyama Branch?

541
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,877
I see.

542
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,114
That's a troubling situation, Nitta.

543
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,084
I'm very sorry.

544
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,055
If we approved a loan to a company
running a fraud,

545
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,758
it would be considered
as a compliance violation.

546
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,692
Yes.

547
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:59,097
In addition to that,
if the 50 million yen is unrecoverable,

548
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,568
you will have to face the consequences
of that.

549
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,073
Grand Marriage was a new contract,

550
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,943
so I was concerned that it wasn't
examined well enough,

551
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,347
but my subordinate Sugishita
believed in Munakata's abilities.

552
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,783
So I believed him and put him in charge.

553
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,717
I see.

554
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,922
I will make him take responsibility.

555
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,892
It will be painful for me to do so,

556
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,995
but if I go easy on him,
it won't set a good example.

557
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,264
I see.

558
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,034
That's fine.

559
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,537
Yes.

560
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,707
Nitta.

561
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,443
I'm expecting great things from you.

562
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,617
Don't disappoint me.

563
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,322
Thank you. I will keep that in mind.

564
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,602
Are you serious?

565
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,205
The Manager said the loan for
Grand Marriage

566
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,840
is Mr. Sugishita's fault?

567
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,542
Yes, he did.

568
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,946
I guess that can't be helped.

569
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,215
It's become such a big issue now.

570
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,151
I feel sorry for Mr. Nitta since he

571
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,787
has to deal with such subordinates.

572
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,023
It's time for my meeting.

573
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,859
Listen, don't tell anyone
about what I just told you.

574
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,795
-Sure.
-I'm so busy.

575
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,104
This is horrible. It's all lies.

576
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,907
The Manager forced Mr. Sugishita
to submit the loan.

577
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,410
I'm going to object to Mr. Nitta.

578
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,412
It's a waste of time.

579
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,180
Nothing you say will get to him.

580
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,652
Why do you give up so easily?

581
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,987
Both you and Mr. Sugishita.

582
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,293
"Credit goes to the boss.
Mistakes to the subordinates."

583
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,427
That's unacceptable.

584
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:16,100
Are we not allowed to point out
what's wrong at this bank?

585
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,535
It can't be helped!

586
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,908
What you're saying is correct.

587
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,710
Everyone knows that.

588
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,479
But

589
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,215
no matter how correct it is,

590
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,719
there are some things that
don't apply at a bank.

591
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,026
You may not know that
because you've always been a teller.

592
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,631
With all due respect…

593
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,536
is it the rule at a bank to keep quiet
when we see someone

594
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,838
suffering from injustice?

595
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,809
When things become inconvenient,

596
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,911
everyone says "bank this," "bank that."

597
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,882
Are banks that special?

598
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,807
What are you doing?

599
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,945
You're from Branch Inspection.

600
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,215
I heard that Manager Nitta
from the Aoyama Branch was here.

601
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,550
Mr. Nitta already left.

602
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,153
I see.

603
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,324
What business do you have with Mr. Nitta?

604
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,762
Nothing. Thank you very much.

605
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,473
Hanasaki.

606
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,741
BRANCH MANAGING DEPARTMENT
DIRECTOR SHINJIRO KARASHIMA

607
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:04,942
What's the matter?

608
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,813
Mr. Karashima.

609
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,418
I see. That's what Soma said, huh?

610
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,852
Yes.

611
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,223
I think he sees his past self

612
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,793
in Mr. Sugishita.

613
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,497
AOYAMA BRANCH
NITTA / ISHIKAWA / SUGISHITA

614
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,102
If it's unrecoverable,

615
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,404
it's your responsibility!

616
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,809
What happened to him in the past?

617
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,579
I guess I can tell you
since you work with him.

618
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,584
Did you know he was in the
Finance Department at Marunouchi Branch?

619
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,787
Yes, he said he worked under Mr. Nitta.

620
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,789
Yes, that's the time.

621
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,993
A business he was overseeing went bankrupt

622
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,528
and lost 100 million yen.

623
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,564
One hundred million?

624
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,235
In order to take responsibility for that,
he was transferred

625
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,038
from the Finance Department
to the Sales Division.

626
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,741
Basically, he got an X-mark

627
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,978
and fell off his career path.

628
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,250
But there was a rumor back then saying,

629
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,820
"Soma had to

630
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,723
take responsibility
in place of his boss, Nitta.

631
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,460
Nitta was the one that originally

632
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,897
proceeded with the loans to begin with."

633
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,106
NOTICE OF TRANSFER

634
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,108
Please wait a minute.

635
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:48,146
Manager Nitta, that's an account
that you handed over to me.

636
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,747
You didn't listen to me

637
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,216
when I asked you to reconsider it.

638
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,486
-Why do I have to--
-You're in charge of this account.

639
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,190
You.

640
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,659
There's nothing else to be said.

641
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,760
PERSON IN CHARGE - SOMA

642
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,530
All that matters is the result.

643
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,331
That's a bank for you.

644
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,939
Everything regarding this issue
is your responsibility.

645
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,636
They're the only ones who know the truth.

646
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,272
But that incident

647
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,343
changed his life as a banker.

648
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,511
That's for sure.

649
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,783
I see.

650
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,193
<i>But I'm surprised to see you</i>

651
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,396
<i>doing this kind of a job, Soma.</i>

652
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,968
<i>The former ace of the Finance Department</i>
<i>is now a Branch Inspector, huh.</i>

653
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,503
And your partner is a female to boot.

654
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,373
These are just women taking their anger
out on us because they can't marry.

655
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,908
If you can't get it,

656
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,210
you have to take responsibility.

657
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,879
All that matters is the result.
That's a bank for you.

658
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,851
BRANCH INSPECTION

659
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,305
I'm sorry about earlier.

660
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,374
I shouldn't have said that.

661
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,577
It's fine.

662
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,016
Um…

663
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,955
-Um…
-What is it?

664
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,523
Mr. Soma.

665
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,726
Let's take revenge.

666
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,596
What are you saying?

667
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:22,500
There's something I noticed about
Branch Manager Nitta.

668
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,403
-What?
-Mr. Sugishita said something.

669
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,472
That he recently bought a house
in the downtown area.

670
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,174
He bought a foreign car too.

671
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,811
And?

672
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,982
Do you think he's getting a share of
the money

673
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,183
from Grand Marriage?

674
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,388
That's why he pushed for the loan.

675
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,493
But we have no proof.

676
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,797
Proof…

677
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,501
Oh, look at this.

678
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,104
"Wonderful business.
I'd like to support it. Nitta."

679
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,405
He wrote this, right?

680
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,909
Would this prove that he forced
the loan proceedings?

681
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,611
No, this wouldn't be enough.

682
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,715
What else is there…

683
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,817
Something else…

684
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,888
-Sorry.
-What are you doing?

685
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,225
What?

686
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,566
Is this…

687
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,436
What is it?

688
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,708
CUSTOMER INFORMATION DATABASE

689
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,511
MIKA KAWAGUCHI

690
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,579
MIKA KAWAGUCHI

691
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,782
AKASAKA BRANCH

692
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,317
Just as I thought.

693
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,129
What is it, Hanasaki?

694
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,332
Mr. Soma, please take a look at this.

695
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,269
-What is it?
-Members of Grand Marriage.

696
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,472
Among them is a customer I knew
when I worked at the Akasaka Branch.

697
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,574
How did you remember her name?

698
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,311
Remembering the customer's name
is part of a teller's job.

699
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,747
But just one person…

700
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,850
There's at least ten people
just within this list.

701
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,752
TOMOMI KUWABARA AKASAKA BRANCH
JUNKO MIYAGAWA AKASAKA BRANCH

702
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,154
NAOMI TANIGUCHI AKASAKA BRANCH
MAYUMI YOKOYAMA AKASAKA BRANCH

703
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,893
Is this a coincidence?

704
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,498
Hanasaki.

705
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,067
Let's check them.

706
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,503
-All 113 names.
-Yes.

707
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,374
-Give me half of the list.
-Yes.

708
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,016
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

709
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,290
At this rate,

710
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,360
50 million yen will become unrecoverable.

711
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,163
Yes.

712
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,231
Sugishita,

713
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,234
are you prepared?

714
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,973
Sugishita!

715
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,816
Excuse me.

716
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,821
Why are you here?

717
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,757
We're here to see you,
Branch Manager Nitta.

718
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,227
Unlike the Branch Inspectors,
I'm really busy.

719
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,264
We're having an important discussion about

720
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,499
the 50 million yen loan. Right, Sugishita?

721
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,806
We have an important discussion too.

722
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,242
Branch Manager Nitta,

723
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,313
it's about the crime you have committed.

724
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,249
What?

725
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,384
Crime?

726
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,854
What are you talking about?

727
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:42,993
You deliberately pushed ahead
with the loan for Grand Marriage

728
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,696
because you had a reason to do so.

729
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,630
What?

730
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,302
That's why you didn't listen to
Mr. Sugishita

731
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,237
when he suggested

732
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,839
examining the account more carefully.

733
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,977
What are you talking about?

734
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,813
I can't waste my time on this nonsense.

735
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,714
Get out.

736
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,052
That's too bad.

737
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,621
I was hoping

738
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,323
you would confess on your own.

739
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,457
I said get out.

740
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,768
These are

741
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,506
313 signatures of female members
at Grand Marriage.

742
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,709
When we

743
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,812
compared these names with our
bank's client database,

744
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,917
205 people out of 313 listed on here,

745
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,354
had something in common.

746
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,427
They have an account at our bank.

747
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,200
We're a large bank.
That's not surprising at all.

748
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,068
You're right.

749
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,704
But that's not all.

750
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,643
They're all single women
between 30 and 45 with

751
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,978
an annual income of over eight million yen

752
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,848
and five million yen in balance.

753
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,718
Grand Marriage is
a high-end marriage agency.

754
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,720
They had clients that could afford

755
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,023
to pay the two-million-yen enrollment fee.

756
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,796
Lastly, there is another
big common factor.

757
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,033
Their accounts

758
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,069
are all in either
Aoyama, Akasaka, or Shibuya.

759
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,338
Just those three branches.

760
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,209
There are over 160 branches
within the city,

761
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,546
but all 205 members are clients
at the three

762
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,015
branches located near Grand Marriage.

763
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,617
Is it a coincidence?

764
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,888
And your point?

765
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,424
Our bank's personal information
was leaked.

766
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,330
We had the System Department
look at the records of searches

767
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,865
made on our database.

768
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,871
Female women between 30 and 45,

769
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,076
who opened an account at either
Akasaka, Aoyama or Shibuya,

770
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,179
with over five million yen
in their account.

771
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,384
There was one person in our bank who had

772
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,820
searched for all those criteria

773
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,422
on our database.

774
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:31,795
Employee identification number 9806451.

775
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,767
Branch Manager Nitta, it's you.

776
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,006
HAYAO NITTA AOYAMA BRANCH

777
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,879
That's wrong. It's not me.

778
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,948
You sold the data to

779
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,549
Mr. Munakata, right?

780
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,820
Based on that data,
Grand Marriage persistently

781
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,423
solicited them by calling and messaging,

782
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,058
to acquire its members.

783
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,995
You took part in a crime

784
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,597
that troubled many women!

785
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,237
I didn't know that it was fraud!

786
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,074
How did this happen?

787
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,548
Mr. Nitta.

788
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,720
Until now, whenever a problem arose,
you made your subordinates

789
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,889
take the responsibility,

790
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,558
and that's how you came this far.

791
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,832
But you will have to take

792
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,669
responsibility for this one.

793
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,452
Credit goes to the boss,

794
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,055
mistakes to subordinates.

795
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,992
If that's common sense at the bank,

796
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,229
that kind of common sense can…

797
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,165
kiss my ass!

798
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,535
That's all.

799
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,795
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

800
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,396
Well…

801
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,968
I need to do my best without giving up.

802
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,838
That's right. You're going to
become a dad soon.

803
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:55,772
Yes.

804
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,810
"Kiss my ass" huh…

805
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,714
I'm sorry for cursing.

806
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,482
I don't usually curse. Right?

807
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,518
Oh, come on.

808
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,623
I'm serious. I don't usually say
things like that.

809
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,393
I was just a little frustrated,
but I'm usually all smiles.

810
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,097
<i>As for the data breach of</i>
<i>our customer's information,</i>

811
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:24,801
<i>we deeply apologize to our customers,</i>

812
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,372
<i>shareholders, and everyone involved,</i>

813
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:32,576
<i>for causing a great deal of inconvenience</i>
<i>and trouble.</i>

814
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,413
Mr. Munakata confessed everything,

815
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,216
and we may be able to recover
the 50 million.

816
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,486
What about the female members?

817
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,254
It won't be a full return,

818
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,924
but they will get a portion of it back.

819
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,126
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

820
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,462
But I can't believe how these
problems occur

821
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,132
wherever those Branch Inspectors go.

822
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,667
Yeah.

823
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,937
But they end up solving each incident,

824
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:03,440
so those two might be a very good pair.

825
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,314
I can't believe

826
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,917
Nitta damaged Tokyo Daiichi Bank's trust

827
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:14,851
this badly.

828
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,189
Disciplinary dismissal was appropriate.

829
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:20,857
Yes.

830
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,228
He was receiving money from them too…

831
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,831
Even though Mr. Nitta was being
favored by you--

832
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,900
Who was favoring him?

833
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,801
What?

834
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,339
He wasn't cut for greater things.

835
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,341
Yes.

836
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:39,910
But…

837
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,847
seems like those Branch Inspectors
stirred up trouble again.

838
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,982
Yes.

839
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,783
It seems like

840
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:51,188
we can't give them free rein
to do what they want.

841
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:53,357
Yes.

842
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,401
I'm glad Mr. Sugishita didn't
get terminated.

843
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,302
Yeah.

844
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:09,373
His wife can concentrate
on her baby without any worries.

845
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,375
That's right.

846
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,946
Family is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

847
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,648
You have to get married first.

848
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,685
That's right.

849
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,824
What should we have for lunch today?

850
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,627
Our inspection site today
is the Odawara Branch,

851
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,897
and Odawara is known for… fish cakes.

852
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,533
You're still a rookie.
Those are for souvenirs.

853
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,502
Oden.

854
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,637
Seafood rice bowl.

855
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,006
Deep fried mackerel!

856
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,609
-That sounds good.
-You think so too?

857
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,145
-We have similar tastes.
-Only with food.

858
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,846
-Oh!
-What?

859
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,316
We'll miss the train. Let's run.

860
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,052
Wait. Hold on a second.

861
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,255
Deep fried mackerel!

862
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,890
Wait.

863
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,393
-Support?
-As a teller.

864
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,328
I'm getting excited.

865
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,730
Make them work harder.

866
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,632
Finish this up.

867
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,801
I came here to get bullied?

868
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,768
Just do it.

869
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,137
I'll have to fight back.

870
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,474
I've been troubled because of
these incompetent people.

871
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,944
Everyone here is not incompetent.

872
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,180
