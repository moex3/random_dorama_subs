1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,778
Please wait! I'm getting on!

2
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,016
BRANCH MANAGING DEPARTMENT
BRANCH INSPECTION - MAI HANASAKI

3
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,350
I made it.

4
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,425
-Want to come to my place tonight?
-What?

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,327
-My mom's not home today.
-Really?

6
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,929
-Your eyelash.
-Oh?

7
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,199
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

8
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,436
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Thank you.

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,043
-Are you okay?
-Okay?

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,381
Ouch…

11
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,888
They're so lucky.

12
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,992
I wonder where I can find my Mr. Right.

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,627
I found it.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,935
Good morning, Mr. Shibasaki.

15
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,170
Good morning, Hanasaki.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,471
BRANCH MANAGING DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT GM
TAIICHI SHIBASAKI

17
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,273
That's yours, right?

18
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,912
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,414
Looks like you're having
a leisurely morning.

20
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,382
What?

21
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,053
Oh! I have to go. Excuse me.

22
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,191
She's full of energy.

23
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,634
Excuse me! I'm getting on!

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,208
Good morning,

25
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,076
Mr. Shindo, Mr. Kodama.

26
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,044
Good morning.

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,812
CORPORATE PLANNING DIVISION ASSISTANT GM
NAOKI KODAMA

28
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,880
Branch Inspection.

29
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,981
I'm Hanasaki.

30
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,551
Oh, from Branch Inspection.

31
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,286
You're working hard.

32
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,623
Not at all. I'm only getting used to it.

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,392
I'm thankful that you've accepted this job

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,262
that nobody wants to do,
for the sake of our bank.

35
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,998
Not at all.

36
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,667
But I will do my best.

37
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,505
Banks have their own unique customs
and views,

38
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,275
so it must be hard for a young lady
like yourself.

39
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,844
No… Oh, but…

40
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,615
The traditional views of the bank
are a little stuffy

41
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,317
and old fashioned sometimes…

42
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,190
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

43
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,964
-Work hard.
-Yes. Thank you.

44
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,305
BRANCH INSPECTION

45
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,343
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

46
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,646
All right. I made it on time.

47
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,949
You can rush in here,
but there's nothing to do.

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,285
What? There's no inspection today?

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,588
It's a good sign for us to be bored.

50
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,722
What?

51
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,525
Because it means there are no problems
at the branches.

52
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,162
I see… but we're not the police.

53
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,531
Unlike my time at the branch,

54
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,467
I have time to enjoy my coffee like this.

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,969
It's not so bad.

56
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,471
I can't handle staying still

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,006
in a quiet place like this.

58
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,909
That's why being a teller
was the perfect job for me.

59
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,011
You're too young.

60
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,014
Mr. Soma,

61
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,649
you're not that old either.

62
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,687
Hey. I never said that I was old…

63
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,790
Hello. Branch Inspection.

64
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,794
No, it's not. Yes. Goodbye.

65
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,896
What was it?

66
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,498
-It was a wrong number.
-I see.

67
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,374
It's too quiet.

68
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,579
-Should I sing something?
-No, thank you.

69
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,886
The bank is stuffy and old fashioned, huh?

70
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,456
That female employee
doesn't know anything.

71
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,125
She just happened to solve
a big incident recently,

72
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,860
so she's getting ahead of herself.

73
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,895
Then you should teach her.

74
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,964
Yes?

75
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,833
Normally, a Branch Inspector

76
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,969
is only supposed to solve small issues
within the branch.

77
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,073
They're almost non-existent
in this organization.

78
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,510
Take care of it.

79
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,412
Yes!

80
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,424
The branch data has been organized,

81
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,993
all the documents for disposal
were shredded,

82
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,428
and we cleaned the office.

83
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,398
There's nothing to do tomorrow.

84
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,202
Dad, what's wrong?

85
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,640
-I haven't been feeling well.
-Really?

86
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,176
I feel uneasy.

87
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,046
My pot broke, I'm out of sweet sake,
and my knife is blunt.

88
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,580
That's not your health.

89
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,752
What are those pills?

90
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,957
They're supplements.

91
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,993
You bought this many?

92
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,195
I get one free when I buy three.

93
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,129
I see.

94
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,200
"Araiso no ko"? Does this work?

95
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,437
Apparently, some type of extract
from seaweed.

96
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,206
-It's good for somewhere in the body.
-How vague.

97
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,841
All of my customers take this.

98
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,176
So I'm sure it works.

99
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,846
You always fall for these
online health commercials.

100
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,481
But they never last.

101
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,184
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

102
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,986
Acupressure sandals, knee brace,

103
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,889
balance ball, and exercise steps.
They're all dusty.

104
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,793
And the inversion table is
just a clothing rack.

105
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,630
-I'll use it someday.
-I wonder.

106
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,845
-One, two, one, two.
-It won't last long.

107
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,647
I see.

108
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,384
Please leave it up to me.

109
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,185
I'm counting on you.

110
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,489
Kayabacho and Aoyama.

111
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:34,293
Mr. Shindo is very frustrated because
two Branch Managers

112
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,897
from the Shindo faction
have been dismissed one after another.

113
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,200
There is lots of work to do at my branch,

114
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,270
so I'm sure they'll give up in one day.

115
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,772
I'm glad to hear that.

116
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,039
KAMATA BRANCH
BRANCH MANAGER SUGA

117
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,475
I'll brand them as useless workers

118
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,511
and send them back to you.

119
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,083
I look forward to it.

120
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,220
Mr. Kodama, if this goes well…

121
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,357
I will put in a word with Mr. Shindo

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,393
so that you can go to the department
of your choice,

123
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,296
during the next transfer.

124
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,098
Thank you.

125
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,601
How long has this been collecting dust?

126
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,545
Hello, it's Hanasaki.

127
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,015
I just got a call from Mr. Shibasaki.

128
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,119
They want us to go to the Kamata Branch
for two days early next week.

129
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,424
-For inspection?
-No, it's for support.

130
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,358
Support?

131
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,727
You'll be a teller.

132
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,897
What? A teller?

133
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,832
Yeah.

134
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,136
How annoying. This is not our job
as Branch Inspectors.

135
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,872
I got it!

136
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,908
See you later. Good night.

137
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,113
What's wrong with her?

138
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,949
Yes!

139
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:09,322
I can work as a teller for the first time
in a long while.

140
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,523
All right!

141
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,029
Unbelievable.

142
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,099
Mr. Shibasaki should turn down jobs
that are not

143
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,835
associated with branch inspection.

144
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,973
But it was a request from
the Branch Manager, right?

145
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,041
They probably have high hopes for us.

146
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,212
High hopes? For us? For what?

147
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,083
I guess so… but what kind of person
is the Branch Manager?

148
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,918
He's an elite from headquarters

149
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,488
and it's only been a year since
he went to the Kamata Branch.

150
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,623
I see.

151
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,493
But ever since he took over,
their numbers have been declining.

152
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,896
He was always harsh on his subordinates,

153
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,865
but I hear he's getting worse these days.

154
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,700
-I see.
-Oh.

155
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,870
And he's from the Shindo faction.

156
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,673
-Again?
-Yes.

157
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,144
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

158
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,646
KAMATA BRANCH

159
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,182
KAMATA BRANCH

160
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,251
Hanasaki.

161
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,020
Don't get riled up.

162
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,622
I know. If I want to say something,

163
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,957
I'll breathe in.

164
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,662
Promise me you'll do that.

165
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,897
-Yes.
-Where's your smile?

166
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,736
Can't you smile a little more warmly?

167
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,742
Then show me how to do it.

168
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,479
What? I guess I have no other choice.

169
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,484
Can I take a picture of that?

170
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,588
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

171
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,557
So you're the Branch Inspectors.

172
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,961
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

173
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,063
We will do our best.

174
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,198
Your best?

175
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,132
Yes.

176
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,436
That's what people say
when they cut corners.

177
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,805
That's not what I meant.

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,443
We heard that we were called here

179
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,914
because you personally requested us.

180
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,083
It wasn't a request.

181
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,486
We're in a tight spot right now because

182
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,923
one of our tellers quit,
and the Deputy Manager is at training.

183
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,026
So I asked for someone
who's free and bored.

184
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,230
By the way, our branch is very busy

185
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,265
so be prepared.

186
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:38,004
It will be difficult for people like
you guys who have been away from action.

187
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,507
No one will take pity and help you
even if you cry.

188
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,946
I will do my very best.

189
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,615
-Just as I always do.
-Step back.

190
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,528
How dare he think that I would cry.

191
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,097
All right.

192
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,204
If we continue this way,
we won't meet our budget.

193
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,940
The F Block is certain
to place last again.

194
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,343
Why isn't there

195
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,080
a single person who can
live up to my expectations?

196
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,416
Listen carefully.

197
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,952
We don't need incompetent people
at this branch!

198
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,124
Finance Department.

199
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,261
I've been bringing in major clients,

200
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,396
but what are you doing?

201
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,966
Don't show your face here
until you bring in a new loan account.

202
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,967
Yes, sir.

203
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,070
Sales Division.

204
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,173
I'm not expecting you to raise profits.

205
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,475
Just don't go into minus.

206
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,977
Listen. Just don't make any mistakes.

207
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,880
-Yes, sir.
-Louder!

208
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,415
Yes, sir.

209
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,152
Oh, these Branch Inspectors
from headquarters

210
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,088
have come all the way here

211
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,591
to help us out with
administrative support.

212
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,129
They usually inspect branches.

213
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,099
Hopefully they will be of some help.

214
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,270
Hanasaki, you will work as a teller.

215
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,739
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,908
Soma, you'll be in the lobby

217
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,010
to direct the customers.

218
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,847
What?

219
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,515
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

220
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,688
Nice to meet you.

221
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,922
Nice to meet you.

222
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,497
I'm getting excited.

223
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,499
ATTENDANT

224
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,367
Why am I doing this?

225
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,170
Nice to meet you.

226
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,706
Nice to meet you.

227
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,876
The battle is about to begin.

228
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,711
Battle?

229
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:09,922
Welcome.

230
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,659
I will pass out ticket numbers,
so please stand in line.

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,961
Excuse me.
I will pass out the ticket number.

232
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,230
Welcome.

233
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,400
Welcome. Good morning.

234
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,103
-Wow.
-Please.

235
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,404
Pick up your ticket number here.

236
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,676
Welcome.

237
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,678
Welcome.

238
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,348
Please hold onto this number
and take a seat.

239
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,085
I was wondering who they would be,

240
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,856
but they ended up being a cheeky
young girl and a man who's spaced out.

241
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,090
Yes, sir.

242
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,594
Load them with work.
Don't show them mercy.

243
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,262
Yes, sir.

244
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,800
It'll be too much for them to handle.

245
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,037
We have some customers that are
hard to deal with.

246
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,707
How long are you going to make us wait?

247
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,410
How long do you think I've been waiting?

248
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,212
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,014
I'm processing a transaction
for the previous customer.

250
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,851
-Please wait a little longer.
-No, I won't.

251
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,053
What's wrong with this bank?

252
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,623
You guys are working too slow.

253
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,159
I'm very sorry. I'll try to work faster.

254
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,627
What?

255
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,336
Please wait.

256
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,944
Fine then.

257
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,180
Thank you.

258
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,390
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Arakawa.

259
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,158
Please confirm this.

260
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,530
My legs are swollen.

261
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh, Mr. Kaneda.

262
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,769
-I'll help you.
-Thank you.

263
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,738
Thank you.

264
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,507
It must be tough every day,

265
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,078
to be helping out customers
and running other tasks at the same time.

266
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,482
I'm forcing myself to keep going.

267
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,650
That's amazing.

268
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:24,523
Our tellers are very competent,

269
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,861
but Ms. Hanasaki has wonderful
customer service.

270
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,065
They have to deal with both nice customers
and difficult customers.

271
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,302
She once told me that

272
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,705
she never distinguishes her customers.

273
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,943
She has the same attitude
towards everyone.

274
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:45,911
Even her boss.

275
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,614
I'll remember that.

276
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,950
But please don't tell her that.

277
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,385
She'll get carried away.

278
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,790
Why are you resting?

279
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,631
Even if you're only a part-timer,

280
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,933
we don't need unmotivated workers.

281
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,269
I apologize.

282
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,874
It's not your break time yet.

283
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,244
You're right.

284
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,386
Thank you for waiting.

285
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,888
Have fun
at your grandchild's birthday party.

286
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,590
-Thank you.
-Take care.

287
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,858
Thank you.

288
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,926
CALL

289
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,197
<i>Number 212.</i>

290
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,202
Transfer and tax receipt.

291
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,636
TRANSFER

292
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,604
Welcome.

293
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,187
Thank you for waiting.

294
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,223
Please come again.

295
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,993
Wow.

296
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,697
She's really meant to be a teller, huh?

297
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:33,185
-How's that female teller?
-Well…

298
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,186
Oh!

299
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,755
Welcome, Mr. Takeuchi.

300
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,590
Hello, Branch Manager Suga.

301
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,393
How can we help you today?

302
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,295
I have a few transfers to make.

303
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,997
I can take that.

304
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,665
Please have a seat.

305
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,100
Thank you.

306
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,873
Hey you, do this first.

307
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,642
I'm working in order.

308
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,345
I told you to do this first.

309
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,348
Mr. Takeuchi is an important customer.

310
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,220
Then I think it would be best
to process this in the back.

311
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,457
Because all the other customers
have been waiting in line.

312
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,893
I told you to do it right now!

313
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,168
Please don't worry.

314
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,270
They're working in order.

315
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,639
-I'm very sorry.
-Not at all.

316
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,642
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

317
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,946
-Please have a seat.
-Yes.

318
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,816
Welcome.

319
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,319
The rest is fine.

320
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,410
So fast!

321
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,679
-It's balanced.
-That was fast!

322
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,515
BALANCE

323
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,482
Wow.

324
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,253
-It's balanced.
-Okay.

325
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,687
It's balanced.

326
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,456
-It's balanced.
-Okay.

327
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,757
TOTAL BALANCE AT TELLER
BALANCED

328
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,563
Everything is balanced.

329
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

330
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,304
I'm done.

331
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,408
I processed 105 customers today.
No wonder it was so busy.

332
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,310
I did 96.

333
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,380
I'm sorry, I only did 84.

334
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,983
What? Ms. Hanasaki, you did 143?

335
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,953
I gave it my all because it's been

336
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,222
a while since I've done this.

337
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,724
Wow.

338
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,625
It's nothing.

339
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,564
Didn't you give them work to do?

340
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,299
Yes.

341
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,302
I directed all
the difficult customers to her,

342
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,471
so she should've given up already but…

343
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,876
she's more detailed and faster
than our experienced tellers.

344
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,213
-Why are you impressed?
-I'm sorry!

345
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,015
Think of something else.

346
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,051
If they leave here unscathed,

347
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,253
I won't be able to face Mr. Shindo!

348
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,190
Make sure you knock them down tomorrow!

349
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,158
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,796
This restaurant is far away
from the branch,

351
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,467
so we don't have to worry about
bumping into co-workers or customers.

352
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,169
Okay.

353
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,771
Cheers!

354
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,281
We can complain all we want here.

355
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,350
That's important.

356
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,621
That branch is so somber and stressful.

357
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,122
I'm glad you agree.

358
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,392
The atmosphere changes
when Branch Manager walks in.

359
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,994
Yes, it does.

360
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,996
He's always frustrated because

361
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,365
our branch isn't producing good results.

362
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,900
It gives us anxiety because he's always

363
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,003
walking around the main floor.

364
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,238
It's as if he's looking
over our shoulders.

365
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,540
Wouldn't that cause you to make mistakes?

366
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,010
-Yes!
-Right?

367
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,412
Let's drink all we want today

368
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,748
and release our stress!

369
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,750
Cheers.

370
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,361
-That was a long day.
-Yes.

371
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,670
Delicious.

372
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,607
I'm glad I brought you here.

373
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,475
This is excellent.

374
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,813
I had made a note of this place
as somewhere to visit

375
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,815
in Kamata. See?

376
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,817
Oh, that's good to know.

377
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,521
The sashimi sounds good too.

378
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,523
I want the potato salad,

379
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,193
and the simmered beef and tofu too.

380
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,832
Ms. Hanasaki, you were so cool today.

381
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,300
With Mr. Takeuchi, right?

382
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,170
The Branch Manager's face was hilarious.

383
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,104
It sure was.

384
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,209
-Is Mr. Takeuchi a longtime customer?
-No.

385
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,613
He's the president of an IT company
in Shinagawa.

386
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,950
He recently built a house near our branch,
and that's when he

387
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,185
became our customer.

388
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,688
Then why does he get special treatment?

389
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,525
He's planning to move his company
near the branch,

390
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,427
so the Branch Manager wants him.

391
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,397
He wants them to use our bank.

392
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,034
Mr. Takeuchi's company apparently makes
two billion yen a year.

393
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,237
I see, so that's what it is.

394
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,508
So you finalized the plans
to relocate your office?

395
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,479
Yes. I believe my employees will
be using your bank after we relocate.

396
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,115
And as for the other thing we discussed…

397
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,286
Oh, about our main bank?

398
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,721
Yes.

399
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,024
We've been with Hakusui Bank
for a long time,

400
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,926
but there's no office in Kamata.

401
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,295
I think I will be moving over

402
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,530
to Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

403
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,299
-Really?
-Yes.

404
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,703
Thank you very much.

405
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,140
I'd like to set everything up at once with

406
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,609
direct deposits and things like that.

407
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,912
Please open an account for

408
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,614
all 40 employees.

409
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,016
Thank you very much.

410
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,520
But I'm short on time.

411
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,989
We will do it immediately.

412
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,191
Mr. Kadowaki, the application.

413
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,962
Here's the application.

414
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,766
We'll just need ID verification
for all the employees--

415
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,368
If you're in rush,

416
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,637
you can give us the verification later on.

417
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,006
Just fill out this form

418
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,341
and submit the power of attorney.

419
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,710
Then we will process it all at once.

420
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,179
Are you sure?

421
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,781
Yes, just for you, Mr. Takeuchi.

422
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,051
Thank you very much.

423
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,858
-Looking forward to our business.
-Thank you.

424
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,562
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Thank you.

425
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,969
Let's eat.

426
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,537
Mr. Soma,

427
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,640
there's something I want to tell you.

428
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,309
What is it?

429
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,913
We get some difficult customers

430
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,749
at our branch every day.

431
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,852
But all of them were

432
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,688
directed toward Ms. Hanasaki today.

433
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,659
<i>Number 314.</i>

434
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,495
Excuse me.

435
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,497
Please go to that window.

436
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,734
So that's what was happening.

437
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,736
I was noticing that

438
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,639
Hanasaki was getting yelled at a lot
by the customers.

439
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,943
Is Mr. Shindo one of the top management
at headquarters?

440
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,844
Yes.

441
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,548
He's the General Manager
of Corporate Planning. Why?

442
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,818
After the bank closed, Branch Manager was

443
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,686
talking to Mr. Kadowaki.

444
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,424
He said, "At this rate, I can't show
my face in front of Mr. Shindo."

445
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,297
Maybe you and Ms. Hanasaki

446
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,966
are marked by that person.

447
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,502
What?

448
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,575
But that Branch Manager is so awful.

449
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,111
Saying "incompetent people are useless,"

450
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,046
and "I'm not expecting profits."

451
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,848
That's unacceptable.

452
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,919
-He says that all the time.
-I see.

453
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,422
I want that Branch Manager to get

454
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,724
transferred soon. I can't handle it.

455
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,194
We don't have to worry about
promotions and stuff like that,

456
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,897
but the men must be having a tough time.

457
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,666
-Right?
-Yeah.

458
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,935
He's so busy every day.

459
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,269
What?

460
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,673
Minami's boyfriend is an ace
in the Finance Department.

461
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,342
-Be quiet.
-He's good looking too.

462
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,679
You're so lucky! I'm so jealous.

463
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,082
-I guess work isn't all bad.
-Yes.

464
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,386
-Don't you have a picture?
-He was there this morning.

465
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:32,624
I see. He's trying to gain points
with Mr. Shindo

466
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,227
by giving Hanasaki and me a hard time.

467
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,167
I think so. That's why he was making
you do odd jobs

468
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,871
even though you came from headquarters.

469
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,473
That Branch Manager

470
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,810
looks like he only has numbers
and promotion in his head.

471
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,547
Both you and Ms. Hanasaki
should be careful.

472
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,750
Thank you.

473
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,257
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
KAMATA BRANCH

474
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,593
-What?
-Shut up, you're so loud.

475
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,097
I'm sorry. But does that mean
we were sent here to be bullied

476
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,866
so that the Branch Manager
can get some points?

477
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,670
I think so. He probably thinks that
Mr. Shindo will be happy

478
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,506
if he gives us a hard time,
because we took down

479
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,575
two members of the Shindo faction.

480
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:28,213
-Stop acting like a child--
-Lower your voice, idiot!

481
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,614
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,919
Well, I guess I have no choice but to

483
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,154
take this challenge.

484
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,225
Calm down, Hanasaki. Listen.
We just need to get through this day.

485
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,993
Then our job here is done.

486
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,501
I will do my best today.

487
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,937
-All right.
-Will she be okay?

488
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:58,410
I'll be at the desk instead of
working as a teller?

489
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,312
We have lots of accounts
that need to be processed.

490
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,614
Work on this for now.

491
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,617
All this by myself?

492
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,087
Yes, do you have a problem with that?

493
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,457
Not at all.

494
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,693
You'll be helping the tellers too.

495
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,627
Sure.

496
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,368
Seriously?

497
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,209
Mr. Soma…

498
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,345
It's the same old odd jobs for me.

499
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,016
Hurry up or you can't go home.

500
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,652
Yes, sir.

501
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,656
All right.

502
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,169
-Here.
-Thanks.

503
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,404
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

504
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,072
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

505
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,014
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

506
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,685
Hanasaki.

507
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,420
Yes.

508
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,556
-Hanasaki.
-Yes.

509
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,397
Please do this too.

510
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,534
Yes, sir.

511
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,116
I'm finally done.

512
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,987
Can you process the transfers now?

513
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,724
By today.

514
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,126
I understand.

515
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:03,501
Oh, I'm very sorry.

516
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,737
Please wait a moment.

517
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,510
Hanasaki, can you go to the ATM?

518
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,079
What? Me?

519
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,584
Can't you see that
we're all busy right now?

520
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,922
I understand.

521
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,960
-Hello.
-Sorry.

522
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,195
Mr. Takeuchi.

523
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,198
Thank you for yesterday.

524
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,533
How can I help you?

525
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,002
My passbook won't come out,

526
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,271
even though the cash and card came out.

527
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,209
I'm very sorry.
I will go check on that right now,

528
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,578
can you wait inside the lobby?

529
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,279
Okay.

530
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,635
SONOKO ARAI

531
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,674
Thank you for waiting.

532
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,743
Is this your passbook?

533
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,914
Thank you, this is my wife's.
This is her maiden name.

534
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,916
I see.

535
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,386
-Mr. Takeuchi.
-Hello, Branch Manager.

536
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,957
Welcome. Thank you for yesterday.

537
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:37,128
Likewise. And I brought some documents

538
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,665
for the application to open the accounts.

539
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,533
Thank you.

540
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,135
For 42 people.

541
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,404
Thank you very much.

542
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,007
We will get to this right away.

543
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,608
Thank you very much.

544
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,543
I'll be leaving now.

545
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,353
I hope you weren't rude to Mr. Takeuchi.

546
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,457
Of course not.

547
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,766
That cheeky little brat
hasn't changed at all.

548
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,803
She's been completing all the work
I've been giving her…

549
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,838
What are you doing?

550
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,042
Then we'll do whatever it takes

551
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,912
to take her down a peg or two.

552
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,553
-Here it is.
-Okay.

553
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,088
-Here it is.
-Okay.

554
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,263
-Here it is.
-Okay.

555
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,197
-Here.
-Okay.

556
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,468
I wonder if I can finish this today.

557
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,443
This is the payment from a customer
at the Finance Department.

558
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,378
-Process it.
-Yes, sir.

559
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,481
He's almost leaving, so do it right away.

560
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,682
Yes, sir.

561
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,852
What?

562
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,459
Writing the account number
is basic routine.

563
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,660
Unbelievable.

564
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,863
AKASHI BUILDING

565
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,232
SEARCH

566
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,648
What have you done?

567
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,418
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,758
We asked you to request a deposit
from Akashi Building Inc.

569
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:51,062
But you sent a request to
Akashi Building Ltd.

570
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,997
They're different companies.

571
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,801
The account number wasn't
written on the deposit slip,

572
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,770
so I searched for it myself.

573
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,740
I didn't know there were two companies
with the same name.

574
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,941
What?

575
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,011
You're blaming it on the deposit slip?

576
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,846
No…

577
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,884
Mr. Kadowaki noticed the error

578
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,519
and stopped it from

579
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,589
getting processed, so it didn't
become a big issue.

580
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,392
But what if he didn't notice it?

581
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,563
How embarrassing.

582
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,066
Even a rookie wouldn't

583
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,202
make an error with
the account number, right?

584
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,537
Yes.

585
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,406
Our branch was about to get marked up

586
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,342
because of someone
who's only here for two days.

587
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,212
I'm very sorry.

588
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,083
Don't just apologize to me.
Apologize to everyone else.

589
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,126
I'm very sorry

590
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,528
for causing you trouble.

591
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,765
Listen everyone.

592
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,769
You guys better not make
an embarrassing mistake like this.

593
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,840
We don't need incompetent people
in this branch.

594
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,124
Just as I promised,
I taught them a nice lesson.

595
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,825
Thank you.

596
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,997
I'm sure it will make
Mr. Shindo very happy.

597
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,549
I'm very sorry

598
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,651
for causing trouble for you.

599
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,954
Don't be. That was definitely a trap.

600
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,956
-A trap?
-Everyone at this branch knows.

601
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,159
About there being two companies

602
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,361
called Akashi Building.

603
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,463
-What?
-It's easy to mistake them.

604
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,932
So Mr. Kadowaki is always telling us
not to forget

605
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,534
the account number on the slip.

606
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,204
-Then…
-He did it on purpose.

607
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,106
So that you would fail.

608
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,874
If they stop it in time,

609
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,543
our branch won't get in trouble.

610
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,779
I doubt Mr. Kadowaki could do that
on his own initiative,

611
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,448
so it must have been set up
by the Branch Manager.

612
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,188
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

613
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,525
I was completely tricked.

614
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,460
That's why he looked so smug.

615
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,296
That damn Branch Manager!

616
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,066
It's delicious.

617
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,969
Mr. Soma, were you listening
to what I was saying?

618
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,939
Let's forget about it,
since it's all behind us now.

619
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,874
But still…

620
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,376
I feel bad for everyone working there too.

621
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,913
They have to work under
that Branch Manager.

622
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,849
The performance at Kamata Branch
is declining,

623
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,319
but that's definitely
Branch Manager Suga's fault.

624
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,022
Yeah. No one would have
the motivation to work when

625
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,458
he strips everyone of their dignity.

626
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,527
Is he really an elite?

627
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,363
Being capable or not,

628
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,132
and having good leadership or not

629
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,567
are two different things.

630
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,539
I see. Which means he's
disqualified as a Branch Manager.

631
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,708
I didn't go that far.

632
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,410
Isn't there anything we can do?

633
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:32,283
If you keep on empathizing with
the branch employees,

634
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,920
it'll make it that much harder for you
to continue this job.

635
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:36,887
Fine.

636
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,494
What? Are you serious?

637
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,999
-Yes.
-Oh no. I got tricked.

638
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,167
-What happened, Dad?
-Listen, Mai.

639
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,770
This supplement is a scam.

640
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,705
-What?
-A scam?

641
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,074
I guess it was a hot topic online

642
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,778
because they received
a flood of complaints. I was tricked.

643
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,114
-Oh no.
-That's horrible.

644
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,183
Someone researched the ingredients

645
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,253
and found nothing effective in it.
It's like candy.

646
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,589
No one can contact them anymore.

647
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,325
They probably fled already.

648
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,893
They fled…

649
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,828
Can I see that?

650
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,430
Sure.

651
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,034
Araiso no Ko.

652
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,670
BANK NAME - TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
BRANCH - ASAGAYA BRANCH

653
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,141
Hey, their account is our bank
at the Asagaya Branch.

654
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,077
You're right.

655
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,047
That means our bank account
was used for illegal dealings.

656
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,283
Well, only if it really was a scam.

657
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,451
Hey Mai,

658
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,254
wouldn't your bank be able to find
the culprit?

659
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,789
Report it to the police.

660
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,492
-That's not possible.
-Why?

661
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,929
People use dummy accounts
for illegal dealings.

662
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,533
-Dummy accounts?
-They use other people's names.

663
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,935
Or they make up names

664
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,137
to trick the bank into opening an account.

665
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,908
Even the bank doesn't know
who's using the account.

666
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,377
-It's a big problem.
-Oh, so it's used for scams.

667
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,145
All sorts of them?

668
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,981
-I've seen those before.
-That's right.

669
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,553
As a bank, we can't stop
such transactions,

670
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,121
so it's difficult to handle.

671
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,856
How frustrating.

672
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,025
You know that it's a scam,

673
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,827
but you can't catch them!

674
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,563
What is it?

675
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,733
Mr. Soma, we may be able to
catch this con artist.

676
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,201
What?

677
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,844
SONOKO ARAI

678
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,978
SEARCH

679
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,315
Just as I thought.

680
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,050
What do you mean?

681
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,452
-Mr. Soma, look at this.
-What?

682
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,488
The name under this account

683
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,690
is not Araiso no Ko,

684
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,859
but Sonoko Arai.

685
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:55,760
SONOKO ARAI

686
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,361
Oh.

687
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,831
The scam artist who made
this dummy account

688
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,967
decided to scam people by

689
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,102
making supplements using this name.

690
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,003
ARAISO NO KO
ARAI SONOKO

691
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,239
They're both the same in <i>katakana</i>.

692
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,274
Transfers use <i>katakana</i>,

693
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,143
so he used that to his advantage.

694
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,578
I see.

695
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,616
People would find it suspicious
to transfer money to an actual person,

696
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,753
but this made it look like
it was the company name.

697
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,955
Just like my dad.

698
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,058
I have to say, it's a smart idea but…

699
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,962
Wait, didn't you say that we might

700
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,031
be able to catch this con artist?

701
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:34,999
Who is it?

702
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,935
Mr. Takeuchi.

703
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,937
Mr. Takeuchi…

704
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,240
-The customer at Kamata Branch?
-Yes.

705
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,645
Yesterday I saw…

706
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,915
Mr. Takeuchi with the passbook
for this account.

707
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,883
It's my wife's.

708
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,720
Mr. Takeuchi said that it was
his wife's passbook,

709
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,290
but she had a different last name.

710
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,525
Are you serious?

711
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,695
Mr. Takeuchi is the con artist, right?

712
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,097
It seems so…

713
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,468
Oh no, this is bad.

714
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,370
Yesterday, they processed all

715
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,340
42 bank accounts
for Mr. Takeuchi's employees.

716
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,542
-What?
-He had the power of attorney,

717
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,611
but no personal verification.

718
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,481
But the Branch Manager pushed it through.

719
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,718
If those are all dummy accounts
to be used for fraud…

720
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,954
This is awful.

721
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,789
Let's go talk to Mr. Takeuchi.

722
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,190
Yeah.

723
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,131
Is it really here?

724
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,502
It should be close by.

725
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,544
It should be around the corner.

726
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,248
What?

727
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,626
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

728
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:16,433
Here are the 42 passbooks.

729
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,669
Thank you very much.

730
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,124
Wait a minute!

731
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,126
What are you doing here?

732
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,997
-Do not give him the passbooks.
-What are you doing?

733
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,566
How dare you be so rude.

734
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,936
-Give it back.
-Mr. Takeuchi, I'm very sorry.

735
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,606
Mr. Takeuchi, where is your
company located?

736
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,275
What?

737
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:02,079
We just went to the address
where your company is supposed to be.

738
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,451
The place was just a small park.

739
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,890
What's this nonsense?

740
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,425
It's not nonsense.

741
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,497
Mr. Takeuchi,

742
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,000
you are a con artist.

743
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:32,543
There is no relocation
or a company to begin with.

744
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,477
ARAISO NO KO

745
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:37,014
You got in contact with the Branch Manager
in order to make

746
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,016
dummy accounts for your fraud.

747
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,556
The name Katsumi Takeuchi is most likely

748
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,690
a fake name.

749
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,306
What is your real name?

750
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,058
POLICE DEPARTMENT

751
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,236
This is unbelievable.

752
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,539
I can't believe Mr. Takeuchi
was a con artist.

753
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,742
What's going to happen to our branch?

754
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,883
Let's go, Hanasaki.

755
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:46,817
Yes.

756
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:03,901
The Branch Manager and I will go to
the police for some questioning.

757
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,671
You have nothing to worry about.

758
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:12,142
Because as far as this incident
is concerned, we are the victims.

759
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,512
Let's go, Branch Manager.

760
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,649
Branch Manager?

761
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,985
Why do I have to deal with this?

762
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,558
This is all your fault!

763
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,561
If you had brought results,

764
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,931
we wouldn't have fallen for
that dumb scam.

765
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,433
How dare you taint my career!

766
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,369
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

767
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,941
-Wait a minute.
-Hey…

768
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,711
The one who fell for that "damn scam"

769
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,546
is you, Branch Manager.

770
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,715
What?

771
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,786
It's wrong
to blame your employees for that.

772
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,657
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

773
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,993
Do you know how much I've suffered

774
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,928
because of these incompetent people?

775
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,800
With all due respect…

776
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,604
everyone here is not incompetent.

777
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,845
Didn't you think that they would lose
the meaning of work when you

778
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,814
berate them like that every day?

779
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,086
The performance at this branch is bad

780
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,823
because the atmosphere of
the workplace is bad.

781
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,827
What are you saying?

782
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,595
-Shut up!
-No, I won't.

783
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,233
You only think about your promotion

784
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,335
and silence your subordinates.

785
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,870
That's wrong!

786
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,642
You always say

787
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,379
that incompetent people are not
needed here.

788
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,513
If that's so,

789
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,917
what this branch doesn't need

790
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,319
is you, Branch Manager Suga.

791
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,595
I'm sorry for causing a scene.

792
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,803
What?

793
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,878
What?

794
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,816
Oh… um…

795
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,885
it's not worthy of applause…

796
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,791
Ms. Hanasaki, look at all this.

797
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,828
My heart is beating so fast…

798
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,564
You were so cool.

799
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,142
He was caught.

800
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,510
SUSPECT SUZUKI

801
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,513
He looks like a bad guy.

802
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,149
I hope I can catch the bus.

803
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,852
Here you go, Dad.

804
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,521
-I'll be off.
-Okay, bye.

805
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,494
What?

806
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,134
<i>ENERGETIC AND LIVELY!</i>
<i>FRESH HEALTHY EXERCISE</i>

807
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,705
That girl…

808
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,278
Branch Manager Suga's next transfer
will most likely be to the countryside.

809
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,781
I think so too.

810
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,451
Banks are tough.

811
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:19,022
That's right. I've worked hard until now
enduring hardships

812
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,225
one after another as I was
sandwiched between my boss

813
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,628
and my subordinate…

814
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,463
-What?
-Oh no!

815
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,700
I had compliance training today.

816
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,202
-I might not make in time.
-Give me a break.

817
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,638
They'll blame me for management issues.

818
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,907
-I'm sorry.
-That's right, Hanasaki.

819
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,377
If you can't fulfill your schedule,
or be on time, it's an issue.

820
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,680
-Not just as a banker but--
-Sorry, I'll be off.

821
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,753
She never listens to other people.

822
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,556
Sorry.

823
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:57,060
I'm very sorry. I didn't imagine
such a thing would happen.

824
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,529
It's fine.

825
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:06,370
Those two prevented our bank
from embarrassing itself

826
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,239
by opening dummy accounts.

827
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,044
But Kodama…

828
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,112
Yes, sir.

829
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,181
I…

830
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,253
hate words that display

831
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,488
weakness…

832
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,592
Error.

833
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,262
Loss.

834
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,968
Failure!

835
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,810
BRANCH INSPECTION

836
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,945
I can't pass up on the eel.

837
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,349
What is it now?

838
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,485
The training was tomorrow.

839
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,956
-Hey.
-Sorry.

840
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,364
Disappeared?

841
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,199
It's your fault my son disappeared.

842
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,868
It's like the monster parents.

843
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,036
No financing?

844
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,371
I'm sorry.

845
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,074
There's something off about
Branch Manager Nakamura.

846
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,476
Loving your child doesn't give
you the right

847
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,944
to do whatever you want.

848
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,146
