1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:05,538
Voila.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,741
Perfect!

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,211
What?

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,120
It's hot! Whoa!

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,158
Oh no.

6
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,694
What? What are you doing, Mai?

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,062
Well,

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,598
I thought I should make breakfast
once in a while.

9
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,800
That thought is more than enough.

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,803
I have a request.
Please don't come near this kitchen.

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,573
Seriously.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,077
I don't think you got
your mom's cooking genes.

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,980
You couldn't cook anything
when you first started too.

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,583
I really didn't like your messy omelet.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,818
Stop complaining. What did you expect?

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,987
I never cooked while your mom was alive.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,289
I never entered the kitchen.

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,458
Can you make Mom's croquettes?

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,261
-The ones with the soft potatoes.
-Oh, them.

20
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,029
-I love them.
-Yeah.

21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,800
By the way, you're 26 already
but you're still making requests.

22
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,302
That's why you can't get married.

23
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,205
You're that one that banned me
from the kitchen.

24
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,444
Look at the time.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,279
I'll make you breakfast.

26
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,481
-Thanks.
-Hurry up.

27
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,316
Okay.

28
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,352
Mackerel?

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,493
I really lack femininity.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,830
I should at least learn how to
make a simple breakfast.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,367
EGGS BENEDICT

32
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,103
This looks so good.

33
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,805
Hollan… day…

34
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,707
It's Hollandaise sauce.

35
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,845
Eggs Benedict is so good.

36
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,980
-Which restaurant is it?
-It's not a place.

37
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,149
I'm going to make it.

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,952
I'm rotting away

39
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,255
because I'm always eating out
with a middle-aged man like this.

40
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,757
You can cook, despite how you look?

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,228
I wish that was the case.

42
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,896
I thought so.

43
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,932
But your dad is such a good cook.

44
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,470
That ultimate turnip was incredible.

45
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,572
I'd like to try that.

46
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,744
General Manager Shindo.

47
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,581
May we sit here?

48
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,918
-Sure.
-Put that away.

49
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,589
General Manager Shindo,

50
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,326
you also use the employee cafeteria?

51
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:44,531
Of course, it's part of my job to
understand the feelings

52
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,833
of the employees.

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,568
That's wonderful, Mr. Shindo.

54
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,804
I hear you guys are a great pair.

55
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,974
I wouldn't say that we're a good pair--

56
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,043
-Ow…
-Don't say unnecessary things.

57
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,147
The Branch Managing Department was wise to

58
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,317
place a female in Branch Inspection.

59
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,253
There's a rise in female Branch Managers
these days,

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,357
so banks might be entering
the age of female dominance.

61
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,593
-Kodama.
-Yes.

62
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,629
I see, female dominance…

63
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,866
I will work even harder.

64
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,236
-Enjoy your meal.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,777
-You've got a great appetite.
-Uh… thank you.

66
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,422
I lost my appetite,

67
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,825
with Mr. Shindo sitting
right in front of us.

68
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,195
But he's probably not as scary
as the rumors make him out to be.

69
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,564
He's supportive of working women too.

70
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,702
His talk about female dominance
must mean he expects a lot from me.

71
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,338
-Whoa.
-You're so clueless.

72
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,006
About what?

73
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,308
What I mean is, one word from him

74
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,711
and he can ship us off anywhere.

75
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,180
I see. Please be careful, Mr. Soma.

76
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,649
-I said "us"!
-That's right, Soma.

77
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,385
-Please be careful.
-Mr. Shibasaki.

78
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,121
You forgot to stamp your name
on this report.

79
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,391
-I'm sorry.
-Please be careful.

80
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,560
-As for you, Hanasaki…
-What?

81
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,629
Your physical examination.

82
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,731
-You got a reminder.
-I'm sorry.

83
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:28,067
The age of female dominance is near,
but your time seems far off.

84
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,671
You two are such a great pair.

85
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,506
Did you come here to give us this?

86
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,475
Oh! I forgot the main reason.

87
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,477
Please go to the West Yokohama Branch.

88
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,745
What is it this time?

89
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,549
A young bank employee disappeared.

90
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:44,984
Disappeared?

91
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,091
PEKING KOUJI

92
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,961
A disappearance, huh…

93
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,497
I wonder what happened.

94
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,631
Oh, it's hot.

95
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,768
Mr. Soma.

96
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,004
The disappearance of a new employee
is a story we hear

97
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,906
once in a while at a bank.

98
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,775
-Really?
-Yeah.

99
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,011
And when they open up a drawer
inside their dormitory,

100
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:16,115
there are piles of unprocessed documents.
We hear stories like that.

101
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,317
Wow.

102
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,986
I'm sure it's just a new employee

103
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,323
who couldn't handle the pressure
and the workload.

104
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,893
We'll be done after asking
some simple questions.

105
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,495
Disappearance, huh.

106
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,565
A job at a bank is tough,
so it can be dangerous…

107
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,701
-Suppressing all that stress.
-Yeah.

108
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,170
I should be careful too.

109
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,906
You have nothing to worry about.

110
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,709
You don't suppress anything.

111
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,944
-What?
-Nothing.

112
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,512
Nothing at all.

113
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,550
WEST YOKOHAMA BRANCH

114
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,690
-Yes?
-They're here.

115
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,726
Excuse me.

116
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,262
I'm sorry for calling over
the Branch Inspection

117
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,498
for this kind of trouble.

118
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,303
The employee

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,940
that's gone missing is this person
named Hisashi Mitsuoka.

120
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,243
It's been a year since he was assigned
to the Finance Department.

121
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,046
He was a diligent worker,

122
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,515
and we didn't notice anything
different with him.

123
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,985
But he's been missing ever since
he left home yesterday morning.

124
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,654
You haven't been able to contact him?

125
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:33,693
There has been no contact from him
either to his house or to the bank.

126
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,228
But according to his mother,

127
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,598
some of his clothes were missing
from his house.

128
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,001
Then he probably wasn't
involved in an accident.

129
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,906
Give me a break.
Why would he disappear on us?

130
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,843
Do you have any idea why he disappeared?

131
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,312
-No.
-How many companies was he in charge of?

132
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,982
Not very many. About 20 or so.

133
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,718
-That's not a lot.
-I see.

134
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,721
But out of all the work within the branch,

135
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,390
loans are the most complicated
and difficult.

136
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,627
Well, there are no easy jobs.

137
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,363
That's how all of us were trained.

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,099
-Right, Mr. Soma?
-Ah… yes.

139
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,069
We are all in agreement that

140
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:21,774
he lacked the qualities
necessary for a banker.

141
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,515
In addition to that,
he was dealing with another problem.

142
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,416
Another?

143
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,387
It's embarrassing to say this,

144
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,191
but Mitsuoka's mother was the problem.

145
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,660
What kind of a problem?

146
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,096
It's what people usually call
Monster Parents.

147
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,035
-Monster parent?
-Even when he's a working adult?

148
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,837
His mother calls in for him

149
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,738
when he has a cold.

150
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,342
He should be the one contacting us, right?

151
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,277
That mother can't let go of him.

152
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,048
Can't anyone take a firm stand against

153
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,116
such an overprotective mom?

154
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,985
Ow…

155
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,857
We would have if we could.

156
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,862
The Mitsuoka family is very wealthy,
and when he started working here,

157
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,398
his mother transferred all
of their accounts and investment trusts

158
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,968
to our bank from Hakusui Bank.

159
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,037
But if you keep on worrying about
their funds,

160
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,839
you will never have a say.

161
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,875
-How much do they--
-500 million yen.

162
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,143
500 million?

163
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,747
That is a valued client for sure.

164
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,617
That's the reason why we can't talk back.

165
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,485
-Not to that mother.
-Where's the Branch Manager?

166
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,556
It's the monster.

167
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,424
Monster?

168
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,597
What will you do?

169
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,667
It's your fault that my son is missing.

170
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,637
Why isn't anyone looking for him?

171
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,405
Hurry up and find my son!

172
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,141
You cannot say that this is our fault…

173
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,577
Why would my Hisashi disappear?

174
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,679
Something must have happened for

175
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,049
a diligent and responsible person
like him to run away!

176
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,285
She's furious.

177
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,186
She seems very strong.

178
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,789
But even so,

179
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,860
Mitsuoka isn't the only one who's
handling difficult work,

180
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,297
and we aren't expecting
unreasonable things from him.

181
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,765
That's not acceptable.

182
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,134
I know that he was treated badly.

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,635
Absolutely not…

184
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,737
That is not the case.

185
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,042
Let's calm down at once, Mother.

186
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,778
Mother? Don't you dare call me mother!

187
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,846
-I'm not your mother!
-True.

188
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,981
-Hey.
-Oh…

189
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,151
Who are those two?

190
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:49,155
We came from headquarters
regarding this case.

191
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,057
Headquarters. Great timing.

192
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,726
What are your thoughts on this?

193
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,494
My son has disappeared,

194
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,030
but people at this branch haven't
done anything!

195
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,133
-Um… well…
-You stay quiet.

196
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,572
Was Hisashi saying anything
before he disappeared?

197
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,575
For example, was he having
a hard time at work?

198
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,079
He was very patient,
so he never voiced it,

199
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,215
but it was painful to see him
look so exhausted every day.

200
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,019
What do you call that thing for loans…

201
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,520
-Proposal document?
-Yes.

202
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,789
That was sent back to him again and again,

203
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,492
so he seemed to be having
a very difficult time.

204
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,860
I see.

205
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,031
I know for a fact that he was
being harassed.

206
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,201
He was not being harassed.

207
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,904
His proposal document was returned
because his theory wasn't structured,

208
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,675
and it didn't meet
the level of requirement.

209
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,077
Then tell me,

210
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,580
what is the level of requirement?

211
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:53,419
Mrs. Mitsuoka, I understand
that you're very worried.

212
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,554
I also have a son.

213
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,860
But I don't think a mother
should interfere

214
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,063
with her grown son's workplace.

215
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,936
Are you trying to blame
my son's disappearance on me?

216
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,505
No, that is not what I meant.

217
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,373
It's all the bank's fault!

218
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,377
There hasn't been a single apology
at this stage in the game.

219
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,645
It's unforgivable!

220
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,683
Say something!

221
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,318
-With all due respect…
-Hanasaki.

222
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,991
But I think that's wrong.

223
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,093
What's wrong?

224
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,130
The person causing trouble
to the customers and the workplace

225
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,999
is actually your son.

226
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,868
No matter what his reasons,
leaving behind his

227
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:47,006
responsibilities and disappearing,
is unacceptable not just as a banker

228
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,809
but as a grown, working adult.

229
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,844
What are you saying?

230
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,681
The problem is

231
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,217
the bank's response to this.

232
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,952
You don't understand it at all.

233
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,688
No, you're the one who doesn't understand.

234
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,523
-What?
-This is not kindergarten.

235
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,425
It's absurd for a parent to

236
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,194
barge into a child's workplace.

237
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,930
-Hanasaki.
-Oh…

238
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,369
Oops, I've done it…

239
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,106
Absurd?

240
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,209
If that's the attitude you're taking,
I've made up my mind.

241
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,148
I will remove all of our accounts.

242
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,483
-Um…
-Huh?

243
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,119
Mrs. Mitsuoka, please wait a moment.

244
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,221
-Mrs. Mitsuoka, please wait.
-Open it.

245
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,655
-Calm down--
-Open it!

246
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,660
-What have you done?
-I'm very sorry.

247
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,995
You got her so mad.

248
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:48,134
What will you do if Mitsuoka's mother
really removes all of her funds.

249
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,869
What did you come here for?

250
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,650
You're hopeless.

251
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,885
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,955
But she's horrible to think that
having 500 million in funds

253
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,757
would let her get her way.

254
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,394
No amount of common sense will
get through to that mother

255
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,296
who's lacking in common sense.

256
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,634
I don't think there's foul play involved,
so we'll just

257
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,736
write a report and finish this.

258
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,674
I wonder what will happen to Mr. Mitsuoka?

259
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,813
He abandoned his job and disappeared
without any notice.

260
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,682
Even if he returns,
it'll be too awkward to stay

261
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,684
so he'll probably end up quitting.

262
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,154
-Right.
-Um…

263
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,059
You're investigating Mr. Mitsuoka, right?

264
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,027
Yes.

265
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,399
I'm sorry to interrupt.
My name is Okazaki, and I'm a teller.

266
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,301
Did you have something to tell us?

267
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,773
I'm sure the Branch Manager had lots

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,042
of negative things
to say about Mr. Mitsuoka.

269
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,645
-Well…
-Mr. Mitsuoka…

270
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,647
He is not an irresponsible person.

271
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,321
He was trying very hard to get
a loan approved

272
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,256
for his customer.

273
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,259
-Redo it.
-Yes.

274
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,127
Redo it.

275
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,264
His proposal document
was turned back so many times.

276
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,667
Goodbye.

277
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,703
But he would redo it each time.

278
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,909
He was working very hard.

279
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,914
It's very different from what
the Branch Manager was saying.

280
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,687
As for his mother, Mr. Mitsuoka was
having the hardest time with her.

281
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,290
-Really?
-Yes.

282
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,859
I'm always telling my mom

283
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,729
to stop interfering with my work.

284
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,597
But she won't listen…

285
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,503
But I understand her too.

286
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,673
She gave her all to raise me,

287
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,175
and I became her purpose in life.

288
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,981
But because of his mother,

289
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,752
his boss and colleagues gave him
the cold shoulder.

290
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,555
I see.

291
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,228
Um… Will Mr. Mitsuoka get fired?

292
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,898
Hm… we don't know.

293
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,635
Please help Mr. Mitsuoka.

294
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,370
Ms. Okazaki…

295
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,607
Sorry for taking your time.

296
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,418
Mr. Mitsuoka's image
is starting to change.

297
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,989
Yeah, I thought he was just
a mama's boy until now.

298
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,024
Let's investigate

299
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,627
how he was working.

300
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,995
Yes.

301
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,830
Here.

302
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,234
These are the loan related files that
Mitsuoka was in charge of.

303
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,202
I see.

304
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,706
What do you plan to do with all of this?

305
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,376
We need this to write our reports.

306
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,313
I'm sorry, but our boss is very picky.

307
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,049
I guess that can't be helped.

308
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,618
Thank you for your cooperation.

309
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,022
But please make it quick.

310
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,658
I don't want the Branch Manager
to find out.

311
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,927
-Yes.
-Thank you.

312
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:37,930
All right.

313
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,634
We can find out how he worked
by looking at

314
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,269
the proposal documents.

315
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,840
Is that how it is?

316
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:05,758
It's not easy to provide loans
to a company, huh?

317
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,028
Yeah. The way a proposal document
is created

318
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,997
affects whether it gets approved or not.

319
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,467
That's where a banker
can showcase his abilities.

320
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,602
I see.

321
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,340
And how were
Mr. Mitsuoka's proposal documents?

322
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,742
Well…

323
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,311
Are they problematic?

324
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,215
-They're not bad.
-What?

325
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,852
Not only are they not bad,
his proposal documents are pretty good.

326
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,389
Judging by what I've read,

327
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,892
I think Mitsuoka was a decent guy.

328
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,927
-Really?
-Yeah.

329
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,999
This is what he was working on
right before he disappeared.

330
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,568
-Omi Kikai Kougyou?
-Yeah.

331
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,636
It's engine parts.

332
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,572
One hundred million yen working capital.

333
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,142
All the other ones have been approved,

334
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,978
but this is the only one
she didn't approve.

335
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:00,879
DENIED

336
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,081
You're right.

337
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,751
Mitsuoka rewrote it many times.

338
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,721
I've never met him,

339
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,690
so he may be the hopeless,

340
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,193
pampered kid that everyone says he is.

341
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,262
But I can tell that he was
earnestly trying to

342
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,564
help out this company.

343
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah.

344
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,970
In the end, the loan did not get approved.

345
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,940
The Branch Manager makes
the final decision,

346
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,776
but I wonder if he disappeared because

347
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,445
he felt a sense of responsibility.

348
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,215
I see.

349
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,283
Branch Manager.

350
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,619
What are you doing?

351
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,556
You guys didn't leave yet?

352
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,760
We were looking through Mr. Mitsuoka's
proposal documents.

353
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,332
Your job here should be done by now.

354
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,366
Please leave.

355
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,236
I have one question.

356
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,573
Why didn't you

357
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,476
approve this loan?

358
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,014
Why do I have to answer that?

359
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,717
Does Branch Inspection have the right to

360
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,319
question our credit analysis?

361
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,656
No, I was just curious
because looking at the proposal,

362
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,292
it seemed to qualify for an approval.

363
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,667
True, their sales are in the black,

364
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,503
but this company has a history

365
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,306
of ending up in deficit
when surplus was expected.

366
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,074
Three years ago, right?

367
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,912
But they've recovered
their performance recently,

368
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,347
so they seem to be trustworthy.

369
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,251
I will decide whether they can be trusted
or not.

370
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,122
If by any chance, the loan
for this company becomes unrecoverable,

371
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,691
I have to take responsibility
as a Branch Manager.

372
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,128
You have no right to tell me what to do.

373
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,666
I apologize.

374
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,304
May I ask one more question?

375
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,039
What is it?

376
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,541
What did Mr. Mitsuoka say regarding

377
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,177
your reason for denial?

378
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,712
His opinion?

379
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,250
How would I know?

380
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,688
Does he even have his own opinion
to begin with?

381
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,289
But that's…

382
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:28,460
These issues will be
handled by our branch.

383
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,862
Please take your leave.

384
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,969
Please contact the HR department
right away so that

385
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,503
we can get his replacement.

386
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,047
But Mr. Mitsuoka

387
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,984
is still an employee.

388
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,924
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

389
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,261
Disappearance is a serious matter.

390
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,528
But I'm starting to

391
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,632
understand why Mr. Mitsuoka would
want to disappear.

392
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,435
His boss is not understanding,
and his mom is a ridiculous monster.

393
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,905
When you think about it,
he's an unfortunate guy.

394
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,341
Well first of all,

395
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:20,045
it's wrong that his mother is using
her funds as a tactic to get her way.

396
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,748
Doesn't she realize that she's the one
driving her son

397
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,116
into a corner?

398
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,251
But parents

399
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,288
can't help but want to walk ahead
of their child

400
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,056
and pick up rocks on the road

401
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,392
so that they won't trip and fall.

402
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,361
They know that their child

403
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,698
has to fall and experience pain
in order to grow,

404
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,134
but they can't help but feel helpless.

405
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,371
It's hard to explain a parents' love
for their children.

406
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,374
That's why I think every parent has

407
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,276
potential to become a monster parent.

408
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,378
Good evening.

409
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,248
Good evening. Is it raining?

410
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,683
Yes, it's starting to rain.

411
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,159
No.

412
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,627
Why?

413
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,497
I rewrote it just as you instructed.

414
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,865
Oh jeez,

415
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,502
I thought you'd turn in something
more acceptable,

416
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,907
but my fault for expecting
something from you.

417
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,349
We waited all this time
only to get denied?

418
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,750
I'm

419
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,486
very sorry.

420
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,123
I'm very sorry.

421
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,327
I'm very sorry, everyone.

422
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,629
I'm very sorry!

423
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,978
-Mr. Soma.
-Yeah?

424
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,715
Do you want to look for
Mr. Mitsuoka tomorrow?

425
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:04,683
What?

426
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,752
I just can't let this go.

427
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,155
But how do you plan to look for him?

428
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,292
Yeah… that's a good question.

429
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,695
We have no idea where he could be.

430
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,967
By the way, what happened to
Omi Kikai Kougyo afterwards.

431
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,603
-When the loan was denied?
-Oh, I looked into it.

432
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,172
They were somehow able to
come up with the funds.

433
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,040
I see.

434
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,077
Why don't we go there tomorrow?

435
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,413
We might find out something
from the President.

436
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,849
Okay, let's do that.

437
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,218
Wow, you're so agreeable today.

438
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,121
What happened? Usually, you would say,

439
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,457
"That's none of our business."

440
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm wondering if there's a reason
why Branch Manager

441
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,329
didn't approve that loan.

442
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,265
What do you mean by that?

443
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,002
For example, a personal grudge?

444
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,671
-Personal grudge?
-It's an example.

445
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,142
Is it the instinct of
a former Finance Department worker?

446
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,647
Mr. Soma is getting fired up
for the first time ever.

447
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,282
Are you making fun of me?

448
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,184
Not at all.

449
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,353
It's going to be busy tomorrow.

450
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,128
OMI KIKAI KOUGYO

451
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,203
What does Tokyo Daiichi Bank
want with us now this late in the game?

452
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,172
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Omi.

453
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,542
We were about to go bankrupt
because your bank

454
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,811
denied our loan!

455
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,614
I ran around to gather funds,

456
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,218
begging local credit unions
and friends' companies

457
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,820
and somehow got it together.

458
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,457
We are very sorry about that.

459
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,428
Um… we haven't been able to get in contact

460
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,931
with Mr. Mitsuoka who was
in charge of your loan application.

461
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,167
I heard.

462
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,869
I'm worried.

463
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,606
Since he was a clumsy, yet sincere kid.

464
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,444
Of course, I can't forgive your bank.

465
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,547
But he didn't do anything wrong.

466
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,652
Would you have any idea where he might be?

467
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,587
No.

468
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,856
I see.

469
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,692
How was his attitude towards work?

470
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,195
He was very passionate.

471
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,396
Good morning.

472
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,298
He would come by often,

473
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,601
to learn more about our company.

474
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,105
He's young,

475
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,507
but I've never had a banker who worked

476
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,942
as hard as he did.

477
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,977
I see.

478
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,980
But I'm very angry with
your Branch Manager.

479
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,784
She dragged the process out until the day

480
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,753
we needed the loan, only to deny us!

481
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,589
Are you serious?

482
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,790
Yeah.

483
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:03,061
It's an overall decision based on
your company's past performance.

484
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,763
If we can't get a loan from you,

485
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,265
our company will go bankrupt!

486
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,502
I'm begging you.

487
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,472
Unfortunately,
I won't be able to help you.

488
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,174
Branch Manager!

489
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:21,313
We were treated horribly.

490
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,149
Did you have any trouble with

491
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,952
Branch Manager Nakamura in the past?

492
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,789
No. I've only exchanged
greetings with her.

493
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,992
President.

494
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,795
You have a call from Central Machinery.

495
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,197
Tell them I'm not here.

496
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,967
It's an official lawsuit now.

497
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,936
We need to settle this in court.

498
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,674
Did something happen?

499
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,876
Oh…

500
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,281
There's a company we're having
problems with.

501
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,218
So I took legal action.
I really wish I didn't have to

502
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,953
deal with a lawsuit

503
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,856
at a busy time like this.

504
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,659
We will take our leave now.

505
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,097
We couldn't find anything about
Mr. Mitsuoka's whereabouts

506
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,898
or the connection with the Branch Manager.

507
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,837
But there's definitely something up with
Branch Manager Nakamura.

508
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,372
Why do you think so?

509
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,474
Banks teach that

510
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,211
"A loan denial should be
determined quickly."

511
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,248
That way, the company can go search
somewhere else for a loan.

512
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,685
-Okay.
-But not Branch Manager Nakamura.

513
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,856
She delayed the final decision
until the day the loan was needed,

514
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,824
and then she denied it.

515
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,861
It's definitely strange.

516
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,963
That means…

517
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,199
It's possible that

518
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:52,871
she was purposely trying to
cause this company to go bankrupt.

519
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,511
If that's true,

520
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,949
that's unacceptable.

521
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,853
Let's go back to headquarters
and investigate Nakamura.

522
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,989
Yes.

523
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,665
Hello, this is Hanasaki.

524
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,468
This is Okazaki
from the West Yokohama Branch.

525
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,805
What's the matter, Ms. Okazaki?

526
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,541
I just checked Mr. Mitsuoka's
bank account.

527
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,042
Then…

528
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,010
HISASHI MITSUOKA

529
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:37,015
<i>He withdrew money from the ATM</i>
<i>at Honmoku Yamashita-cho.</i>

530
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,983
When was that?

531
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,585
10:40 a.m. today.

532
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,658
He couldn't have gone far.
Thank you, Ms. Okazaki.

533
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,762
Mr. Soma, I'm going to go look for
Mr. Mitsuoka.

534
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,063
Okay.

535
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,004
PRESIDENT JIN OMI

536
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,310
I guess I won't find any clues here.

537
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,147
Oh, Kodama.

538
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,883
I was looking for Mr. Shibasaki.

539
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,852
I guess he's not here… bye.

540
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,920
Oh! Hold on a minute.

541
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,956
Hey, Kodama you used to

542
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,593
work with Branch Manager Nakamura
from the West Yokohama Branch, right?

543
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,928
-Yeah.
-What kind of person is she?

544
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,964
Hm… well,

545
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,367
she's exactly how she seems.
A capable female banker.

546
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,172
-Anything else?
-Something else…

547
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,674
-I don't know.
-Come on.

548
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,877
Help your colleague for old time's sake.

549
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,412
Something about her friends,
hobbies, or family.

550
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,084
-Oh…
-Ah! You just remembered something.

551
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,320
-But it's not that important…
-That's okay.

552
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,191
She was in the company newsletter
last year with her family.

553
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,393
Oh.

554
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,394
Right here.

555
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,164
MY FAMILY

556
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,334
-Her son owns a company?
-Yeah.

557
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,937
It's the Branch Manager's proud son.

558
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,005
What industry?

559
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,275
It's a company that handles engine parts.

560
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,043
It's apparently doing well.

561
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,846
Engine parts? What's the company called?

562
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,282
I don't know that.

563
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,350
You don't know?

564
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,052
Is that my fault?

565
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,290
YUJI NAKAMURA

566
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,295
Central Machinery?

567
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,399
You have a call from Central Machinery.

568
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,500
What should I do?

569
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,103
Thank you, Kodama.

570
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,805
You were a big help.

571
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,441
I'll be heading back to Omi Kikai Kougyo.

572
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,809
Hey, Soma.

573
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,312
What's Omi Kikai Kougyo?

574
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,583
This man

575
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,420
withdrew money at the ATM here.
Do you remember him?

576
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,389
-I don't remember.
-I see.

577
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:02,160
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

578
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,094
No.

579
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,198
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

580
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,099
No.

581
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,104
No way!

582
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,875
Mr. Mitsuoka, please wait.

583
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,376
Mr. Mitsuoka!

584
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,512
Mr. Mitsuoka.

585
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,582
-Yes.
-Oh, wrong person.

586
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,723
I did it!

587
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,227
This is the best way to

588
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,230
relieve frustration.

589
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,731
Right, Mr. Mitsuoka?

590
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,604
I'm Hanasaki from Branch Inspection.

591
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,343
I'm glad you're okay.

592
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,445
Let's go back.

593
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,815
Everyone at the bank is worried about you.

594
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,117
That's a lie.

595
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,722
But Ms. Okazaki…

596
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,291
Ms. Okazaki is

597
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,361
very worried for you, Mr. Matsuoka.

598
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,697
Oh, and…

599
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,499
your mom too.

600
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,575
My mom didn't used to be like that.

601
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,145
But after she divorced my dad
ten years ago,

602
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,381
I became her sole purpose in life.

603
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:10,888
Then let's go apologize to the
Branch Manager for your mom's sake too.

604
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,925
-I'll go with you.
-I've already caused a lot of trouble.

605
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,327
For the bank with my mother, and,

606
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,363
I was a no-call, no-show for a few days.

607
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,264
Plus…

608
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,236
I wasn't able to get an important loan
approved because of my inadequacy.

609
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,072
I just wasn't meant to be a banker.

610
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,575
That's not true.

611
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:34,812
My boss was praising your proposal
document saying that it was well-written.

612
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,682
Oh, and President Omi.

613
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,619
He said that no one had ever
worked that hard for them before.

614
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,958
There are people who appreciate
your hard work, Mr. Mitsuoka.

615
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,764
Plus, I don't think you're
solely responsible

616
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,200
for the loan denial this time.

617
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,437
Branch Manager Nakamura

618
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,839
is clearly hiding something.

619
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,374
What?

620
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,211
I don't exactly know what that is yet.

621
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,380
But if you continue running away,

622
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,616
all the blame will be pinned on you.

623
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,351
Isn't that frustrating?

624
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,454
It's okay.

625
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,589
I don't belong in the bank.

626
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,426
I never did, to begin with.

627
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,429
I'm going to quit the bank.

628
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,698
Is that what you really want?
Don't you want to--

629
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,802
Please leave me alone! I'm already

630
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,571
finished anyway.

631
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,340
You're not finished yet.

632
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,511
Nothing ever changes because you're always

633
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,746
running away like that.

634
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,116
The same with your mother.

635
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,352
It's partly your fault that

636
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,488
your mom turned out that way.

637
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,692
Shouldn't you stop

638
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,661
running away and face your problems?

639
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,836
I'm sorry.

640
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:11,476
My mom died when I was ten.

641
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,846
That's why I know that…

642
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,583
No matter how much they love their child,

643
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,652
a parent will be leaving you first.

644
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,022
But a child

645
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,893
must continue to live on their own.

646
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,010
Ms. Hanasaki.

647
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,882
I won't run away anymore.

648
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,451
Not from my mom,

649
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,520
or the bank.

650
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,664
MR. SOMA

651
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,766
This is Hanasaki.

652
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:12,937
What?

653
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:39,597
Mr. Mitsuoka.

654
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,811
-Hisashi.
-Mother.

655
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,715
Branch Manager, Mitsuoka is…

656
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,192
I'm very sorry.

657
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,962
What have you been doing?

658
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,899
You even brought your mom with you.

659
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,401
Is it wrong for me to be here?

660
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,404
My son didn't ask me to come with him.

661
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,840
I came here of my own will.

662
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,575
This is an issue for the bank.

663
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,877
Can you please refrain from interfering?

664
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,280
Branch Manager, I'm not satisfied

665
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,316
with the way you handled this situation
in the first place.

666
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,120
Hisashi, you don't have to apologize.

667
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:40,358
Everything is their fault. So I'll--

668
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,393
That's enough, Mother.

669
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,863
Hisashi?

670
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,666
Please stop talking.

671
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,003
I'm in the wrong.

672
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,740
So please leave.

673
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:20,131
I've caused everyone a lot of trouble
because of my irresponsible actions.

674
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,565
I'm very sorry.

675
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,468
But

676
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,405
I want to continue this job.

677
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,542
Whoa. That's asking for too much.

678
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,546
You abandoned your work.
You're disqualified as a banker.

679
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,415
I agree with that.

680
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,785
For the last three days,

681
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,988
I've been wondering what I'm doing.

682
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,925
But still,

683
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,495
I want to help society
by working with loans.

684
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,898
I want to help out small companies.

685
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,733
Is that your conclusion?

686
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,235
You're naïve.

687
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,740
Do you think you can come back
after all this?

688
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,478
Honestly, I don't want to see your
face anymore.

689
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,816
And of course, your mother's face too.

690
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,855
I'm very sorry about my mother.

691
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,559
I will make sure that this
will never happen again.

692
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,627
Again?

693
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,565
It's really "like mother like son,"

694
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,300
isn't it?

695
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,936
You don't have a place here anymore.

696
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,638
Hurry up
and write your resignation letter.

697
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,606
What?

698
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,377
How else will you take responsibility?

699
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:48,619
Hold on a second.

700
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,758
Mr. Mitsuoka is admitting his mistake
and apologizing for it.

701
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,961
He still wants to come back and work here.

702
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,362
He shouldn't have to quit.

703
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,465
This is our branch's problem.

704
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,435
-You have no right to interfere.
-But--

705
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,438
He abandoned work and disappeared.

706
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,508
All I can say is that
Mr. Mitsuoka is clearly not suited

707
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,409
to be a banker.

708
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,081
With all due respect…

709
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,052
you are partly responsible for that,
Branch Manager Nakamura.

710
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,090
I'm responsible?

711
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,459
That's ridiculous.

712
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,594
Then why did you prolong the loan process

713
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,229
for Omi Kikai Kougyo,

714
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,364
only to deny it?

715
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,170
A loan denial should be
determined quickly.

716
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,740
That's the iron-clad rule for loans,

717
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,741
am I right?

718
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,581
That has nothing to do with this.
First of all, they were

719
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,417
trying to get a loan
by using inaccurate sales estimates.

720
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,621
They're not a company
we should be doing business with.

721
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,923
Is that really true?

722
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,697
Wasn't there another reason
why you didn't approve that loan?

723
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,902
What are you saying?

724
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,505
What do you mean by "another reason"?

725
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,245
May I interrupt?

726
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,685
What is it all of a sudden?

727
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,752
Excuse me.

728
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,288
Branch Manager Nakamura.

729
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:36,060
Do you know of a company called
Central Machinery?

730
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,699
It's the rival company
of Omi Kikai Kougyo,

731
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,668
who Mr. Mitsuoka was trying
to secure a loan for.

732
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,670
You know, right?

733
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,541
So what if I do?

734
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,112
Central Machinery was established in 2008.

735
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,682
A location in Tokyo and Shinagawa.
Capital stock is 30 million yen.

736
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,484
Representative

737
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,487
is Mr. Yuji Nakamura.

738
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,388
PRESIDENT YUJI NAKAMURA

739
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,326
Branch Manager Nakamura,

740
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,896
it's your son, right?

741
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,169
That has nothing to do with this.

742
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,704
I'm here because it does.

743
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:26,010
His company is being sued
by Omi Kikai Kougyo

744
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,745
for violating

745
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,713
the cylinder head patent, right?

746
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,885
Due to this lawsuit, the operation at your

747
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,687
son's company is at a standstill.

748
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,090
Because of your resentment,

749
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,627
you not only prolonged the loan process
for Omi Kikai Kougyo,

750
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,095
but you denied them.

751
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,264
To bankrupt them.

752
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,307
That's a false accusation.

753
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,976
You don't have proof, right?

754
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,845
I made an objective decision

755
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,148
and denied the loan. That's all.

756
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,883
It's true that there is no proof.

757
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,386
We'll have no way of knowing what was

758
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,188
going through your mind.

759
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:16,760
But you nitpicked on a loan proposal
that should have

760
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,496
been approved. That much is a fact.

761
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,166
No matter how you deny it,

762
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,635
this will really question your

763
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,805
qualifications as a Branch Manager.

764
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,691
Branch Manager, Nakamura.

765
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:52,296
setting a company up for bankruptcy
over a personal grudge

766
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,764
is wrong.

767
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,768
Do you really think that doing that

768
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,004
will benefit your son?

769
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,108
You said that

770
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,310
Mr. Mitsuoka's mother was a monster,

771
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,179
but I will throw those words

772
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,382
right back at you.

773
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,419
You are

774
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,820
the true monster.

775
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,026
Who are you to tell me that?

776
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,462
You don't have a child,
so you won't understand.

777
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,999
What do you know about being a mother?

778
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,071
You're right,

779
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,673
I don't know…

780
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,076
how you can love someone enough

781
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,844
to become a monster.

782
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,348
But

783
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,850
I know this much for sure.

784
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,954
Loving your child doesn't
give you the right

785
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,491
to do whatever you want.

786
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,034
What's wrong with that?

787
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,539
I just wanted to…

788
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,607
help my son…

789
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,246
For my son…

790
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,314
Hisashi.

791
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,088
Mother,

792
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,557
I'm sorry about earlier.

793
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,928
I'm going to work hard.

794
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,432
I'm going to do all that I can

795
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,502
so that I can continue working
at the bank.

796
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,373
I'll work hard so that you can
feel at ease.

797
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,644
So can you believe in me,

798
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,646
and see how I do?

799
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,729
Thank you very much.

800
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,366
Good luck.

801
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,471
Let's go.

802
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,420
I'll try it.

803
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,354
Yeah.

804
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,524
How is it?

805
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,458
Hm…

806
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:10,861
Well…

807
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,996
It's so-so.

808
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,372
-It's no good.
-Of course. You just started.

809
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,975
It takes more than a day or two
to master it.

810
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,277
Mom's omelet was so good.

811
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,713
-It was sweet and fluffy.
-Yeah.

812
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,217
-I still remember it.
-Yeah.

813
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,822
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

814
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,891
A mother's love

815
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,527
is really deep, isn't it?

816
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,764
So much that it makes you blind.

817
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,103
I want to become a mom like my mom.

818
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,606
What? You don't even have a husband yet.

819
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,774
-Oh, right.
-Hm?

820
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:01,011
I think someone like Mr. Soma
would be great.

821
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,615
What?

822
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:08,552
Mr. Soma is a great catch.
He's single, right?

823
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,822
Plus, if he becomes your husband
we can drink every night.

824
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,725
You're already
drinking with him all the time.

825
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,262
Aren't dad's supposed to stop
their daughters from getting married?

826
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,997
I can't wait.

827
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,900
Brush up on your cooking skills
in the meantime.

828
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,469
It's not going to happen, okay?

829
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,604
-Let's have some salted squid.
-Yeah.

830
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,872
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

831
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,375
Branch Manager Nakamura

832
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,144
ended up getting a strong warning.

833
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,613
But she will most likely be demoted

834
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,548
during the next rotation.

835
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,752
She mixed official business with

836
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,921
personal affairs when making decisions.

837
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,425
It seems like the responsibility
of being a Branch Manager,

838
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,062
was too heavy of a load for
a female like Ms. Nakamura.

839
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,633
Yes, you're absolutely right Mr. Shindo.

840
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,636
But I wonder how those people

841
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,372
at Branch Inspection found out about

842
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,608
her son's company.

843
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,343
Oh, I wonder…

844
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,745
I… I wonder how.

845
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,054
-Kodama.
-Yes.

846
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,058
You're sweating.

847
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,095
Is it that hot in here?

848
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,064
N… no.

849
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,534
It's just the right temperature.

850
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,575
I ended up drinking too much
because of what Dad said.

851
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,310
-Hey.
-Oh… hey!

852
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,012
Morning.

853
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,480
Here you go.

854
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,416
Mai!

855
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,755
Nope!

856
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,390
Never!

857
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,859
I'm imagining weird things thanks to Dad.

858
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,930
What are you saying?
Your business card came in.

859
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,933
Oh… thank you. And good morning.

860
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,469
You're being so weird
this early in the morning.

861
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,938
Oh by the way,

862
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,675
Mr. Mitsuoka is back at work,
and doing very well.

863
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,379
That's great to hear. By the way…

864
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,546
It's love, right?

865
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,816
L… love…

866
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,651
Ms. Okazaki.

867
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,422
She has feelings for Mitsuoka, huh?

868
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,559
This is why I don't like old men because

869
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,194
they love gossiping.

870
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,263
Who are you calling an old man?

871
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,967
Oh, good morning.

872
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,036
But a chance meeting

873
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,072
might be hiding somewhere closer
than you think.

874
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,307
What? You were listening?

875
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,743
Yeah, of course.

876
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,579
Spring is the season of love…

877
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,983
Mr. Shibasaki and his wife started
as an office romance.

878
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,718
This is going to be a long one.

879
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,853
-I see.
-As for me and my wife…

880
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,288
Oh… I forgot!

881
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,925
I have to go pick up some file folders.

882
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:02,993
Wait, I'm still--

883
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,929
-I'll be off.
-Wait, Hanasaki.

884
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,998
A special audit?

885
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,266
We're here for inspection.

886
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,168
Aota went to the Nakano Branch?

887
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,037
Don't overlook anything. Be thorough.

888
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,138
An informer?

889
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,573
No way.

890
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,675
This is interesting.

891
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,944
It's wrong as a human being.

892
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,080
