00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,939
BRANCH INSPECTION

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,009
I'm so bored.

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,912
-Hey!
-Ah, you scared me!

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,715
You look like there's no life left in you.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,818
You're at work right now,
so pull yourself together.

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,589
-Get it together!
-I know I'm at work.

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,759
But I'm tired of organizing data.

8
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,328
Remember what I told you before?

9
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,064
If Branch Inspection is bored,
it means there are

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,165
no problems at the branches. Right?

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,666
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,369
I get that, but…

13
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,805
When I worked as a teller,

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,741
it was busy every day,

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,210
but I was able to make lots
of customers happy

16
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,646
and it was so fulfilling…

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,449
I miss those days.

18
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,484
You've only been here a month.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,919
Stop getting nostalgic.

20
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:01,327
I'm so tired. Let me rest a bit.

21
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,264
What happened? You worked up a sweat.

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,867
The Financial Services Agency
will be inspecting our banks next week.

23
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,202
Inspection?

24
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,471
The inspector visits banks,

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,773
to check and provide guidance on loans.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,709
You didn't know this?
How can you call yourself a banker?

27
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,045
Of course, I know about that.

28
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,548
It's an inspection to assess the borrowers

29
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,917
and the details of the loan agreement.

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,653
-Right?
-That's right.

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,223
But I've never experienced
financial inspection before.

32
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,926
Well, out of the 750 branches nationwide,

33
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,729
only ten or so branches are inspected.

34
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,833
I guess it's like winning a lottery.

35
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,168
But you never know when they will come,

36
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,405
so even the smallest of the branches
have to be prepared.

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,807
What do you prepare?

38
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,211
Check to make sure pages aren't missing
from the loan files,

39
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,413
and organizing data.

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,649
-Also creating additional data.
-That's a lot of work.

41
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,885
All right, I'll be heading back.

42
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,490
Oh, Mr. Shibasaki. I'll be stopping by
the Nakano Branch before work next Monday.

43
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,926
Nakano Branch is where the two of you
used to work, right?

44
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,028
Yeah.

45
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,965
-You still have some unfinished business?
-Somewhat.

46
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,501
Then I want to go to
the Nakano Branch too.

47
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,103
That's not necessary. I'll go by myself.

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,339
I want to see everyone too.

49
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,976
-It's not a reunion.
-Soma, what are you going there for?

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,680
-It's my seal…
-Seal?

51
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,582
I forgot to stamp it on something.

52
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,585
A stamp oversight?

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,489
No way, Mr. Soma.

54
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,225
The Section Chief of the Sales Division?

55
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,028
-Making such a rookie mistake?
-You little…

56
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,597
I'm sure you'll be feeling
a little ashamed,

57
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,332
so I'll go along with you.

58
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,834
That's not necessary.

59
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,303
Yeah, Ms. Hanasaki should go too.

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,772
-What?
-Thank you very much!

61
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,576
We never know what she'll do
if we leave her alone.

62
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,313
Yes! I finally get to visit
the Nakano Branch again.

63
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,282
I'm so excited.

64
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,554
I'm sure everyone will be so surprised,

65
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,557
to see how refined I've become
after moving to headquarters.

66
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,661
-Refined? Who? Where?
-Everywhere!

67
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,829
What? Mr. Soma! And Ms. Hanasaki!

68
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,032
-Hey.
-Mr. Nagase!

69
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,867
-Long time no see.
-Hello.

70
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,703
-How have you been?
-Pretty good.

71
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,372
Are you inspecting our branch today?

72
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,343
No, it's not for an inspection…
Stop looking at me like that.

73
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,278
We're here to run an errand.

74
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,682
Ms. Hanasaki, you got prettier.

75
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:41,321
Oh! I guess you can say that.

76
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,389
See? I told you so.

77
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,558
You ever heard of social etiquette?

78
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,729
Everyone at the branch was saying
that Mr. Soma and Ms. Hanasaki

79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,798
is a very unexpected pair,

80
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,167
but you two seem like great partners.

81
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,468
-As if.
-As if.

82
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,570
See?

83
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,708
-Stop copying me.
-I wasn't.

84
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,744
How nostalgic.

85
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,981
Like I said,
it's only been a month and a half.

86
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,219
What's going on?

87
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,123
Don't tell me…

88
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,697
Excuse me… what's going on?

89
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,735
I'm Aota, the Chief Inspector
of Financial Services.

90
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,870
I'm here to inspect.

91
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,939
Our branch?

92
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,208
Please open the door.

93
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,510
Yes.

94
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,614
Mr. Soma, is this…

95
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,451
It seems like we came here at a bad time.

96
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,326
Financial inspection.

97
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,433
We will check everyone's bags.

98
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,035
Please line up.

99
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,570
Open your bag.

100
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,040
Excuse me.

101
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:07,974
Whoa.

102
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,945
They even check the contents of your bag
during the financial inspection?

103
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,214
It reminds me of the bag check at school.

104
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,751
But it's nothing that simple.

105
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,924
-You can't take business cards home.
-I'm sorry.

106
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,360
Why can't you take those out
of the branch?

107
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,662
Business cards are
customer information too,

108
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,031
so they're not allowed to leave the bank.

109
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,133
Why is this in your bag?

110
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,903
I wanted to write the proposal at home.

111
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,904
That's not allowed.

112
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,007
Sometimes it backfires
being hardworking like that.

113
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,778
Okay, that's done. Next person.

114
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,481
Comics and games are okay?

115
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,351
If this was a school,
that would be confiscated.

116
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,853
Like I said, it's not a school bag check.

117
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,056
Now we will check inside the desks.

118
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,057
Unlock it.

119
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,460
Hurry.

120
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,600
They even check inside the drawers?

121
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,969
How strict.

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,270
Why is this here?

123
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,439
You have to take your keys back home.

124
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,708
Isn't it better to leave the keys

125
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,543
at the desk so you don't lose them?

126
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,278
Then anyone can open it.

127
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,014
-What's the point of locking it?
-Right…

128
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,850
Listen up, everyone.

129
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,918
Banks have a tendency to

130
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,855
hide things that are inconvenient.

131
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,591
-Don't go easy on them!
-Yes, sir.

132
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,326
What's with him?

133
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,561
He's treating the bank like a villain.

134
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,230
Lower your voice.

135
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,733
Why do you have cash here?

136
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,368
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,904
Whose passbook is this?

138
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,174
-Whose seal is this?
-Uh…

139
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,076
This isn't yours, right?

140
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,478
What's this?

141
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,247
It's my personal laptop.

142
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,115
I always take it back home, but…

143
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,618
It's used for work.

144
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,887
There might be a data breach.

145
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,022
-Take it to investigate.
-What…

146
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,826
How horrible. They even take away
your personal laptop?

147
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,195
They don't usually go that far.

148
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,131
Soma, Ms. Hanasaki.

149
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,501
-Branch Manager Makino.
-Nice to see you again.

150
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,704
What a hassle this has become.

151
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,874
I didn't think the Financial Services
would inspect our branch.

152
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,845
And for Aota to come, of all people.

153
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,448
Is he that famous?

154
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:32,785
Yeah, he lives to harass banks.

155
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,555
He's a notorious inspector
known for nitpicking

156
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,889
every detail.

157
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,925
Yeah. He seems unpleasant.

158
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,261
-Lower your voice--
-Who's unpleasant?

159
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,635
It's nice to see you again,
Branch Manager Makino.

160
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,537
Hello.

161
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,106
I have to thank you
for the last time we met.

162
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,010
It's nice to see you again.

163
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,080
Oh, and I forgot to mention that

164
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,350
I've become a Chief Inspector now.

165
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,587
Please go easy on us.

166
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,256
Who are they?

167
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,692
They're Branch Inspectors.

168
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,428
-I'm Soma.
-I'm Hanasaki.

169
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,829
From headquarters…

170
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,066
Just try not to get in our way.

171
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,801
Yes, of course.

172
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,670
But banks sure have changed a lot,

173
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,839
or should I say they've become lax.

174
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,309
How interesting to see a young lady
in Branch Inspection.

175
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,312
I was a teller here until last March.

176
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,747
Teller?

177
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,350
That explains it.

178
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,153
I'm sure you were good at
sitting at the window

179
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,054
and smiling.

180
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,524
With all due--

181
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,126
Don't do it. Bear it.

182
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,128
We're done inspecting the desks.

183
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,029
Okay.

184
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,698
Branch Manager.

185
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,903
Please give us the top 20 companies
your branch is financing.

186
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,404
I understand.

187
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,874
-Section Chief Kimura.
-Yes.

188
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,411
Numabukuro Kensetsu.

189
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,847
Saginomiya Butsuryu.

190
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,783
Hashiba Corporation. Kawashima Jouzou.

191
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,154
Kawazoe Creates. Uchikoshi Seiyaku.

192
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,324
Tougou Community. NKN Entertainment.

193
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,828
We will do a thorough investigation now.

194
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,399
To check every corner of how your branch

195
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,767
is working.

196
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,073
Bring all the files you pick up.

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,709
-And the copy machine.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,114
Would you like us to help you out?

199
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,084
Yes, please.

200
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,588
I'm sorry to drag you into this.

201
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,791
Let's pull together as a team

202
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,061
and make it through
this financial investigation.

203
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,215
It's so heavy.

204
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,322
-It's so heavy.
-What are you doing?

205
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,491
You were full of energy a while ago.

206
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,894
Mr. Soma, you offered to help first.

207
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,898
Hurry up or we won't finish.

208
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,736
All right!

209
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,307
Check for any changes.

210
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,443
-In loan agreements, focus on the bonds.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,647
Don't overlook any borrower numbers.

212
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,850
-Especially repayments and use of funds.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,920
This is the nitpicking inspection
that he's notorious for?

214
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,358
Yeah, he checks the details
of every single loan.

215
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,360
If there's even a minor issue,

216
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,430
he'll do a thorough investigation on it.

217
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,334
That Chief Inspector seems
stubborn and persistent.

218
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,103
Can you take
your personal conversation outside?

219
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,505
Lady from headquarters,

220
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,775
didn't I tell you not to get in our way?

221
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,444
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,347
Please let me know if there's anything
I can do.

223
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,649
Anything?

224
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,353
Then bring tea for everyone here.

225
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,089
Tea?

226
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,958
-You said anything, right?
-But…

227
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,994
Okay… yes, we'll get the tea right away.

228
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,265
One, two, three… 15 people. Hurry up.

229
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,283
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

230
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,058
Mr. Shindo, did you call for me?

231
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:06,959
Yes.

232
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,464
It seems like the Nakano Branch
is getting inspected.

233
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,565
Yes.

234
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,270
Why are they inspecting
a small branch like Nakano?

235
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,273
Do you have any information
regarding this?

236
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,677
No, nothing in particular…

237
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,612
I see.

238
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,116
Nothing at all?

239
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,054
I don't know if this will be
useful information,

240
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,922
but the Nakano Branch is

241
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,992
being inspected by Chief Inspector Aota.

242
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,893
Aota?

243
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,928
It's strange,

244
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,365
that Aota would choose to go to
the Nakano Branch.

245
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,669
There aren't any problematic,
or large loan contracts there.

246
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,971
That's strange.

247
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,408
It would be a hassle if they do
some faultfinding in order to

248
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,112
issue us a business improvement order
like they did with Haruna Bank.

249
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,480
Yes.

250
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,749
And then…

251
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,685
What?

252
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,824
Soma and Hanasaki from Branch Inspection
just so happened

253
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,927
to be at the Nakano Branch for an errand.

254
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,797
-Branch Inspection?
-They decided to stay.

255
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:22,468
To help the Nakano Branch
handle the inspection.

256
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,905
Of all the times to let them go there…

257
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,007
What bad timing.

258
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,208
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,379
Good work.

260
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,182
Let us know if you hear anything.

261
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,818
Yes. I will take my leave now.

262
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,025
Shibasaki.

263
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,298
-You're sweating.
-Oh?

264
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,502
Is it that hot in here?

265
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,706
N… no, not at all. I'll be going now.

266
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,710
The temperature is just right.

267
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,751
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
NAKANO BRANCH

268
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,925
Not only is that Chief Inspector
really unpleasant,

269
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,761
he's also super demanding.

270
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,896
Mai!

271
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,932
Aki! Keiko!

272
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,300
Long time no see.

273
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,871
-I missed you guys.
-How dramatic.

274
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,939
We were together at Mika's wedding.

275
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,376
I know, but it feels like it was long ago.

276
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,446
I miss the days when I was working here.

277
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,949
-You're here for the financial inspection?
-No, it was a coincidence.

278
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,852
But I somehow ended up
helping with the inspection.

279
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,922
-Mai, aren't you tired?
-A little.

280
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,459
When you were a teller,
you looked so sharp and worked so hard

281
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,762
that people called you
"Nakano Branch's number one teller."

282
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,800
Why is everything in the past tense?

283
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,770
Do I look that worn out?

284
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,038
Not really,

285
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,707
but you're losing your femininity.

286
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,110
Losing my femininity…

287
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,848
Ever since I went to Branch Inspection,
I'm surrounded by men.

288
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,817
That's great. You're the only girl there.

289
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,586
Find an elite at headquarters.

290
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,223
-Start going out with him.
-There are lots of men.

291
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,794
But they're not elite,
or boyfriend material.

292
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,597
They're plain, and stuffy.

293
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,534
But a flower doesn't live long,
so you have to do your best.

294
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,772
The flower at a bank is the teller, huh?

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,242
I need to do something.

296
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,951
Listen. No matter how small the error,

297
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,254
don't overlook it,
and make sure you report it.

298
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,022
Dig everything up.

299
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,260
Mr. Aota, we found this in this laptop.

300
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,928
-It belongs to someone in Finance.
-What?

301
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,333
I see.

302
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,670
This is interesting.

303
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,443
Thank you for helping us out today.

304
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,579
I haven't been doing much.

305
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,947
-Right?
-Yeah.

306
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,451
It seems like you were well prepared,
so I'm sure

307
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,819
you'll be fine.

308
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,154
Yeah…

309
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,390
What's the matter?

310
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,162
There's actually a file that I'm hiding.

311
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,464
Hiding a file?

312
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,201
It's nothing that shocking.

313
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,470
Every branch has a couple of these.

314
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:48,340
-Stuff they don't want management knowing.
-But a hidden file…

315
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,510
Numbers from financial statements
and business plans

316
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,013
aren't enough to decide on a loan.

317
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,649
But Financial Services has a hard time
understanding that concept.

318
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,720
So we have to keep those files away
from the prying eyes

319
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,355
of the finance inspectors.

320
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,691
I see.

321
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,626
Branch Manager.

322
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,660
Branch Manager.

323
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,932
The inspectors are
heading to the warehouse.

324
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,267
What?

325
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,251
-What is this?
-How horrible.

326
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,619
We found it!

327
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,034
What's this about, Branch Manager Makino?

328
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,736
That is…

329
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,773
From what I can see,
these are files related to loans.

330
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,812
You were hiding these here?

331
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,918
This is clearly an evasion of inspection.

332
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,952
It's a big problem.

333
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm very sorry.

334
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,392
But I believe it's a mistake.

335
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,429
We'll find out when we check
what's inside.

336
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,667
We'll scrutinize these files now.

337
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,503
-Take them.
-Yes.

338
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,047
I didn't think they'd search here too.

339
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,220
They trashed this entire place

340
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,088
and left without cleaning up.

341
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,358
Is the file that bad?

342
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,896
Most of those files were here
just to be on the safe side,

343
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,631
but there's one file

344
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,667
that may not pass
the debtor classification.

345
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,703
Which company?

346
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,113
There must be some suspicious
activities going on

347
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,917
here at this branch for you to be
hiding these files.

348
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,020
Not at all. We have nothing to hide.

349
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,424
Then you're saying that these files
were not hidden?

350
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,659
That's right.

351
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,828
Then what is this?

352
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,797
Nogata Giken.

353
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,904
The financial statement shows that
they've been in the red for six terms.

354
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,974
Yes, but their business is slowly
on the rise.

355
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,145
-It's clear if you see--
-It doesn't match with the business plan.

356
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,081
You made a bad financial decision.

357
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,518
If you will take a look at
their growth rate,

358
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,188
you'll see that they're still recoverable.

359
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,225
It seems like

360
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,695
Branch Manager Makino isn't
understanding the problem.

361
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,933
What I'm talking about is the fact that

362
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,037
Nogata Giken is behind their payments
by three months.

363
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,472
We are keeping an eye on--

364
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,542
You need to do more than
keep an eye on them.

365
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,716
They are at risk of bankruptcy.

366
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,928
I wonder if they're all right.

367
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,563
Ms. Hanasaki.

368
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,701
-How is it in there?
-I have no idea.

369
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,402
I see…

370
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,172
Things turned into a big problem.

371
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,440
Yeah.

372
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,843
Mr. Nagase.

373
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:49,047
Just between you and me,
how bad is the file

374
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,983
that was being hidden?

375
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,552
How bad?

376
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,089
Will the branch be in big trouble
if they find out?

377
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,525
Maybe.

378
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,994
I see…

379
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,331
I'm so worried.

380
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,268
Wait.

381
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,906
By the way, where did Mr. Soma go?

382
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh…

383
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,945
-Take care of those.
-Okay.

384
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,315
If they're in danger of bankruptcy,

385
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,518
it will be damaging to your branch.

386
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,655
You will have to
take responsibility for it.

387
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,227
Yes.

388
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,197
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

389
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,166
You're not supposed to be here.

390
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,636
I'm sorry, but this is an urgent matter.

391
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,570
Branch Manager.

392
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,410
-Really?
-Yes.

393
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,512
What are you two whispering?

394
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,449
Nogata Giken's late payments
will be paid off.

395
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,818
What?

396
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,589
WRITTEN CONSENT

397
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,625
-What is this?
-Nogata Giken.

398
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,128
It owns a facility in the prime location
of Kamakura.

399
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,932
We were in talks to have
them sell that land

400
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,701
in order to secure our funds.

401
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,537
The President gave his approval just now.

402
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,072
What?

403
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,441
With this, Nogata Giken

404
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,310
is no longer in danger of bankruptcy.

405
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,481
WRITTEN CONSENT

406
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,749
NOGATA GIKEN

407
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,870
It ended.

408
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,279
-Is everything all right?
-Somewhat.

409
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,615
Branch Manager Makino.

410
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,617
Yes.

411
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,621
Do you have any other files
you are hiding?

412
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,090
No.

413
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,695
If you confess now,

414
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,164
we will consider mitigating certain areas.

415
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:24,069
But if we find some irregularities
later on,

416
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,437
you will pay for it.

417
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,039
We have nothing.

418
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,175
If we find something,

419
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,546
we will issue
a business improvement order, understand?

420
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,984
When that happens, we will make sure
to report your name.

421
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,587
Your life as a banker will be over.

422
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,358
How horrible.

423
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,494
He just threatened him.

424
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,798
What? Is it the lady
from Branch Inspection again?

425
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,568
Please don't misunderstand,

426
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,838
I'm just doing what's right.

427
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,509
-With all due respect…
-Oh no, she said it.

428
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,479
Just because you're an inspector,
doesn't mean

429
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,215
you have the right to determine
a banker's future.

430
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,851
You're very high-spirited.

431
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,589
But the one evading the investigation
by secretly hiding files,

432
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,524
is the bank. Am I wrong?

433
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,226
That's…

434
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,931
If you're a former teller,

435
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,536
why don't you supervise the girls
working at the window.

436
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,240
Stay out of my business.

437
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,782
Don't think that this is over.

438
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,986
I'll show you what happens when you
go against

439
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,589
an inspector.

440
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,340
He's unforgivable!

441
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:12,077
What's so great about being
an inspector for Financial Services.

442
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,347
-She's really riled up today.
-Yes.

443
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,949
Here's your favorite offal stew.

444
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,685
Dad, I'm not a little kid anymore.

445
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,189
You can't put me in a better mood
by feeding me my favorite food.

446
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:25,957
It's delicious.

447
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,994
-She smiled.
-How simple.

448
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,164
Today was a tough day.

449
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,534
The financial inspection started,

450
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,169
and of all people,
Aota is the one in charge.

451
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,772
He's a lot stricter than I had heard.

452
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,676
Who knows what he will say tomorrow…

453
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,379
But thank you for helping me today.

454
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,782
Soma, thank you for helping me
with Nogata Giken.

455
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,384
Minamida was the one in charge,

456
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,452
and he worked hard to negotiate.

457
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,188
-But Mr. Makino…
-Yeah?

458
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,158
Did something happen with Aota
in the past?

459
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,161
I've been wondering ever since
this morning.

460
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,897
Well,

461
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,901
back when Aota was a rookie inspector,

462
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,339
the inspection style was very tyrannical,

463
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,143
so I reported it to his boss.

464
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:23,348
And he received a formal warning
because of that.

465
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,751
I heard that he still holds a grudge
against me for that.

466
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,988
I see.

467
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,491
He still resents you for doing that,

468
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,761
and that's why he hates you so much?

469
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,930
I think so.

470
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,533
What a piece of work.

471
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,870
It's not just his work ethics,
but his personality that is nasty too.

472
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,439
Eat your offal stew.

473
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,775
Mr. Makino, eat the offal stew
and cheer up.

474
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,211
-Thank you.
-That's on us.

475
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,680
-Thank you.
-Sure.

476
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,064
But how did they find that?

477
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,833
-That file?
-Yeah.

478
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,537
They don't usually search
an underground warehouse.

479
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,008
Yeah, that sure is strange.

480
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:24,876
Oh.

481
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:30,081
Maybe there's an informer within the bank.

482
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,017
Informer?

483
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,787
So someone who knew about
that warehouse told Aota?

484
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,921
Yes.

485
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,958
But not everyone knows where the files

486
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,760
are hidden, right?

487
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,295
Everyone in the Financial Department

488
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,064
and the Section Chief's would know.

489
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,434
Then we won't know who the informer is.

490
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,369
That's right.

491
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,273
I wonder who it is.

492
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,142
Oh…

493
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,611
Maybe Deputy Manager Tanaka wants to

494
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,346
become the Branch Manager.

495
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:08,153
That can't be.
Mr. Tanaka is such a nice person.

496
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:13,124
Oh, maybe it's Mr. Kimura, the
Section Chief of the Finance Department.

497
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,561
Despite how he looks,
Mr. Kimura is very ambitious.

498
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,931
Look at my wife. Isn't she beautiful?

499
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,069
Mr. Kimura loves his wife,
so I don't think it's him.

500
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,239
It might be Mr. Ishii…

501
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,775
He said he can never win against

502
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,544
the Branch Manager at golf.

503
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,215
But Mr. Ishii is a sweet father
of two kids.

504
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,551
So there's no way it's him.

505
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,252
What are you saying?

506
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,522
I have no idea.

507
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,528
I doubt he'll end things without a fight.

508
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,429
What?

509
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,233
I've heard lots of horrible rumors
about Aota.

510
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,369
When Haruna Bank got
the business improvement order,

511
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:02,073
they say he fabricated details to
make it seem like they evaded inspection.

512
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,576
-Fabricated?
-Yeah.

513
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,011
Just like you said,

514
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,047
we found the hidden files

515
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,949
but that's not good enough.

516
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,318
We couldn't corner Makino.

517
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,254
What else is there?

518
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,825
At this point,
use whatever means possible.

519
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,728
Do something yourself.

520
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,499
What?

521
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,102
You want me to publicize everything?

522
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,807
We can't put our guard down tomorrow.

523
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,977
We don't know what dirty tricks
he will play.

524
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,480
I wonder what he has up his sleeves.

525
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,381
Oh.

526
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,417
What would you do, Mr. Soma?

527
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,586
-What? Me?
-Yeah.

528
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,322
If it was me…

529
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,060
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
NAKANO BRANCH

530
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
MONTHLY FINANCE REPORT

531
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,255
BUSINESS REVIVAL PLAN

532
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,742
So, you were the informer…

533
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,412
Mr. Nagase.

534
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,551
-How?
-What if Aota were to plot something?

535
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,654
We thought he would try to conceal
the investigation files.

536
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,891
We figured he would make
his informer do that.

537
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,094
Before the Finance Department came in.

538
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,566
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,470
Mr. Nagase…

540
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,939
Why are you his informer?

541
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,041
Were you threatened by Aota?

542
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,546
Yes.

543
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,414
Just as I thought…

544
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,952
Yesterday,
when they confiscated my laptop,

545
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,555
they checked my email…

546
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,726
They found out that I'm in debt.

547
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:39,063
It seems like you're deep in debt.

548
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,066
And since you're also borrowing
from loan sharks,

549
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,435
that would disqualify you as a banker.

550
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,140
If this becomes public,

551
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,243
it will ruin your future as a banker.

552
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,913
Please… anything but that.

553
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:57,649
Then,

554
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,985
give me information that would
harm the branch.

555
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,854
What?

556
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,923
That's blackmailing.

557
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,759
That's something Aota would do.

558
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,265
That's why I told him where the loan files

559
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,334
were hidden.

560
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,638
But Aota was not satisfied with that.

561
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,007
That's why

562
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,944
he tried to fabricate a case

563
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,645
of data concealment.

564
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,713
Yes.

565
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,417
Mr. Aota called me last night.

566
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,787
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>use whatever means possible.</i>

567
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,189
<i>Figure something out on your own.</i>

568
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,524
No way…

569
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,328
-I can't do it.
<i>-What?</i>

570
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,330
You want me to publicize everything?

571
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,799
But…

572
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,435
<i>Go pull out a loan file that</i>
<i>I'm about to tell you.</i>

573
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,570
<i>-Hide it somewhere.</i>
-What?

574
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,707
Later, I will pretend I found it.

575
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,975
What?

576
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,813
He's taking advantage
of someone's weakness.

577
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,514
He's so dirty!

578
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,155
It's my fault for succumbing
to his blackmail.

579
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,257
I…

580
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,427
I'm disqualified as a banker.

581
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,632
Mr. Nagase, let's go apologize to
Branch Manager Makino.

582
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,302
If you explain everything,
I'm sure he'll understand.

583
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,206
No, that won't be enough.

584
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,008
Mr. Soma.

585
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,409
Nagase.

586
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,747
If you really regret what you've done,

587
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,715
it's not too late.

588
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,252
Go and tell Aota that you won't do it.

589
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,495
Isn't that what you should do right now?

590
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:55,833
Yes.

591
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,306
But I want to punish that

592
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,076
Chief Inspector somehow.

593
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,812
Isn't there a way to do that?

594
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,281
Stop it.

595
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,315
What?

596
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,719
For once, the bank is not at fault.

597
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,655
We'll just have to let it go.

598
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,957
No way.

599
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,593
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

601
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,168

611
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,196
-Mr. Aota.
-Yes?

612
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,699
There are no problems with
any of the loan files.

613
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,934
What?

614
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,806
That can't be.
There has to be a missing file.

615
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,475
-There's nothing missing.
-It's all here.

616
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,150
That bastard.

617
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,825
What's going on?

618
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,228
I…

619
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,967
cannot betray the bank anymore.

620
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,971
Do you want me to publicize your debt?

621
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,709
Do you understand

622
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,745
that I can easily use my power

623
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,447
to fire a banker like you.

624
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,418
Do whatever it takes

625
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:31,322
so that I can blame the Branch Manager
for obstructing inspection.

626
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,791
-Got it?
-I can't do it.

627
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,927
I won't do it.

628
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:36,861
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,938
Damn it.

630
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,257
Oh no, I didn't know that the finance
inspection would be going on today too.

631
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,391
What's the matter?

632
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,894
Well…

633
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,399
Mr. Takagi from the Finance Department
asked me to

634
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,235
hold onto something.

635
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,170
Something?

636
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,507
I don't know what it is,
but it's a loan file.

637
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,546
He was supposed to have dealt with it
by last week,

638
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,448
but he said he forgot.

639
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,218
He said, "If Financial Services

640
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,089
finds out about this,
it will trouble the whole branch."

641
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,891
What? Why did you let him leave it
with you?

642
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,927
-Because…
-More importantly,

643
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,862
where did you hide that file?

644
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,631
BREAK ROOM

645
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,865
It's at…

646
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,825
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

647
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,030
Everything is balanced.
Thank you very much.

648
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,431
Thank you.

649
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,001
Good work, everyone.

650
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,804
-I'm so hungry.
-What do you want to eat?

651
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,106
Will you treat me…

652
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,712
Who is Keiko Shimazaki?

653
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,015
That's me.

654
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,251
Show me your locker.

655
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,319
What?

656
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,255
-Why Keiko?
-What?

657
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,191
What's going on?

658
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,429
We received information
from an inside informant

659
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,598
that there is an important loan file
hidden in the locker

660
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,167
of Keiko Shimazaki.

661
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,235
What?

662
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,479
This is not right.

663
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,881
She's in the Sales Department,
not Finance.

664
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,651
It'll all clear up
once we check her locker.

665
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,423
Please open your locker.

666
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,293
Wait a minute. Even if it's an inspection,

667
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,128
there has to be a line somewhere.

668
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,064
Oh, it's you again.

669
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,633
I can report this as obstruction.

670
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,837
-We don't care.
-Hanasaki.

671
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,772
There's no point talking to you.

672
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,176
Branch Manager,
didn't I tell you yesterday

673
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,012
that I will not let you go if there are

674
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,814
any hidden loan files.

675
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,685
Be prepared.

676
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,257
Give me your keys.

677
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,166
Over here.

678
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,469
Inspector Aota.

679
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,539
You should stop right now.

680
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,675
You have no right to tell me what to do.

681
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,114
Please stop!

682
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,650
NOW HANDLING IC CASH CARD!

683
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,025
Why isn't it here?

684
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,700
Let's go.

685
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,236
Wait a minute.

686
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,972
You ransacked a female employee's locker,

687
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,840
and you're just going to leave?

688
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,976
Apologize before you leave.

689
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,614
Listen. There's a hidden file
somewhere in this branch.

690
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,817
We're just trying to find that.

691
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,818
Is that wrong?

692
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,688
Does an inspection justify everything?

693
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,590
What?

694
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,828
You said that an inside informant

695
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,564
told you about a hidden file,

696
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,668
but is that even true in the first place?

697
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
What?

698
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,377
Did you set me up?

699
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,279
Yes.

700
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,815
There are no files hidden in this branch.

701
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,384
What?

702
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,187
What?

703
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,824
What?

704
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,162
Do you think you'll get away with this?

705
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,665
You were resorting to using dirty tricks,

706
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,300
so we just played accordingly.

707
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,070
Dirty tricks? What are you talking about?

708
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:58,175
Mr. Aota, in order to avenge
an old grudge, you were searching

709
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,278
Nakano Branch for a big mistake
that could bring down

710
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,147
Branch Manager Makino.

711
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,349
When you couldn't find anything,

712
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,484
you threatened our employee

713
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,421
to make him hide an important file, right?

714
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,857
I don't know about that.

715
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,093
Mr. Nagase told us everything.

716
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,830
He said he's ready to testify anytime.

717
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,634
Will you still deny it?

718
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,903
Idiot…

719
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,374
That's just his imagination.

720
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,111
Between a bank employee

721
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,214
and a Chief Inspector for
the Financial Services Agency,

722
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,816
who will they believe?

723
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,656
Are you done now?

724
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,658
Hey.

725
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,328
What happened to your fiery attitude?

726
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:56,200
First of all, there isn't any proof

727
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,236
to back up what you've said.

728
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,343
<i>Do you want me to publicize your debt?</i>

729
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,715
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>that I can easily use my power</i>

730
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,885
<i>to fire a banker like you.</i>

731
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,354
Mr. Soma…

732
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,590
<i>Do whatever it takes</i>

733
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,227
<i>so that I can blame the Branch Manager</i>
<i>for obstructing inspection.</i>

734
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,128
<i>Got it?</i>

735
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:28,699
Mr. Aota.

736
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,070
This counts as proof, right?

737
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,009
I had heard bad rumors about you.

738
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,047
So I knew that you would object to
whatever we say.

739
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,417
So I had Nagase record the conversation
just in case.

740
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,022
It's some kind of mistake.

741
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,328
I conducted a legitimate inspection…

742
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,631
Legitimate inspection?

743
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,868
Can you say the same thing in front
of the Minister for Financial Services?

744
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,970
Well?

745
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,640
Shut up!

746
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,908
No, I won't!

747
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,377
You misused your authority

748
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,580
to trap a banker to avenge
your personal grudge.

749
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,115
That's wrong!

750
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,052
You are wrong as an inspector… no,

751
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,455
as a human being!

752
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,699
And

753
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,135
you stormed into

754
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:42,239
the women's locker room
and didn't apologize for causing a ruckus.

755
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:46,110
You're a despicable man!

756
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,123
Damn.

757
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,438
-I did it.
-What?

758
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,374
-Keiko, you were amazing!
-I'm so happy.

759
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,811
-Why didn't you ask me?
-I'm so glad!

760
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:27,284
-Hold on a minute.
-Cheers!

761
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,119
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

762
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,189
All right,

763
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,358
cheers!

764
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,662
That was impressive.

765
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,864
I can't believe that was all an act.

766
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,833
I'm sorry.

767
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,569
But we wouldn't have been able to get that

768
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,238
sly inspector if we hadn't done that.

769
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,007
But I'm glad he fell for it.

770
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,509
It was hit or miss.

771
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,345
Mr. Soma, we wouldn't have
had to work so hard

772
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,581
if you had told us about that recording.

773
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,485
I was waiting for a chance to
submit it to top management.

774
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,789
-Oh really?
-I still can't believe it.

775
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:06,757
Coming up with that plan.

776
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,261
It's because we had a great actress.

777
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,197
Keiko used to be in the drama club.

778
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,566
-You didn't know?
-How would I know?

779
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,634
I knew. Good work.

780
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,637
I wish I could've seen you act.

781
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,872
Thank you.

782
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,142
It's been a while since I acted
in front of a crowd,

783
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,710
so I was so nervous.

784
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,445
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

785
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,381
-I was shocked.
-I couldn't tell you.

786
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,183
I knew you'd get so nervous.

787
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,652
I guess you're right.

788
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:39,122
You did so well, Keiko.

789
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,059
Oh, and where did that
black underwear come from?

790
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,529
-Oh yeah--
-That was part of the plan too?

791
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,598
Is that yours?

792
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,033
-No way!
-What about the black underwear?

793
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,004
No, Keiko came up with that on her own.

794
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,540
I didn't know about that either.

795
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,276
I ran out and bought it during my break.

796
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,645
I wanted to make it exciting,

797
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,280
but was it too much?

798
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,216
-It was awesome.
-All right!

799
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,852
Women are scary.

800
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:09,753
They sure are.

801
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,289
Did you say something?

802
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,824
No.

803
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:18,996
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

804
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,598
Aota received a disciplinary dismissal.

805
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,001
Dismissal?

806
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:29,239
Yes. False reporting, blackmail,
and misuse of authority.

807
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,743
It was confirmed that he had
done something similar

808
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,044
in the past.

809
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,315
I never expected that

810
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,285
aggressive inspector to end up like this.

811
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,387
We got a lucky break,

812
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,390
but Aota getting dismissed
by Financial Services

813
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,126
is great news for our bank.

814
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,730
But it bothers me that those two people

815
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,933
from Branch Inspection

816
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,002
had a part in this.

817
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,940
If we leave them alone,

818
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,108
those two

819
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,012
might become a troublesome existence.

820
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:24,628
BRANCH INSPECTION

821
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,229
I'm back.

822
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,333
Branch Manager Makino just called.

823
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,233
Really?

824
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,937
They only received a strict warning
for the files that were

825
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,806
found in the warehouse.

826
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,909
I'm so glad.

827
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,678
What about Mr. Nagase?

828
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,649
He's fine too, since Aota got fired.

829
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,985
But he received a scolding

830
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,553
about his personal life.

831
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,856
I'm sure Mr. Nagase learned his lesson.

832
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,393
Yeah, I'm glad it all worked out.

833
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,163
-There's nothing to be glad about, Soma.
-What?

834
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,934
You were gone for two days
doing something other than inspection.

835
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,503
These are the inspection sites
for you this week.

836
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,539
-They piled up.
-This many?

837
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,775
Stop complaining and get moving.

838
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,510
Okay.

839
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,613
-Where should we start?
-Let's see.

840
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,283
-Oh no.
-What is it?

841
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,819
I ended up never stamping my seal

842
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,321
at the Nakano Branch.

843
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,823
Oh come on, Mr. Soma…

844
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,459
You're hopeless.

845
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,828
What were you doing for two days?

846
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,164
I'll go there right now.

847
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,767
-I'll go too.
-Why are you coming?

848
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,336
I'll go with you.

849
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,439
-I'm fine by myself.
-I'll come.

850
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,841
Go to the inspection sites!

851
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,844
Okay, bye!

852
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,613
Sexual harassment by a manager?

853
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,283
This wouldn't have happened
if you had listened to me.

854
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,586
A scandal is prohibited at a bank
where we prioritize trust.

855
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,222
I didn't want people to know.

856
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,859
I won't forgive you for ruining her life.

857
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,162
