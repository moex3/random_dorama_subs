1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:05,372
Looks delicious.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,342
The juicy Hakone Sanroku Beef.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,746
Look at this one!
Fresh and extravagant seafood platter!

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,181
I like this room with the open bath.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,850
I agree.

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,353
We've been working for five years,
so it's time to treat ourselves.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,655
That's right, we're working hard.

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,259
Then Natsuko, you'll be the coordinator,
since this was your idea.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,062
-What? Me?
-Thanks, Natsuko.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,296
Roger!

11
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,300
Let's talk and drink all night
to release our stress.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,303
I'll save up lots of horrible stories
about my boss.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,207
I can talk all night about
the awful Section Chief at my workplace.

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,710
I can't wait to try the hot spring.

15
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,680
This is delicious!

16
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,317
This has the perfect flavor.

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,119
This is delicious!

18
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,222
This has the perfect consistency.

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,324
I love watching you eat.

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,726
I can tell you enjoy it.

21
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,229
As you get older
your appetite decreases, right?

22
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,098
So it's quality over quantity.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,468
That's why I'm so particular about
delicious cuisine.

24
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,837
I agree, Mr. Soma.

25
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,706
We're so like-minded.

26
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,008
Yeah!

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,977
Oh?

28
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,513
Where's Hanasaki…
I mean, where's your daughter?

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,250
-She's out drinking with her colleagues.
-Her colleagues?

30
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,153
She gets together with those girls
pretty often.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,555
I see.

32
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,691
They're probably releasing their stress
by talking bad

33
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,359
about their workplace and boss.

34
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,395
Women love doing things like that.

35
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,629
Yes.

36
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,733
But Mr. Soma, I'm sure no one
ever talks bad about you.

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,770
-That's not true.
-No way, Mr. Soma.

38
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,673
You're the ideal boss.

39
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,942
No, no.

40
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,779
No, no. My boss is a pretty nice guy,

41
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,348
but he's not motivated,
and he's also unreliable.

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,818
He's not the ideal boss at all.

43
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:03,223
Mai, you've become like an old man.

44
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,725
-What?
-I was thinking the same thing.

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,461
-Your mannerism and the way you speak.
-No way…

46
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,698
I'm alone with him at work,
so maybe he's rubbing off on me.

47
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,968
Did you hear that Nanami is going to
start a new job in June?

48
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:15,969
-Really?
-Yeah.

49
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,873
-It's sad to see our colleagues leave.
-Yeah.

50
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,575
What if I'm the only one left.

51
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,911
No one will give us a goodbye party.

52
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,848
In that case, everyone who was
in the same employee training class

53
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,850
should all quit together. No?

54
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:31,985
What?

55
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,955
Employee training class
makes me nostalgic.

56
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,361
We couldn't even count bills
properly back then.

57
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,964
We just happened to be in the same class,
and we've been friends since.

58
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,367
Yeah.

59
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:51,004
This monthly colleague dinner has been
going on for a long time.

60
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,605
Though we lost some members.

61
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,742
Well, all of us here are late in the game.

62
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,480
What?
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

63
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,218
Let's raise our glasses.

64
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,086
To what?

65
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,256
Cheers to our colleagues who
are working hard!

66
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,225
Cheers.

67
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,462
That charged me with power
to work hard tomorrow.

68
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,666
Mai, it's amazing that you're
working at the headquarters now.

69
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,100
Not at all.

70
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,537
Branch inspection is a job that's
hated by the branches.

71
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,007
-But you're doing your best, right?
-I wonder.

72
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,043
-And you, Natsuko?
-Hm?

73
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,813
You haven't given up on
the general management position, right?

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,914
Hm…

75
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,218
I still can't understand why

76
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,553
you never passed the examination.

77
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,990
You're writing your name down, right?

78
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,193
-I wrote it down.
-Really?

79
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,798
I'm so envious of you, Mai.
You're always so positive.

80
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,101
-That's not true.
-Really?

81
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,135
Yes.

82
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,973
Maybe I'll buy something on the way back.

83
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,480
TRUTH ABOUT THE MEGA BANK T

84
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,916
BEAUTIFUL FEMALE BANKER EXPOSES
THE HIDDEN FACE OF AN ELITE BANKER!

85
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,918
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

86
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,560
We're in trouble.

87
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,169
-We're in trouble.
-Good morning, Mr. Shibasaki.

88
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,740
Good morning.
What's going on this morning?

89
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,943
Was the convenience store
out of your favorite chocolate?

90
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,380
Yesterday, it was because the cutlet
at the cafeteria was too thin.

91
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,383
How can you guys be so carefree?

92
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,652
Haven't you seen this?

93
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,053
-What?
-Huh?

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,557
"The hidden face of an elite banker?"

95
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,993
"Sexual harassment by a branch manager?"

96
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,894
What?

97
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,600
Mega bank T…

98
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,102
This picture is clearly our bank.

99
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,671
This ID…

100
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,673
It's our bank.

101
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,142
That's why I said that we're in trouble.

102
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,810
I see…

103
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:15,081
"The accusation was made by
a female teller in her twenties working at

104
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,116
Bank T located in the city."

105
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,919
"Calls me into his office and touches me"?

106
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,422
"Holds my hand in the elevator"?

107
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,657
"Tried to kiss me"?

108
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,026
This is despicable!

109
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,027
How scary.

110
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,496
It's preposterous to be doing that
in the workplace!

111
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,965
If it was me, I would've punched him.

112
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,368
Yes, you would.

113
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,804
-Hanasaki won't have to worry.
-What?

114
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,973
Do you think anyone would
sexually harass Hanasaki?

115
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,810
-Very true.
-Right?

116
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,481
The remark you just made
is sexual harassment too.

117
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,882
Really?

118
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,253
Branch Inspection.

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,689
Good morning, Director Karashima.

120
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,690
What?

121
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,425
Soma. Hanasaki.

122
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,796
-This is Assistant General Manager Omae.
-I'm Omae.

123
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,833
-I'm Soma from Branch Inspection.
-I'm Hanasaki.

124
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,402
Did you two read this?

125
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:10,970
Yes.

126
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,741
In order to solve this issue
as quickly as possible,

127
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,211
the Branch Managing Department

128
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,213
will cooperate with HR.

129
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,883
I want you to find out
who this female employee is.

130
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,820
Find? But how…

131
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,656
She probably said this
in order to get some money,

132
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,358
but this is unacceptable.

133
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,660
But she is claiming that she was--

134
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,196
It's something written by
a gossip magazine.

135
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,098
Sexual harassment at our bank

136
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,401
is obviously nonsense.

137
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,935
But…

138
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,338
Come in.

139
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,608
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Shindo.

140
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,942
What happened?

141
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,181
How's the investigation regarding
the female employee in the article?

142
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,784
We just assigned that task to these two.

143
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,319
What? To Branch Inspection?

144
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,890
Can we trust this task to them?

145
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,258
They will be fine.

146
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,929
They're a reliable pair that has resolved
many problems at the branches.

147
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,899
But this is different

148
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,536
from the small problems that
Branch Inspection has been dealing with.

149
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,174
In order to maintain our bank's trust,
we must avoid any scandal.

150
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,710
But as for this case,

151
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,614
there are things that can only
be discussed between women.

152
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,683
So sending her would be appropriate.

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,584
I see.

154
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,356
You will find her, right?

155
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,091
Ah…

156
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,660
I will do everything I can.

157
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,663
Everything you can?

158
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,931
I mean…

159
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,767
I will definitely find her.

160
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,369
I see. Definitely.

161
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,271
Yes.

162
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,176
If you find anything out,
contact me right away.

163
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,312
I understand.

164
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,148
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:06,252
Why did you say "definitely"?

166
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,654
Think about what that means for us.

167
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,458
-I'm sorry. I couldn't resist…
-You can never resist.

168
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,694
You can't resist saying
or doing something.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,364
Do you know how much trouble I've
gone through because you can't resist?

170
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,066
I'm sorry I couldn't resist…

171
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,334
-See?
-Oh.

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,135
Don't say that starting today.

173
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,138
-What?
-Think about it.

174
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,142
How many thousands of female employees
do you think there are within the city?

175
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,112
Finding one particular person
among all of them,

176
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,348
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

177
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,184
But you said,
"I will definitely find her."

178
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,753
What we know from this article is that

179
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,891
she is a teller in her twenties,
who is working within the city.

180
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,459
How are we supposed to

181
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,828
narrow down the suspects.

182
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,996
MS. A IS A TELLER IN HER TWENTIES
WORKING AT A BRANCH IN THE CITY

183
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,564
MS. A / IN HER TWENTIES

184
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,899
I got it.

185
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,635
Let's start by looking at
pictures of tellers within the city.

186
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,936
Why?

187
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,971
Because it said, "beautiful employee."

188
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,341
Mr. Soma, you really are

189
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,910
an old man.

190
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,878
I was only joking.

191
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,779
Oh!

192
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,148
How about we ask the publisher?

193
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,583
They'll never tell us.

194
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,087
Moreover, they'll write,
"Tokyo Daiichi Bank came to

195
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,523
the publishing department
to ask about Ms. A,"

196
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,092
in next week's article to make fun of us.

197
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,694
You're right.

198
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,097
Let's start by searching for
certain employees.

199
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,832
-Those who've given notice.
-What?

200
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,002
Selling the company you work for
to a magazine

201
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,171
means they're ready to leave.

202
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,075
I see. I'll have HR make a list for us.

203
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,276
Okay, thanks.

204
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,514
Among the tellers in their twenties
who are working within the city,

205
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,051
12 of them have handed in
their letter of resignation.

206
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,387
That's a lot. What's the reason?

207
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,992
Marriage, giving birth, studying abroad,
change of occupation, and so forth.

208
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,062
Oh yeah, Hanasaki.

209
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,531
-I want you to do the questioning.
-What?

210
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,766
We'll be talking to women…

211
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,236
Only you can do it.

212
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,106
Director Karashima said that too.

213
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,375
I see.

214
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,409
I understand.

215
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,281
This is going to be a really big hassle.

216
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,117
-Did you say something?
-No, nothing.

217
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,252
SOUTH SHINJUKU BRANCH

218
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,420
I'm offended!

219
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,390
Do I look like a whistleblower who would

220
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,592
trouble the bank that I was working at?

221
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,494
No, not at all.

222
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,063
We are just asking
everyone who is leaving,

223
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,532
just to make sure.

224
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,268
Do you think I'm leaving
because I hate this company?

225
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,938
That's just ridiculous!

226
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,041
Oh… um… I'm sorry.

227
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,111
It's a long road ahead of us.

228
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,146
Hey Hanasaki, there's a great

229
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,914
curry restaurant over there.

230
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,118
We don't have time for that today.

231
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,453
DENENCHOFU BRANCH

232
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,088
I wonder who that teller is.

233
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm so curious.

234
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,292
-Yes…
-I had thoughts on who it might be.

235
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,795
Maybe beautiful Aiko
from the Marunouchi Branch.

236
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,197
-She had quit already though.
-Um…

237
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,365
Then how about

238
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,566
the girl in Yokohama?

239
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,869
It's within the city…

240
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,304
Then what about the girl
at the Hachioji Branch?

241
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,207
How about the Beyoncé look-alike
at the Tama Branch?

242
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,143
What about the Higashimurayama Branch?

243
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,045
MUKOJIMA BRANCH

244
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,715
Do you suspect me?

245
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,418
No, we're asking other people,

246
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,653
so it's not just you.

247
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,290
But you didn't call
the other older tellers…

248
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,526
Oh, well… um…

249
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,428
Please don't cry.

250
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,965
What are you doing here?

251
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,002
-You didn't call the branch manager.
-I'm very sorry.

252
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,204
But you seemed very busy.

253
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,340
I hear that you came to investigate
that article.

254
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,142
Yes… oh, well…

255
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,944
Then what?

256
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,915
You think I'm sexually harassing my staff?

257
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,084
No, we don't suspect you…

258
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,489
Do I look like someone who
would do something that despicable?

259
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,292
But sometimes looks can be deceiving.

260
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,427
-Right?
-That's right… what?

261
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,429
You're doubting me!

262
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,100
Thank you for your support.
Come on, let's go.

263
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,802
I'm so tired.

264
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,738
I'm so hungry.

265
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,507
We didn't have time to eat lunch.

266
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,578
But we didn't produce any results.

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,215
Did you learn anything?

268
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,450
Nothing in particular.

269
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,353
None of the tellers
seemed to fit the bill.

270
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,758
Will you be able to find her like this?

271
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,759
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,927
Oh, jeez…

273
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,231
It's unforgivable that she's
working another day

274
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,501
when she sold out our company
to get money.

275
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,505
Um… I've been wondering why this Ms. A

276
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,507
is being blamed for everything.

277
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,609
-Isn't that unfair?
-Hanasaki.

278
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,812
The manager that sexually harassed her

279
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,480
is the main problem.

280
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,284
Do you believe what's written
in this magazine?

281
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,520
Generally speaking,

282
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,022
most women who cry about
being sexually harassed

283
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,526
are just exaggerating things
and making a big deal out of nothing.

284
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,328
I feel sorry for the boss.

285
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,364
This Ms. A,

286
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,599
must be a good-for-nothing girl.

287
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,470
With all… due…

288
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,307
Either way,

289
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,210
find this female teller
as soon as possible.

290
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,645
Understand?

291
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,780
Yes.

292
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,187
That Omae gets me so mad.

293
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,323
I can't believe someone in HR
would say that.

294
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,692
-Yeah.
-Mai.

295
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,460
This bank with

296
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,596
sexual harassment isn't your bank, is it?

297
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,464
It says Bank T right here…

298
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,366
-Keep it on the down-low.
-It is?

299
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,336
Your voice is too loud.

300
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,206
Mai, I hope you weren't sexually harassed

301
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,507
when you were a teller.

302
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,210
-No, don't worry.
-Really?

303
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,511
Don't worry.

304
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,013
No man would sexually harass her.

305
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,215
Mr. Soma.

306
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,018
Oh… no, that came out wrong.

307
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn't mean it that way.

308
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,656
-You're right.
-Dad?

309
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,860
Because if you do anything
like that to her, she'll break

310
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,294
a bone or two.

311
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,495
I agree.

312
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,533
-Mr. Kozo.
-It's hot.

313
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,270
But Mr. Omae might have a valid point.

314
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,207
Everything written in these
magazines isn't guaranteed to be true.

315
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,543
You're right, but…

316
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,545
-What?
-Well.

317
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,147
I read that article over and over again.

318
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:47,186
She says, "Every day, I was scared
of what he would do to me,

319
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,722
but I couldn't afford to take a day off,"

320
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,258
or "I just need to bear it."

321
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,860
I think Ms. A

322
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,230
is earnest and has
a strong sense of responsibility

323
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,298
Yeah.

324
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,435
I don't think someone like that would
lie just to make money.

325
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,638
That makes sense too.

326
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,743
So she must have been
pushed beyond her limit.

327
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,981
She was alone without anyone around her
that she can confide in…

328
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,185
If that's true, I feel very bad for her.

329
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,965
THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO LEAKED THE STORY

330
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,034
ABOUT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

331
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,472
SEND

332
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,944
We're in trouble!

333
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,215
We're in trouble!

334
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,084
What is it now?

335
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,020
This email was sent to the President.

336
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:55,955
Let me see.

337
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,726
"The whistleblower who leaked
the story about the sexual harassment

338
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,829
is Natsuko Kawashima
from the Kyobashi Branch."

339
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,999
Let me see that.

340
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,802
Natsuko…

341
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,106
You know her?

342
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,743
She's my colleague.
Who would do such a horrible thing…

343
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,413
Can you go to the Kyobashi Branch?

344
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,515
Mr. Shibasaki, you believe this email?

345
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,817
Well…

346
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,419
This is obviously a prank.

347
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,756
If she's Ms. A, she would have

348
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,459
confided in me
before doing something like this.

349
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,227
She never said she was harassed.

350
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,563
I see…

351
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,199
But since this email was sent to us,

352
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,167
we can't ignore it.

353
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,702
Please go talk to her.

354
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,903
I understand.

355
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,605
Let's go.

356
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,041
Okay…

357
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,078
What is it? You look so lost.

358
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,950
It's nothing.

359
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,987
You're sure it's not Ms. Kawashima, right?

360
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,256
That's right.

361
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,325
I believe that, but…

362
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,564
But if by any chance, Natsuko was

363
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,733
being sexually harassed…

364
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,509
KYOBASHI BRANCH

365
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,044
This email

366
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,114
was sent to our President.

367
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,885
THE WHISTLEBLOWER IS
NATSUKO NAGASHIMA OF THE KYOBASHI BRANCH

368
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,287
Ms. Kawashima?

369
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,890
Of course, this email could be a prank.

370
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,325
But we wanted to make sure.

371
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,297
I've known her ever since I was
a Deputy Manager

372
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,100
but she's not someone who would
do something like this.

373
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,070
Of course, I've never
sexually harassed her either.

374
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,471
Oh, yes…

375
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,741
How are Ms. Kawashima's work ethics?

376
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,710
She's a competent
and a trustworthy employee.

377
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,982
Is it possible to talk with Ms. Kawashima?

378
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,584
Yes.

379
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,292
-Mr. Soma.
-Yeah?

380
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,361
Can I talk to her privately?

381
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,300
Of course.

382
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,635
Thank you.

383
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,679
Excuse me.

384
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,086
Mai…

385
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,691
The person from headquarters, is you?

386
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,592
Yeah.

387
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,261
You know about that

388
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,163
magazine article, right?

389
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,834
Branch Inspection
is in charge of that case.

390
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,670
And…

391
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,076
we received this email today
at headquarters.

392
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,150
I'm sure it's just a prank,

393
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,019
but we had to come and hear things out.

394
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,387
It was me.

395
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,992
I'm the one that sent this email.

396
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,660
What?

397
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,296
Why?

398
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,000
I wanted them to find out
as soon as possible, that I am

399
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,469
Ms. A in that article.

400
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,941
Natsuko…

401
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,678
you were sexually harassed?

402
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,152
Branch Manager Iwaki?

403
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,190
The branch manager
before Branch Manager Iwaki.

404
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,458
Who is it?

405
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,130
Assistant General Manager Omae from HR.

406
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,899
What?

407
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,367
THE WHISTLEBLOWER IS
NATSUKO NAGASHIMA OF THE KYOBASHI BRANCH

408
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,003
What is this?

409
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,141
TRUTH ABOUT THE MEGA BANK T

410
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,044
This article is about me?

411
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,814
Damn it.

412
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,382
That woman…

413
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,186
How dare she do this to me!

414
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,960
Assistant General Manager Omae…

415
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,965
Is everything written in that article

416
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,099
really true?

417
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,337
Everything he did to me

418
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,771
is true.

419
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,512
Good work.

420
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,986
At first, I thought I was thinking
too much of it.

421
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,426
But when I didn't say anything…

422
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,467
his harassment escalated.

423
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,272
But if it was just sexual harassment,

424
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,143
I would have endured it,
no matter how frustrating it was.

425
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,414
What happened?

426
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,819
Remember how I took the exam

427
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,921
for the general management position
last year?

428
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,327
He took me out for dinner
the night before the exam.

429
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,399
EXAM FOR THE GENERAL MANAGERIAL POSITION

430
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,302
I'll be writing
the letter of recommendation

431
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,503
so don't worry.

432
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,506
Thank you.

433
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,079
I reserved a room.

434
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,650
It'll be for your own good.

435
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,453
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,790
I'll be leaving.

437
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,965
EXAM RESULT
FAILED

438
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,369
It's too bad you failed.

439
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,005
This wouldn't have happened

440
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,674
if you had listened to me.

441
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,276
Is this because

442
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,746
I turned down your offer the other day?

443
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,817
No way…

444
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,988
I will report this to HR.

445
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,857
That's useless.

446
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,828
Between a female employee,

447
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,696
and a branch manager,

448
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,032
who will they believe?

449
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,635
That's horrible.

450
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,107
You failed the exam
because Mr. Omae got mad

451
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,242
and didn't write a good recommendation?

452
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,713
That's so unfair.

453
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,716
But the branch manager is the one
who evaluates

454
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,251
the employees.

455
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,555
But still,

456
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,957
using his authority

457
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,327
to do what he wants with his subordinates
is unforgivable.

458
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,496
Hey,

459
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,298
Natsuko.

460
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,368
Why didn't you tell me?

461
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,470
That you were going through that.

462
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,473
Even if you had told me,

463
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,309
it might not have solved anything.

464
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,578
But…

465
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,282
I could have listened to you.

466
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,286
I could've been your support.

467
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,722
Hey.

468
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,659
We're friends, right?

469
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,229
Then why…

470
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,968
I'm sorry.

471
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,340
I couldn't tell you,

472
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,577
because you're my friend.

473
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,517
I didn't want you to know that

474
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,788
I was being sexually harassed.

475
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,441
I'm sorry I wasn't able to realize it.

477
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,058
THE WHISTLEBLOWER IS
NATSUKO NAGASHIMA OF THE KYOBASHI BRANCH

478
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,294
This email was sent to the President?

479
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,031
Yes. We have no idea who would
send such a thing.

480
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,235
It's nothing but a prank.

481
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,804
How can you be sure?

482
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,174
Oh, well…

483
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,043
Tell this Ms. Natsuko Kawashima to come to

484
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,678
headquarters tomorrow.

485
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,615
-Yes.
-I'll talk with her directly.

486
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,582
Yes.

487
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,720
Now that it's come to this,

488
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,690
we have to investigate all the facts.

489
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,661
And remove Branch Inspection
from this case.

490
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,763
What?

491
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,034
Conventional sense of justice,
and sound argument

492
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,036
can get in the way sometimes.

493
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,512
I was planning to forget everything

494
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,881
because Mr. Omae transferred to

495
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,183
headquarters in January.

496
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,989
But when I went to headquarters
for training the other day…

497
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,025
Mr. Omae, we will process this.

498
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,693
-Thank you.
-Okay.

499
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,062
Kawashima.

500
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,934
Long time no see.

501
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:10,835
Yes.

502
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:17,375
Are you planning to take the exam
for the general management position?

503
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,247
I'm probably

504
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,751
going to be in charge of the interviews.

505
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,254
I couldn't understand why someone

506
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:34,326
who treated me so badly
was being promoted.

507
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,429
I also wondered how long

508
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,365
I would have to endure that man.

509
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:46,137
Then something snapped in me,
and I couldn't take it anymore.

510
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,845
I happened to know someone from the
editing department at a publishing company

511
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,781
so I asked that person to write
the article for me.

512
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,516
I didn't accept any money.

513
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,853
I see.

514
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,491
I thought my voice would be heard

515
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,994
if it was published in an article,

516
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,597
and maybe that would move headquarters to

517
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,033
make a case out of this.

518
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,237
That's why I sent an email
to the President.

519
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,976
I wanted him to see it
before Mr. Omae covered it up.

520
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,614
But doing this would
affect you too, Natsuko…

521
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,084
I know.

522
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,288
I don't care what happens to me,

523
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,925
as long as I can punish that man.

524
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,098
I wouldn't have done this,

525
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,300
if I wasn't prepared.

526
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,483
So that's what happened.

527
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,352
Assistant General Manager Omae…

528
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,554
That's horrible.

529
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,791
What should I do?

530
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,427
Hanasaki.

531
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,997
Ms. Natsuko Kawashima has been called in.

532
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,966
-She'll be here at headquarters tomorrow.
-What?

533
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,969
General Manager Shindo says that he will
talk to her.

534
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,472
Can we sit in?

535
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,175
No, you can't.

536
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,846
We've been removed from this case.

537
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:35,780
What?

538
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,783
They decided that Mr. Shindo
and HR will handle it.

539
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,953
HR? Then…

540
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,922
Mr. Omae will be there tomorrow?

541
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,257
That's right.

542
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,926
No way.

543
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,663
But General Manager Shindo will

544
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,532
believe Ms. Kawashima
if he hears her story, right?

545
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,403
He will deal with
Mr. Omae accordingly, right?

546
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,644
-I don't know about that.
-What?

547
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,314
No matter what she says,
Omae will never admit it

548
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,915
if there's no proof.

549
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,985
He will probably use any method

550
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,088
in order to protect himself.

551
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,524
I'm sure he'll want to
protect himself from

552
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,026
falling off the promotional ladder
at all costs.

553
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,764
It all depends on who

554
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,834
Mr. Shindo chooses to believe. Right?

555
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,005
Then there's a chance that

556
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,107
Natsuko will be dismissed?

557
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,409
Yes.

558
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,762
BRANCH MANAGER OMAE

559
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,400
BRANCH MANAGER OMAE

560
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,043
Damn it.

561
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,388
You're not leaving yet?

562
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,092
I understand how you feel,

563
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,162
but there's nothing you can do.

564
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,302
But if Natsuko's the one that
ends up getting dismissed,

565
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,370
what was the point of her doing this…

566
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,545
Sexual and power harassment

567
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,182
is troublesome
because there's no way to prove it.

568
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,486
That's why the perpetrator gets bold

569
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,655
and repeats the offense.

570
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,593
You're right.

571
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,796
Repeats?

572
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,565
-Oh.
-What?

573
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,536
Mr. Soma, can I see the personnel file
on Mr. Omae that you were looking at?

574
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,670
Here.

575
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:19,043
He worked in six different branches
before going to

576
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,979
Kyobashi Branch.

577
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,013
Okay.

578
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,915
What?

579
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,387
What are you planning to do?

580
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,956
I'm going to make a list
of female employees

581
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,193
that worked under Mr. Omae
and see if they can help us out.

582
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,561
What?

583
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,498
Mr. Soma, you just said that
the perpetrator gets bold,

584
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,634
and repeats the offense.

585
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,535
I did but…

586
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,239
There must be more victims that
never spoke up.

587
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:52,543
Even if there is, there's no way
they would cooperate with us that easily.

588
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,946
I'm still going to try.

589
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,095
BRANCH MANAGER KOU OMAE

590
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,571
-Don't push yourself too hard.
-Okay.

591
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,601
THE BRANCH MANAGER COMMITTING
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS BRANCH MANAGER OMAE

592
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,297
MS. A IS MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND

593
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,470
MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND

594
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,958
I AM WRITING TO ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION

595
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,324
No replies.

596
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,094
That's to be expected.

597
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,571
Mr. Soma isn't here yet.

598
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,483
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

599
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,257
This is four years' worth of documents.

600
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,892
-Thank you.
-No problem.

601
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,997
But I'm surprised that
Branch Inspection would work this hard

602
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,899
for one employee.

603
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,301
Well…

604
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,537
if it was a little while ago

605
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,706
I wouldn't have been doing this either.

606
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,277
Thanks to
my overly passionate subordinate,

607
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,546
um… how can I say this…

608
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,383
I can't stay quiet.

609
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,652
I see.

610
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,246
Natsuko.

611
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,347
Mai.

612
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,119
I'm sorry. I tried to see if there was
anything I can do, but…

613
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,423
Thank you. Don't worry.

614
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,998
You must be Natsuko Kawashima.

615
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,466
-Yes.
-Come in.

616
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,971
You have no business here.

617
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,251
You're Natsuko Kawashima
from the Kyobashi Branch, right?

618
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,520
-Yes.
-Sit down.

619
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,804
Is it true that you are
the female employee who is

620
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,774
behind the story
published in this magazine?

621
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,853
Answer us, Kawashima.

622
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,558
Yes.

623
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,094
It was me.

624
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,601
For a long time, I had to

625
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,338
put up with sexual harassment
from my branch manager.

626
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,505
Kawashima.

627
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,909
Don't talk nonsense
in front of the General Manager.

628
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,612
By branch manager, you mean Mr. Iwaki?

629
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,881
No. The previous branch manager.

630
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,019
It was Mr. Omae sitting right there.

631
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:38,756
What?

632
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,960
What is this about, Mr. Omae?

633
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,064
That's ridiculous,
I never did such a thing.

634
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,333
She's making everything up.

635
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,637
No! I'm telling the truth!

636
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,674
Believe me.
I have never acted inappropriately

637
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,209
to a female employee.

638
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,313
General Manager Shindo, what should we do?

639
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,033
FOUR UNREAD MESSAGES

640
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,573
This is a problem.

641
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,712
One side is saying that she was
sexually harassed,

642
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,480
but the other is denying it.

643
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,988
But with this type of issue,
it's always hard to figure out

644
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,557
who's telling the truth,

645
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,360
unless there is proof.

646
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,198
But what's clear right now is that

647
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,935
Kawashima is the whistleblower who

648
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,838
provided the magazine with a story.

649
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:06,177
And that caused significant damage to

650
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,980
Tokyo Daiichi Bank's reputation.

651
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,019
Do you admit to that?

652
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,890
Yes.

653
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,096
Kawashima.

654
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:29,200
It seems like you're
a very competent employee.

655
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,605
I don't want to lose a promising employee

656
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,006
over something like this.

657
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,147
How about we

658
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,583
pretend this didn't happen?

659
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,687
Um…

660
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,289
what do you mean?

661
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,424
In other words,

662
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,895
Ms. A in this article

663
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,830
is not you,

664
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,833
and Bank T

665
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,835
is not our bank either.

666
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,642
I don't care what happens to me

667
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,511
as long as I can punish that man.

668
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,379
I wouldn't have done this

669
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,581
if I wasn't prepared.

670
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,256
You're telling me to forget everything?

671
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,360
-But…
-This can't continue.

672
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,164
Any more and you will be disgracing
all of the 30,000 people

673
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,532
working at this bank!

674
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,671
I think my suggestion

675
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:46,577
is the best way to prevent
further damage towards

676
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,612
Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

677
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,483
Do you agree?

678
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,094
Kawashima, what Mr. Shindo says is true.

679
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,566
Nothing ever happened.

680
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,235
Everything will be settled,
if you say that.

681
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,373
It's to benefit the bank.

682
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,596
That's okay, right Kawashima?

683
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,620
Please wait a minute.

684
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,991
-What are you doing?
-Wait…

685
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,492
-Get out.
-Hey…

686
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,161
Please take a look at this.

687
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,464
These are emails from

688
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,066
female employees that worked at branches

689
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,135
that Mr. Omae used to oversee.

690
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,973
"I read that article and immediately knew

691
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,844
that it was about Branch Manager Omae,

692
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,114
because he did the same thing to me
three years ago."

693
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,616
What are you saying?

694
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,018
These are all lies.

695
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:40,257
"I could not defend myself from
Branch Manager's harassment, so I quit

696
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,559
the bank a year ago.

697
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,262
He was very persistent,
so I turned him down many times,

698
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,531
but he never stopped harassing me."

699
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,832
Enough already!

700
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,603
"I couldn't stand Branch Manager Omae's
sexual harassment,

701
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,371
so I talked to the chief.

702
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,273
But the branch manager found out

703
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,909
and started abusing his authority."

704
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,879
General Manager Shindo,
I did no such thing!

705
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,447
Believe me.

706
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,483
Everyone cooperated because they wanted to

707
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,852
help out other victims,

708
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:13,123
and they wanted to punish
Assistant General Manager Omae.

709
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,124
Enough!

710
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,795
Anyone can fabricate these things!

711
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,432
Then should we contact these people?

712
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,768
What are you saying…

713
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,473
First of all, there's no way
this can be used as proof.

714
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,345
Excuse me.

715
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,480
Mr. Soma.

716
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,220
I went to Kyobashi Branch

717
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,690
and borrowed Ms. Kawashima's
personnel documents.

718
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,591
What?

719
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,097
Ever since Ms. Kawashima
was hired four years ago,

720
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,933
she has been receiving high evaluations

721
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,335
regarding her work and character.

722
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,539
"Highly valued by boss and colleagues

723
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,708
and has high administrative skills."

724
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,444
"An employee essential to our bank."

725
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,081
Mr. Omae evaluated her very highly
for two years while

726
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,783
he was a branch manager.

727
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,087
But when Ms. Kawashima took her

728
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,025
exam for
the general management position last year,

729
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,662
the letter of recommendation that
Mr. Omae wrote was

730
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,296
horrible.

731
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,933
"Behaves badly," "lacks cooperativeness,"

732
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,437
"problematic with the other sex."

733
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:39,443
Ms. Nakashima's thesis
and her interview received passing grades,

734
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:45,115
so the reason why she failed is clearly
because of this evaluation.

735
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:53,390
Mr. Omae, why did she receive
such a low evaluation score this one time?

736
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,459
It's inconsistent.

737
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,495
It's…

738
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,966
because all of those things
really happened.

739
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,436
I gave an honest assessment.

740
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,908
With all due respect…

741
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,278
isn't it because

742
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,714
you had some kind of trouble
with Ms. Kawashima?

743
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:22,352
For example, she didn't do as you asked.

744
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,923
In order to take revenge,
you gave her a low evaluation score

745
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,792
so that she would fail her exam.

746
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,565
Am I wrong?

747
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,446
Mr. Omae.

748
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,888
Natsuko is my friend.

749
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,459
Natsuko always said

750
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,695
that she enjoyed her work.

751
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,999
If she hadn't become your subordinate,

752
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,470
she would still be working with
a smile on her face.

753
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,043
Why did she have to become the target

754
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,913
of a despicable boss like you?

755
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,354
You messed up her life,

756
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,924
and I will never forgive you for that!

757
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,714
Hanasaki.

758
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,819
I will remember what happened here today.

759
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,555
Yes.

760
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,928
Thank you.

761
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,864
Mr. Omae will most likely

762
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,799
receive disciplinary action.

763
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,535
Yes.

764
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:55,572
But you will also
have to take responsibility…

765
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,041
Don't worry.

766
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,879
I'm prepared to accept any outcome.

767
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,182
I see.

768
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,018
Thanks, Mai.

769
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,223
If you hadn't come in,

770
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,427
I would have had to agree to their terms.

771
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,201
I'm so glad I have a friend I can rely on.

772
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,040
I'll be off.

773
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,354
Natsuko.

774
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:46,823
Yeah?

775
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,398
Our hot spring trip.

776
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,901
The fresh and extravagant seafood platter
and the open bath.

777
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,770
-Those are a must!
-What?

778
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:04,241
Did you forget about that?
Get it together.

779
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,542
You're the coordinator.

780
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,013
-Okay.
-Okay.

781
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,049
-See you.
-Bye.

782
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,930
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

783
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,871
You used to look fresh and young too.

784
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,508
Mr. Soma, you're here again?

785
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,043
Any complaints?

786
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,613
Mai, stop being rude
to our precious customer.

787
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,916
But I always have to make sure I look

788
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,418
presentable because my boss
can show up anytime.

789
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:52,055
Don't worry, Hanasaki.
I really don't care if you

790
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:56,126
look presentable or not.

791
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,666
-Oh, I remembered.
-What?

792
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,535
Mr. Soma, you copied me today.

793
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,636
What?

794
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,939
"With all due respect…"

795
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,844
I… I didn't copy you…

796
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,179
Everyone uses that phrase.

797
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,415
You can be honest with me.

798
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,219
I told you that I didn't copy you…
I just couldn't resist.

799
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,355
Resist? Wait, didn't you ban

800
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,357
that word from being used?

801
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,193
You're banned from using it. Not me.

802
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,229
Hanasaki.

803
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,097
Calm down, you two.

804
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,832
This is today's special.

805
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,268
-Wow!
-Thank you.

806
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,105
Thank you.

807
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,211
Delicious!

808
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,649
I'm Mai Hanasaki.

809
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,885
Maybe we're meant to be.

810
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,154
Getting illegal money from clients?

811
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,856
-I'll stop the wrongdoing.
-I don't need to cooperate.

812
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,392
That's the one that accepted the bribe.

813
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,827
What will happen to my shop?

814
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,929
You're wrong as a business manager.

815
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,031
