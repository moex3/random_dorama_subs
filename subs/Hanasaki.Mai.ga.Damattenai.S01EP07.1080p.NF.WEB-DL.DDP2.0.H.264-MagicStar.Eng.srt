1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,839
BRANCH INSPECTION

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,408
Hello, Ayana?

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,478
I know. Seven o'clock tonight, right?

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,213
Let's get together with the girls

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,582
and eat lots of delicious food.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,183
I'm excited.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,985
About that…

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,955
can I bring my boyfriend along?

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
-Sure.
<i>-Also.</i>

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,327
There's someone I want
to introduce you to.

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,830
Someone you want to introduce me to?
A guy?

12
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,833
<i>Of course! See you at seven.</i>

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,301
Ah, wait! Hey…

14
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,141
I was wondering
what your private phone call was about,

15
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,676
but it was to plan a mixer party?

16
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,179
No, it wasn't! I was just…

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,850
Well, it's about time
you got yourself a boyfriend.

18
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,919
It's not what you think.

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,356
That's right. Hanasaki.

20
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,625
Look at this.

21
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,493
What is this, Mr. Shibasaki?

22
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,830
A questionnaire
by 100 female bank employees?

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,565
Yes, and look here.

24
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,835
Most female bank employees
get married by 27 at the latest.

25
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,972
When you turn 30 years old,
men rarely ask you out anymore.

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,809
-I'm out of time.
-I told you.

27
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,546
No, no. These are just statistics.

28
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,115
So I'm fine.

29
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,486
"Women who act strong and think
that they'll be okay,

30
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,722
won't be able to find a boyfriend."
End of quote.

31
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,626
Hanasaki. You should be honest.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,097
-Please take care of this.
-Okay.

33
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,933
Hanasaki is running out of time, huh?

34
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,836
Why do I need him to tell me that?

35
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,672
Mr. Shibasaki is always out
to help people.

36
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,575
He and his wife love to play matchmaker.

37
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,443
Soon enough…

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,180
they might try to match you up
with someone.

39
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,316
Matchmaking… no…

40
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,718
I will find someone on my own.

41
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,521
Are you going to the mixer party
in that outfit?

42
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,325
Well… I thought it was going to be
a laid back dinner with girlfriends.

43
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,128
That's a little too plain
for a mixer party.

44
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,365
-You're right.
-Yeah.

45
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,268
I wore a uniform when I was a teller,

46
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,105
so I always changed into
clothes that I preferred…

47
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,974
I said it's not a mixer party!

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,810
Well, if you're really looking for
a boyfriend,

49
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,479
I think it's best to go home and change.

50
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,882
I will not change!

51
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,653
Or so I said, but…

52
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,590
I hope I don't look like I tried too hard.

53
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,960
It's all because of what Mr. Soma said.

54
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,229
Welcome.

55
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,864
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

56
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,537
Over here.

57
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,773
Oh, Ayana. Sorry to make you wait.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,342
You're late. What were you doing?

59
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,511
-I'm sorry.
-Mai.

60
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,580
You haven't met Yuuki in a while, right?

61
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,982
-Hello.
-Hello.

62
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,351
You're lovey-dovey as always.

63
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,987
-What?
-No, we're not.

64
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,089
-No, right?
-Yeah.

65
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,994
Oh, and what is this about
introducing me to someone?

66
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,331
Ever since you broke up with
your boyfriend earlier this year,

67
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,301
you haven't found anyone new,
and you've lost that spark.

68
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,703
Sorry for not having a spark.

69
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,105
I never asked you to help me find some--

70
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,409
But we found you a great person.

71
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,779
-He's Yuuki's senior.
-Yeah, he's really good looking.

72
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,781
-What?
-It'll make you wonder.

73
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,650
About where this gem was hiding
all this time.

74
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,520
A gem, huh?

75
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,756
-He's here.
-What?

76
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,030
Hello.

77
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm sorry for being late.

78
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,302
Mai, this is Mr. Tomoda.

79
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,771
Nice to meet you. I'm Kojiro Tomoda.

80
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,845
Nice to meet you, I'm Mai Hanasaki.

81
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,513
All right!

82
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,459
It's delicious.

83
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,861
Do you like it? I'm so glad.

84
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,298
-How about more wine?
-Thank you.

85
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,239
This is a lovely restaurant,
and everything is delicious.

86
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,674
It sure is.

87
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,576
This Roquefort cheese sauce

88
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,944
goes well with the meat.

89
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,780
That looks so good.

90
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,483
-I want some too.
-Sure.

91
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,685
-Thanks.
-Me too.

92
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,821
Mr. Tomoda, do you come to
these restaurants pretty often?

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,624
I come here every day.

94
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,760
You eat steak every day?

95
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,930
He looks fresh, but he's probably
the aggressive type…

96
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,567
No, Mai. This is Mr. Tomoda's restaurant.

97
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,672
What? Oh… that means he's the owner
of Tokyo Dallas?

98
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,341
Yes, he's the president.

99
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,379
I'm sorry for not saying it earlier.

100
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,748
Not at all.

101
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,453
You have more, right?

102
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,955
He has a place in Akasaka and Nakameguro.

103
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,391
I plan to keep on expanding as well.

104
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,695
-You're amazing.
-Not at all.

105
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,166
I just want a lot of people
to eat delicious steak.

106
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,100
That's all.

107
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,071
That's wonderful.

108
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,374
Excuse me, sir.

109
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,777
The Takahashi party coming in
at nine is bringing more people,

110
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,146
so there won't be enough bisque.

111
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,449
Then change the bisque to lobster

112
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,317
and add crab to it.

113
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,685
Okay, I understand.

114
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,122
-Oh, Otsuka.
-Yes.

115
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,093
Please reserve two servings of the sorbet.

116
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,160
Oh, okay.

117
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,796
The popular desserts always run out.

118
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,165
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,968
Excuse me.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,306
I'm sorry about that.

121
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,274
When training young staff members,

122
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,311
there are lots of things that can only be
taught on site.

123
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,582
Managing a business must be
a very difficult job.

124
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,052
-Ms. Mai, what do you do for work?
-Oh, I'm…

125
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,154
Mr. Tomoda, I never told you?

126
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,990
Mai works at the same place as me.
Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

127
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,659
Is that right?

128
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,362
If Ms. Mai was there,
I'd visit that bank every day.

129
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,166
Every day… oh, please!

130
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,871
Actually, I've been using
Tokyo Daiichi Bank ever since

131
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,506
I opened my first restaurant.

132
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,641
Oh, really?

133
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,943
It seems like we're meant to be.

134
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,614
Yes!

135
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm back!

136
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,088
Welcome back.

137
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,390
-Do you want dinner?
-No.

138
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,626
I'm full from eating delicious steak.

139
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,996
Where's the restaurant
with delicious steak?

140
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,330
Mr. Soma.

141
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,734
You changed!
You're even wearing pink shoes!

142
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,671
Stop eating dinner here.

143
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,107
Hey, stop interfering with my business.

144
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,075
Mr. Soma is our valued customer.

145
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,245
-Here's the shrimp dumpling.
-Thank you.

146
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,182
-Looks delicious.
-Mai, do you want some too?

147
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,083
I told you that I'm full.

148
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,020
It's delicious.

149
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,756
So how was the mixer party?

150
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,825
You went to a mixer party?

151
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,493
No, I didn't!

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,563
I can find a nice man
without going to a mixer party.

153
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,798
And how was he?

154
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:50,837
Well, he had a nice smile, and he's mature

155
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,172
but he has a boyish charm…

156
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,142
-It's none of your business.
-Okay.

157
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,580
I see. You met a nice man, huh?

158
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,581
I see.

159
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,451
Dad, you're always telling me
to find a man and get married.

160
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,353
I know that,

161
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,156
but when it's really happening…

162
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,260
Mr. Soma, raising a daughter on your own
is lonely and sad.

163
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,363
You have my sympathy.
Let me pour you a drink.

164
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,299
Thanks.

165
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,835
Dad…

166
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,072
You're kind of a pain.

167
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,710
Thank you for the meal last night.

168
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:36,349
I'd like to go eat
the delicious steak again.

169
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,452
Am I being too forward?

170
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,987
Oh no.

171
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,824
Are you okay?

172
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,394
You look really crazy,
getting excited on your own.

173
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,196
I'm not excited.

174
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,099
I'm just sending a message to say thanks.

175
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,534
It's good manners.

176
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,469
I wonder.

177
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,373
It's the phone.

178
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,976
What?

179
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,279
Swallow it.

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,016
Fine, I'll take it.

181
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,918
Hello, this is Branch Inspection.

182
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,320
What?

183
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,556
I'll send her down right away.

184
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,659
You have a guest.

185
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,460
A guest? For me?

186
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,230
Someone from Tokyo Dallas.

187
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,197
Tokyo Dallas.

188
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,969
What? Mr. Tomoda came to see me.

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,170
Hold on…

190
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,841
Wait a minute… um…

191
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:37,977
I'll be off.

192
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,917
She's definitely not okay.

193
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,475
I wonder where Mr. Tomoda is.

194
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,880
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

195
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,717
I'm from Tokyo Dallas.

196
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,285
Oh!

197
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,621
Excuse me.

198
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,190
You were at the restaurant…

199
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes, I'm Otsuka.

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,062
Oh, so you're my guest… okay…

201
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,833
You forgot this.

202
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,904
I'm so sorry. Thank you very much.

203
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,573
MAI HANASAKI

204
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,610
You came all the way here to deliver this?

205
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,978
Um…

206
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,881
there's something I want to discuss.

207
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,283
It's about our president.

208
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,386
What?

209
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,286
BRANCH INSPECTION

210
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,890
Our employee is receiving
dirty cash from a customer?

211
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,327
Yes. Apparently, someone from
the Shinagawa Branch

212
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,962
received a bribe from

213
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,730
a company called Tokyo Dallas.

214
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,867
I overheard

215
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,203
my boss talking to the banker
on the phone.

216
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,440
The loan will be approved, right?

217
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,576
That's why I gave you two million yen.

218
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,080
Yes, please make sure to take care of it.

219
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,949
I don't know who he paid the money to,

220
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,153
but I'm sure that he paid
two million yen to

221
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,988
someone at Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

222
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,825
If that's true,
that's a very serious issue.

223
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,326
Yes.

224
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,364
Mr. Otsuka, why are you telling us this?

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,501
Oh… well…

226
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,705
Are you blowing the whistle on your boss?

227
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,308
No! If my boss is

228
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,478
doing something illegal,
I want him to stop right away.

229
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,546
That's all.

230
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,952
President Tomoda hired me
when I didn't have any education

231
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,787
or experience.

232
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,224
It's not just me.

233
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,461
There are lots of employees
who are grateful to him.

234
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,596
I see.

235
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,168
Please,

236
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,870
save our restaurant.

237
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,142
-Okay!
-What?

238
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,913
We will do all we can to find the banker
who accepted the two million yen,

239
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,848
and put an end to this!

240
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,349
H… hey, Hanasaki!

241
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,818
-Right, Mr. Shibasaki?
-What?

242
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,088
Well… yeah.

243
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,258
This is a serious issue

244
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,926
for our bank.

245
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,563
-Okay, let's investigate it.
-We are?

246
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,799
Thank you very much!

247
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,305
Here we go again.

248
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,144
Why do you it?

249
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,480
-Readily accept these troublesome cases?
-Well…

250
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,017
How can we leave Mr. Otsuka
after he begged us like that?

251
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,786
-What?
-Oh!

252
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,389
That means Mr. Tomoda

253
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,125
was bribing the bank.

254
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,495
I thought I had met a nice guy

255
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,697
for the first time in a long while.

256
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,466
I see.

257
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,736
The restaurant you went to last night
was Tokyo Dallas.

258
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,538
Oh!

259
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,940
Yes.

260
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,177
I see.

261
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,114
Let's search Tokyo Dallas.

262
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,116
I see.

263
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,918
Kojiro Tomoda.

264
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,986
He's a good looking guy.

265
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,756
Stop that.

266
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,027
It's true that the Shinagawa Branch

267
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,729
approved a loan
for a company called Tokyo Dallas

268
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,032
for 50 million yen.

269
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:57,236
That means that President Tomoda
paid two million yen to someone

270
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,271
at the Shinagawa Branch to get that loan?

271
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,874
Most likely. This restaurant is

272
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,611
expanding locations in the city,
but their business was probably

273
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,048
not doing well enough to get
an approval for a loan.

274
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,251
But it's unacceptable for the bank
to accommodate

275
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,821
a loan contract by getting money.

276
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,526
Please go to the Shinagawa Branch
and secretly investigate who

277
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,760
accepted the bribe.

278
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,562
Yes, sir.

279
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,665
Good luck. I'm not liking this.

280
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,268
I have to report this to management now.

281
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,305
I never imagined

282
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,408
that I would be investigating
Tokyo Dallas.

283
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,278
You're the one that accepted this.

284
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,613
You're right.

285
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,450
But I understand that you're sad
because you went on a rare date,

286
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,919
and it ended up like this.

287
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,787
Don't say that it's rare.

288
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,157
All right, let's rest our minds
and get to work.

289
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,030
Listen Hanasaki.

290
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,966
Branch Manager Yagi at Shinagawa Branch

291
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,637
is a super elite who worked
at headquarters for a long time.

292
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,206
It's not going to be easy.

293
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,074
I'll be prepared.

294
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,510
And one more thing.

295
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,580
Don't tell me…

296
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,682
Shindo faction.

297
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,686
I knew it… It's becoming
even more troublesome.

298
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,655
Exactly.

299
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,261
SHINAGAWA BRANCH

300
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,630
BRANCH MANAGER YAGI

301
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,901
And what is Branch Inspection
doing at our branch?

302
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,937
We found some errors in some

303
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,805
of the old loan documents so we came

304
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,974
to check on them and to give guidance.

305
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,077
Branch Inspection must be very bored

306
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,447
to come all the way here for that.

307
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,182
-Right?
-Exactly.

308
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,085
We will not take much of your time.

309
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,887
Please show us some loan documents…

310
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,589
There isn't a single thing
wrong with our loans.

311
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,559
-But--
-The branch manager is being clear.

312
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,728
We don't need you here.

313
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,830
But still,

314
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,067
we cannot go back without doing anything.

315
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,768
Please cooperate.

316
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,809
First of all,
does this young female employee

317
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,011
know anything about loans?

318
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,145
No, right?

319
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,449
Um… with all due respect…

320
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,384
-Don't do it.
-What?

321
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,554
Well… since Branch Inspection
has to do their job,

322
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,023
let's have Section Chief Nanba
deal with them.

323
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,360
Yes, let's do that.

324
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,528
Please make it very quick.

325
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,800
Unlike Branch Inspection,
our branch is very busy.

326
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,068
Goodbye.

327
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,377
What a jerk.

328
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,080
I bet the one taking the bribe
is that branch manager.

329
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,316
Don't accuse him just yet.

330
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,817
But he's so suspicious.

331
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,553
"There isn't a single thing
wrong with our loans."

332
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,989
Those are the ones that are
filled with problems.

333
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,891
Listen Hanasaki.

334
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,793
Branch Manager isn't the only one

335
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,228
who has a say with loans.

336
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,399
The deputy branch manager
and section chief do too.

337
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,600
Calm down.

338
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,804
Apparently, there is a banker

339
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,374
in the Shinagawa Branch that
accepted illegal funds.

340
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,209
Shinagawa Branch…

341
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,546
-Is that where Yagi is?
-Yes.

342
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,648
If that's true…

343
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,187
it would be a big blow
to the Shinagawa Branch.

344
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,322
Yes.

345
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,626
The pair from Branch Inspection is
there right now

346
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,194
to investigate.

347
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,796
Branch Inspection?

348
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,665
You messed up her life.

349
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,500
I will never forgive you for that.

350
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,136
That little brat…

351
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,807
She better not do anything unnecessary.

352
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,341
Yes.

353
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,015
These are
all the specified loan documents.

354
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,551
-Thank you for your cooperation.
-Thank you.

355
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,688
Um…

356
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,625
Is there a problem with a company
in one of these files?

357
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,793
No, not at all.

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,763
We're just doing a quick check.

359
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,598
Yes, a quick check.

360
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,167
I see.

361
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,202
FINANCE DEPARTMENT SECTION CHIEF - NANBA

362
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,571
Then, I'll be leaving.

363
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,450
He seemed very concerned.

364
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,087
That section chief is
definitely suspicious too.

365
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,196
-Here it is. Tokyo Dallas.
-Thanks.

366
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,867
Now, let's take a close look at this.

367
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,035
Okay.

368
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,472
But you know…

369
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,210
that restaurant seemed like
it was doing really well.

370
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,012
I wonder if they couldn't

371
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,349
get a loan without paying a bribe…

372
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,184
Mr. Tomoda too…

373
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,287
I thought he was a great guy.

374
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,523
Looks can be deceiving, huh.

375
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,992
You just have bad taste in men.

376
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,460
Why are you replying?

377
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,328
Just ignore me and carry on.

378
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,803
What are those branch inspectors
investigating?

379
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,139
According to Mr. Nanba,

380
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,377
they are checking close to
50 random loan documents.

381
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,445
What?

382
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,983
I'll ask Section Chief Nanba to keep
a close eye on them.

383
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,052
Please do that.

384
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,760
This is strange.

385
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,563
Did you find anything suspicious?

386
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,800
No, it's strange
because there isn't anything suspicious.

387
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,101
What?

388
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,004
Tokyo Dallas isn't performing that badly.

389
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,342
Their business was down at one point,
but they recovered last summer.

390
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,845
-They even came out of the red.
-You're right.

391
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,080
Then…

392
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:19,418
A 50-million-yen loan wouldn't
have been unreasonable.

393
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,655
Then there's no reason for him
to bribe the bank.

394
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,290
Exactly.

395
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,460
What does this mean?

396
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,731
This is great timing.

397
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,536
-I felt like eating meat today.
-What?

398
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,173
Let's go meet President Tomoda.

399
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,474
Tokyo Dallas.

400
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,611
-We're going there?
-Yeah.

401
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,081
Let's eat meat.

402
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,585
Wow, it's a nice restaurant.

403
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,687
It's fancy.

404
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,891
-It's so awkward.
-What?

405
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,728
To come here when I'm suspicious
of Mr. Tomoda.

406
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,306
Wow.

407
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,277
Steak from Tokyo Dallas is
really popular right now.

408
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,781
Oh, they use the Musashi Japanese beef.

409
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,183
This is going to be good.

410
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,854
Eating steak two days in a row is…

411
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,188
You don't have to eat it.

412
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,423
I'll eat it.

413
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,960
Are you ready to order?

414
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,196
I'll have the…

415
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,632
I ate this yesterday,
but I'll order it again.

416
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,535
The Dallas Special with
the premium Musashi Japanese beef.

417
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,305
I'll do the Dallas Special too.

418
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,205
What?

419
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,909
-Two Dallas Specials?
-Wait… hold on.

420
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,545
Hanasaki, you can't order this.

421
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,181
It costs 15,000 yen.

422
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,550
Who cares, let's just order it.

423
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,951
Two Dallas Specials.

424
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,487
-Okay.
-Thanks.

425
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,959
I wonder if I can expense this.

426
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,529
If I can't, it'll be out of pocket.

427
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,631
Thank you for treating me.

428
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,733
Ms. Mai. Welcome back.

429
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,168
Thank you.

430
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,771
I'm glad to see you here
two days in a row.

431
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,872
Good evening.

432
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,809
-This is?
-Oh,

433
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,011
my name is Soma.

434
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,347
I heard our Hanasaki came here yesterday.

435
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,715
Our?

436
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,216
He's my boss.

437
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,885
Oh, at the bank?

438
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,287
I see.

439
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,422
Please have a seat.

440
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,824
Thank you.

441
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,626
This is a great restaurant.

442
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,628
It seems like you're busy too.

443
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,130
Yes, thankfully.

444
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,966
-Business seems to be doing well too.
-Yes.

445
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,936
Oh? How do you know that?

446
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,373
We work in Branch Inspection,
and we're visiting

447
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,675
the Shinagawa Branch right now.

448
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,111
We're inspecting the loan documents.

449
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,646
Loans?

450
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,416
I'm sorry I never mentioned this before.

451
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,185
Branch Inspection visits various branches

452
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,488
and checks for any problems.

453
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,290
Oh… I see.

454
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,060
Um…

455
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,431
What exactly do you investigate
about the loans?

456
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,267
What we investigate?

457
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,970
In short, we check to make sure there
are no problems

458
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,305
with details regarding the loans.

459
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,374
I see…

460
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,211
I'll be heading back to work,

461
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,880
so, please enjoy.

462
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,609
Delicious.

463
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,246
You're such an opportunist.

464
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,316
You were saying that you
didn't want steak two days in a row.

465
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,285
What's delicious is delicious.

466
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,187
But…

467
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,424
Mr. Tomoda is suspicious after all.

468
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,895
He clearly became wary
when we talked about the loan.

469
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,932
It means that he has something to hide.

470
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,468
I knew it.

471
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,938
Mr. Tomoda is handing money to the bank.

472
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,172
Now,

473
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,043
we have to figure out who
accepted two million yen from him.

474
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,478
Yes.

475
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,782
Branch Manager Yagi,
Deputy Branch Manager Wakamura,

476
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,484
Section Chief Nanba.

477
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,552
Let's investigate those three.

478
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,758
TAKESHI NANBA

479
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,428
We checked their accounts,

480
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,332
but they didn't have any transfers
from Tokyo Dallas.

481
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,734
A banker wouldn't leave any

482
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,239
traces behind when they accept bribes.

483
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,274
You're right.

484
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,613
I checked the account
used by Tokyo Dallas,

485
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,650
but they didn't transfer anything
to those three either.

486
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,951
I bet.

487
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,222
There would be no trace
if he paid in cash.

488
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,361
There's nothing we can do.

489
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,733
What? Two million…

490
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,569
What is it, Hanasaki?

491
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,606
Two million yen was transferred
as a payment in October.

492
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,943
If it says payment, we don't know
what it was used for.

493
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,414
-Mr. Soma, please take a look at this.
-What?

494
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,951
There's an 840-yen service fee
charged on the same day.

495
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,153
Service fee?

496
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,290
840 yen is the service fee
when using a check.

497
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,192
I see.

498
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,596
President Tomoda paid the bribe
to Shinagawa Branch.

499
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,098
-But he used a check.
-Yes.

500
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,769
If he uses a check,
it will only be marked as a payment

501
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,938
on Tokyo Dallas' account.

502
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,908
The person receiving it can
easily cash that at any bank.

503
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,878
It's perfect for a bribe.

504
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,614
But unfortunately,

505
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,683
we can't track it.

506
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,991
-Ah!
-What is it now?

507
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,027
Cashed checks,

508
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,863
always come back to the branch
they were issued from.

509
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,031
Yeah.

510
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,568
The check should have

511
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,670
a signature of the person who cashed it.

512
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,239
-That's who took the bribe.
-Yes.

513
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,844
Which bank did Tokyo Dallas use
to issue the check?

514
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,946
Branch number 194.

515
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,083
MEGURO BRANCH

516
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,218
-It's Meguro Branch.
-Good job.

517
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,723
MEGURO BRANCH

518
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,491
Here it is.

519
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,526
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

520
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,549
-Here it is.
-Let's see.

521
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,321
Ryoji Wakamura.

522
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,357
Deputy Branch Manager Wakamura.

523
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,595
So it was him?

524
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,064
I didn't expect it to be him.

525
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,333
I thought it was Branch Manager Yagi.

526
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:53,071
But Branch Manager Yagi came
from headquarters to the branch

527
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,806
for the first time in ten years.

528
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,711
So Deputy Manager Wakamura was probably
running the Shinagawa Branch.

529
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,281
It's unacceptable for him to
fill his own pockets with

530
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,883
dirty cash.

531
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,852
-Let's go, Mr. Soma.
-Yeah.

532
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,689
What are you saying?

533
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,490
I did not receive any money!

534
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,393
Are you going to play innocent?

535
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,697
It's unacceptable for a banker to
receive illegal funds

536
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,165
from a customer.

537
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,434
Where's the proof?

538
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,535
Hanasaki.

539
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,506
This

540
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,043
is a check issued by Tokyo Dallas
for two million yen.

541
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,214
Isn't this your signature?

542
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,449
That's…

543
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,685
This is proof that you received

544
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,021
a two-million-yen bribe from Tokyo Dallas.

545
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,925
You're wrong! I…

546
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,461
I…

547
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:55,033
I personally lent some money to
Mr. Tomoda, so he paid me back

548
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,068
with that check.

549
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,570
What…

550
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,341
The business at Tokyo Dallas
is going really well,

551
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,243
so we can expect a lot from them.

552
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,180
If the loan was processed correctly,
there's no problem, right?

553
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,487
Listen.
There are no problems with the loan

554
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,222
for Tokyo Dallas.

555
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,657
Now, go away.

556
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,232
-Wait Hanasaki…
-But Mr. Soma!

557
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,667
What Deputy Manager Wakamura says is true.

558
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,804
Tokyo Dallas is performing well,

559
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,573
so they shouldn't have problems
getting a loan.

560
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,309
Which means we can't prove that

561
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,845
this two million yen was used to

562
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,614
approve their loan.

563
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,986
Unless we figure out what this

564
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,655
money was paid for,

565
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,691
we can't question
Deputy Manager Wakamura any further.

566
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:57,662
But how can we figure that out?

567
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,066
I'll go

568
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,335
talk to Mr. Otsuka one more time.

569
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,105
There might be something
he hasn't told us yet.

570
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,073
Yeah.

571
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,077
Then I'll go to this place.

572
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,816
You're trying another gourmet spot
at a time like this?

573
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,983
Look.

574
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,891
A steakhouse established by
Hidehiko Akiyama, who used to work at

575
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,460
the popular restaurant Tokyo Dallas.

576
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,464
Apparently, Chef Akiyama quit and left
after a fight with President Tomoda.

577
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,434
He might know something, right?

578
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,106
-I see.
-I'm sorry.

579
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,011
We thought we had him…

580
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,847
We were so close.

581
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,153
Um…

582
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,423
do you have any idea as to why
President Tomoda

583
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,425
gave two million yen

584
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,794
to the bank?

585
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,695
What?

586
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,365
There has to be
some kind of a reason behind it.

587
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,170
No… I don't know anything.

588
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,174
I see.

589
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,783
PRIME JAPANESE BLACK SIRLOIN

590
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,453
Sounds delicious.

591
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,229
It's delicious!

592
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,565
Thank you.

593
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,302
I'm actually eating steak
two days in a row.

594
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,537
-You must like it.
-Well…

595
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm…

596
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,676
Soma from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

597
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,646
Mr. Akiyama,

598
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,815
you used to be in a restaurant called
Tokyo Dallas, right?

599
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:58,716
Yes.

600
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,320
May I ask few questions about
President Tomoda?

601
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,455
Why?

602
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,893
Well, an employee at Tokyo Dallas
named Mr. Otsuka

603
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,296
is really worried about Mr. Tomoda,

604
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,997
so we've been lending our ears.

605
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,066
Otsuka is?

606
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,735
I see.

607
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,506
Tomoda and I

608
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:27,378
started with a restaurant
as small as this one here.

609
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,048
We took low-cost meat…

610
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,215
This is good!

611
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,318
…and cooked it the best possible way.

612
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,787
It might be better if it's rare…

613
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,822
We experimented every day,

614
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,525
learning by trial and error.

615
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,161
Tomoda was savvy with business,

616
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,230
so our business grew bigger.

617
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,902
But you left after a fight
with Mr. Tomoda, right?

618
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,005
No, it was just a difference of opinion.

619
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,343
He was intent on expanding the locations,

620
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,045
but I couldn't keep up with that plan.

621
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,247
I see.

622
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,784
I have nothing against Tomoda.

623
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,154
He has always been a diligent worker

624
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,957
and he's honest.

625
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,761
That's enough.

626
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,163
Please stop the investigation.

627
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,064
What?

628
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,967
I've been thinking…

629
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,106
whether telling you
was the right thing to do.

630
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,742
I feel like

631
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,311
what I did was an act of betrayal.

632
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,614
That's not true.

633
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,752
Mr. Otsuka, you really wanted to
help that restaurant, right?

634
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,287
I think that's commendable.

635
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,656
No, I…

636
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,025
Papa!

637
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,762
Hey…

638
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,499
He's so cute.

639
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:59,337
-How old is your son?
-He's almost four.

640
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,305
I want to

641
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,209
become a reliable chef,
for the sake of my son.

642
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,380
I shouldn't continue on like this.

643
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,652
It has to be a job that my family
will be proud of.

644
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,554
What?

645
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,058
It's nothing.

646
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,626
I'll be going.

647
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,597
Come here, Keita.

648
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,865
All right!

649
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,741
So you didn't find anything either?

650
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,675
Yeah.

651
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,813
But there's something strange
about Tokyo Dallas for sure.

652
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,216
-What is?
-Listen.

653
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,419
Usually, if the main chef leaves
while your business

654
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,921
is in a slump,

655
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,190
the business will get even worse, right?

656
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,659
-Yeah.
-Not with Tokyo Dallas.

657
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,895
Their business went up after

658
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,963
Mr. Akiyama left.

659
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,333
It's so strange.

660
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,736
So that means something must have

661
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,573
happened after Mr. Akiyama left.

662
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,574
Yeah.

663
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,612
There's something that bothers me too.

664
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,780
What is it?

665
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,783
Mr. Otsuka said,

666
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,353
"It has to be a job that my family
will be proud of."

667
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,423
Is there something that bothers
his conscience?

668
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,559
I don't know…

669
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,294
Here are the shrimp dumplings.

670
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,465
-Here it is.
-Thanks.

671
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,071
How is it? Is it good?

672
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,573
Yeah. Of course your shrimp dumplings
are good.

673
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,145
To tell you the truth, the price for
Shiba shrimp went up

674
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,681
but I didn't want to raise the cost
of the dishes,

675
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,985
so I changed the shrimp
to a more inexpensive one.

676
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,953
Is that right?

677
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,958
-It's delicious as always.
-I'm glad to hear that.

678
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,895
I come up with ways to maintain
the quality even when using

679
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,296
low cost ingredients.

680
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,135
Don't worry, it's still delicious
even with a different ingredient.

681
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,139
Ah!

682
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,577
-What is it?
-You scared me with your loud voice.

683
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,945
Mr. Soma.

684
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,915
I think I solved the mystery.

685
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:25,883
What?

686
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,554
SHINAGAWA BRANCH

687
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,689
Come in.

688
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,761
Excuse me.

689
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,131
What are you guys doing here?

690
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,803
Mr. Yagi, I came here to ask
for your cooperation

691
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,242
regarding the issue with Tokyo Dallas
and Mr. Wakamura.

692
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,344
What?

693
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,150
What are you saying?
You will not have our cooperation.

694
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,786
That's not acceptable.

695
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,591
Mr. Wakamura, you will have to
answer everything truthfully.

696
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,392
-Shut up.
-No, I won't.

697
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,862
What?

698
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,170
President.

699
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:21,672
What is it?

700
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,643
There's… something I want to
talk to you about.

701
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,081
Sorry, maybe a little later.

702
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,284
Hello.

703
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:35,987
Ms. Mai.

704
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:37,989
What?

705
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,124
What do you mean?

706
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,293
I'm sorry to bother you
right before dinner hours.

707
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,227
We're sorry.

708
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,461
What is it?

709
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,864
What is this about the loans?

710
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,733
We have no reason to be told by the bank--

711
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,768
Mr. Tomoda.

712
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,605
You paid two million yen of dirty money

713
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,373
to Deputy Manager Wakamura.

714
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,109
What are you saying?

715
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,513
That was money that I had personally
borrowed from Mr. Wakamura.

716
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,982
Did Mr. Wakamura call you

717
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,217
so that your stories would match up?

718
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,254
That's ridiculous.

719
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,290
Why would I have to pay him dirty money?

720
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,225
Why would you?

721
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,495
Good question.

722
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,701
Business at Tokyo Dallas is doing well.

723
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,036
You should be able to get a loan without

724
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,172
bribing the bank.

725
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,776
So why did you pay two million yen?

726
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,181
Mr. Tomoda, you said that

727
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,050
business at Tokyo Dallas is doing well,

728
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,319
but in fact that was

729
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,154
a lie, right?

730
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,527
You failed at expanding
restaurant locations,

731
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,529
so the business at Tokyo Dallas

732
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,833
started going down two years ago.

733
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,137
But all of a sudden,
business started to recover

734
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,206
from a certain point in time.

735
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,008
What happened?

736
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,382
We did a thorough investigation
of your restaurant.

737
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,887
And we noticed something strange.

738
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,192
The buying price of the beef went down,

739
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,062
but there were no changes

740
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,231
to the prices on the menu.

741
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,233
What does this mean?

742
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,104
The change in the buying price

743
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,441
and business recovery all happened
last summer.

744
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,176
At the same time.

745
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,448
Mr. Tomoda,

746
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,950
you came up with a solution to recover

747
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,352
your business performance.

748
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,588
A solution that someone in

749
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,358
the restaurant business should never
resort to.

750
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,361
Food fraud.

751
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,302
The Dallas Special.

752
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,904
That's not

753
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,940
Musashi Japanese beef, right?

754
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,913
We went to your supplier,

755
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,749
Kitamoto Seiniku, for information.

756
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,683
DELIVERY STATEMENT

757
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,121
We checked all of the delivery statements.

758
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,624
There was no record

759
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,828
of Musashi Japanese beef being delivered
to Tokyo Dallas

760
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,062
this past year.

761
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,166
Using low-cost ingredients
in order to raise profit

762
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,735
is natural for a business.

763
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,038
But selling low-cost meat

764
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,107
as a brand-name meat is called

765
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,343
food fraud and that is clearly

766
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,644
a rule violation.

767
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,615
Mr. Wakamura

768
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,919
noticed that fraud when he was
considering the loan approval.

769
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,388
That two million yen

770
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:35,326
was not a bribe to receive a loan
from the bank,

771
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,230
but it was to have him turn a blind eye
regarding the food fraud.

772
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,998
It was hush money.

773
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,267
That's…

774
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,303
Deputy Branch Manager Wakamura
admitted to everything.

775
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,081
He will receive strict

776
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,517
disciplinary action from the bank.

777
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,186
Wait a minute.

778
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,356
Then what about the loan?

779
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,527
Will it get cancelled?

780
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,495
Most likely.

781
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,665
Then what will happen to my restaurant?

782
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,435
Isn't it natural for a business owner to

783
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,604
prevent their business from collapsing?

784
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,874
I only tried to…

785
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,743
protect my employees!

786
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,345
What's wrong with that?

787
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,852
With all due respect…

788
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,522
did you really think that you could
protect everything

789
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,924
by using fraud?

790
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,828
Because you chose to cheat
by using food fraud,

791
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,798
this restaurant is now in a pinch,

792
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,200
with only a slim chance of survival.

793
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:52,903
Mr. Tomoda.

794
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,973
You did wrong as a business owner.

795
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,615
I'm

796
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,451
finished.

797
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,728
I don't think you're finished yet.

798
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:20,998
Mr. Tomoda.

799
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,902
The person who came to us for help,

800
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,804
is Mr. Otsuka.

801
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,739
Otsuka?

802
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,110
He betrayed me?

803
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,478
You're wrong.

804
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,948
He didn't say a single word
about food fraud.

805
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,053
It must have pained Mr. Otsuka
when he found out about

806
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,121
the food fraud.

807
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,559
But if the bank started investigating
the loan,

808
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,895
it might move you to stop the food fraud.

809
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,831
That was his plan.

810
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,001
He was saying

811
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,436
that he's so grateful to you,

812
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,209
and that's why he wants
to save this restaurant.

813
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,613
No way…

814
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,484
Mr. Otsuka has so much faith in you.

815
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,689
Will you leave him hopeless,
and without a job?

816
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,160
It's not just Mr. Otsuka.

817
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,830
Every single person who works here

818
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,433
has precious family

819
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,935
and their livelihood.

820
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,118
President.

821
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,428
Otsuka.

822
00:44:59,096 --> 00:44:59,930
Everyone…

823
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,200
Boss…

824
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,237
let's start all over again.

825
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,778
We are all ready to

826
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,246
follow you.

827
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,230
I'm sorry.

828
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,368
I'm sorry.

829
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,045
I promise.

830
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,551
I'll start all over again.

831
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,488
I promise…

832
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,123
I promise.

833
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,733
We can

834
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,069
trust him, right?

835
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,373
Yeah.

836
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,785
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

837
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:31,288
-Good work, both of you.
-Thank you.

838
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,890
Thanks.

839
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,060
I reported to the top about
Deputy Branch Manager Wakamura.

840
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,763
And about Tokyo Dallas too.

841
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,801
I wonder what will happen to Tokyo Dallas?

842
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:48,806
I think they'll have to
close down their business.

843
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,607
You're right.

844
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,510
But if he's really determined,

845
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,912
he can rebuild it.

846
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,914
Yes.

847
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,852
This is delicious.

848
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,954
When you make something delicious,

849
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,889
the customer smiles,

850
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,891
and thanks you for the food.

851
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,695
He'll be fine as long as
he doesn't forget that feeling.

852
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,330
Okay.

853
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,834
I have a new dish.

854
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,602
-What?
-A new dish?

855
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,671
We won't expand our location,

856
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,072
but we have new dishes.

857
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,675
I see. I want to try it.

858
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,376
Here it is.

859
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,614
Hanasaki style Japanese beef
grilled with miso and pepper.

860
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,216
Steak?

861
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,518
You don't like it?

862
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,254
It's not that I don't like it.

863
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,089
Try to place yourself in our shoes.

864
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,391
But it looks delicious.

865
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,093
-I'll try it.
-You're eating it?

866
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,595
Yeah.

867
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,063
Then I will too.

868
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,233
Delicious!

869
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,970
It's so good.

870
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,105
Right?

871
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,808
This goes well with sake.
Let's have a drink.

872
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,276
Thanks.

873
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,811
Can you make some more?

874
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,880
-Two more?
-Sounds good.

875
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,817
As for the incident
at the Shinagawa Branch…

876
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,187
The person accepting the bribe
from a customer,

877
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,190
was Deputy Branch Manager Wakamura.

878
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,426
I see.

879
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:21,665
I can't believe a deputy branch manager

880
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,401
took part in fraud.

881
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,337
He needs to be punished.

882
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,707
Yes! But…

883
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,877
I believe Branch Manager Yagi will also

884
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,880
have to take responsibility.

885
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,350
All because of a foolish subordinate

886
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,219
who doesn't know his place.

887
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,692
It's extremely unfair that the future
of someone capable is threatened

888
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,061
because of this.

889
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,363
Yes.

890
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,401
In order to pull together the people
within our company,

891
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,070
I'll need to push forward

892
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,539
with my reform.

893
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,311
Even if I have to do so in a rough manner.

894
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,147
At any rate,

895
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,350
what an eyesore.

896
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,354
Those two in Branch Inspection.

897
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,791
BRANCH INSPECTION

898
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,661
I have indigestion.

899
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,864
Just as I thought,
eating steak for three days in a row…

900
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,401
-It made me sick.
-Really? You couldn't handle that?

901
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,603
How weak.

902
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,807
-Mr. Soma, you're okay?
-Perfect.

903
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,876
You're a foodie, after all.

904
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,278
You have a strong stomach.

905
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,981
-Oh.
-What?

906
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,384
Mr. Soma, your stomach is starting
to stick out.

907
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,654
What? I'm completely fine.

908
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,290
Please watch your diet.

909
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,792
People your age usually gain weight.

910
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,494
Then Mr. Shibasa--

911
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,363
Who are you calling fat?

912
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,933
Mr. Shibasaki…
no, that's not what we meant.

913
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,937
-Whoa.
-Hanasaki, speaking of age…

914
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,872
My wife wanted me to show you this.

915
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,475
Wait, is this…

916
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,477
It's your matchmaking partner.

917
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,013
He's an elite that
graduated from Tokyo University.

918
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,048
I think he's a good match.

919
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,751
I'm not thinking about marriage right now.

920
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,519
At least take a look at it.

921
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,554
No thank you.

922
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,157
Thank you.
All right, let's write the report.

923
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,260
-Are you sure?
-Look.

924
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,630
-Wow. He's pretty good looking.
-Right?

925
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,965
He'll be a hard worker.

926
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,101
He'll make lots of money.
Definitely a billion a year.

927
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,469
Can I…

928
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,807
take a little look?

929
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,675
You said you won't look.

930
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:49,479
I want to look at it now.
Isn't that an improvement?

931
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,214
-No.
-Wait.

932
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,917
-Why?
-Stop being immature.

933
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,620
Matchmaking?

934
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,322
-Keihin Bank collapsed!
-Collapsed?

935
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,524
What about my money?

936
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,126
It's precious money that supported
Ms. Shizue.

937
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,795
It's her fault for being conned.

938
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,163
I'm so sorry.

939
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,932
I will never forgive you.

940
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,101
