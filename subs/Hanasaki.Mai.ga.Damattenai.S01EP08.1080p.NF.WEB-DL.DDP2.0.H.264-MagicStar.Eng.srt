1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,376
Nice to meet you. I'm Teruo Akimoto.

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,644
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,413
I'm Mai Hanasaki.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,982
Ms. Hanasaki, what's your hobby?

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,984
My hobby?

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,023
I guess it's reading and travelling.

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,891
I see.

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,793
I love travelling too.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,862
I see.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,433
Ms. Hanasaki,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,002
don't you have any questions for him?

12
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,438
Me? Well…

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,540
not really…

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,344
That's not good.
You can't get to know him like that.

15
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:49,149
Women have to be
more proactive these days.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,719
Wait. Hold on a second. It's almost as if

17
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,654
you're setting me up with him.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,823
-What? You didn't know?
-It is?

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,792
-What? It's not?
-Wait…

20
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,495
I only came because Ms. Shizue
invited me for tea… what?

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,497
What? She told me

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,633
that she wants to introduce me to someone.

23
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,536
Ms. Shizue…

24
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,173
Who cares about how we got here.

25
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,876
I've always wanted to introduce you two
to each other.

26
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,213
You two look very good together,
just like I imagined.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,982
But it's so sudden…

28
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,785
Y… yeah, you're making her uncomfortable.

29
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,321
Mr. Akimoto

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,224
is a businessman at Keihin Bank

31
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,726
and he's helped me out a lot.

32
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,396
-Oh, you're a banker?
-Yes.

33
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,798
I told you about
Ms. Hanasaki before, right?

34
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,401
When I was living in Akasaka,

35
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,939
she was the cutest and most competent
banker in Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

36
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,342
Oh, please don't say that…
Was that past tense?

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,778
-Oh…
-I contacted her recently.

38
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,949
She said that she's not married yet
so I knew I had to help her.

39
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,585
Both of you are bankers,

40
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,386
so you must get along.

41
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,723
No, unlike Tokyo Daiichi Bank, our bank is

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,358
just a small local one.

43
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,628
But I like local banks
that work closely with the region,

44
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,464
because they get things done very quickly.

45
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,333
-Really?
-Yes.

46
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,101
That makes me happy.

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,072
Mr. Akimoto is so nice and kind.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,808
-Welcome.
-Hello.

49
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,278
Every time he would come,
he would change my lightbulbs

50
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,413
and carry heavy items for me.

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,483
He's like a real grandson to me.

52
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,652
I see.

53
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,290
But apparently, he doesn't have
good results as a banker.

54
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,626
-That's why I'm worried.
-Oh.

55
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,161
No need to mention that.

56
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,433
Ms. Hanasaki was a lovely teller.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,837
I secretly took two number tickets

58
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,806
because I wanted to go to
Ms. Hanasaki's window.

59
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,775
-Really?
-Yeah.

60
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,077
-Ms. Sekiguchi.
-Yes.

61
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,246
Thank you for waiting.

62
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,248
She was still a rookie,

63
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,817
but she was a fast worker,
and very detailed.

64
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,321
And above all, she had a very nice smile.

65
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,823
I know for sure

66
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,693
that Ms. Hanasaki will make a great wife.

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,629
Oh stop it, Ms. Shizue.

68
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:22,268
Oh man, I had to pay for
another wedding gift.

69
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,071
It's already been… three times this year.

70
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,240
I need a break.

71
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,578
But the bride was pretty cute.

72
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,213
What are you saying?

73
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,548
You're partnered with a young lady, right?

74
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,252
-I'm so jealous.
-Hold on. I told you before.

75
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,854
She is not a lady.

76
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,091
You should see her face when she gets mad.

77
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,193
-Really?
-Yeah, she won't be doing it.

78
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,028
Getting married anytime soon.

79
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,266
Hey, you want to get some coffee?

80
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,035
Apparently, this café has
an amazing chocolate cake.

81
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,905
Ch… chocolate… oh…

82
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,975
No, I can't.
My wife will be mad, so I'll go home.

83
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,244
-See you later.
-Bye.

84
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,483
Hanasaki…

85
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm 26 years old.

86
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,523
Oh? Is she being set up with someone?

87
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,893
How old are you, Mr. Akimoto?

88
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,962
-I'm two years older than you.
-This way.

89
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,632
-Coffee and chocolate cake, please.
-That's perfect.

90
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,368
-Okay.
-Two years older is perfect.

91
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,737
I thought we were about the same age.

92
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,613
I can't hear anything.

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,914
Sir…

94
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,850
is something the matter?

95
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,421
Oh, I was looking for some napkins.

96
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,589
-Mr. Soma.
-Oh!

97
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,660
What are you doing here?

98
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,933
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,069
I was so surprised,

100
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,072
to see you being set up with someone.

101
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,341
Like I said, I was not being set up.

102
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,476
I was invited by Ms. Shizue

103
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,945
to have tea together.

104
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,882
By the way, why do you have to
come here on your day off?

105
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:20,586
She's so brave to set you up with someone.

106
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,056
Are you listening to me?

107
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,758
Is she your relative?

108
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,060
Ms. Shizue

109
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,395
was a customer when I worked in Akasaka.

110
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,296
What?

111
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,765
I met her when I first

112
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,301
started the job
and we've been friends since.

113
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,671
So…

114
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,106
who was the other guy?

115
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,042
His name is Akimoto

116
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,845
and he works in Public Relations
at Keihin Bank.

117
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,947
Like I said, we were not set up.

118
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,650
Ms. Shizue really likes Mr. Akimoto

119
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,653
so she tried to set me up with him.
That's all.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,688
Hey Mai, you were set up?

121
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,757
You met him? You didn't tell me that.

122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,858
No, I didn't.

123
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,127
Mr. Soma, please keep your mouth shut.

124
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,663
I'm not saying
that you shouldn't see anyone.

125
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,099
But you just have to tell me these things.

126
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,402
-It seems like he's a banker.
-What? Really?

127
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,803
Then you have my support.

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
A banker's wife is your dream.

129
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,275
That was never my dream!

130
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,643
-Good luck!
-Mai.

131
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,845
-Good luck!
-Mai.

132
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,912
-Good luck!
-Hooray.

133
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,315
-Good luck!
-Good luck, Mai!

134
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,319
MAY 30TH
FRIDAY

135
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,156
Today's inspection is done!

136
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,826
It was another busy week.

137
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,329
-Yeah.
-I feel like it.

138
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,598
Like I've gotten used to this job.

139
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,066
Yeah. You did well.

140
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,603
You didn't get mad all week either.

141
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,405
All right.

142
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,141
I'll be reading <i>Kaido wo Yuku</i>
this weekend.

143
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,777
What? You have no plans this weekend?

144
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,445
Not really.

145
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,081
What happened to that guy
you were set up with?

146
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,983
I haven't contacted him.

147
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,551
What are you doing?

148
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,254
You're young and hip, so go have some fun.

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,356
Young and hip?

150
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,993
This is why I can't be with old men.

151
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,028
Yes, I'm old. So what?

152
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,467
We're in trouble!

153
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,802
BRANCH INSPECTION

154
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,969
We're in trouble!

155
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,237
What?

156
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,205
They're not here.

157
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,842
Soon you'll be an old lady.

158
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,544
You'll be even older then.

159
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,315
-You little…
-What's the matter, Mr. Shibasaki?

160
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,550
We're in trouble!

161
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,053
The guy you were set up with
worked at Keihin Bank, right?

162
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,890
Yes… wait, how do you know that…
Mr. Soma, you told him?

163
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,293
-Why would I tell him?
-Then how does he know?

164
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,428
Who cares about that?

165
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,863
It collapsed.

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,632
-A lapse?
-No, collapsed. Here!

167
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,067
What?

168
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,339
Keihin Bank collapsed!

169
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,074
Collapsed?

170
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,476
KEIHIN BANK COLLAPSES
AFFECTING OVER 3 MILLION PEOPLE

171
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,216
<i>Keihin Bank has collapsed.</i>

172
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,053
<i>They officially filed for bankruptcy</i>
<i>with the Financial Services Agency.</i>

173
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,156
<i>According to the conference held</i>
<i>by the Minister of Finance,</i>

174
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,691
<i>Keihin Bank's debt is</i>

175
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,126
<i>estimated to be over 150 billion yen.</i>

176
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,930
<i>Keihin Bank is a local bank with branches</i>
<i>around Tokyo and Kanagawa,</i>

177
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,533
<i>and this collapse is predicted to affect</i>

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,001
<i>over three million people.</i>

179
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,403
Keihin Bank's management

180
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,006
was technically running on debt.

181
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,344
I hear their subsidiary companies were
all in the red too.

182
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,112
That doesn't sound good.

183
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,085
Well, collapse

184
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:43,155
is unheard of for a large bank like ours--

185
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,624
You're naïve.

186
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,462
A small leak will sink a great ship.

187
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,498
Sink… a ship?

188
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,001
A little negligence

189
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,136
will lead to great collapse.

190
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,171
Yes!

191
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,613
-Kodama…
-Yes, sir.

192
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,284
Always be on alert.

193
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,487
You, yourself,

194
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,658
never know when and where

195
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,398
danger may strike you.

196
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,268
Yes, sir.

197
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,040
Collapsed, huh?

198
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,077
It means they are bankrupt, right?

199
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,745
Yeah,

200
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,815
but it's not the same as
a regular company's bankruptcy.

201
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:47,486
Yeah, because banks handle
customers' money.

202
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,189
Is our bank safe?

203
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,025
I'm sure it is,

204
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,094
but it could happen to anyone.

205
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,197
Is your future boyfriend all right?

206
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,533
Yeah, I was just thinking about that…

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,469
He's not my future boyfriend.

208
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,910
Hello. Ms. Shizue?

209
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,246
Ms. Hanasaki, I'm sorry it's so sudden

210
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,415
but can we meet and talk?

211
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,017
Are you okay?

212
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,920
I need your advice on something.

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,622
Advice?

214
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,056
KEIHIN BANK COLLAPSES
AFFECTING OVER 3 MILLION PEOPLE

215
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,529
I understand. I'll visit your house
tomorrow, Ms. Shizue.

216
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,497
Okay.

217
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,454
KUGAHARA

218
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,822
SHIZUE SEKIGUCHI

219
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,990
Welcome.

220
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,826
-Come in.
-Ms. Shizue, this is for you.

221
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,763
It's <i>nerikiri</i> from Shinanoya in Akasaka.

222
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,333
-You remembered that I like this?
-Yes.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,703
My late husband loved this too.

224
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,172
I gave him this to put him in a good mood.

225
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,273
I see.

226
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,776
Ms. Shizue,

227
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,712
did you want my advice regarding this?

228
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,516
Yes. I was so shocked
because it was so sudden.

229
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,184
How much was your deposit?

230
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,323
My checking account has

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,459
about 500,000 yen.

232
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,063
-Fixed deposit account has 20 million yen.
-Twenty million yen?

233
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,364
Excuse me.

234
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,965
SHIZUE SEKIGUCHI

235
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,538
I cancelled the fixed deposit account

236
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,940
I had made at your bank

237
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,209
and changed it to Keihin Bank.

238
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,912
-I see.
-I'm sorry.

239
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,815
Especially as you helped me open
that account.

240
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,150
Please don't worry about that.

241
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,786
You remember Mr. Akimoto, right?

242
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:05,024
He wasn't meeting his quota,
so I helped him out.

243
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,992
That's very you, Ms. Shizue.

244
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,463
Tell me, what will happen to my money

245
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,997
when the bank collapses?

246
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,435
There is something called
the deposit guarantee system.

247
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,206
Basically, ten million yen
that you have in the bank,

248
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,775
and its interest is guaranteed.

249
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,944
Nothing more than that?

250
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,280
I can't say much on that matter.

251
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,282
I see.

252
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,753
Mr. Akimoto hasn't explained anything?

253
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,989
Yeah, it seems like he's really busy.

254
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,693
How irresponsible…
He's the person in charge of your account.

255
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,198
It can't be helped.
I'm not his only customer.

256
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,035
I'm sure there are lots of people
who have larger amounts of deposits.

257
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,572
The amount of money you have
shouldn't matter.

258
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,275
What?

259
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,676
MAY 26, 2014

260
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,312
This was just two weeks ago!

261
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,349
Yeah. I'm so unlucky.

262
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,684
Oh.

263
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,220
-Hold on a second.
-Sure…

264
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,855
FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

265
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,290
COLLAPSED

266
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,793
Ms. Shizue, I'm so sorry I'm late.

267
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,795
I'm so glad to see you. Come inside.

268
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,999
Thank you. Is someone here?

269
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,636
Nice to see you again.

270
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,205
Ms. Hanasaki. I didn't expect you here.

271
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,007
Hello.

272
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,010
I'm so sorry.

273
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,916
I didn't know that this would happen.

274
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,286
I'm so sorry that

275
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,855
I didn't notice any sooner.

276
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,623
It's not your fault.

277
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,093
I want to give you all the money
you deposited,

278
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,429
but there's not much I can do…

279
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,867
I… don't know
how I can ever make it up to you…

280
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,869
You handed over your precious money…

281
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,273
It can't be helped.
Please don't worry about it.

282
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,876
You're losing your job too.

283
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,678
So I can't blame you.

284
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,980
I'm so sorry.

285
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,189
The depositors ended up having to
pay the price

286
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,892
for the bank's disorderly management.

287
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,763
Keihin Bank's debt seems to exceed the
amount that has been officially announced.

288
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,233
Then that would mean that

289
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,269
they can only guarantee up to
ten million yen per account?

290
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,239
<i>Yes, that's right. I wonder why the bank</i>

291
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,674
<i>couldn't do something before it collapsed.</i>

292
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,911
<i>What will happen to accounts</i>
<i>with over ten million yen?</i>

293
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,218
Something really bothers me.

294
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,720
What?

295
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,789
Ms. Shizue showed me her passbook.

296
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,591
She cancelled her account with us

297
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,195
and created an account with Keihin Bank
on May 14th.

298
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,964
That's two weeks before the collapse.

299
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:00,900
So?

300
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,569
Isn't the timing very suspicious?

301
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,005
Of course, Mr. Akimoto said that

302
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,575
he never thought the bank would collapse.

303
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,078
But why would he suggest to her to
change her account at a time like this?

304
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,216
He was just doing his job, right?

305
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,719
A regular employee has no way
of knowing a collapse in advance.

306
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,155
I know, but…

307
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,492
Important business is done
by the top management in secrecy.

308
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,527
That's how a bank works.

309
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,963
That Akimoto

310
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,065
is a victim too.

311
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,134
But the number one victims

312
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,370
are people like Ms. Shizue who had
entrusted their money to them.

313
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,572
Yeah.

314
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,343
Either way, it doesn't concern our bank.

315
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,647
There's nothing you can do about it.

316
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,182
I know.

317
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,551
But

318
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,688
that money was like a good luck charm

319
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,156
for Ms. Shizue.

320
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,192
-Good luck charm?
-Yes.

321
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,095
TATSUHIRO SEKIGUCHI

322
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,166
All of this is
for the fixed deposit account?

323
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,467
Yes.

324
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,438
It's money that my husband left me
when he passed away last month.

325
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,174
-He left it for me.
-Are you sure you want a fixed account?

326
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,242
It will be difficult to withdraw from…

327
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,012
I don't plan on using this money.

328
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,048
Because it's like my good luck charm.

329
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,218
I see. A good luck charm, huh?

330
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,723
I feel sick.

331
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,159
-Good morning.
-Mr. Shibasaki, did you drink too much?

332
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,863
A junior of mine worked at Keihin Bank.

333
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,798
He dragged me to three places,

334
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,634
and I had to listen to him complain.

335
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,671
-My sympathies.
-He said that a lot of employees left.

336
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,574
They were leaving Keihin Bank
before the collapse,

337
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,409
but he didn't leave early enough.

338
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,011
What?

339
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,347
Then the employees knew about
the collapse?

340
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,084
Yeah. It seems like
they were all talking about

341
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,586
the imminent collapse.

342
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,456
Their organization was on the verge
of disintegrating.

343
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,961
Your junior works at headquarters
or something, right?

344
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,929
No, he works at the branch.

345
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,834
Oh, my head is pounding.

346
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,837
Please stamp your seal on this.

347
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,773
Oh boy.

348
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,810
Things aren't matching up.

349
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,345
Yes.

350
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:30,182
Employees knew beforehand
about the collapse, right?

351
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,285
Akimoto was lying.

352
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,822
Yeah. It would be horrible if he made

353
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,925
Ms. Shizue open up a new account
while knowing about this.

354
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,428
-And what would happen.
-Hold on.

355
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,431
-Why did he do that in the first place?
-What?

356
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,833
If he knew that his bank was
about to collapse,

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
there's no merit in raising your quota.

358
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,604
You're right.

359
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,175
Did he have a grudge against Ms. Shizue?

360
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,312
We might need to investigate him.

361
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,380
Yes.

362
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,851
Oh, Ms. Hanasaki.

363
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,688
You should've told me if you already
had someone like this.

364
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,789
-W… what?
-Huh?

365
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,992
I was wondering why you weren't
showing interest in Mr. Akimoto.

366
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,595
-Hello.
-Ah, yes…

367
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,332
-He's just my boss.
-Don't be so rude.

368
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,368
I'm Soma. I'm just her boss.

369
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,671
Oh, the one at the hotel!

370
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,141
-Oh… ah…
-I saw you there, right?

371
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,909
More importantly,

372
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,147
I came today to ask you about Mr. Akimoto.

373
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,382
-Mr. Akimoto?
-Yes.

374
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,086
How did you meet him?

375
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,055
How?

376
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,658
Early this year,

377
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,428
he came by my house for a sales visit.

378
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,496
Hello.

379
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,401
Hello. My name is Akimoto
from the Kugahara Branch at Keihin Bank.

380
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,205
As I talked with him,
I realized that he was a diligent kid,

381
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,976
so I opened up a checking account
at Keihin Bank.

382
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,080
After that, he offered to come to my house
so that I wouldn't have to

383
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,016
go to the bank
and wait in line for a teller,

384
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,719
and even gave me financial advice.

385
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:19,558
He was a special presence for an old lady

386
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,294
living by herself.

387
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,332
What did he say when he asked you
to change your account?

388
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,867
To a fixed deposit one?

389
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,537
Well,

390
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,908
he was really down because his boss
got mad at him for not meeting

391
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,042
his quota,

392
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,779
so he begged me for help.

393
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,249
FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

394
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,992
Ms. Shizue, can you terminate this account

395
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,727
and open a new account with us?

396
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,034
We have a higher interest rate,

397
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,970
so it's more profitable for you
in the long run.

398
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,071
I see.

399
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,010
I promise I won't allow you to
suffer a loss,

400
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,178
so I'm begging you.

401
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,115
Stop that. Get up.

402
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,786
I'll move my account.

403
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,556
-Really?
-Yes.

404
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,127
I'm so glad! Thank you so much!

405
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,395
Thank you.

406
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,199
THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE DEDUCTED

407
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,267
SINCE THE ACCOUNT WAS TERMINATED
BEFORE THE FIXED TERM WAS COMPLETED

408
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,006
He's like a grandson to me,

409
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,409
so I felt really bad
when he got on his knees

410
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,245
and begged me like that.

411
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,781
Did you notice

412
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,417
anything strange about Mr. Akimoto?

413
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,787
-Anything strange?
-Yes.

414
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,158
For example, did he push
any other financial options on you,

415
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,960
or something else like…

416
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,395
Ms. Hanasaki.

417
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,198
you shouldn't doubt people like that.

418
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,234
But…

419
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,471
that money had important meaning to you…

420
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,839
It's okay,

421
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,742
because I was able to help
Mr. Akimoto with that.

422
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,213
Of course, it's frustrating.

423
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,850
But people are more important than money.

424
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,786
Yes.

425
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,158
-Oh.
-What?

426
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,929
I had something to give her.
Let me go back.

427
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,197
Okay.

428
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,039
I'm so sorry.

429
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:54,713
You worked so hard to leave me
with this money…

430
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,853
I'm so sorry…

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,388
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,338
What do you think, Mr. Soma?

433
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,240
I don't have a good feeling about this.

434
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,276
I agree.

435
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,111
If Akimoto is really

436
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,714
the nice guy that Ms. Shizue says he is,

437
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,317
he would have waited
until the fixed term came to an end.

438
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,353
Otherwise, she loses out.

439
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,825
But he didn't explain that to
Ms. Shizue either.

440
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,859
Yeah.

441
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,963
He's definitely hiding something.

442
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,998
Hiding what?

443
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,002
I don't know what, but…

444
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,305
Is someone here?

445
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,840
Nice to see you again.

446
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,477
It seemed like he had something to hide.

447
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,449
I'm going to go see Mr. Akimoto.

448
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,387
If he really tricked Ms. Shizue…

449
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,126
I will never forgive him.

450
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,634
Here you go.

451
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,472
Mr. Soma, who is that?

452
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,908
Oh… I wonder…

453
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,111
-Is he Mai's new boyfriend?
-No.

454
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,448
-I don't think so.
-Are they okay by themselves?

455
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,550
-Let me go check.
-Oh, wait.

456
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,887
Can I have some asparagus, please?

457
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,788
What?

458
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,190
-Asparagus?
-Yes, asparagus.

459
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,558
-Okay…
-Thank you.

460
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,728
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

461
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,200
I didn't think I'd get a call from you.

462
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,703
I'll pour.

463
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,205
Thank you.

464
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,845
I probably shouldn't be doing this

465
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,847
when I'm about to lose my job.

466
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,084
Let's raise our glasses for now.

467
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,186
Cheers.

468
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,863
Well,

469
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:29,134
I always knew that I wasn't
cut out to be a banker.

470
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,770
I'm horrible at calculating too.

471
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,975
How does it feel to see your

472
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,543
workplace collapse?

473
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,981
I haven't come to terms with it.

474
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,050
I was being told to acquire accounts

475
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,552
and investment funds until yesterday…

476
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,489
but now they're telling me to
tie up loose ends.

477
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,626
As the person in charge,

478
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,928
I can't face my customers anymore.

479
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,531
If I'd known about the collapse,

480
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,068
I could have spared Ms. Shizue
from experiencing all this.

481
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,850
I can't beat around the bush,

482
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,986
so I'll be frank.

483
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,355
What?

484
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,158
Mr. Akimoto, didn't you already know
for some time that Keihin Bank

485
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,760
was going to collapse?

486
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,330
-What are you saying?
-Please answer me.

487
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,999
There's no way I would've known.

488
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,336
I heard that it was a hot topic among
the employees since earlier this year.

489
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,571
I didn't know.

490
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,942
You changed Ms. Shizue's
fixed deposit account

491
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,777
from our bank to yours

492
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,146
just two weeks ago, right?

493
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,183
If you knew that Keihin Bank
was going to collapse,

494
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,787
why would you make her move her account
by ending her contract early?

495
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,558
I just don't understand your actions.

496
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,995
Ms. Shizue was very sad.

497
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,565
Is there a reason behind all this?

498
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:07,999
That's enough!

499
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,172
Oh, please wait.

500
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,108
You called me here to ask me that?

501
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,479
I'm telling you that
I didn't know anything.

502
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,382
I wanted to raise my sales performance,
that's all.

503
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,887
You're just

504
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,556
angry at me because she cancelled

505
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,558
the fixed deposit account you created.

506
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,260
That's not true.

507
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,996
You don't even have proof,

508
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,465
but you're trying to make me look
like a criminal.

509
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,534
Ms. Mai Hanasaki of Tokyo Daiichi Bank,

510
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,336
I can sue you for defamation.

511
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,216
Ms. Shizue isn't sad at all.

512
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,752
She was happy

513
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,489
because I was like a real grandson to her.

514
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,630
Are you leaving now?

515
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,733
Did my daughter do something to upset you?

516
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,246
Thank you.

517
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,654
He gets me so mad!

518
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,957
What happened, Mai? He got mad and left.

519
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,059
Moreover, who is that?

520
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,663
Well… it's complicated.

521
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,864
I see.

522
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,318
The way he got mad seemed like
you hit a nerve.

523
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,923
He finally showed his true colors.

524
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,993
Although we still didn't get any answers.

525
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,162
But just now,

526
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,331
I saw something very interesting
inside his wallet.

527
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,402
-What?
-A Tokyo Daiichi Bank ATM card.

528
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,273
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

529
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,877
He has an account with our bank.

530
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,014
We might find something
if we check his account.

531
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,850
Yes.

532
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,852
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

533
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,154
BRANCH INSPECTION

534
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:45,924
TERUO AKIMOTO

535
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,794
-There are 11 people with the same name.
-Yes.

536
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,730
Who lives within Tokyo?

537
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,433
Wakayama, Okayama,

538
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,635
Hiroshima, Fukuoka.

539
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,371
These five people here.

540
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,274
Do you know how old Mr. Akimoto is?

541
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,478
He said he's two years older than me.

542
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,380
So his birth year is either 1985 or 1986.

543
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,982
Which means…

544
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,121
It's either one of these two accounts.

545
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,428
It's this one.

546
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,296
How do you know?

547
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,197
Look.

548
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,335
He didn't specify his workplace.

549
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,242
<i>Hello, this is Keihin Bank</i>
<i>Kugahara Branch.</i>

550
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,144
I'm sorry, I got the wrong number.

551
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:40,779
Bingo.

552
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,116
The account number is…

553
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,026
TERUO AKIMOTO

554
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,395
A balance of 4,210 yen?

555
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,432
He's transferring money every month
to a real estate company.

556
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,068
It seems like an account to pay for rent.

557
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,005
This doesn't give us any information.

558
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,740
Hold on a second.

559
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,311
-What's this transfer?
-Tokyo First Stock, Akimoto Teruo.

560
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,948
He's a banker, but he has stocks?

561
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:21,886
-This is prohibited at our bank.
-Yeah, this is suspicious.

562
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,823
Wasn't he saying that
he's not good at calculating?

563
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,924
Yes.

564
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,695
Can we investigate
what these transactions are for?

565
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,398
I guess that would be hard
with a brokerage firm.

566
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,601
-No… there is a way.
-What?

567
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,771
My colleague was dispatched to this place.

568
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,376
Tokyo First Stock is our affiliate.

569
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:46,911
Right.

570
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,217
TOKYO FIRST STOCK
KAWASAKI BRANCH

571
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,389
Branch Manager Azuma please.

572
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,691
Yes.

573
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,167
Since it's an affiliate company,
it has the same atmosphere.

574
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,570
Listen up. Just stay still and be quiet.

575
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,471
Yes.

576
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,040
Hey, Soma!

577
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,042
Sorry for coming without notice.

578
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:22,013
-This is Azuma. He's the branch manager.
-Hello.

579
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,618
-I'm Mai Hanasaki.
-Oh, you're Ms. Hanasaki!

580
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,419
-I heard about you.
-What?

581
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,488
She's nothing like how you described.

582
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,723
Well…

583
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,460
He said that you were not ladylike,

584
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,395
and that you're scary when you're mad.

585
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,964
Oh, is that so?

586
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,067
-What are you doing?
-Sit down.

587
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,936
I'll get you back for this.

588
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,071
What brings you here today?

589
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,674
Well, it's a bit troublesome, but…

590
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
What?

591
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,112
This man named Teruo Akimoto
has an account with

592
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,014
Tokyo First Stock.

593
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,649
And?

594
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,817
We want the investment information.

595
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,554
Did this guy do something?

596
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,357
We can't give you the details,

597
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,426
but he might be doing illegal things.

598
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,430
That's it?
That's impossible and you know it.

599
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,466
-I know that, but I want you to try.
-Please.

600
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,938
I'm sure you know,
but although we're an affiliate,

601
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,373
we're separate from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

602
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,743
We can't leak customer information
to an outside source.

603
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,748
Azuma.

604
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,585
He's a banker at Keihin Bank.

605
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,389
-Really?
-Yes.

606
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,894
This company isn't allowed to
trade stocks with a banker, right?

607
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,097
Damn it.

608
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,367
That doesn't mean I can simply look up…

609
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,904
TERUO AKIMOTO

610
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,008
He's using our branch?

611
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,749
He mostly has tech-related stocks.

612
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,785
It's not rare for people to make money
these days

613
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,821
with day trade

614
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,824
but he's pretty clever with it.

615
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,126
We can't look at it.

616
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,327
How is he good?

617
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:20,064
He makes moderate profit
without getting too greedy.

618
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,799
He doesn't lose much either.

619
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:26,170
These detailed investments are not
possible unless he's constantly checking.

620
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,973
He has the knowledge and the skills.

621
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,344
-How much is his operation fund?
-Brace yourselves.

622
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,646
His stock value is

623
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,515
95 million yen.

624
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,051
-Nine…
-What?

625
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,002
TAKAGI

626
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,707
Mr. Takagi?

627
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:07,779
I'm so sorry, I was about to call you
just now.

628
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,313
Yes.

629
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,751
I'm so sorry that I can't do anything
to help you.

630
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,587
Ninety-five million yen.

631
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,890
Unless he's from a wealthy family,

632
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,259
most people in their twenties
aren't that rich.

633
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,761
Where did he get all that money?

634
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,199
In the beginning, he was operating
using a small fund

635
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:32,103
but he's been using tens of millions
since early this year.

636
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,242
15 million on January 16th.
13 million on February 3rd.

637
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,612
20 million on May 14th.

638
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,748
What? Wait.

639
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,883
-What did you just say?
-Hanasaki!

640
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,719
Twenty million on May 14th.

641
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,356
He made ten deposits
of two million yen each.

642
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,558
Total is 20 million.

643
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,495
May 14th is the day that Ms. Shizue
moved 20 million yen

644
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,031
to a fixed deposit account at Keihin Bank.

645
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:04,769
If he deposited two million each, he must
have used an ATM with a deposit limit.

646
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,938
Can you track down the ATM?

647
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,372
Yeah.

648
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,575
KUGAHARA 8-CHOME

649
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,211
It's an ATM inside a convenience store
in Kugahara.

650
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,746
It's right by Ms. Shizue's house.

651
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:19,717
So after Akimoto received
20 million yen from Ms. Shizue

652
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,921
to open a fixed deposit account
at Keihin Bank,

653
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,058
he immediately deposited that
into his account at Tokyo First.

654
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,035
Embezzlement.

655
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,406
But Mr. Soma,

656
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,076
Ms. Shizue has a passbook for her account

657
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,412
and there was record
of a 20-million-yen deposit.

658
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,616
Okay, let's go check it out.

659
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,817
Yes.

660
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,521
Thanks, Azuma.

661
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,822
Thank you very much.

662
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,460
SHIZUE SEKIGUCHI

663
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,862
Hello.

664
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,932
What are you two doing here?

665
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,569
Ms. Shizue, may I see your passbook
once again?

666
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,739
Yeah, of course.

667
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,743
I had it prepared because Mr. Akimoto

668
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,579
said that he'll be by tomorrow
for the passbook.

669
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,115
-What?
-I just got a call.

670
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,751
They're able to withdraw some money now.

671
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,454
So he's going to stop by to return
my ten million yen

672
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,757
and pick up my passbook.

673
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,696
I'm just relieved that I can at least
get ten million yen back.

674
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,032
Please let me see this.

675
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,934
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

676
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,502
KEIHIN FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

677
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,838
Yeah, the money was deposited.

678
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,477
CHECKING ACCOUNT

679
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,445
Excuse me.

680
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:01,619
What?

681
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,923
-Ah!
-What is it?

682
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,527
Please look at this.

683
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,064
Oh.

684
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,468
We finally solved it.

685
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,992

00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,001
-Hello?

688
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,435

The branch manager?

692
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,578
We have a new brand with high potential

I'll head over there now.

KEIHIN BANK

701
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,327
May I see the branch manager?

702
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,628
I understand.

703
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,767
Please wait here.

704
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,235
What? Here?

705
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,015
We've been waiting for you, Mr. Akimoto.

706
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,789
Ms. Hanasaki.

707
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,492
What are you doing here?

708
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,728
I was waiting for you.

709
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,597
There's something we'd like to discuss.

710
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:31,268
Discuss? There's nothing for me
to discuss with you.

711
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,839
You seem to be knowledgeable with stocks.

712
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,543
Mr. Akimoto, aren't you

713
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,979
operating your stocks with money

714
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,914
you embezzled from your customers?

715
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,351
Give me a break. That's not true.

716
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:52,556
Whatever money I use for my stocks,
is none of your business.

717
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,760
With all due respect…

718
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,996
-It is our business.
-What?

719
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,070
We're here to talk with you as an agent

720
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,172
for Ms. Shizue Sekiguchi.

721
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:10,875
What do you mean?

722
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,309
Mr. Akimoto,

723
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,747
you never made Ms. Shizue's
fixed deposit account

724
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,949
of 20 million yen, in the first place.

725
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,988
You took advantage of the fact that
Keihin Bank was about to collapse

726
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,424
and decided to embezzle money.

727
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,059
That's why you cancelled

728
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,763
Ms. Shizue's fixed account
of 20 million yen with Tokyo Daiichi Bank

729
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,199
and took that money by promising to

730
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,401
change her account to Keihin Bank.

731
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,706
The amount is accounted for.

732
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,610
-Here is your confirmation.
-Yes.

733
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,081
Thank you so much, Ms. Shizue.

734
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:55,519
No problem.
I'm glad I was able to help you.

735
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,354
-Let me get you some tea.
-Okay.

736
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,558
-I'll bring the passbook tomorrow.
-Okay.

737
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,601
But that money never went to Keihin Bank.

738
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,505
Because you deposited that money

739
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,942
into your account at Tokyo First Stock.

740
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,580
On May 14th,

741
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,951
you made a deposit at the ATM in Kugahara.

742
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,055
You made ten deposits
of two million yen each.

743
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,492
That's just false accusation.

744
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,828
Do you have any proof to back this up?

745
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,805
I borrowed this from Ms. Shizue.

746
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,778
The number printed
on the passbook of the fixed account,

747
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,848
and the one printed on the passbook
of the checking account

748
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,885
both look identical at first glance,

749
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,821
but the font is slightly different.

750
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,632
You most likely took an unused passbook
from the bank

751
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,234
and printed 20 million yen on your own.

752
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,149
PRINT

753
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,385
KEIHIN FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

754
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,791
This is counterfeit.

755
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,162
When Keihin Bank collapses,

756
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,132
it cannot guarantee any amount
over ten million yen.

757
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,701
That's why you kept Ms. Shizue's

758
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:55,706
20 million yen
instead of depositing it into the bank.

759
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,943
And after the bank collapsed,

760
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,278
you were going to return

761
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,848
ten million yen by making it seem
like that was

762
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:10,654
the recovered amount,
and you were going to pocket the rest.

763
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,724
Am I wrong?

764
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,896
You committed a crime
using your position as a banker.

765
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,832
Mr. Akimoto,

766
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,202
you cheated money out of the weak.

767
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,437
That's wrong.

768
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,574
You're disqualified as a banker.

769
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,915
How annoying.

770
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,051
I don't care about that.

771
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,853
I'm not a banker anymore.

772
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,491
She wasn't planning on using that money.

773
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,161
Why would she need that money
when she doesn't

774
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,696
have much longer to live?

775
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,401
I took good care of her.

776
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,471
It's her fault that she got deceived.

777
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,681
That money that her husband left her,

778
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,319
was a source of comfort for Ms. Shizue.

779
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,390
That money was important to her
because it protected her

780
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,091
like a good luck charm!

781
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,627
Good luck charm? How foolish.

782
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,397
Money is money. It's all the same.

783
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,665
No, it's not.

784
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,601
The money Ms. Shizue protected,

785
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,570
and the dirty money you handle
are not the same!

786
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,773
-Shut up!
-No, I won't!

787
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,047
Ms. Shizue entrusted her precious money
to you because she liked you.

788
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,517
But you took advantage of her.

789
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,654
She said that you were
like a real grandson to her.

790
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,124
She was happy she got to help you.

791
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,063
She said people are more important
than the money she lost.

792
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,701
Ms. Shizue

793
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,204
still believes in you.

794
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:13,711
Even if she finds out the truth, she'll
most likely be more worried about you

795
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,746
than about her money.

796
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,215
That's who she is.

797
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:23,687
But

798
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,525
even if Ms. Shizue forgives you,

799
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,530
I will never forgive you!

800
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,106
We've been waiting.

801
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,908
I'm Ito from Kugahara Police.

802
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,945
Are you Teruo Akimoto?

803
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:51,915
We'd like to question you at the station,
so please come with us.

804
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,597
-Damn it!
-Hey, you!

805
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:09,199
-Let go of me!
-Stop!

806
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,503
-Hanasaki!
-Calm down!

807
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:17,040
Let go of me!

808
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,366
What should I tell her?

809
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,907
Ms. Shizue.

810
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:52,876
Um…

811
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,946
It's about Mr. Akimoto…

812
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,290
Thank you.

813
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,429
Thank you, Ms. Hanasaki.

814
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,001
Not at all.

815
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,919
EMPLOYEES OF TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
HELP WITH ARREST

816
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,722
What a horrible crime.

817
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,592
Will they get back the money
that he conned out of them?

818
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,228
Tokyo First Stock
is working with the police,

819
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,463
and I hear they'll get most of it back.

820
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,966
I'm glad, otherwise it'll be too unfair.

821
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,601
Yeah.

822
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:54,538
But you two are really amazing.

823
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,574
"Employees at Tokyo Daiichi Bank
helped with the arrest."

824
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,978
Oh, well, not really…

825
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,946
You might get

826
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,349
a certificate of appreciation
from the police.

827
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,250
You think so?

828
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,585
Yeah, they might print your picture too.

829
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,454
No way! Really?

830
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,223
I should go to the hair salon,
and the spa beforehand.

831
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,461
Oh no, what should I do if people
start noticing me.

832
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,765
I'm sure it's just a coincidence,
but Branch Inspection

833
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,003
seems to have had a big part
in solving this case.

834
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:31,808
Normally, they're not allowed to stick
their heads in other banks' businesses.

835
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,743
Yes.

836
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,612
But in the end,

837
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,216
it improved the image
of Tokyo Daiichi Bank,

838
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,651
so it's an achievement--

839
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,552
-Achievement?
-Oh, no…

840
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,024
No. They did something unnecessary
once again.

841
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,263
Sir, it's time for your meeting
with Chairman Itami.

842
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,199
Okay.

843
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,442
The Itami Group

844
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,980
is about to begin
the Ginza Redevelopment Project.

845
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:15,218
Getting the contract
as the coordinating bank,

846
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,688
is our biggest chance

847
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,657
to make our bank known to the world.

848
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:22,993
Yes, sir.

849
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,833
-Hurry up, Mr. Soma.
-Yeah.

850
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,868
Ms. Shizue is waiting for us.

851
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,137
I know.

852
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,074
But I wonder why she wanted to
see us all of a sudden.

853
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,142
She wants to thank us both.

854
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,511
Thank us, huh… Oh,

855
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,315
maybe she'll set you up
with someone again.

856
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,783
I don't think so.

857
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,820
All right! Let's go. Good evening.

858
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,955
I'm home.

859
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,758
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

860
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,694
Ms. Hanasaki, your dad is so much fun.

861
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,097
You are too,
with so many interesting stories.

862
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,231
Oh, stop it…

863
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,133
They've really hit it off.

864
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,268
-It seems like it.
-Sit down.

865
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,338
-Yes.
-Thank you.

866
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,607
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

867
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,777
Thank you so much for all of your help.

868
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,846
I'm glad to see you doing well.

869
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:19,349
-You're doing better than before.
-You think so? Thank you.

870
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,919
And as a way to thank you…

871
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,955
-Here it comes!
-Um…

872
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,990
You don't need to set me up with anyone.

873
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,059
You're meeting someone?

874
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,762
It's a great chance, Hanasaki.

875
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,999
I found a great person.
It's a perfect match…

876
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,267
for Mr. Soma.

877
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,002
-What?
-For Mr. Soma?

878
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,339
This person is also a divorcee.
What do you say?

879
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:46,543
Oh… no, I'm not really interested in that…

880
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,311
Oh come on, it's a great chance.

881
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,313
-Try it this once.
-I think so too.

882
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,816
Stop that… wait a minute.

883
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,217
-How about you?
-What?

884
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,986
-That's a great idea.
-No way!

885
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,422
I'm too old for that.
Mr. Soma, you try it.

886
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,191
-No, you should try it.
-No, I have Mai to think about.

887
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,360
-Come on, Mr. Soma.
-No, it's yours.

888
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,929
Come on, Mr. Soma. I'm begging you!

889
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,231
That's the notorious Itami.

890
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,933
Nice to meet you, Hanasaki.

891
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,234
He's so arrogant.

892
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,070
Your loan was denied?

893
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,671
I have to protect this company.

894
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,807
-Where's Itami?
-It's going to fail.

895
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,642
They'll go bankrupt sooner or later.

896
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,944
You're the damn fool.

897
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,046
