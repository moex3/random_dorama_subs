TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
SHINJUKU BRANCH

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,178
-Welcome.
-Here you go.

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,314
You're here to pay the taxes?

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,550
-Please take this number and wait.
-Okay.

5
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,965
-Wow.
-Incredible.

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,134
She's amazing.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,669
Branch Manager,
the rumors about her were true.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,605
We did the right thing by calling

9
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,807
headquarters for administrative help.

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,376
Customer with ticket number five.

11
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,480
Thank you very much for waiting.

12
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,250
I wonder if she's doing okay.

13
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,453
It was for administrative help,
but I felt uneasy sending

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,722
Hanasaki out by herself.

15
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,690
I'm sure she's fine.

16
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,192
Plus, it's not an inspection.

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,262
Being a teller is her calling.

18
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,298
But Soma, aren't you lonely?

19
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,535
Since you're always with Hanasaki.

20
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,636
Lonely?

21
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,274
No way! When I'm by myself,

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,477
I'm so refreshed,
and it reminds me how wonderful it is

23
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,946
to be trouble-free.

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,914
What?

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,250
I want to go back in time
to when Hanasaki wasn't here,

26
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,654
and tell myself,
"Don't take this happiness for granted."

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,390
I guess you have your own struggles.

28
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,659
-You understand?
-Yes.

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,563
Oh, look at the time. I have to go now.

30
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,732
-Bye.
-Okay. I'm so busy.

31
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,146
It's so quiet…

32
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,416
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

33
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,589
We all worked hard today.

34
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,525
-It was so busy.
-Yeah.

35
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:10,430
I forgot how fun it is to be a teller.

36
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,632
Put your hands up!

37
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,537
Move, and he'll die!

38
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,107
What… bank robbery?

39
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,710
I told you to put your hands up!

40
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,247
-Hey you!
-Yes.

41
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,481
Put the cash in here.

42
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,484
-Give me all the cash you have!
-Yes!

43
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,198
Hurry up and get to it!

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,769
Here. This is all we have right now.

45
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,238
-Let's go.
-Okay.

46
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,842
Oh! My arm. It's broken.

47
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,678
Ouch.

48
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,349
Hold up!

49
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,553
Ms. Hanasaki! Wait! Where are you going?

50
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,922
Please move. I have to throw this at them!

51
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,524
Wait. This is training!

52
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,927
Who cares if it's training.

53
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,928
Training?

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,596
What?

55
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,569
What? So the bank robbers are…

56
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,605
They're from the police.

57
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,542
-Section Chief Fushimi.
-Yes?

58
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,211
You didn't tell Ms. Hanasaki?

59
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,512
I'm so sorry.

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,282
I forgot since it was
so busy this morning.

61
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,351
It was training…

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,497
I'm so sorry.

63
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,873
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

64
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,044
Hello, Chairman Itami.

65
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,846
Thank you.

66
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,084
CHAIRMAN OF ITAMI GROUP
SEIGO ITAMI

67
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,555
ITAMI GROUP

68
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,590
GINZA REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

69
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,359
PLANNED OPENING - FALL 2019

70
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,429
Chairman Itami, this plan is
finally taking off.

71
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,565
The Ginza Redevelopment Project.

72
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,570
Over 200 shops, restaurants,

73
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,740
hotels, offices, theatres,
and art museums.

74
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,678
Once it's completed, it will be
the nation's biggest cultural facility.

75
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,382
We expect to see
50 million customers a year.

76
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,450
With more people, Ginza will change too.

77
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,152
Wonderful.

78
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,290
Our budget is no less than
300 billion yen.

79
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,093
Our bank would love

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,429
to help you out in that regard.

81
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:01,200
Of course, I want Tokyo Daiichi Bank
to lend us a hand

82
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,736
by being the coordinator.

83
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,242
Please take the lead.

84
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,312
Thank you.

85
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:16,816
But please go easy on the interest rate.

86
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,154
We will do our best
to meet your expectations.

87
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,092
I use this bank

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,061
for both work and private use.

89
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,098
I hear great things about your son
Mr. Seiichiro.

90
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,902
-His work at the Shinjuku Branch.
-Oh, please don't mention it.

91
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,871
I want him to gain knowledge

92
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,708
about management while he works here.

93
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,212
Eventually, he'll be taking my place.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,550
That's an incredible plan.
We look forward to

95
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,652
working together in the future.

96
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,320
Thank you.

97
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,389
Likewise.

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,260
He finally made it clear that he'll use us
as the coordinating bank.

99
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,462
Yeah.

100
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,431
Mr. Shindo, your time has finally come.

101
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,103
There is one thing

102
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,605
I need to let you know.

103
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,539
What is it?

104
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,743
Hanasaki from Branch Inspection

105
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,279
is at the Shinjuku Branch
for administrative support.

106
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,014
What?

107
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,685
Thankfully, it's only today and tomorrow.

108
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,388
Chairman Itami's son
is in the Finance Department,

109
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,925
so I'm sure they won't have a chance
to meet but I did alert

110
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,595
Section Chief Haneda just to be safe.

111
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,466
Hopefully, nothing happens.

112
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,769
Not "hopefully"!

113
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,670
Prevent it!

114
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,309
There's a chance that this project
will go down the drain

115
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,612
if Chairman Itami becomes upset.

116
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,947
The Ginza Redevelopment Project

117
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,518
will be a 100-billion-yen contract
for this bank.

118
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,022
It's our chance to get ahead
of our rival, Hakusui Bank.

119
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,592
We will not let go of this chance!

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,661
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,301
Everything is balanced. Thank you.

122
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,003
Thank you.

123
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,807
Sorry for causing a scene just now.

124
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,843
It's only natural since you didn't know.

125
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,446
Yes! Branch Manager was shaking,

126
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,481
and Ms. Yasukawa looked close to tears.

127
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,850
I never imagined that it was
just training.

128
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,953
I knew it was training
but it was still really scary.

129
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,323
I know! Those police officers are
such good actors.

130
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,758
Yeah.

131
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,760
Can you process this?

132
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,964
Who is he?

133
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,233
Mr. Itami from the Finance Department.

134
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,670
-Um…
-Excuse me.

135
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,071
We are done for today.

136
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,508
-So what?
-We can't process this now.

137
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,444
It's still working hours, right?

138
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,646
Doing this tomorrow will be a hassle.

139
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,551
I know you guys want to go home early,

140
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,654
but we at the Finance Department
work overtime every day,

141
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,724
so it's selfish to do things
at your own convenience.

142
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,260
Um…

143
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,199
With all due respect…

144
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,703
we're not just trying to leave early.

145
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,271
What?

146
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,707
We have to scrap everything
and recalculate.

147
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,575
We have to balance everything again.

148
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,177
Do you understand that?

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,716
Please take this back overnight.

150
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,784
-Come back tomorrow--
-Hey.

151
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:40,887
Who are you?

152
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,356
I'm Hanasaki from Branch Inspection.

153
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,558
-I'm here for two days--
-Ms. Hanasaki.

154
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,194
Can you stop being so uptight?

155
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,131
Do you know how much money
we handle at the Finance Department?

156
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,335
It's nothing like the coins
you handle at the window.

157
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,777
You'll do this for me,
right Section Chief Fushimi?

158
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,713
Oh… well…

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,184
What's wrong, Itami?

160
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,554
Section Chief Haneda,

161
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,155
this lady from the headquarters

162
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,324
won't process my checks.

163
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,760
You're Ms. Hanasaki
from Branch Inspection?

164
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,395
Yes.

165
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,730
You may not understand,

166
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,767
but unlike the carefree Sales Division,

167
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,069
the Finance Department
has lots of work to do.

168
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,839
We can't work if you get mad over
one or two checks.

169
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,010
-Please do this, Mr. Fushimi.
-I understand.

170
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,379
That's settled.

171
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,317
Thanks,

172
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,819
Ms. Hanasaki.

173
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:11,043
Who is that guy named Itami anyway?
He's so arrogant!

174
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,448
He's full of himself
and looks down on others.

175
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,717
He gets me so mad!

176
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,219
It's also annoying.

177
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,254
-Him being good looking.
-Right?

178
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,257
Mr. Itami is always causing us trouble.

179
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,659
-I can see that.
-Okay.

180
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,328
Now that you've released your stress,

181
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,630
try our daily special.

182
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,232
It's Kabocha <i>chakinshibori</i>.

183
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,600
-It looks delicious.
-Here.

184
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,569
Thank you very much.

185
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,537
Thank you.

186
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,706
By the way, why is he so arrogant?

187
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,774
He's still young.

188
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,176
He's the heir to the Itami Group.

189
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,479
-Itami--
-The Itami Group is that company.

190
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,781
The one that builds huge buildings
and hotels?

191
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,917
The chairman's only son

192
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,853
works at our branch.

193
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,755
-Only son--
-He's the only son.

194
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,024
He's the heir, right?

195
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,594
He's working at our branch
to learn about business in order to

196
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,462
take over the Itami Group.

197
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,732
Mai, if you get that son,
you'll be filthy rich.

198
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,367
You'll be the president's wife.

199
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,170
Though your dream to be a banker's wife
won't come true.

200
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,007
Like I said, I never dreamed
of that before.

201
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,710
And leave us alone.
We're having a girl's talk.

202
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:21,681
-There's a wall here.
-Fine, fine.

203
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,684
What's this about the banker's wife?

204
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,521
It's nothing at all.
It's all his imagination.

205
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,291
What? Itami junior is
at the Shinjuku Branch?

206
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,493
It slipped my mind.

207
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,997
If I'd known, I wouldn't have let
Hanasaki go by herself.

208
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,434
You're worrying too much.
Even Hanasaki wouldn't…

209
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,470
But apparently, she already had
an issue with junior.

210
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,705
Wow, Hanasaki.

211
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,809
Mr. Kodama contacted me
and told me to be more careful.

212
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,310
What is she doing?

213
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm so worried,

214
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,649
that I can barely eat.

215
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,718
I see…

216
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,356
Yes?

217
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,929
The Itami Group is planning

218
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,999
the Ginza Redevelopment Project,
and our bank is about to be chosen

219
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,669
as the coordinating bank.

220
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,004
The person pushing for that

221
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,940
is General Manager Shindo.

222
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,613
I just got a bad feeling.

223
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,415
-Right?
-Yes.

224
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,052
It doesn't matter whose son he is.
What's wrong is wrong.

225
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,389
I know. But the management are
all scared of him.

226
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,860
Everyone calls him "VIP" or "in charge."

227
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,528
VIP…

228
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,396
Then he always had that

229
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,732
arrogant and haughty attitude?

230
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,268
Yeah, ever since he came.

231
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,770
Year-end party?

232
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,272
-I'll pass.
-But…

233
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,007
Usually everyone attends.

234
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,777
I don't plan to be here for long,

235
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,912
and I don't want to

236
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,547
become friends with all of you.

237
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,083
He'll say that he's cut above

238
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,319
the rest of the employees,
with a straight face.

239
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
There's an error on here,

240
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,923
so can you re-do this please?

241
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,393
What? Just go and fix it yourself.

242
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,263
We can't do that.

243
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,167
I'll leave these small funds up to you.

244
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,703
He thinks everything aside from loans
is a menial job.

245
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,140
Everything about him is awful.

246
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah.

247
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,545
Even if he's connected
to one of our clients,

248
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,413
it's wrong.

249
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,282
-He can't do whatever he wants, right?
-But…

250
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,451
He's apparently pretty good
working with loans.

251
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,354
He brings in lots of
new, big loan contracts.

252
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,290
Really?

253
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,225
People say that it's because

254
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,561
those companies are connected
with the Itami Group

255
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,895
and he has connections.

256
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,798
That doesn't justify everything.

257
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,102
Therefore, please go to
the Shinjuku Branch tomorrow.

258
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,172
-What do you mean?
-Well.

259
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,541
Just keep an eye on her.

260
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,412
Soma, you're the only one that can
stop Hanasaki.

261
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,913
Give me a break.

262
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,882
I was looking forward to relaxing.

263
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,451
-To having trouble-free day tomorrow.
-Please.

264
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,889
Director Karashima was worried too.

265
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,060
Plus, you've worked
at the Shinjuku Branch before.

266
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,362
That was ten years ago.

267
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,699
Please do me this one favor.

268
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,003
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

269
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,274
This week is Customer Satisfaction
Improvement Week.

270
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,776
Please work with the customer's

271
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,378
satisfaction as your priority.

272
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,281
Next on our topic is…

273
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,050
Why is Mr. Soma here?

274
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,219
I follow orders from the boss.

275
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,455
That's what a businessman does.

276
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,489
What?

277
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,994
So you came all the way here to
keep an eye on me?

278
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,630
I didn't want to come either.

279
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,532
They don't trust me at all.

280
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,469
Well, you already caused trouble
yesterday, right?

281
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,138
I didn't cause trouble… oh yeah,

282
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,308
listen to this Mr. Soma.
This guy is horrible--

283
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,044
Stop. That's enough. Listen, Hanasaki,

284
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,080
I've told you over and over again.

285
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,183
-Be quiet, even if you want to speak up.
-Yes.

286
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,885
But do you ever listen

287
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,987
to that advice, even once? No.

288
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,822
I have, two or three times.

289
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,226
I'll say it even stronger this time
with maximum effort.

290
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,029
Don't say anything unnecessary.

291
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,164
Oh, he's here.

292
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,102
That's Itami junior?

293
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,604
Yeah.

294
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,442
Good morning.

295
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,146
-Oh, you're Ms. Hanasaki?
-Yes.

296
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,314
Smile.

297
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,484
I'm Soma from Branch Inspection.

298
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,053
Hello.

299
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,788
Then you're Ms. Hanasaki's boss?

300
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,523
Yes.

301
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,793
She's really loud,
so please keep her in check.

302
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,996
Um… you don't need to say…

303
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,864
Okay.

304
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,102
Please do your best.

305
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,975
Why does he look down on people like that?

306
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,144
Smile, Mr. Soma.

307
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,452
This is not good, Mr. Karashima.

308
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,489
I hear that Hanasaki caused trouble with

309
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,858
Chairman Itami's son.

310
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,127
I'm very sorry.

311
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,164
It seems to have been a small issue,

312
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,367
but I sent her boss, Mr. Soma,

313
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,802
to the Shinjuku Branch just in case.

314
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,974
You know about that

315
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,778
Ginza Redevelopment Project by
the Itami Group, that I'm heading, right?

316
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,580
Of course.

317
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,449
I hear that our bank will become
the coordinator.

318
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,651
But it's not confirmed yet,

319
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,687
so we can't let our guard down.

320
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,756
We want to avoid

321
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,859
even the smallest of issues
with the Itami Group.

322
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,595
Both with the chairman himself,

323
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,563
and his son.

324
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,133
But Hanasaki

325
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,769
has never done anything wrong
up until now.

326
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,804
She is only doing her job.

327
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,775
I'm not concerned about what's

328
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,942
right or wrong.

329
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,812
What do you mean?

330
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,584
What's important is thinking about
what is most beneficial

331
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,454
for Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

332
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,927
I'm opening a savings account
for my newborn grandchild.

333
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,563
Is that right? Congratulations.

334
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,498
We will take good care of it.

335
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,669
She becomes a different person
once she wears a uniform.

336
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,976
Mr. Koda.

337
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,111
Mr. Koda.

338
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,580
Long time no see. How are you?

339
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,383
Mr. Soma.

340
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,552
You came back to the Shinjuku Branch?

341
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,188
I'm at headquarters now.
I'm here for support.

342
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,989
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

343
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,492
I never thought I'd get to see you today.

344
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,828
Thank you for continuing to use our bank.

345
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,697
-Thank you.
-But ours is just a small company.

346
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,100
Don't say that.

347
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,369
Welcome, Mr. Koda.

348
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,506
Hello, Section Chief Fushimi.
I brought this.

349
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,674
Please enjoy it.

350
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,143
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

351
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,014
-Who are you seeing today?
-I'm heading to Finance.

352
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,883
Okay.

353
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,618
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

354
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,955
Mr. Soma, you know him?

355
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,524
Yes, when I worked
at this branch ten years ago,

356
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,193
I was in charge of Koda Sangyo's loans.

357
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,828
Oh, I see.

358
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,264
He's such a nice man.

359
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes.

360
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,835
Mr. Itami.

361
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,540
Mr. Koda.

362
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,409
Is everything all right?

363
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,710
You don't look well…

364
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,346
Well…

365
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,048
it's hard for me to bring this up,

366
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,784
but my loan request is in danger.

367
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:47,586
Really?

368
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,256
I've had it with Mr. Itami.

369
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,425
Itami…

370
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,995
I'm sorry for complaining to you.

371
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:57,896
No problem.

372
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,133
-I'll be leaving.
-Goodbye.

373
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,717
Everything is balanced.
Thank you very much.

374
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,119
Thank you.

375
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:25,157
Ms. Hanasaki, thank you so much
for the last two days!

376
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,827
Thank you.

377
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,963
We're so glad you came.

378
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,298
You were a good example for our tellers.

379
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,067
Oh, please.

380
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,970
-I learned so much.
-Thank you, Ms. Hanasaki.

381
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:42,241
Oh, stop it. I didn't do much.

382
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,577
She's definitely getting carried away.

383
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,013
I'll be going now.

384
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,581
Thank you.

385
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,284
Oh, I forgot.

386
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,290
Mr. Koda gave this to us.
Let's all share it.

387
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,359
-Oh!
-What?

388
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,794
Please wait a moment.

389
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,597
I think you should ask
the Finance Department first.

390
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,598
What do you mean?

391
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,568
It seems like the loan discussion

392
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,536
with Koda Sangyo isn't going so well.

393
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,138
I see…

394
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,141
We don't want them to say that

395
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,910
they couldn't deny the loan
because we accepted this.

396
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,313
-Right.
-I see.

397
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,814
Who's in charge?

398
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,683
Mr. Itami.

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,051
Itami, huh…

400
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,356
Oh, Itami.

401
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,893
We got something from Koda Sangyo.

402
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,296
-What should we do?
-Huh?

403
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,665
It seems like there are issues
with the loans

404
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,932
so I thought I'd ask…

405
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,969
-Just throw that away.
-What?

406
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,606
Since we most likely won't be
financing that place.

407
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
-That's not right…
-Hanasaki.

408
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,052
If you can't accept it,

409
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,853
shouldn't you give it back?

410
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,322
How can you throw it away…

411
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,457
Their company is of that level.

412
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,762
Koda Sangyo is a customer that's been
with us

413
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,197
for the last ten years.

414
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,932
Does that matter?

415
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,736
What's important is
the business performance.

416
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,407
First of all, why are you asking me
about something you got from that

417
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,011
small little company.
I have no time for this.

418
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,779
That's so rude.

419
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,881
A support member from headquarters

420
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,151
has the right to tell me how to do my job?

421
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,855
No, we do not.

422
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,591
I thought so.

423
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,702
I will stop by Mr. Koda's company
on the way back.

424
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,272
Thank you very much.

425
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,278
-I'm so mad.
-I'm so mad.

426
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,615
-We were thinking the same thing.
-Yes, we were.

427
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,617
It must be something

428
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,886
for you to get mad, Mr. Soma.

429
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:08,854
Yeah.

430
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,357
KODA SANGYO

431
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,502
-I see.
-I'm sorry we can't.

432
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,604
-Can't accept your kindness.
-Don't worry.

433
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,273
I'm sorry for causing you
trouble in the end.

434
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,409
Please sit down.

435
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,814
I really don't know what to do.

436
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,682
Mr. Koda.

437
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,086
I heard that it's difficult
to get the loan,

438
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,955
but what did the Finance Department
tell you?

439
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,225
They said it's impossible
with our business performance.

440
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,162
How much is the loan?

441
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,464
Fifty million yen.

442
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,435
Pardon me for being rude,

443
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,671
but are you in the red?

444
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,240
No. Our profits are small
but we're in the black.

445
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,078
Please look at this.

446
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,280
Thank you.

447
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,686
We have lots of orders this term,
so our sales will go up

448
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,889
but we'll be making more
purchases as well.

449
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,024
I see.

450
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,128
This has never happened before.

451
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,998
This is the first contract with Mr. Itami,

452
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,035
but I didn't think he'd be reluctant.

453
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,103
When do you need it by?

454
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,539
Next Tuesday.

455
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,108
-That's in four days.
-Yes.

456
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,747
What if you can't get the loan by then?

457
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,249
What will happen?

458
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,319
Our check will bounce,

459
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,555
so we may go bankrupt.

460
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,557
Bankrupt…

461
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,761
What did Itami say?

462
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,065
He said it can't be helped even if

463
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,700
we are to go bankrupt.

464
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,936
We're not in the red,

465
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,038
and there's prospect of growth.

466
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,375
But

467
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,411
I have to protect this company.

468
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,481
I'll go back one more time…

469
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,650
No, I'll go back until I can get a loan.

470
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,723
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

471
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,094
I wonder what will happen to the loan
for Koda Sangyo.

472
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,030
They should be able to get it
with those numbers.

473
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,633
But it's Mr. Itami.

474
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,838
Whether it's approved or denied,
loans require

475
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,307
many people to assess the approval.

476
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,510
Even if Itami makes the wrong decision,

477
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,445
his boss would make sure to fix it.

478
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,916
You're right.

479
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,951
And if their check bounces,

480
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,520
it will make the branch look bad.

481
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,721
It'll cause trouble.

482
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,158
So I'm sure they want to avoid that.

483
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,394
Oh no…

484
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,597
If this continues, I might be
in the red this month.

485
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,800
-What?
-It's difficult.

486
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,235
Managing a business,

487
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,305
even a small private restaurant.

488
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,975
Well, a lot of people stay home
during the rainy season.

489
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,177
But don't worry.

490
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,948
Because the cuisine here is
exceptionally delicious.

491
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,884
Mr. Soma, you always say such nice things.

492
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,354
-It's just the truth.
-That just made me feel better.

493
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,756
This girl over there.

494
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,959
-She gives no words of encouragement.
-Not true.

495
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,696
If only she would marry a rich man
so that I can rest a little.

496
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,397
Don't expect too much.

497
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,433
I wonder if I should be happy

498
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,734
to have anyone take her.

499
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,671
I just prefer him to be
the second born son.

500
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,473
Someone who can drink,

501
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,375
enjoy talking about food,

502
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,444
and go on hot-spring trips together.

503
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,878
That would be the best.

504
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,981
You're so picky.

505
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,816
He has high expectations.

506
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,026
FROM PRESIDENT KODA OF KODA SANGYO

507
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,362
HE WANTS YOU TO CONTACT HIM
REGARDING THE LOAN

508
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,778
FOUR DAYS LATER

509
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,780
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

510
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,351
This is Chairman Itami, huh?

511
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,121
He's very distinguished.

512
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,691
He's the head of a very big company.

513
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:44,496
This reminds me of that idiot son,
and that's getting me mad.

514
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,131
Hey, calm down.

515
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,935
Branch Inspection.

516
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,038
Mr. Koda.

517
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,840
What's wrong?

518
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,409
What…

519
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,778
Your loan was denied?

520
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,546
What?

521
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,250
-Let's go to Koda Sangyo first.
-Okay.

522
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,956
KODA SANGYO

523
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,393
What? You were denied today?

524
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,662
But you needed it by today, right?

525
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,899
I couldn't get in touch with him
for two days.

526
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,867
He wasn't at the branch today,

527
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,670
and I finally got him on the phone
a while ago.

528
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,772
What do you mean, Mr. Itami?

529
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,074
<i>You didn't hear me?</i>

530
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,110
I told you that we're denying
your loan this time.

531
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,312
Please wait.

532
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,081
Why are you telling me this now?

533
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,784
Everything at a bank requires approval.

534
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,153
There's nothing I can do on my own.

535
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,091
Thirty million yen,

536
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:49,194
even 20 million yen is enough. Please!

537
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,863
Please!

538
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,566
That's horrible.

539
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,967
What do you plan to do?

540
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,504
I have to prepare 50 million yen for now

541
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,807
before our payment check bounces.

542
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,210
But getting 50 million by today is…

543
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm asking everyone,
from my acquaintances to customers

544
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,083
and begging for their help.

545
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,254
Mr. Sakamoto?

546
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,990
I'm really ashamed to ask this of you,

547
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,859
but I have a favor to ask.

548
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,897
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

549
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,470
What are you doing here?

550
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,506
Section Chief Haneda.

551
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,008
Why did you deny the loan for Koda Sangyo?

552
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,148
-What?
-And on the day of the settlement.

553
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,216
Their payment may bounce.

554
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,721
Wait. I haven't received
the proposal for Koda Sangyo yet.

555
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,624
-What?
-Today's the settlement day?

556
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,093
You didn't know?

557
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,730
Mr. Itami didn't turn in
his proposal document?

558
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,898
No, he did not.

559
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,037
Koda Sangyo's account

560
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,340
has an insufficient fund
of 47 million yen.

561
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,010
At this rate,
this check will really bounce.

562
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,445
-Where's Itami?
-Not picking up.

563
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:18,116
Section Chief Fushimi, how long can you
wait to process that?

564
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,718
I can wait until 4:30 p.m.

565
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,287
Only two more hours.

566
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,324
Hello, President Koda. This is Soma.

567
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,929
Our bank can wait until 4:30 p.m.
to process the check.

568
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,031
I can get up to ten million yen

569
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,967
but getting the rest by 4:30 p.m. may be

570
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,335
impossible for us.

571
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,705
I see. I will call back again.

572
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,075
Where's the branch manager?

573
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,213
He's heading to Kumamoto
to tour Nakamaru Denki's factory.

574
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,549
-He's probably on his flight right now.
-I see.

575
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,621
Let's have Finance at headquarters
approve an emergency loan.

576
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,090
-You can do that?
-It'll be a stretch, but yes.

577
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,792
-That's our only option.
-But…

578
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,927
Koda Sangyo's financial statements

579
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,697
showed that their business is going well.

580
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,032
It's wrong to deny their loan

581
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,334
for 50 million yen!

582
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,771
At this rate, Koda Sangyo will go
bankrupt, right?

583
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,706
Yes.

584
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,942
A company is about to go bankrupt

585
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,078
just because of one employee.

586
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,013
That's definitely wrong.

587
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,084
-Look for the proposal document.
-Yes!

588
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,163
Koda Sangyo.

589
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,236
-Here's the temporary password.
-Thanks.

590
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,677
It's not here.

591
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,580
PROPOSAL DOCUMENT

592
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,483
KODA SANGYO

593
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,517
Here it is.

594
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,155
PROPOSAL DOCUMENT
KODA SANGYO

595
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,891
What is this?

596
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,992
It's unfinished!

597
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,597
-Let's make one.
-What?

598
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,833
-A new proposal document.
-It's too late now.

599
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,669
We won't know until we try.

600
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,738
-We have two more hours.
-With only two hours…

601
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,574
President Koda hasn't given up yet.

602
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,810
So we have to do all that we can.

603
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,280
You're right. Saito, can you…

604
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,550
-No, please let me do it.
-What?

605
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,019
I was in charge of Koda Sangyo
ten years ago.

606
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,690
-Really? Okay, please do it.
-Okay.

607
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,724
I'll help.

608
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,927
-Please examine all of the statements.
-Yes.

609
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,530
Hanasaki, call Finance at headquarters.

610
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,632
-Get an appointment with the director.
-Okay.

611
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,107
Hello, I'm Hanasaki
from Branch Inspection.

612
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,875
Is Director Nishino there?

613
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,980
In a meeting… until when?

614
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,717
I see. Which meeting room is it?

615
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,086
I understand. Thank you.

616
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,987
Bye.

617
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,256
I'll go to headquarters.

618
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,359
-He can look at the files once he's out.
-Okay.

619
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,827
-We'll send it soon.
-Okay.

620
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,399
CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT

621
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,934
Okay. That looks good.

622
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,970
-Mr. Soma.
-Okay, let's put it together.

623
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,138
Okay.

624
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,874
I'll head to headquarters too.

625
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,543
-Okay.
-Please take care of the rest.

626
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,617
Oh…

627
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,354
Excuse me. Where is Director Nishino
of Finance?

628
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,558
I'm Nishino. Who are you?

629
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,627
I'm Hanasaki from Branch Inspection.

630
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,495
There is a case here.

631
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,265
-It needs an immediate loan approval.
-What?

632
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,640
That's ridiculous.
Why does headquarters have to clean up

633
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,375
the mess made by the branch?

634
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:43,514
Um… this is not the time to be
talking about these issues.

635
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,284
-Those at the branch and headquarters.
-What?

636
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,021
An honest company that has been
with us for over ten years is about to

637
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,290
go bankrupt because of our mistake.

638
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,793
Please help us.

639
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,169
-Hello.
<i>-It's Shinjuku's Branch Manager Tokuyama.</i>

640
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,475
-Put him through.
<i>-Okay.</i>

641
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,413
Hello.

642
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,250
Yes, she's here…

643
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,288
I see. I got it.

644
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,263
I'll look at the proposal document.

645
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,966
Thank you very much.

646
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,335
But whether I approve or not.

647
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,772
-That will depend on the proposal.
-Yes, sir.

648
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,557
LOAN PROPOSAL DOCUMENT

649
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,294
Okay. This should be good enough.

650
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,129
-Send this right away.
-Yes, sir.

651
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,430
ELECTRONIC LOAN SYSTEM

652
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,171
-Hello.
<i>-Hanasaki.</i>

653
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,072
We just sent it.

654
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,341
Okay. Excuse me.

655
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,478
Hanasaki.

656
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,946
Section Chief Haneda.

657
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,186
We uploaded the proposal document.
Please check it.

PROPOSAL NUMBER

660
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,529
KODA SANGYO

661
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,932
We'll discuss this right away.

662
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,467
I'll call soon.

663
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,804
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

664
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,358
How was it?

665
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,393
We did all we could.

666
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,096
We just have to wait.

667
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,764
We'll get ready to process it.

668
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,099
Yes.

669
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,469
-Good work.
-Not at all.

670
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,582
But why didn't Mr. Itami

671
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,552
turn in the proposal document?

672
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,023
All I can think of is that he didn't want
to finance Koda Sangyo.

673
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,125
He didn't turn it in on purpose?

674
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,694
That idiot! Why would he…

675
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,132
Did he have a personal grudge
against them?

676
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,869
So he's somehow linked with Mr. Koda?

677
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,239
There's something that I've been
wondering about.

678
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,375
What is it?

679
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,410
Itami was in the Sales Division

680
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,313
for about two months after he came here.

681
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,182
-I see.
-It happened then.

682
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,886
Itami processed the wrong amount
on a transfer slip, and that customer

683
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,889
was President Koda.

684
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:18,529
This is not good. This ended up
causing trouble for our customers.

685
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,597
I see.

686
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,168
Then please fill this out.
We will deposit the rest.

687
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,405
Deposit the rest? This was your mistake,

688
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,407
so you should process the correction.

689
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,275
But this is easier.

690
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,413
You're not going to apologize?

691
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,283
It's only 500,000 yen.

692
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,752
Are you serious?

693
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,259
What? He's holding a grudge
just for something like that?

694
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,128
That's most likely it…

695
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:57,835
Itami is someone
that can't apologize to people.

696
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,004
He's too proud.

697
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,707
He's probably never had anyone
get mad at him before.

698
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,044
He's an elite with a sheltered upbringing
so he's not thick-skinned.

699
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,246
But even so…

700
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,849
Mr. Koda is here.

701
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,688
I was only able to get ten million yen.

702
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,692
We asked headquarters
for an emergency loan for 50 million.

703
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,295
-Really?
-Yes.

704
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,565
But we don't know
if it'll make it in time.

705
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,868
I see… but…

706
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,871
-Thank you very much.
-Not at all.

707
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,041
Mr. Koda, please sit down.

708
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,448
Yes.

709
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,385
Thank you.

710
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,156
-Please process it.
-Yes.

711
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,428

713
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,583
PROCESS

714
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,118
It's done!

715
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,586
The check won't bounce.

716
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,289
-All right!
-We did it!

717
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,526
-We did it.
-Thank you!

718
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,329
Yes.

719
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,139
What's going on?

720
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,376
-What were you doing?
-Visiting customers.

721
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,777
I don't care about that.

722
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,549
Why didn't you submit Koda Sangyo's
proposal document?

723
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,451
Today was the settlement day.

724
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,753
What? Was it today?

725
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,689
You're saying you didn't know?

726
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,759
I must have forgot.

727
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,695
And what happened?

728
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,264
We were able to avoid
the check from bouncing.

729
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:09,934
I see.

730
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,842
"I see"? That's all you can say?

731
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,277
A company was about to go down
because of you.

732
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,215
I told you, I just forgot.

733
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,653
I'm working on a big contract,
so I've got my hands full.

734
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,757
Is it true that you really forgot?

735
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,959
Yeah.

736
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,094
Is that so?

737
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,665
You had a personal grudge
against President Koda,

738
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,835
and that's why you didn't want to
finance his company. Right?

739
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,240
What are you saying?

740
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,746
This is a half-written proposal document
that was saved

741
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,314
in your computer.

742
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,315
PROPOSAL DOCUMENT

743
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,153
You looked?

744
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,788
Then you remember this?

745
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,860
"Unstable company with no future prospect.

746
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,696
Low profit, with lots of competition.

747
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,566
May not last the next three years."

748
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,637
It's written as if to prevent them
from getting a loan.

749
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,374
But you must have thought

750
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,110
that your boss would still
approve the loan.

751
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,713
That's why you purposely
didn't turn in the proposal document,

752
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,550
to make it seem like there was no
loan proposal at all.

753
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:38,155
You talked to President Koda as if
the approval was denied, and turned down

754
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,657
the loan on your own accord,

755
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,726
without telling your boss.

756
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,364
Did you think you'd be able to
pull it off?

757
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,336
That's just your imagination.

758
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,706
You're an outsider, so stay quiet.

759
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,576
No, I won't stay quiet.

760
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,583
You started this proposal five days ago.

761
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,885
It clearly says on here

762
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,955
that the settlement day is today.

763
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,457
So let me ask again.

764
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,361
Is it true that you really forgot?

765
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:32,009
Our mistake has

766
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:36,246
caused you lots of trouble.
We're very sorry.

767
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,416
It's okay. Please raise your head.

768
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,454
Apologize to him!

769
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,410
It all worked out.

770
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,413
You didn't go bankrupt.

771
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,018
Hey you…

772
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,024
-Hey!
-Mr. Haneda!

773
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,030
Are you sure you want to do that?

774
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,467
I can easily get rid
of a low-level banker like you.

775
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,649
What?

776
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,086
How can you say such a thing?

777
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,721
When you caused this trouble.

778
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,391
What? It's not my fault.

779
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,127
A small company that can't survive

780
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,830
without a 50-million-yen loan is bound to

781
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,932
go bankrupt sooner or later.

782
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,570
Don't you know that?

783
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,172
Are you an idiot?

784
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,610
With all due respect…

785
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,047
you are the damn idiot.

786
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,453
Have you ever thought about

787
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,424
how your single proposal can
bankrupt one company

788
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,028
and leave many employees without a job.

789
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,365
Among those employees are people

790
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:38,168
supporting their family
while paying their mortgages.

791
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,239
The happiness of those people

792
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,110
was about to be taken away
by your stupid pride.

793
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,011
That's wrong!

794
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,349
Stop this nonsense!

795
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,853
Do you know who you're speaking to?

796
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,488
I do!

797
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,957
You've only been here for four years,

798
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,992
so you're just a rookie banker who has

799
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,794
no knowledge of the bank!

800
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:10,134
Mr. Itami, in the future

801
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,170
you may become a manager over many people.

802
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,707
But right now,

803
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,210
you're a nobody!

804
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,204
Dad, choose where you want to go
from here.

805
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,672
-What?
-Hot spring.

806
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,940
You wanted to go, right?

807
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,776
But that's when you get a husband.

808
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,811
But I don't have one.

809
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,948
-So come with me.
-But I'm in the red this month.

810
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,784
I'll take you, since it's Father's Day.

811
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,586
What?

812
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,488
-I'll be off.
-Okay, bye.

813
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,160
That girl.

814
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:47,297
Don't think that you can get on my
good side with…

815
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,067
Natural hot spring from the source?

816
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,610
Chairman Itami's son

817
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,746
will get a strong
disciplinary action, right?

818
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah.

819
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,950
It can't be helped, since he did
something unacceptable.

820
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,986
But will that be all right?

821
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,789
The Ginza Redevelopment Project.

822
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,092
What if it goes down the drain?

823
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,794
Branch Inspection

824
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,497
did something unnecessary again.

825
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,468
This is the result of them
saving one company.

826
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,738
Well that's true, but…

827
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,241
I heard that Chairman Itami

828
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,911
really dotes on his son.

829
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,580
I…

830
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,750
don't think they did anything wrong.

831
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,825
Today's inspection is Hamamatsu Branch.

832
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,329
Hamamatsu is famous for eels, right?

833
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,665
How can you be so cheerful?

834
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,767
Why?

835
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,902
I'm losing my appetite

836
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,406
thinking of how Mr. Shindo
must be so mad about Itami Junior.

837
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,876
Then would you have let
Koda Sangyo go bankrupt?

838
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,778
Of course not.

839
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,113
Then we had no choice.

840
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,516
That's true, but…

841
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,918
Hey, it's best to eat eel when you

842
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,386
don't have an appetite.

843
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,824
-Yes, it's very nutritious.
-All right, let's go Mr. Soma.

844
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,592
You're so positive.

845
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,196
Eel, eel…

846
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,069
HR is asking about the disciplinary action

847
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,171
for Seiichiro Itami.

848
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,640
How should I answer them?

849
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,515
Have HR take care of him.

850
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,185
What?

851
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,057
Once the dust settles,
send him to a different branch.

852
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,226
But then that wouldn't be

853
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,929
a disciplinary action.

854
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,398
Is there an issue?

855
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:09,072
A company called Koda Sangyo received
a loan of 50 million yen.

856
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,608
They didn't go bankrupt either.

857
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,583
It's all about the result.

858
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,386
That's how a bank works.

859
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,158
Oh, I want to eat whitebait too.

860
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,227
No, let's go with eel.

861
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,497
-Whitebait.
-Eel.

862
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,335
FINALLY THE LAST EPISODE

863
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,937
10,000 people's payroll data is lost.

864
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,005
Lost?

865
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,240
This is a big problem.

866
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,809
-I'm very sorry.
-How are you handling the press?

867
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,244
What are you guys doing?

868
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,645
Where did the data go?

869
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,882
Everyone here can be dispatched somewhere.

870
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,917
You'll get dispatched somewhere.

871
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,619
With all due respect…

872
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,655
It's wrong to blame things on
innocent people.

873
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,624
-Shut up!
-No, I will not.

874
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,659
Dissolve Branch Inspection.

875
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,996
Hanasaki, you're not wrong.

876
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,265
