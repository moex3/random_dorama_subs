1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,975
LIMITED TO 20 SERVINGS A DAY!

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,479
Twenty!

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,915
-Yes, I made it in time.
-Ouch!

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,150
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,119
It's okay…

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,155
-Mr. Soma.
-Hanasaki.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,257
-Why are you here?
-What about you?

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,692
You said you want soba.

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,627
You said you'd be at the cafeteria.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,998
-Oh.
-You were going to leave me behind.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,307
-It's delicious.
-Delicious!

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,545
It's the classic, traditional flavor.
Awesome.

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,647
It's just as I expected.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,216
I've been wanting to come here
for a long time.

15
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,485
The Ginza Front City is so amazing.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,988
There will be lots of new stores
opening up too.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,424
It'll be great if they make a multiplex.

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,426
I might stop by every day after work.

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,531
The Itami Group's Ginza Redevelopment
Project has everyone's hopes up.

20
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,801
Yeah, it's a huge project that's
expected to change

21
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,402
the city of Ginza.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,138
But thinking of Itami

23
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,041
brought back bad memories.

24
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,176
The heir?

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,577
Yes.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,879
Stop this nonsense!

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,382
Do you know who you're speaking to?

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,884
I'm getting really angry again.

29
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,287
Stop reminding me of that.

30
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,255
It's ruining our meal.

31
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,491
That's right. Let's forget it.

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,661
I forgot.

33
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,264
-That was delicious.
-Yeah.

34
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,899
I wanted to try the croquette.

35
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,302
The hashed beef and Naporitan too.

36
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,605
It's worth going back there to
try their entire menu.

37
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,040
I agree.

38
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,843
But there are lots of other places
I want to try too.

39
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,080
Marunouchi has so many options for lunch.

40
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,483
-Ah.
-Ah.

41
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,718
Hello.

42
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,453
SEIICHIRO ITAMI
HEIR TO THE ITAMI GROUP

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,288
Why are you at headquarters?

44
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,192
I was transferred to HR a week ago.

45
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,296
I couldn't stay at the Shinjuku Branch
after what happened.

46
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,133
Since you treated me so badly.

47
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,568
You are the damn idiot.

48
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,003
In the future,

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,540
you may become a manager over many people.

50
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,043
But right now,

51
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,113
you're a nobody!

52
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,654
Well, soon enough I'm sure I'll be sent to

53
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,690
a big branch somewhere within the city.

54
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,959
I see.

55
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,530
I'm off to eat lunch now,

56
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,331
do you know any good places?

57
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,434
-Good places…
-There aren't any.

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,637
This place is so barren.

59
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,405
-Right, Mr. Soma?
-You're right.

60
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,141
There were so many

61
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,944
good restaurants
around the Shinjuku Branch.

62
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,846
Bye.

63
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,826
He gets me so mad!

64
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,262
It's ridiculous that he didn't
get punished

65
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,798
for trying to destroy a company.

66
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,200
They probably couldn't

67
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,936
dispose of the son of Itami Group.

68
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,240
The person who made HR take care of him

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,409
is General Manager Shindo.

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,378
-Really?
-Yeah.

71
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,981
It would be a big problem
if the chairman gets mad

72
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,517
and decides to put
the redevelopment project

73
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,751
down the drain.

74
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,089
The chairman apparently dotes on his son.

75
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,192
I guess a stupid son still seems cute
to his father.

76
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,095
-How nauseating.
-Mr. Soma.

77
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,663
How about some oysters?

78
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,132
-They're rock oysters.
-You can eat them raw.

79
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,901
You can also grill them.

80
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,638
-That sounds good.
-I want some too.

81
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,273
They're a bit pricey, though.

82
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,609
Give us a discount.
We haven't gotten paid.

83
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,545
-I can't negotiate that.
-What?

84
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:10,283
Wait. You pay for your meals here?

85
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,087
Yes. He charges me for everything
I eat and drink here.

86
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,924
Oh wow, I thought you weren't paying
since you're his daughter.

87
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,193
No, he won't even give me a discount.

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,195
I can't spoil her like that.

89
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,864
I have to draw the line there
or else it would be

90
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,332
rude to my customers.

91
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,468
You're amazing.

92
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,437
I knew you'd understand me, Mr. Soma.

93
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,872
Yes.

94
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,441
I'm so impressed with
your parenting philosophy.

95
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,377
-You're so understanding.
-Not at all.

96
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,911
I'm nothing compared to you.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,415
JUNE 25TH
WEDNESDAY

98
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,450
What?

99
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,551
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
PLEASE TRY AGAIN

100
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,719
Why?

101
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,491
150,000 YEN

102
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,893
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
PLEASE TRY AGAIN

103
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,296
What? My paycheck isn't deposited?

104
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,931
That can't be.
Are you sure you're doing it right?

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,634
What?

106
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,369
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
PLEASE TRY AGAIN

107
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,974
Yes, this is Sales Division Two.
Please wait.

108
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,877
Mr. Sakata, it's accounting
from Itami Holdings.

109
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,811
Okay.

110
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,546
ASSISTANT GM OF SALES DIVISION TWO

111
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,814
Hello.

112
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,317
ITAMI HOLDINGS

113
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,387
Mr. Sakata, the employees
haven't received their salaries.

114
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,157
What? Didn't receive them?

115
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,825
That can't be.

116
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,729
There's trouble!

117
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,432
-Ita…
-Ita?

118
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,369
-What's "Ita"?
-Mr. Shibasaki, please calm down.

119
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,375
-Go to the main meeting room.
-What?

120
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,579
You two were chosen as members
of the investigation committee.

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,416
Investigation? For what?

122
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,220
The salary data of over
10,000 Itami Group employees

123
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,421
have disappeared!

124
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,925
Disappeared?

125
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,895
-What will we do in this committee?
-Not sure.

126
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,700
This is my first time
in the main building.

127
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,937
It really feels like a traditional bank.

128
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,741
Employees like us usually don't
have a chance to visit

129
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,542
these types of meeting rooms.

130
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,646
I'm getting nervous.

131
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,041
General Manager Shindo.

132
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,745
Good mor-- ouch!

133
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:00,520
The investigation committee's meeting
regarding the lost salary data

134
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,188
will now begin.

135
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,992
Right now, there is a huge commotion

136
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,629
among the Itami Group's employees
and their families.

137
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,498
Chairman Itami is furious,

138
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,667
so our president has

139
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,170
instructed the investigation committee

140
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,373
to be made under Mr. Shindo's command.

141
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,643
In order to solve this issue
as quickly as possible,

142
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,346
we asked capable members
from each department to join this team.

143
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,148
That's all of you.

144
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,385
They're expecting a lot from us.

145
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,588
The sales representative will
give us details

146
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,724
on the current status and situation.

147
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,563
-Mr. Sakata.
-You know him?

148
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,833
He helped me a lot when I was
in the Akasaka Branch.

149
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,937
I'm Nakagawa,
the Director of Sales Division Two.

150
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,674
I'm Sakata.
I'm in charge of the Itami Group.

151
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,446
I received a call this morning at 9:35
from accounting at the Itami Group,

152
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,116
saying that their salary hasn't been
deposited even though it's payday.

153
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,453
I thought it wasn't processed,
so I went to Operations…

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,121
SALARY TRANSFER LIST

155
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,991
We haven't received that data.

156
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,293
That can't be…

157
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,298
ITAMI HOLDINGS

158
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,369
We found out that the data

159
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,805
was never sent to the operations center.

160
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,010
Mr. Sakata, how are

161
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,980
the salary data processed
for the transfers?

162
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,916
For the Itami Group,

163
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,188
we physically hand over
this magnetic tape.

164
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,157
Five days ago, on June 20th,

165
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,194
I went to the accounting department

166
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,496
at Itami Holdings

167
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,164
and received the data…

168
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,837
I placed it inside the designated locker
in the Sales Division.

169
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,011
TO THE OPERATION CENTER

170
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,415
Usually from there, either Iseki or Kameda

171
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,717
takes it to the Operation Center.

172
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,020
I was very busy that day,

173
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,656
so I left the office right away,

174
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,659
and when I came back the slips were gone,

175
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,327
so I thought someone

176
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,130
took care of it,
and I failed to verify that.

177
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,000
But when I asked today,

178
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,937
they both said that they did not
process it.

179
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,540
We knew that the salary data
for the Itami Group

180
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,310
had to be sent in by that day,

181
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,079
but we all thought that someone else

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,214
had processed it.

183
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,254
It was a lack of confirmation.

184
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,291
I guess they had gotten complacent
over time.

185
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,060
A small open seam,

186
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,128
mistake,

187
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,067
and minor negligence leads
to a huge problem.

188
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,838
That's the risk we take as someone
who works in a business

189
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,640
like the bank.

190
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,242
You guys

191
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,645
seem to have forgotten that!

192
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm very sorry!

193
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,854
This problematic incident
matters for two reasons.

194
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:26,559
Number one.
If by any chance this salary data

195
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,861
is leaked to an outside source,

196
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,199
it will be the biggest failure
in the history of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

197
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,435
Second.

198
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,472
The Itami Group's

199
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,642
Ginza Redevelopment Project.

200
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,946
This is the greatest chance for us
to place this bank

201
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,681
above the rest.

202
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,685
But because of this incident,

203
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,920
not only may we not become
the coordinator,

204
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,659
we may also not even be able to
take part in the project.

205
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,762
Finding the data,

206
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,363
and controlling the situation,

207
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,433
should be prioritized above all else.

208
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,201
Please remember that.

209
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,336
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,805
Director Karashima.

211
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,174
You've been investigating, right?

212
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,109
Yes.

213
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,446
There's a possibility that it dropped

214
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,182
somewhere on its way
to the Operation Center,

215
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,420
so security and other employees
are searching everywhere from

216
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:31,223
the Sales Division, Foreign Exchange
Division, and the Operation Center.

217
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,359
But we have not found it yet.

218
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,227
Either way,

219
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,198
finding the lost data is our top priority.

220
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,602
Um…

221
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,570
Huh?

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,108
What is it, Hanasaki?

223
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,581
Isn't there a possibility

224
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,084
that it was stolen?

225
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:07,426
Are you saying that someone
in Sales Division Two

226
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,328
stole the data?

227
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,497
Ah… no, but…

228
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,700
we can't rule out the possibility
that it was stolen

229
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,569
due to someone's malicious intent.

230
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,441
-Search that route.
-Yes, sir.

231
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,680
Work hard.

232
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,815
Yes, sir.

233
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,684
Mr. Karashima, a word please.

234
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,885
Yes.

235
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,757
What's wrong with you?

236
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,126
I told you to be quiet!

237
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,963
-Sorry, I couldn't resist…
-There you go again. You couldn't resist.

238
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,298
I'll fine you the next time you say that.

239
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,134
-500 yen each time.
-How expensive!

240
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,139
Let's start by checking the entry record
for the sales floor.

241
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,609
Let's also check the security camera.

242
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,977
Oh yeah, that's right.

243
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,646
Hold on. We will do that.

244
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,181
We can't give such

245
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,718
important tasks to Branch Inspection.

246
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,754
Mr. Kodama, we can appoint tasks
on our own, right?

247
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,324
Yes, please do that.

248
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,894
We at the Planning Division

249
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,197
will interview everyone who entered
the sales floor.

250
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,032
PR is media.

251
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,469
Administration,
please have the data reissued.

252
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,175
Why is Branch Inspection here?

253
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,210
I chose them to represent

254
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,479
the Branch Managing Department.

255
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,550
They've resolved many issues
within the bank.

256
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,052
This is not a small issue within a branch.

257
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,424
This is a crisis that could rock
the foundation of this bank's credibility.

258
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,928
That's why Hanasaki's unique perspective

259
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
will be of help.

260
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,966
Director Karashima.

261
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,302
I spoke to the president the other day,

262
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:02,074
but during the next structural change,
I plan to create a new department

263
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,544
within Corporate Planning, that will
function as branch inspectors.

264
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
What do you mean?

265
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,915
Then what will happen?

266
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,618
Branch Inspection

267
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,886
will be dissolved.

268
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,489
Those two are always

269
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,726
going beyond their role
as branch inspectors.

270
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,996
-But…
-Isn't it because of you?

271
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,198
Letting them do whatever they want?

272
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,611
BRANCH INSPECTION

273
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,548
Wow.

274
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,018
This many people came into
this building on

275
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,987
June 20th?

276
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,622
It's more than I thought.

277
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,792
We have to find someone suspicious
out of all these people, right?

278
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,228
This is just a person making a delivery.

279
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,831
This won't give us any clues.

280
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,635
VISITOR APPLICATION SLIP

281
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,238
Hey Hanasaki, let's say that
what you said was true,

282
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,340
and someone did steal the data.

283
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,077
Do you have any idea
who the culprit might be?

284
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,079
Not really…

285
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,482
Just as I thought.

286
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,719
But it's someone who knows
how the data is passed along, right?

287
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,323
So it's someone within the bank.

288
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,091
Or so I think.

289
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,960
And the motive?

290
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,932
The salary data has
personal information on it such as

291
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,667
their full name and earnings.

292
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,202
-Yeah.
-They might be selling that.

293
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,538
But is that worth

294
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,541
sacrificing your current job
and future prospects for?

295
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,476
You'd be dismissed if you were caught.

296
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,478
That's true…

297
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,416
Isn't it more realistic to think that

298
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,984
it's just harassment?

299
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,187
I see. Someone who has a grudge
against our bank?

300
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,556
-Or against the Itami Group.
-Yeah.

301
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,992
Or against Mr. Sakata.

302
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,328
But Mr. Sakata isn't someone

303
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,763
who would incur someone's hatred.

304
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,600
He's really nice, diligent,
and takes care of his subordinates.

305
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,171
It could be resentment.

306
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,140
I see.

307
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,380
We don't have time for this.

308
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,016
-What?
-Mr. Soma, let's go to the Sales Division.

309
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,851
To do what?

310
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,953
It's the scene of the crime.

311
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,755
We need to check the scene.

312
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,323
What are you, the police?

313
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,234
ITAMI HOLDINGS

314
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,370
We're very sorry.

315
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,041
You haven't found it yet?

316
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,276
What do you mean?

317
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,680
We set up an investigation committee
so our employees can

318
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,715
join forces together.

319
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,017
Since this happened,

320
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,453
we will require a satisfactory explanation

321
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,022
of the cause of this incident.

322
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
Of course.

323
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,259
We will investigate the cause

324
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,827
and report back.

325
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,362
Mr. Shindo,

326
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,132
if by any chance the data is leaked,

327
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,570
I will no longer use your bank to finance

328
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,539
the Ginza Redevelopment Project.

329
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,778
And it seems like your bank's

330
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,313
Shinjuku Branch humiliated

331
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,150
my son the other day.

332
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,186
I'm very sorry.

333
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,123
But can you please give us time

334
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,926
before making your final decision?

335
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,363
Chairman Itami, we will redeem ourselves

336
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,133
by settling this issue as quickly
as possible.

337
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,134
We're very sorry.

338
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,613
-That's it, right?
-Yeah.

339
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,553
Mr. Sakata.

340
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,687
Hey.

341
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,757
Wow, Nanami.

342
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,259
She's so big now.

343
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,961
She's in first grade now.

344
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:20,299
Is that right? She probably doesn't
remember me anymore.

345
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,339
ITAMI HOLDINGS

346
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,607
EISUKE SAKATA

347
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,879
Mr. Sakata,

348
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,882
I'm sorry for being frank,

349
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,852
but does someone have a grudge
against you?

350
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,388
You're saying that the person who did this
has a grudge against me?

351
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,524
That's a possibility.

352
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,394
I can't think of anyone…

353
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,863
I see.

354
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,234
I feel very bad

355
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,069
for everyone at the Itami Group.

356
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,205
There are people

357
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,841
who need to pay for things on payday.

358
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,945
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,681
I have to go apologize to them again.

360
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,782
Excuse me.

361
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,825
Should we ask the subordinates?

362
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,293
Yes.

363
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,365
Did you see the magnetic tape
with the Itami Group's salary data

364
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,699
last Friday?

365
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,501
No, I did not.

366
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,236
If I did, I would've delivered it.

367
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,706
That was the routine, right?

368
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,543
Yes, Mr. Sakata came up with it.

369
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,978
I just did what Mr. Sakata told me to do.

370
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,982
Do you suspect me

371
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,350
of stealing it?

372
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,020
No, that's not it…

373
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,421
My job

374
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,457
is to take the data from the locker
to the Operation Center.

375
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,727
And plus, the person in charge
of transferring the salary

376
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,995
is Mr. Sakata.

377
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,900
Everybody is so selfish.

378
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,135
What?

379
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,971
They're too busy trying to
defend themselves.

380
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,741
The only person thinking about
the customers is Mr. Sakata.

381
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,443
You're right.

382
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,046
How disappointing.

383
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,381
-Ah.
-Ouch!

384
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,450
I'm sorry… oh.

385
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,454
Try to be more careful.

386
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,523
Do you know how much these cost?

387
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,024
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, Kameda.

389
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,395
-What?
-Hello.

390
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:34,099
-You know each other?
-He was my senior in university.

391
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,801
I'll be leaving now.

392
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,841
What are you doing with him?

393
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,079
Oh, let me guess.

394
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,848
Because our company's data is lost?

395
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,351
Something like that.

396
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,719
That's a shame.

397
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,888
Is this bank all right?

398
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,692
Well, do your best.

399
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,497
He's so annoying!

400
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,066
He was as arrogant as always.

401
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,571
And he addressed the Itami Group as
"our company."

402
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,006
Yes, he did.

403
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,609
He's not aware that he's an employee
at Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

404
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,211
Yeah.

405
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,281
There's trouble.

406
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,417
Look how big it's being featured.

407
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,619
What? Let me see it.

408
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,023
System trouble for Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

409
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,427
10,000 people's salaries
have been delayed.

410
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,034
What's going on with the media?

411
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,202
I'm very sorry.

412
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,272
What about the salary transfer
for the Itami Group?

413
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,008
We had the data reissued
and processed right away,

414
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,245
but accounts with an outside bank
will not get it today.

415
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,448
What about everyone who entered
the sales floor?

416
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,784
We talked with everyone

417
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,688
whose ID card came up on the entry record,
but we didn't find

418
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,789
any lead.

419
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,392
We're also checking the security camera
footage by the entrance,

420
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,628
but we haven't found anything

421
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,096
at the moment.

422
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,200
That's not good enough!

423
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,136
-Branch Inspection?
-Oh… um…

424
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,973
Nothing to note.

425
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,941
Unbelievable…

426
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,078
What have you all been doing?

427
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,081
Why did it disappear?

428
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,218
Where did the salary data go?

429
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,621
Why doesn't anyone

430
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,423
have any answers.

431
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,394
Do whatever is necessary to give me

432
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,830
a satisfactory answer by tomorrow.

433
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,965
Yes, sir.

434
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:52,270
I guess even General Manager Shindo
raises his voice like that, huh.

435
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,341
It's a big problem that is putting
his career at risk.

436
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,144
I guess the life of a banker is
pretty tough.

437
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,812
Hey, Mai.

438
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,649
You should give up on your dream
of becoming a banker's wife.

439
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,851
It seems hard.

440
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,987
How long are you planning
to keep that up, Dad?

441
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,957
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Soma.
Never even once

442
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,259
did I dream of becoming a banker's wife.

443
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,061
Yes, you have.

444
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,830
When? What year? What month?
What day, and what time?

445
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,765
Oh…

446
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,600
I don't remember…

447
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,040
Sakata?

448
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,843
-From Sales Division Two?
-His wife.

449
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,812
I'm friends with his wife too.

450
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,883
<i>Ms. Hanasaki, I heard that</i>
<i>you met my husband today.</i>

451
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,885
<i>Please come visit us again.</i>

452
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,288
<i>Nanami remembers you</i>
<i>and wants to see you again.</i>

453
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,489
She's cute.

454
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,859
It seems like

455
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,296
Mr. Sakata didn't tell her about
what happened at work.

456
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,865
-Mr. Soma.
-Yeah?

457
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,201
Mr. Sakata won't be

458
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,304
dismissed because of this incident,
will he?

459
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,109
If the data was stolen,
instead of being lost,

460
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,144
it will be the culprit's responsibility.

461
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,581
I don't know.

462
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,983
Mr. Sakata

463
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,853
is dedicated
and is kind to his subordinates.

464
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,622
He was always empathetic
with the customer too.

465
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,826
Those people should get promoted.

466
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,330
We have to find the culprit.

467
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,545
ITAMI HOLDINGS

468
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,590
ITAMI HOLDINGS

469
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,729
This is the data.

470
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,666
-What?
-The Itami Group's salary data was found?

471
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,801
Yes.

472
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:03,735
Where?

473
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,037
The men's restroom on the seventh floor.

474
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,108
What?

475
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,777
It was found within the bank,

476
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,412
but you don't know who did it?

477
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,382
We are investigating it right now.

478
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,256
Were there traces of the file
being opened by someone?

479
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,290
No.

480
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,159
Then the data won't be leaked?

481
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,828
It shouldn't be.

482
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,831
That's a silver lining to all this.

483
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,299
Finding the data

484
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,503
hasn't resolved this case at all.

485
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,409
If it was found in the bathroom,

486
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,812
it means that someone had
taken it on purpose, right?

487
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,681
That's right.

488
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,919
So the culprit is within this bank.

489
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,087
That's highly possible.

490
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,391
-Let's find the culprit, Mr. Soma.
-What?

491
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,926
The security camera.

492
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,862
The Planning Division combed through
those vid--

493
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,464
They might have missed something.

494
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,399
But still…

495
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,268
The culprit is definitely in the footage.

496
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,239
Someone in this bank caused
everyone this trouble.

497
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,007
It's unforgivable.

498
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,976
And if we find the culprit,

499
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,078
Mr. Sakata might not be punished.

500
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,380
-But…
-Okay, let's go Mr. Soma.

501
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,649
-What are you doing?
-Let's hurry it up.

502
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,218
-Ouch.
-Hurry up.

503
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,795
-This is the file for June 20th.
-Thank you.

504
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,030
Some people looked at this yesterday too.

505
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,533
We apologize for bothering you again.

506
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,706
There's so much traffic
in this department.

507
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,075
It's not just employees either.

508
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,812
But it only shows people going in and out.

509
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,816
So it'll be difficult to find a clue here.

510
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:58,750
Yes.

511
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,021
Oh, it's Mr. Sakata. He came back.

512
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,791
So the magnetic tape entered
the building at this point.

513
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:07,792
Yes.

514
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,165
This person…

515
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,735
went in without using the ID card.

516
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,753
It's the same person.

517
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,495
-It's the same person.
-Did you find something?

518
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,865
This person went in
without using his ID card,

519
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,834
and he's hiding behind someone
when he comes out.

520
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,369
How strange.

521
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,240
It's almost as if he doesn't want to
leave a record of entering this floor.

522
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,474
Right?

523
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,512
Could this be the culprit?

524
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,015
Who is this?

525
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,052
We can't tell because he's not
showing his face.

526
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,356
What about characteristics?
His suit, way of walking, or size?

527
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,392
How can I find that…

528
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,265
-Oh!
-What?

529
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,834
Mr. Soma…

530
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,470
I think I found the culprit.

531
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,605
What?

532
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,427
It was you?

533
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,764
Why did you call me out here?

534
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,767
I wanted to ask you something.

535
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,771
What? I don't care to talk with you.

536
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,079
Mr. Itami.

537
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,050
You're the one that stole
the Itami Group's salary data.

538
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,118
Am I right?

539
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,186
What?

540
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,956
What are you saying?

541
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,259
We found evidence to prove
that you're the culprit.

542
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,499
CORPORATE PLANNING DIVISION
GENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE

543
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,701
What do you mean?

544
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,470
Our salary data

545
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,839
was found in the bathroom

546
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:39,077
of your company but you still don't know
who the culprit is?

547
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,945
I'm very sorry.

548
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,481
We are investigating it right now.

549
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,482
Investigating it?

550
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,019
Don't tell me

551
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:51,422
that one of your employees did this.

552
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,492
If so,

553
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,896
this is a big problem.

554
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,533
There's trouble! Mr. Seiichiro Itami…

555
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,702
What happened to him?

556
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,538
Ah…

557
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,141
Answer me!

558
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,147
This was captured from footage

559
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:20,218
taken by the security camera
of the sales floor last Friday.

560
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,822
This person went in
without using his ID card,

561
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,758
and a few minutes later

562
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,428
came out while hiding behind someone.

563
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,264
This is you, isn't it?

564
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,003
On that day,

565
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,341
you entered Sales Division Two
without using your ID card

566
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,418
and stole the Itami Group's salary data…

567
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,688
OUT TO OPERATION CENTER

568
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,799
Then you left by hiding from
the security camera.

569
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,371
If important data is lost,
people will check

570
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,440
everyone who entered the floor.

571
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,843
That's why you didn't leave any record

572
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,212
and hid from the camera.

573
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,683
So that no one would ever suspect you.

574
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,820
Stop this nonsense.

575
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,822
How do you know that that person is me?

576
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,291
What if you're wrong?

577
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,160
-You still don't get it?
-What?

578
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,599
These are the expensive pair of shoes

579
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,402
that you're so proud of.

580
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,740
-Oh.
-Ouch!

581
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,209
Do you know how much these cost?

582
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,085
Why don't you confess?

583
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,889
You can't make excuses anymore.

584
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,062
We found out that you stole the data.

585
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,132
But we couldn't figure out

586
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,434
how you knew the details

587
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,703
of the data processing.

588
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,107
Then we realized something.

589
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,912
You know someone in Sales Division Two.

590
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,584
I told Mr. Itami about

591
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:37,455
when the Itami Group's salary data
will be sent in and how it's usually

592
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,023
processed.

593
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,292
And the password to the locker?

594
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,729
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,766
Mr. Itami threatened me by saying,

596
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,668
"Do you know what will happen if you

597
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,570
don't listen to me?"

598
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,406
Mr. Kameda

599
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,976
told us everything.

600
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,249
On June 20th,

601
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,019
you stole the Itami Group's salary data,

602
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,123
and then you placed it
in the men's bathroom this morning.

603
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,491
ITAMI HOLDINGS

604
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,502
Yeah, it was me.

605
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,437
But so what?

606
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,207
It's not a big deal.

607
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,942
I returned the data too.

608
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,543
Why did you do this?

609
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,445
It's revenge.

610
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,914
For Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

611
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,154
I thought I'd humiliate this bank.

612
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,155
Humiliate?

613
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,325
I was treated badly
at the Shinjuku Branch.

614
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,596
This bank is the worst.

615
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,966
But I'm forced to

616
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,268
do boring tasks here every day.

617
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,604
I'm so sick and tired of it.

618
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,407
I want to quit right away,

619
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,309
but my dad tells me to stay here
for two more years.

620
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,246
You caused trouble

621
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,848
for many people for of a reason like that?

622
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,985
Stop exaggerating.

623
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,587
All that happened was
the salary was delayed.

624
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,192
Tokyo Daiichi Bank was humiliated
a little bit,

625
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,660
but it didn't hurt anyone.

626
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,263
You have worked at a bank

627
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,865
for three years, and yet you don't know

628
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,437
how much trouble it causes people
when their salary is delayed?

629
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,806
I don't care.

630
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,748
Are you going to hit me?

631
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,654
Do you know what will happen
if you do that?

632
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,657
You'll get transferred for sure.

633
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,038
Mr. Itami.

634
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,143
You may not be able to stand

635
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,012
working here at the bank.

636
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,651
But everyone who's working here
is gritting their teeth

637
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,187
and doing their job

638
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,823
every single day.

639
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,794
Because that's what it means to work.

640
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,331
What you did

641
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,401
is something despicable that insulted

642
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,004
not only everyone in this company

643
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,442
but every hard working employee

644
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,511
in this world.

645
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,914
You want to quit right away?

646
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,351
Give me a break.

647
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,190
You are not qualified to work here
in the first place.

648
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:13,171
Listen, Dad! These people are horrible!

649
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,357
What have you done?

650
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,367
Sorry for causing you trouble.

651
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,371
I'm very sorry.

652
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,211
Mr. Itami,

653
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,514
please raise your head.

654
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,027
I heard what you said.

655
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,129
It seems like

656
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,000
I didn't raise my son the right way.

657
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,005
I have to teach him from the ground up.

658
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,646
Thank you for making me realize that.

659
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,958
Seiichiro.

660
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,028
Let's go.

661
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,783
You…

662
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,253
ran off on your own again.

663
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,101
Good work, everyone.

664
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,936
Cheers!

665
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,909
I was so surprised.

666
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,012
I didn't think Mr. Shindo
and Chairman Itami would come.

667
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,815
I really thought I was
going to get punched.

668
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,985
You two are always making me worry.

669
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,789
I've lost my appetite ever since
Hanasaki came.

670
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,893
It's delicious.

671
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,896
I'm happy to hear that, Mr. Shibasaki.

672
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,765
I've heard about this place from Soma,

673
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,468
but it's really delicious.
Right, Mr. Karashima?

674
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,604
Yes. I'll be coming by again.

675
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,240
I don't want all of my bosses
to come here.

676
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:07,411
Mr. Karashima, are you the one that
recommended my daughter

677
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,480
go to headquarters?

678
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,915
What are you asking?

679
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,384
Because there's no way you can go to

680
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,787
headquarters without being
recommended by someone with power.

681
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,623
It's not like you're especially
talented or pretty

682
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,193
and you're strong-willed and scary.

683
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,295
Do you have to go that far?

684
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,297
I chose Ms. Hanasaki.

685
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,866
-What?
-So it's true?

686
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,569
I heard about your work at the branch,

687
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,271
and I thought someone like you would
be able to

688
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,841
change the old-fashioned ways of the bank.

689
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,445
Thank you for thinking so highly

690
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,413
of my daughter.

691
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,281
Good for you, Hanasaki.

692
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,717
That hurts.

693
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,519
-This is on me!
-Wow!

694
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,721
-Thank you.
-It looks delicious.

695
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,890
Wow. Thank you.

696
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:56,694
Branch Inspection will be dissolved.

697
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,031
-It's as good as always.
-I'm glad.

698
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,634
-It's better than last year.
-What?

699
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,738
I thought we were done for,

700
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,642
but that seemed to be
a blessing in disguise.

701
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,010
Yes!

702
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,881
What should we do now?

703
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,451
Even the media found out
about this scandal,

704
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,288
so it will be trouble if they find out
that it wasn't lost but that it was

705
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,689
stolen by an employee.

706
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,459
What are you saying?

707
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,360
What?

708
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,998
There was no theft by an employee.

709
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:34,965
What?

710
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,202
The Itami Group's salary data

711
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,807
was lost because of mismanagement,

712
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,909
but it was safely found.

713
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,813
That's all that happened this time.

714
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:56,387
This is an unexpected chance that you
and the branch inspectors created.

715
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,994
I will take full advantage of it.

716
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,234
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

717
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,543
EISUKE SAKATA ASSISTANT GM
OF SALES DIVISION TWO

718
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,644
ISAO NAKAGAWA GM OF SALES DIVISION TWO

719
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,246
NEW POST HOKUETSU DAIICHI KOGYO
NEW POST MORIMURAKAWA BRANCH

720
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,248
Why?

721
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,518
Mr. Sakata is dispatched
and Mr. Nakagawa is transferred.

722
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,986
What does this mean?

723
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,491
They're forced to take responsibility
for the incident with

724
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,092
the Itami Group's salary data.

725
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,528
But that was done by

726
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,663
Seiichiro Itami and Kameda.

727
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,366
They both admitted what they did
and resigned.

728
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,902
It's General Manager Shindo.

729
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,270
What?

730
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,541
Our bank was chosen
as the coordinating bank

731
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,476
for the Ginza Redevelopment Project.

732
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,144
OUR BANK WAS CHOSEN…

733
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,113
What does that have to do with this?

734
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,316
General Manager Shindo used this incident

735
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,219
as a negotiating tool.

736
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,621
To negotiate?

737
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,690
On paper, both Itami junior and Kameda

738
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,059
resigned voluntarily.

739
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,530
Therefore, the salary data was
never stolen

740
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,864
by an employee.

741
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,699
No way!

742
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,271
By covering up the incident
caused by Chairman Itami's son,

743
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:25,175
he got the position as coordinating bank
for the hundred-billion-yen project.

744
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,914
Mr. Sakata is going to be transferred
because of that?

745
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,983
It was only temporary,
but the data did disappear.

746
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,886
The people in connection with it
have to take the blame.

747
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,290
It wouldn't set a good example
if no one took the blame.

748
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,618
BUS TERMINAL

749
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,461
I don't want to go!

750
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,997
You can make new friends
at your new school.

751
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,766
No, I want Mina.

752
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,803
I want Mina.

753
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,204
Nanami.

754
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,175
I'll work hard at my new workplace too.

755
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,944
Let's work hard together, okay?

756
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,349
Ms. Hanasaki.

757
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,351
Hanasaki.

758
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,759
-Thanks for coming.
-No…

759
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,197
I'm not happy with this.

760
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,567
Why do you have to be dispatched?

761
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,904
Someone always has to take responsibility.

762
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,072
That's how banks work.

763
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,542
-But what happened this time…
-It's okay.

764
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,978
I knew this would happen.

765
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,083
I'll be waiting.

766
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,918
For you to come back.

767
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,465
Hanasaki, a bank is…

768
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,567
One X-mark and that's the end…

769
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,803
right?

770
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,339
But that's not right.

771
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,744
What's wrong needs to be changed.

772
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,921
That's very you, Hanasaki.

773
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,528
Bye.

774
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,263
Stay well.

775
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:03,701
Thank you. Good luck, Mr. Sakata.

776
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,171
Yes.

777
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,842
<i>How far did you go to see him off?</i>

778
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,577
Sorry.

779
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,379
The meeting is going to start.

780
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,382
It's the last meeting with
the investigation committee.

781
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,751
Didn't I tell you?

782
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,157
<i>Hello?</i>

783
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,362
Mr. Soma.

784
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,801
What does it mean to work?

785
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,203
What now?

786
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,872
Everything

787
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,541
feels so meaningless.

788
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,516
What I thought was right

789
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,185
turned out to be wrong…

790
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,524
Is there a meaning to working hard

791
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,893
in a place where

792
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,463
everything seems wrong?

793
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,470
No matter what I do,

794
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,073
or what I say,

795
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,312
I may not be able to change anything.

796
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,754
<i>Hanasaki.</i>

797
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,455
Yes.

798
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,659
I'm never going to repeat

799
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,062
what I'm about to say right now,

800
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,730
so listen well.

801
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,366
Okay.

802
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,668
Hanasaki.

803
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,606
You're not wrong.

804
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,946
<i>When something is wrong,</i>
<i>you can say that it's wrong.</i>

805
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,750
<i>That's a good thing.</i>

806
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,359
<i>Having a subordinate</i>
<i>who speaks out without</i>

807
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,361
<i>fearing anyone,</i>

808
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,631
<i>is really tiring</i>

809
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,267
<i>for a boss.</i>

810
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,605
<i>But</i>

811
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,442
<i>having one person like that…</i>

812
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,579
no, if we gradually get more
and more people like that,

813
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:08,018
this bank that you're ready to give up on…

814
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,356
may start to change.

815
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,334
Hurry up and come back.

816
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,107
Yes!

817
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,841
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

818
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,846
Thanks to everyone's efforts,

819
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:15,018
the incident with the Itami Group's
lost salary data has been resolved,

820
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,322
and we were able to get the position
as the coordinating bank

821
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:22,259
for the Ginza Redevelopment Project.

822
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,678
Soon, our bank will reign as the top bank

823
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,513
in the nation.

824
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,652
All of you should carry a sense of pride

825
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,788
as an employee of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

826
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,948
There is something I'd like to ask
General Manager Shindo.

827
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:23,320
Hey you. First, you're late,
and you're being rude. Sit down.

828
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,256
Why did Mr. Sakata and Mr. Nakagawa
of Sales Division Two

829
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,591
get transferred?

830
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,526
Hanasaki.

831
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,829
Is it because you used them
as a negotiation tool for

832
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,564
the Ginza Redevelopment Project?

833
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,903
What are you saying?
You're being very rude.

834
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,107
The data was never lost.

835
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,381
Seiichiro Itami stole it
because he resented this bank.

836
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,787
In order to twist the truth
and make it seem like the data was lost,

837
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,689
you placed the blame on innocent people.

838
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,791
That's wrong!

839
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:10,367
I prioritized what was best for the bank.

840
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,235
That's all.

841
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,473
Then what's most important to you,
is whatever

842
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,942
benefits the bank?

843
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,779
That's right.

844
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,050
Let me ask you.

845
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,053
What do you think is important?

846
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,124
The people.

847
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,629
I want the people at this bank to be
the most important thing.

848
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,169
With a naïve
and idealistic theory like that,

849
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,905
this bank will go down in three days.

850
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,178
Whatever benefits the bank will eventually

851
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,748
lead to the happiness
of everyone working here.

852
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,521
With all due respect…

853
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,492
it's not everyone.

854
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,832
There are people who suffer
from injustice,

855
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,168
and families who are affected by that.

856
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,204
It's wrong to pretend like

857
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,307
those people do not exist.

858
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,145
You've only been at this bank
for five years

859
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,614
and have no knowledge of bank management.

860
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,915
So what would you know?

861
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,418
It's true that I don't know

862
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,020
anything about bank management.

863
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,221
Then shut up.

864
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,589
No, I will not!

865
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,594
I don't know about management,

866
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,032
but I know that it's wrong
for hardworking people

867
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,834
at this bank to be

868
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,869
moved around like chess pieces!

869
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:03,613
Ever since I started working at
Branch Inspection,

870
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,816
I've come across many people.

871
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,320
This bank

872
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:15,692
has many people who are
working diligently for themselves,

873
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,328
their family, and their friends.

874
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,265
Those people are

875
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,536
harassed by their bosses,

876
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,940
blamed for their boss's mistakes,

877
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,510
and called incompetent…

878
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,517
It's wrong for people's lives to be
affected by words like

879
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:46,022
"setting an example" or "formality."

880
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,762
It's wrong that hardworking people

881
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,365
can't be happy.

882
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,173
This bank

883
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,509
is full of wrong things.

884
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,681
It's wrong?

885
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,055
Then what should we do?

886
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,159
I think it needs to be changed.

887
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,529
Do you think you can change it?

888
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,733
Yes, I do.

889
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,157
Then try it.

890
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,562
Yes.

891
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,952
I'm sorry for Hanasaki's rude behavior.

892
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,889
Director Karashima.

893
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,925
About the dissolvement
of the Branch Inspection…

894
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:29,826
Yes.

895
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:34,030
I've decided to put that off for now.

896
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,434
Really?

897
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,335
Yes.

898
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,871
I decided on that just now.

899
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,508
Thank you.

900
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,310
But why?

901
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,983
-Is it good?
-Yes.

902
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,586
I'm so happy.

903
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,822
Mai, didn't you get your bonus?

904
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,825
Didn't you say you'd

905
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,527
pay your tab with your bonus?

906
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:44,033
Oh no! I bought clothes already.

907
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,568
Did you say something?

908
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,371
Nothing. I'll pack the rest for lunch.

909
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,839
Mai. Hold on. Wait.

910
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,541
-Thank you.
-What?

911
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,043
She's hopeless.

912
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:59,382
It's delicious!

913
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,953
I'm surprised.
I never thought you would ever

914
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,990
approve of those two
from Branch Inspection.

915
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,428
When did I say that?

916
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,863
Oh, but…

917
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,600
you're going to keep
Branch Inspection, right?

918
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,636
I said, "for now."

919
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,641
I'll take my time to observe.

920
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,447
Yes, sir.

921
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,451
Hanasaki Mai…

922
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,755
Why are you so stubborn?

923
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,957
With all due respect…

924
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,426
this isn't about stubbornness.
It's preference.

925
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,967
-Deep-fried mackerel is best with a sauce.
-No, soy sauce!

926
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,470
It's delicious when the thick sauce

927
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:57,073
seeps into the crispy fried mackerel.

928
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,641
The sauce is too heavy.

929
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,510
The soy sauce is nice and simple.

930
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,479
We'll never see eye to eye.

931
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,414
I guess so.

932
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,450
I'm waiting for an inspection
at Nippori Branch

933
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,220
because there's
a really good restaurant near there.

934
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,523
The Niigata special called Italian
sounds nice too.

935
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,657
What is that?

936
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,527
There's tomato sauce
on top of the <i>yakisoba</i>.

937
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,631
I've never heard of that.
That looks really good.

938
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,866
It's so hot today!

939
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,535
-It's an inspection.
-Where?

940
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,537
-Which branch?
-It's Ni…

941
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:28,938
-Niigata?
-Nippori, right?

942
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,011
