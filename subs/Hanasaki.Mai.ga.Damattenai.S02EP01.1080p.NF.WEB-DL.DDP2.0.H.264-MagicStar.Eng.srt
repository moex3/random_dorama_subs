TICKET NUMBER

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:22,088
<i>Customer with the ticket number 128,</i>
<i>please come to window one.</i>

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,223
Welcome.

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,859
Withdrawal? Please wait a moment.

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,298
Mr. Tsujimoto.

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,468
I am very sorry, but…

8
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,272
this transaction is denied.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,240
MAI HANASAKI

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,109
What do you mean?

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,211
I have my passbook and stamp.

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,613
What's going on?

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,314
Excuse me, sir…

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,684
But you are not Mr. Kenji Tsujimoto,
right?

15
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,490
Please wait!

16
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,832
May I help you?

17
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,733
KEN SOMA

18
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,809
Thank God!

19
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,215
<i>He stole someone's bag</i>
<i>and tried to use the passbook</i>

20
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,717
<i>and stamp inside to withdraw some money.</i>

21
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:29,522
Ms. Hanasaki, because you
were temporarily filling in for us,

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,759
we were able to prevent a crime.

23
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,127
Thank you very much.

24
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,496
Not at all…

25
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,898
It was just a coincidence.

26
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,234
How did you know that he was suspicious?

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,203
Well…

28
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,944
I thought he was acting strange
the moment he came in.

29
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,750
He kept on glancing around,
and he looked nervous.

30
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:02,122
And he was sweating
in an air-conditioned room.

31
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,358
So I checked his name on the slip
and the stamped form.

32
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,659
KENJI TSUJIMOTO

33
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,228
They didn't match.

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,866
Mr. Soma, please.

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,468
So I had it examined.

36
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,237
It's the gentleman over there.

37
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,372
Okay.

38
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,341
KENJI TSUJIMOTO

39
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,314
So that's how you found out that
his bag was stolen.

40
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,249
That's right.

41
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,684
How cool! It's an instinct as a teller.

42
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,855
I was excited because it's been a while
since I've worked as a teller.

43
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,124
Ms. Hanasaki is the best teller.

44
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,093
Can I take a picture with you later?

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,063
I am not… How about in front of the logo?

46
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,732
She's getting carried away.

47
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,835
Mr. Soma, you did a great job too.

48
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,736
Yes?

49
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,639
You responded to Ms. Hanasaki quickly

50
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,508
and contacted the customer right away.

51
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:59,345
No wonder you two are
the famous pair from Branch Inspection.

52
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,181
No, we are not.

53
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,382
Jinx.

54
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,320
KUSATSU ONSEN

55
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,126
This sashimi is delicious.

56
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,031
The konjac tastes great too.

57
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,668
My expectations are rising for
the stone-grilled beef <i>hitsumabushi</i>.

58
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,036
Yes.

59
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:27,840
Coming here and not trying Joshu Wagyu
is like drawing a dragon without its eyes.

60
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,375
It would be unacceptable!

61
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,044
Is it that important?

62
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,951
I can't wait.

63
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:43,723
Visiting the branches
and eating delicious local foods

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,593
is the highlight of working
as a branch inspector.

65
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,428
Exactly.

66
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,999
We solve and assist with tiny problems
at individual branches,

67
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,435
but we get so much hate for doing our job.

68
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,171
We deserve this kind of treat.

69
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,642
But this time, we made them happy.

70
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,444
Don't get carried away.

71
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,280
That was a rare case
that might happen only once a year.

72
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,514
You are right.

73
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,885
-Oh?
-What?

74
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,554
It's Mr. Shibasaki.

75
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,723
Keep mum about the hot springs.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,295
Hanasaki speaking.

77
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,664
<i>Great job, Ms. Hanasaki.</i>

78
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,269
Well done!
The branch manager just called me.

79
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,471
I was just lucky.

80
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,740
Where are you now?
Are you on your way back?

81
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,775
It is already late,

82
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:41,714
so I am thinking of staying
at a business hotel near the station.

83
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,650
That's not good.

84
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,985
Why?

85
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,721
If you stay the night,
you can't make it here

86
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,722
tomorrow morning.

87
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,591
Tomorrow morning?

88
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,928
I can come before noon.

89
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,263
<i>It has to be morning.</i>

90
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,301
I am very busy. I'll explain tomorrow.

91
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,936
Do you understand?
See you tomorrow morning.

92
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,039
Mr. Shibasaki?

93
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,941
What is it?

94
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:09,909
He hung up.

95
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,878
You must be joking.

96
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,180
He said he was busy.

97
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,318
What? He always says he is busy.

98
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:23,189
We have no other choice. Let's eat this
and the <i>hitsumabushi</i> and go back.

99
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,492
Oh, no… This is no good, Hanasaki.

100
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,460
Huh?

101
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:33,066
We must leave here now, or we will
miss the last train to Tokyo.

102
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,233
I mean right now.

103
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,737
Thank you very much for waiting.

104
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,508
This is our specialty dish.
Stone-grilled beef <i>hitsumabushi</i>.

105
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,150
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

106
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,032
It looked so delicious.

107
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,000
You should have said no to Shibasaki.

108
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,335
It's not my fault.

109
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,971
You always speak out when you shouldn't.

110
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,006
How come you didn't speak out today?

111
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,376
We must hurry.

112
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,245
I should have gotten it to go.

113
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,781
-Hurry up!
-I know.

114
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,318
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

115
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,753
Good morning.

116
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,654
Good morning.

117
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:35,194
I wanted to try that
stone-grilled beef <i>hitsumabushi</i>.

118
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,964
It even appeared in my dream last night.

119
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,298
Same here.

120
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,333
Good morning.

121
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,269
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,409
Hello, General Manager Shindo.

123
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,309
Hey.

124
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,210
Executive Director.

125
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,047
Executive Director Shindo.

126
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,983
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TSUYOSHI SHINDO

127
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,184
Don't worry.

128
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,055
Ms. Hanasaki, you're always
full of energy.

129
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,925
Thank you.

130
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,929
I appreciate that you are
doing the work that everyone despises.

131
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:15,067
Businesses succeed due to
the work done by unsung heroes like you.

132
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,670
-Don't you think so, Mr. Kodama?
-Yes.

133
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,406
I completely agree with
Executive Director Shindo.

134
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,607
SECRETARIAL OFFICE
ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER NAOKI KODAMA

135
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,578
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,314
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

137
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,716
Keep it up.

138
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,858
They both look very happy.

139
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:44,564
He was finally promoted to
Executive Director.

140
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,201
Your promotion this time

141
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:53,005
is proof that President Serizawa
views you as his successor.

142
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:58,010
Thinking about that makes me…

143
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,514
Don't rush to conclusions.
We can't be sure of that.

144
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,251
Yes, we can!
Your time has finally come, Mr. Shindo.

145
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,626
Even General Manager… I mean
Executive Director Shindo

146
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,528
is happy to be promoted.

147
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,931
Why not? All bankers want to be promoted.

148
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,167
Mr. Soma.

149
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:25,538
I don't think promotion is everything.

150
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,607
Hey!

151
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,710
I'm not saying that because I'm bitter.

152
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:35,848
It is not bad to step aside from the
fast-track to enjoy life at my own pace.

153
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,018
I know.

154
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,620
What's with that look?

155
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,155
Don't look at me like that.

156
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,958
You should understand that I am your boss.

157
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
I know. You're--

158
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,464
Ouch!

159
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,433
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shibasaki.

160
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,003
You're full of energy, Ms. Hanasaki.

161
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,071
Good morning. Are you okay?

162
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm fine.

163
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,510
Are we going to Nihonbashi Branch
for inspection today?

164
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,012
What happened?

165
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,316
A customer is saying that
he is going to sue us.

166
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,217
What?

167
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,820
COMPENSATION

168
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,055
CRIMINAL CHARGE

169
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,058
Sue the bank?

170
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,832
An issue concerning
investment trusts, huh.

171
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,936
-It sounds tough.
-Hanasaki.

172
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,037
Yes?

173
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,105
-Don't get fired up.
-Huh?

174
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,776
Every time you get fired up,
does it ever work to our advantage? No.

175
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,677
Maybe once.

176
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,546
Even if it did happen once, forget it.
Listen, Hanasaki.

177
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,747
Never…

178
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,585
Never say unnecessary things.
Grin and bear it. Right?

179
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:51,424
Right. And the Nihonbashi Branch Manager
belongs to the Shindo faction.

180
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,195
That's very daunting.

181
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,201
NIHONBASHI BRANCH

182
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,073
I am Soma from Branch Inspection.

183
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,341
I am Hanasaki.

184
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,809
Thank you for coming.

185
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,580
I never asked for help
from Branch Inspection.

186
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,582
Stop wasting my time.

187
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,219
My branch is number one in the nation
for its performance.

188
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,321
We are not like other branches.

189
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,423
Am I right, Section Chief Nakamura?

190
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,425
Exactly right, Branch Manager.

191
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,631
But headquarters received a complaint
threatening to take legal action.

192
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,599
How could he sue a big bank like us?

193
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,402
He is just trying to
threaten us for money.

194
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,140
What are you doing?

195
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,945
I am sorry,
but we will confirm the details.

196
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,415
The person filing the claim is
Mr. Hiroshi Morozumi,

197
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,684
the president of Morozumi Industry.

198
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,721
Six months ago, he purchased
a 30-million yen investment trust

199
00:10:55,788 --> 00:11:00,092
with the advice of Ms. Yuri Kitahara
from Public Relations.

200
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,531
Recently, he needed cash,
so he redeemed the funds

201
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,001
and saw that he had lost three million yen
due to loss of principal.

202
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,272
But Mr. Morozumi says that
at the time of purchase,

203
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,409
he was promised no loss,
and that the principal was guaranteed.

204
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,079
That's just false accusation.

205
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,449
He is making accusations
because he's angry about his loss.

206
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,350
However--

207
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:30,389
Investment trust is a financial product
with chances of risks and returns.

208
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,557
PRINCIPAL IS NOT GUARANTEED

209
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,627
Bankers will never say that
the principal is guaranteed.

210
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,128
Right, Mr. Nakamura?

211
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,563
That's exactly right.

212
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,699
Oh right…

213
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,136
Nit-picking of the branch
is the job of a Branch Inspector.

214
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,242
But we are working responsibly as bankers
of Tokyo Daiichi Bank's

215
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,411
number one branch.

216
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,682
Don't make me waste time dealing
with such a trivial company.

217
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,718
Trivial company?

218
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,988
But he says that he will sue us.

219
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,324
He can't be serious.

220
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,059
We have nothing to be accused of.

221
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,597
These people get carried away
because we give them time and attention.

222
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,434
With all due respect--

223
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,308
I am sorry but may I talk to Ms. Kitahara,
who was in charge of this client?

224
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,743
Please.

225
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,118
Well, Mr. Nakamura.

226
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,389
Bring Kitahara since
the Branch Inspectors want to see her.

227
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,524
Yes, sir.

228
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,894
Time is precious.

229
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,297
Make it quick.

230
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes.

231
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,478
What's up with that damn Branch Manager?

232
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,248
Idiot! You are too loud!

233
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,983
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

234
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,888
There it is again.
You're always unable to resist.

235
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,757
Being rude to us is one thing,

236
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,194
but it's so rude
to call our customers "trivial."

237
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,265
Calm down. Don't get too worked up.

238
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,801
Aren't you angry after he talked
to you that way?

239
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,771
He has pride
as the number one branch, you know.

240
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,074
Is it that great to become number one?

241
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,212
It's not easy to become
the number one amongst 750 branches.

242
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,948
They deserve the recognition.

243
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:36,916
But…

244
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,352
He's the one that produced results
and made this branch number one.

245
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,490
So it's only natural that he's
looked upon favorably by the top.

246
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,793
-The results are--
-All that matters, right?

247
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,597
You're finally starting to understand
the nature of the bank.

248
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,598
I don't.

249
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,134
I just memorized it.

250
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,406
I didn't tell him that
the principal was guaranteed.

251
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,444
Do you have any idea why
Mr. Morozumi thought you did?

252
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,414
I think he is telling a lie.

253
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,549
I see.

254
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,088
Have you talked to Morozumi Industry
about this issue?

255
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,692
Yes. He came to the branch last week.

256
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,829
I've lost three million yen.

257
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,731
How will you fix this?

258
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,132
MOROZUMI INDUSTRY HIROSHI MOROZUMI

259
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,434
It's working capital!

260
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,735
I am very sorry.

261
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,340
But unlike a deposit, the investment trust

262
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:39,578
has specialists investing
customer's money on stocks and bonds.

263
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,749
Sometimes it goes well and offers profits,

264
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,119
but you redeemed it when
there was a loss of principal--

265
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,287
Wait a moment.

266
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,657
Remember what you said?

267
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,361
You said I wouldn't lose money because

268
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,897
the principal was guaranteed.

269
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,900
No.

270
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,002
What?

271
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,272
I didn't say the principal was guaranteed.

272
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,807
Give me a break!

273
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,912
I see. So that's why he's saying
that he'll sue us.

274
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,947
He may be thinking that

275
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,583
we will make up for the loss
if he says he'll sue us.

276
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,154
I don't think we should assume that.

277
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,856
Anyway, I didn't guarantee it.

278
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,826
Branch Manager told me
not to deal with him.

279
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,796
-But…
-Can I excuse myself?

280
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,365
I told you everything I know.

281
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,534
I will return to my work.

282
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,311
How rude.

283
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,148
She seems to be on the same page
as Mr. Hashizume.

284
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,082
Right.

285
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,552
She won't say anything further
even if we ask her.

286
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,987
I guess so.

287
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,158
Let's go talk to Morozumi Industry.

288
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,426
All right.

289
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,030
Where are you going?

290
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,470
We're going to Morozumi Industry
to confirm the facts.

291
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,205
That's not necessary.

292
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,173
What?

293
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,711
As Kitahara said, we didn't tell him that
we would guarantee the principal.

294
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,412
That's all.

295
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,382
-But we have to confirm.
-You don't have to.

296
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:28,654
A Branch Inspector's job is to
solve issues within the branch.

297
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,290
Don't poke your nose in, or meddle

298
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,659
with things that are not your business.

299
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,694
Yes, sir.

300
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,999
Thank you very much
for your cooperation today.

301
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:40,933
Okay.

302
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,635
Let's go. Come.

303
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,511
Are you really sure it's okay?

304
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,880
We have nothing to be accused of.

305
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,849
There is no way he will sue us.

306
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,419
If by any chance, he sues us…

307
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:01,987
Mr. Hashizume,

308
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,859
you will disgrace Mr. Shindo,
who has been supporting you.

309
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,727
Do you understand?

310
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,430
Yes, I do.

311
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,867
Yes. Goodbye.

312
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,107
YURI KITAHARA

313
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,611
She is an elite.

314
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,517
She was a teller until a year ago.

315
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,534
-The eggplant is delicious too.
-Thank you.

316
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,704
It's you again, Mr. Soma.

317
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,806
Hi there.

318
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,276
"Again"? Don't be rude to
my regular customer.

319
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,679
I have to come eat here at least
three times a week.

320
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,449
Mr. Soma, you are the best customer.

321
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,517
Yeah!

322
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,187
Stop acting like a couple in love.

323
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,523
I want you to bring
someone you are in love with.

324
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,227
You didn't bring that boyfriend
you just broke up with?

325
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,963
Mai, you had a boyfriend?

326
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,899
Yes. He was two years older
and working at a ward office.

327
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,101
Mr. Soma!

328
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,535
How did you meet him?

329
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,737
Her friend at university knew him.

330
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,005
That's enough.

331
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,309
Sounds like a nice man.
Why did you get dumped again?

332
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,712
I didn't get dumped. We just broke up.

333
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,949
I think that stubborn attitude of yours
is what causes problems.

334
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,285
She might have said something to him
"with all due respect."

335
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,553
I had my reasons.

336
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,390
But Mai's dream is to be
a wife of a banker.

337
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,925
That's right.

338
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,029
Let me repeat. I've never dreamed of
such a thing.

339
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:51,964
Excuse me.

340
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,332
Right away.

341
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,403
I have to go home too.

342
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,107
Mr. Soma, I want to ask you something.

343
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,845
It's about Ms. Kitahara
of the Nihonbashi Branch.

344
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,447
What about her?

345
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,384
I think she's lying.

346
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,886
Lying?

347
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,190
I didn't tell him that
the principal was guaranteed.

348
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,492
She was too composed.

349
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,362
She had a miscommunication with a customer

350
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,197
and threatened to be sued.

351
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,465
Isn't that strange?

352
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,335
She may be a calm person by nature.

353
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:35,307
She had been working as a teller
before she went into Public Relations.

354
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,842
And?

355
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,547
Something about her bothers me…

356
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,781
as a former teller.

357
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,852
Is it a former teller's instinct?

358
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,088
Mr. Soma,

359
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,359
why don't we go see
Morozumi Industry tomorrow?

360
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,761
No.

361
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,768
But you'll go even if I say no, right?

362
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,869
Yes.

363
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:12,277
Morozumi Industry is a company
that makes precision parts.

364
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,645
MOROZUMI INDUSTRY

365
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,018
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

366
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,720
Can I see Mr. Morozumi?

367
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,122
President, you have a visitor.

368
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,394
May I help you?

369
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,799
I am Soma of
Tokyo Daiichi Bank Headquarters.

370
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,967
I am Hanasaki.

371
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,405
It is too late to see a person
from headquarters.

372
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,306
Yes?

373
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:47,446
I had my lawyer
file a petition just right now.

374
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,847
What?

375
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,517
PLAINTIFF HIROSHI MOROZUMI

376
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,152
DEFENDANT TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

377
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,821
I am so sorry.

378
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,991
I didn't think he would really sue us.

379
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,161
Executive Director Shindo had trusted you

380
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,398
because you told us that everything
was under control.

381
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,666
I am very sorry.

382
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,638
He has no evidence,
so even if that trivial company sues us

383
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,373
they won't be able to win--

384
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,211
I am not worrying about
who will win or lose in court.

385
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,817
If news gets out that
Tokyo Daiichi Bank is being sued,

386
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,088
people may think that

387
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:34,026
our bank did something
worthy of being sued for.

388
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,195
Even if it's only one person suing us,
it will cause damage.

389
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,266
It doesn't matter
whether we are at fault or not.

390
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,168
Yes, sir.

391
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,608
Someone has to
take responsibility for this.

392
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,617
They really told me that
the principal was guaranteed.

393
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,086
I see.

394
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,156
For you bankers,

395
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,426
three million yen may be
a small amount of money.

396
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,362
But for me,

397
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,766
we are running on a shoestring.

398
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,103
I can't give up.

399
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,971
Excuse me.

400
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:26,011
Was this contract the first time
you handled business with Kitahara?

401
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,080
I've known her since she was a teller.

402
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,648
I see.

403
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,220
That was why I trusted her without doubt.

404
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,790
She said I wouldn't lose anything.

405
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,160
She advised me to buy it so earnestly.

406
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:49,334
That's why I can't forgive her
all the more.

407
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:55,440
I'm sure you won't believe me…

408
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,409
Is that a diary?

409
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:02,914
I take notes in here so that
I won't forget important things.

410
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,784
This is it.

411
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,521
This is the day when she explained
the investment to me.

412
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,822
Let me see it.

413
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,860
PERSON IN CHARGE - MS. KITAHARA
INVESTMENT TRUST STOCKS, BONDS SPECIALIST

414
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,695
PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED

415
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,530
WITH NO LOSS

416
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,305
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK NIHONBASHI BRANCH

417
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,346
PETITION

418
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,126
Ms. Kitahara.

419
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,498
Are you sure you didn't tell him that
the principal was guaranteed?

420
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,868
You don't believe me?

421
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,137
We didn't mean that.

422
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,740
Mr. Morozumi showed us his diary.

423
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,177
He could have written that down later.

424
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,346
I don't think so.

425
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,153
Mr. Morozumi said that

426
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:21,026
he trusted you because he knew you
when you were a teller.

427
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,598
If you sold the investment trust
by lying to him,

428
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,702
that's an unforgivable thing to do
as a banker.

429
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,170
Stop it, Hanasaki.

430
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,408
You deceived the customer
to improve your performance.

431
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,442
No!

432
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,479
That's not it.

433
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,548
You don't know anything.

434
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,819
What do you mean?

435
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,534
Ms. Kitahara!

436
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,413
Hanasaki, hurry up.

437
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,482
What is this all about?

438
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,554
No one has achieved the target!

439
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,757
Public Relations!

440
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,094
You think you can be number one like this?

441
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,729
I am terribly sorry.

442
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,635
Such a pain…

443
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,871
You guys are all useless!

444
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:46,945
You created an unprecedented scandal
of being sued by the customer.

445
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,049
Can't you do anything other than
cause me trouble?

446
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,153
I made this branch number one.

447
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,155
But you ruined everything.

448
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,425
Are you garbage?

449
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,461
Is this room a garbage box?

450
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,972
Kitahara, pick it up.

451
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,480
All you'll find in the garbage box
is garbage!

452
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,586
If you don't want to be garbage,

453
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,821
improve your performance.

454
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,556
Yes, sir!

455
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,033
BRANCH INSPECTION

456
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,403
That Branch Manager is awful.

457
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,339
I agree.

458
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:51,142
When he speaks like that, no one can
say anything because they're scared.

459
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,578
It was nothing but verbal violence.

460
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,682
That was how he managed people
and improved performance.

461
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,890
She may have been suffering too.

462
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,026
Who?

463
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,028
Ms. Kitahara.

464
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,497
She got upset when you asked her

465
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,001
if she lied to improve her performance.

466
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,704
You deceived the customer
to improve your performance.

467
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,373
No!

468
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,942
That's not it.

469
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,379
You don't know anything.

470
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,548
You're right.

471
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:36,588
She probably got upset because she wanted
to at least deny that claim.

472
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,826
Do you need me, sir?

473
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,365
Write a letter of resignation.

474
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,134
What?

475
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,238
Since we are being sued,
someone has to take responsibility.

476
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,243
That's how a bank works.

477
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,647
-However…
-Who is in charge of Morozumi Industry?

478
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,617
You, right?

479
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,286
Yes.

480
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,389
Sooner the better.

481
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,993
Bring the letter of resignation tomorrow.

482
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,564
By the way,

483
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,034
this is voluntary.

484

TOKYO DAIICHI BANK NIHONBASHI BRANCH

485
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:58,303
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

486
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,079
Ms. Kitahara.

487
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,451
I wanted to apologize for what I said.

488
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,021
I shouldn't have said that.

489
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,726
I am sorry for making blind assumptions.

490
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,766
What were you trying to say to me
that time, Ms. Kitahara?

491
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,203
You were about to say something.

492
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,539
After you said that
I didn't know anything.

493
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,349
Ever since I became a branch inspector,

494
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,586
I've met many people who suffer because of

495
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,891
the old-fashioned mindset
of the bank and its

496
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,225
unreasonable managers.

497
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,930
They can't say what they want to say,

498
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,299
and they suffer alone.

499
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,807
If you're experiencing that right now,

500
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,078
I won't keep quiet.

501
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,223
It was not to improve my performance.

502
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,094
It was an order.

503
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,430
What?

504
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,770
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

505
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,006
Today's sardine is delicious.

506
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,875
Thank you.

507
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,312
Mai is not home yet.

508
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,350
What's wrong?

509
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,152
Nothing.

510
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,387
-Mr. Soma.
-Yes?

511
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:01,726
Is Mai doing unnecessary things
and causing you trouble?

512
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,629
No.

513
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,032
That's a "yes."

514
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,539
I told

515
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,343
Mr. Morozumi that
the principal was guaranteed.

516
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,580
It was an order from the Manager.

517
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,751
How did it happen?

518
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,524
SIX MONTHS AGO

519
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,194
Don't you want to be number one this year?

520
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,364
You want it, right?

521
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,099
Yes!

522
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,502
All we need is higher numbers.
Your job is to

523
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,871
enhance your performance.

524
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,673
Is that clear?

525
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,041
Yes.

526
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,012
-Kitahara.
-Yes.

527
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,147
How is the investment trust?

528
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,548
I am sorry,

529
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,718
but Mr. Morozumi won't agree to it
that easily.

530
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,989
I see. Tell him that
the principal is guaranteed.

531
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,159
-What?
-He will buy it then.

532
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,861
But if there's a loss--

533
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,995
No worries.

534
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,732
There won't be a loss of principal
in this economy.

535
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,633
However…

536
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,471
I will take responsibility
if there is any problem.

537
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,809
Make sure to bring in the results.

538
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,312
This is an order by the Branch Manager.

539
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes, sir.

540
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,485
Investment trust is risky.

541
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:40,525
For this trust,
the principal is guaranteed.

542
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,430
You mean I won't lose?

543
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:46,931
That's right.

544
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,938
That sounds really great.

545
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,209
I didn't know that.

546
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,484
I was hoping that it would work out,

547
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,920
and not cause him any loss.

548
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,257
But the result was awful.

549
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,892
HIROSHI MOROZUMI

550
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,161
It is only a loss of three million yen.

551
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,734
It's his fault for redeeming it
at a time like this.

552
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,003
I will go apologize to him.

553
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,871
No you won't.

554
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,609
If you apologize, you will be
admitting that it's our fault.

555
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,012
What should I do?

556
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,580
Just say that you never

557
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,881
guaranteed the principal.

558
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,552
But you told me to say
the principal was guaranteed

559
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,991
and that you'd take responsibility
if there were any problems.

560
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,029
What? I didn't say such a thing.

561
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,897
You did this on your own.

562
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,432
No…

563
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,237
Never admit what you did, got it?

564
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,575
If you want to continue working here,
that's your only choice.

565
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,948
Do you understand?

566
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,785
Yes, sir.

567
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,386
No.

568
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,358
I didn't say that
the principal was guaranteed.

569
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,226
Give me a break!

570
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,598
Look at my diary here.

571
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,268
Read what you told me.

572
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,869
Hey!

573
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,405
I see. So that's what happened.

574
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,012
I've been regretting what I had said.

575
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,983
Branch Manager came to me and said that

576
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,453
I should resign.

577
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,887
What?

578
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,792
Write a letter of resignation.

579
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,061
That's awful!

580
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:01,032
He's placing all the blame on you.
That's not fair.

581
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,469
But there is no evidence
that he ordered me.

582
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,405
He knew that from the beginning.

583
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,243
But your colleagues will understand…

584
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,378
No way.

585
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,380
Why?

586
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,617
Branch Manager is the "rule"
in our branch.

587
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,222
That's why whenever there was a problem,

588
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,359
I always thought that it might have been
ordered by the Branch Manager.

589
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,362
But I turned a blind eye.

590
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,767
I was relieved that it wasn't me.

591
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,840
Since you work for
a Branch Manager like him,

592
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:47,745
I understand why you kept silent,
and never said what you wanted to say.

593
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,747
-But…
-I…

594
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,418
I think I had forgotten
the most important thing.

595
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:03,895
Even if I was pushed into a corner,
I had no right to deceive a customer.

596
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,806
This bank is rotten.

597
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:23,881
Even an elementary school student
can tell that this is wrong.

598
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,156
Ms. Hanasaki.

599
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:39,096
When I got a job offer
at Tokyo Daiichi Bank,

600
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,966
I was so happy.

601
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,470
I am from a small town,

602
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,774
so everyone got excited that
I would be working at a bank.

603
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,643
My parents were happy too.

604
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,648
I felt like I was able to
make my parents really proud.

605
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,790
I don't have any special talent,

606
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:12,263
but this employee ID gave me confidence
and a place to belong.

607
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,470
I was hoping to keep working here.

608
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,444
I didn't want to resign.

609
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,815
I didn't want to resign, but…

610
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,888
Maybe because her mother passed away
when she was young,

611
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:42,693
she always pretended to be fine
even when she was sick,

612
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,562
had a problem at school,

613
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,632
or when she was dumped by her boyfriend.

614
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,767
Here you go.

615
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,473
But when it concerns other people,

616
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,309
she can't ignore it and has to speak up.

617
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,377
That's a problem.

618
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,881
But sometimes I think…

619
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:05,783
Yes?

620
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,952
When I have no one on my side,

621
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,589
if a person like Hanasaki is with me,

622
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,226
I will probably feel at ease.

623
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,496
I am frustrated.

624
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,934
I…

625
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,306
I am so frustrated.

626
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,066
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

627
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:16,020
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

628
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,160
Hey.

629
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,563
Good evening.

630
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,767
Hey, look at your face.

631
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:33,838
Mr. Soma.

632
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,908
I can't forgive that Branch Manager.

633
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,313
So you went to see Ms. Kitahara, huh?

634
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,115
Yes.

635
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,819
I see, so that's what happened.

636
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,255
It's not fair

637
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,558
that Ms. Kitahara has to
take responsibility for everything.

638
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,160
I will see him tomorrow.

639
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,762
Don't.

640
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:01,999
You won't stand a chance against him
without any evidence.

641
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,003
A sentimental argument won't
work with him.

642
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,707
In fact, he'll end up cornering
Ms. Kitahara even more

643
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,709
for telling you everything.

644
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,081
Then I should find evidence
to prove that he ordered it.

645
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,050
There is no evidence.
It'll end up being a battle of

646
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,619
"he said she said."

647
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,722
Maybe you are right. But…

648
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,594
But I heard from Ms. Kitahara that…

649
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,731
That's why whenever there was a problem,

650
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,835
I always thought that it might have been
ordered by the Branch Manager.

651
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,173
There should be more people
who had to obey his orders.

652
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,075
Don't tell me that

653
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,712
you will ask everyone in the branch.

654
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,216
I can't turn a blind eye.

655
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,885
Stop it. They won't tell you anything.

656
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,987
If they know about Ms. Kitahara…

657
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:01,325
Even if do, they'll be too busy
trying to protect themselves.

658
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:06,797
But it's not right that they have
to do things that are wrong just because

659
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,032
it's his order.

660
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,369
Listen Hanasaki. Let me repeat this.

661
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:19,009
A sound argument is not always accepted
in the world of banking.

662
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,247
In fact, it's not accepted
most of the time.

663
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,385
You will meet many people

664
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:32,623
who suffer unreasonable treatment
within the branch.

665
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:39,964
You can't be emotionally involved
with every single person you meet.

666
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,401
If you want to work in a bank,

667
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,739
you have to learn to ignore
and bear certain things.

668

TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

671
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,808
Excuse me. I am Hanasaki
of the Branch Inspection.

672
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,077
May I ask you something?

673
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:32,216
No, Branch Manager has not
given me any unreasonable orders.

674
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,884
How about someone else?

675
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,220
Do you know anyone who suffers--

676
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,889
I don't know anything.

677
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,691
Can I go?

678
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,329
I don't know.

679
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,568
But it could happen to someone else.

680
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,037
I really don't know anything.

681
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,343
Mr. Nakamura, you may know something.

682
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,147
Ms. Hanasaki, do you know
what you are trying to do?

683
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:07,985
I want to stand by Ms. Kitahara
and everyone in this branch.

684
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,021
A bank is not as simple as you think.

685
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,263
-Excuse me. I am Hanasaki--
-What are you doing?

686
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,107
Why do you always go off by yourself?

687
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,242
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,512
But you understand now that
there is nothing we can do, right?

689
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:36,981
Yes.

690
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:42,052
Don't visit the Nihonbashi Branch anymore

691
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,787
and don't go out all day today.

692
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:51,362
I have manager training
so I can't keep watch over you.

693
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,032
But don't go anywhere. Understand?

694
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,668
Yes.

695
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,471
Excuse me.

696
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,012
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

697
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,086
What is it?

698
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,024
Nothing.

TOKYO DAIICHI BANK NIHONBASHI BRANCH

713
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:06,630
Ms. Kitahara will be leaving
the company for personal reasons.

714
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,868
She will say goodbye to everyone.

715
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,545
Um…

716
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,955
Thank you for everything.

717
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,593
Please wait.

718
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,768
What are you doing?

719
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,504
It is unfair for Ms. Kitahara to resign.

720
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:52,276
I told you not to come back to
this branch.

721
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,077
Ms. Hanasaki, go back.

722
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,379
Mr. Hashizume.

723
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,282
Why does Ms. Kitahara have to leave?

724
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:05,155
She wrote a resignation letter
of her own will, to take responsibility

725
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,491
for the trouble with Mr. Morozumi.

726
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,659
However,

727
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,565
it was you who ordered her to say
that the principal was guaranteed.

728
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,204
Are you insane?

729
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,139
I never said such a thing.

730
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,309
I heard it from Ms. Kitahara.

731
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,983
In order to become
the nation's number one branch,

732
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,420
you ordered her to sell investment funds
by lying to the customer

733
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,689
to produce results.

734
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:42,826
You're very rude. Never have I

735
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,296
forced my employees
to do something dishonest.

736
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,340
This is the list of the people
who have been transferred or retired

737
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:01,144
from this branch since you became
the Branch Manager two years ago.

738
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,185
I met and interviewed them.

739
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,324
They were not willing to tell me anything.

740
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,361
However…

741
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:24,434
Do you remember Mr. Yuichi Anzai
who was in Public Relations a year ago?

742
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,974
Mr. Anzai said that
Mr. Hashizume ordered him

743
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,743
to sell the investment trust

744
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,312
by lying to the customers
and guaranteeing a profit.

745
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,150
TEMPORARY TRANSFER
TOKYO FIRST SCIENCE INC.

746
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,087
When Mr. Anzai refused to do so,

747
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,256
he was transferred to another company.

748
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,458
He told me so.

749
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,464
That's not true.

750
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:58,835
-Well--
-No one will believe you.

751
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,773
What do you all think?

752
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,209
Do you believe her?

753
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,152
As you can see…

754
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,258
Excuse me.

755
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,260
Mr. Soma.

756
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,398
I believe her.

757
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,470
What are you doing?

758
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,238
I am sorry,

759
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,941
but two people including Ms. Kitahara are

760
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:42,179
testifying the same thing.

761
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,315
How can the Branch Inspector
know anything?

762
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,987
It seems like you are assuming that
I ordered them to do it, but where's

763
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,488
the evidence?

764
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,926
Show me the evidence.

765
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,463
-Ms. Kitahara and Mr. Anzai are testify--
-But...

766
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,368
The testimony of two measly bankers
doesn't mean anything.

767
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,608
She's blaming someone else
for something she did on her own.

768
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,943
I am quite annoyed.

769
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,949
With all due respect…

770
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,156
It is you, Mr. Hashizume,

771
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,593
who is blaming others.

772
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,561
What?

773
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,798
You use your position as Branch Manager

774
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,900
and treat your subordinates as pawns.

775
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,503
You're forcing them to do bad things.

776
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,539
-Shut up!
-No, I won't.

777
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,013
You deceive customers
without dirtying your hands

778
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,216
and place all the blame
on your subordinates. That's wrong!

779
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,122
You said this nation's number one branch

780
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,658
was different from the others.

781
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,096
This branch may have an award
for being number one,

782
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,198
but it does not have heart.

783
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:17,507
Branch Manager Hashizume,
you're the one taking the heart away.

784
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,697
Um…

785
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,002
I was turning a blind eye.

786
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,907
One year ago, as well as this time,

787
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:59,583
Mr. Hashizume ordered Mr. Anzai
and Ms. Kitahara to act dishonestly.

788
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,258
-Nakamura… damn you--
-I…

789
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,828
I was ordered by the Branch Manager to

790
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:15,232
process a loan by making
the interest rates seem advantageous.

791
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,435
Tanaka.

792
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:24,674
I'm being ordered to give Asagi Products
a higher loan than what's required.

793
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,946
Ms. Kitahara isn't the only one being
forced to do wrong by the Branch Manager.

794
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,416
-Fujiwara.
-I'm being forced as well.

795
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,185
Me too.

796
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,219
Me too.

797
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,688
He ordered me, too.

798
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,090
Me too.

799
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,572
I guess there are more
than just two measly people.

800
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:58,909
Mr. Hashizume,

801
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:06,516
it will be impossible to ignore all these
voices as meaningless.

802
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,173
Morozumi Industry withdrew the lawsuit.

803
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,345
We paid compensation
to settle the case out of court.

804
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,982
We prevented it from getting serious.

805
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,817
Branch Inspection did a great job.

806
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,553
But I can't get too happy about it.

807
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,755
Yes?

808
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,891
Mr. Hashizume has been transferred.

809
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:27,397
They didn't fire him to prevent the
problem from becoming public knowledge.

810
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,533
I see. You are moving to Tategawa Branch.

811
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,635
Yes.

812
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:36,339
Everyone at the Nihonbashi Branch
advised me to stay

813
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,842
and work to take responsibility.

814
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,111
I'm sure it will be tough,

815
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,146
but I wish you the best.

816
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,448
<i>Thank you.</i>

817
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:51,254
This bank may be rotten,
but the people working in it are not.

818
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,890
You taught me that, Ms. Hanasaki.

819
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:59,896
<i>I will start all over again</i>
<i>from the bottom. At this bank.</i>

820
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,402
Thank you very much, Ms. Hanasaki.

821
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,404
I didn't do much.

822
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,840
Bye.

823
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,653
Mr. Soma.

824
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,826
Do you remember what I said to
Executive Director Shindo a year ago?

825
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:37,667
This bank is full of wrong things.

826
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,570
What should we do then?

827
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,674
I think we should change.

828
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,882
I was arrogant to think
that I could change the bank.

829
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:56,219
After a year, nothing has changed.

830
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:00,323
What's wrong? Are you ready to give up?

831
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,525
-No.
-Then what?

832
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:09,566
I may be able to change
the people who work here.

833
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,869
I may be able to ask them to change.

834
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,539
If more people make changes,

835
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,443
then the bank may change someday.

836
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,413
We've still got a long way to go.

837
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,550
-I see.
-Yes!

838
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,757
-It's time. Let's go.
-Okay.

839
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,762
Today, we are going to Tsukishima.

840
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,463
That's right.

841
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:47,003
So, Executive Director Shindo
settled everything amicably?

842
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,873
I guess he didn't want to
taint his faction.

843
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,441
I see.

844
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,613
He's got a rival now,

845
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,682
so Mr. Shindo must be feeling anxious.

846
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,286
A rival?

847
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,056
Mr. Doujima returned from New York.

848
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,260
What? Is it that Mr. Doujima?

849
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,397
Yes. He returns
as a Senior Executive Director.

850
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,970
SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHOGO DOUJIMA

851
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,205
Mr. Shindo.

852
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,808
Long time no see.

853
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,548
Senior Executive Director Doujima.
Long time no see.

854
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:38,188
I hear you've been working hard
under President Serizawa.

855
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,389
Oh, no.

856
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:45,929
I hear that you covered up
a scandal in a branch the other day.

857
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,299
It was really a small thing.

858
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,534
I see.

859
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,170
But Mr. Shindo…

860
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:02,679
You won't be able to do as you like

861
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,348
from now on.

862
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:23,800
Mr. Shindo. Regarding the meeting
with Mr. Itami from Itami Group,

863
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,935
how about next Wednesday?

864
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,937
PERSONNEL NOTICE

865
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,240
Damn Branch Inspectors…

866
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,842
doing unnecessary things.

867
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,447
Where do you want to go for lunch?

868
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,516
Monja is famous in Tsukishima.

869
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,583
Sounds nice.

870
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,286
Believe it or not, there is
a hamburger shop too.

871
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,721
Nice!

872
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,191
Urchin beef roll…

873
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,526
Urchin?

874
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:50,927
Let's go.

875
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,128
Hello, I'm Matsuki.

876
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,763
This is fate.

877
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,797
Yes!

878
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,699
I'll terminate the loan. It's final.

879
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,968
That's withdrawal of loan credit.

880
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,803
<i>I may have reached my limit.</i>

881
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,739
That's unacceptable.

882
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,942
Please withdraw the debt recovery!
