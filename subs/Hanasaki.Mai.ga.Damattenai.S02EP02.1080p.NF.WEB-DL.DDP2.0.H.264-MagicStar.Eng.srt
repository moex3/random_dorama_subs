1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,238
What should I do this summer?

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,908
Mai, you don't have a single thing
planned for this summer?

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,611
I have some plans.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,315
Did I just rub salt in the wound?

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,084
You had plans with your boyfriend,

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,352
but you were dumped.

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,322
I wasn't dumped. We just broke up.

8
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,025
Oh, right.

9
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,293
Why are you doubting it?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,365
Did you really go out with that
government worker who was two years older?

11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,266
Huh?

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,635
It doesn't sound real.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,438
Yes, I did. It wasn't my imagination.

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,906
I see.

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,544
That was delicious. Thank you.

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,247
Just leave it.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,150
-See you later.
-Take care.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,024
I have to find someone for her.

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,994
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,830
BRANCH INSPECTION

21
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,332
SOLO TRIP DURING SUMMER

22
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,403
This looks nice.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,205
Solo trip?

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,108
Good morning.

25
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,243
Good morning.

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,414
Why are you looking at me with pity?

27
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,116
Hanasaki.

28
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:27,554
I hope you have a nice summer vacation…
by yourself.

29
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,623
What's wrong with going solo?

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,029
I can do what I want, like spend hours
at a museum, keep the light on all night,

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,398
set the AC to my preference…

32
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,203
The only ones who can talk about
the perks of being alone are ones who've

33
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,205
experienced being in a relationship.

34
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,977
I thought divorce

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,947
meant failure.

36
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,883
It's all about experience.

37
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:02,789
It's also important to avoid
the worst case scenario.

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,758
What?

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,761
Good morning.

40
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,197
Is this a bad time?

41
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,500
Not at all. Good morning.

42
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,969
-Good morning.
-Morning.

43
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,704
Is that a new inspection?

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes. Gotanda Branch.
Incorrect payment and missing stamps.

45
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,678
There's been lots of clerical errors
lately, so please check on them.

46
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,615
-Yes!
-Ms. Hanasaki.

47
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,453
Using 70% of your power
should be good enough this time around.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,322
-What?
-This is not a big issue.

49
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,325
Just come straight back
after hearing them out.

50
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,161
Come straight back?

51
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,731
I don't want you poking your nose
where it does not belong,

52
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,433
only to dig up more problems.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,703
Don't tell me the Gotanda Branch Manager
belongs to…

54
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,306
The Shindo faction.

55
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,240
I thought so.

56
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,608
I see.

57
00:02:55,675 --> 00:03:00,513
It is a difficult time for Mr. Shindo.

58
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,015
What happened?

59
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,450
You don't know?

60
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,254
Mr. Shindo's rival for the next Presidency
has appeared.

61
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,957
Everyone in the bank is talking about it.

62
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,692
The battle for the next President…

63
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,229
It sounds like something going on
in a different company.

64
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,233
I agree. And who is Mr. Shindo's rival?

65
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,237
Senior Executive Director Doujima.
He came back from New York.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,541
I saw the article.

67
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,777
Look.

68
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,979
Here.

69
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:38,284
I see.
This is Senior Executive Director Doujima.

70
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,422
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TSUYOSHI SHINDO

71
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,094
SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHOGO DOUJIMA

72
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,829
Mr. Shindo.

73
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,497
Long time no see.

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,801
Senior Executive Director Doujima.
Long time no see.

75
00:03:54,867 --> 00:04:01,674
You won't be able to do as you like
from now on.

76
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,811
COMPANY NEWSLETTER

77
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm sure Mr. Shindo is
pretty tense right now.

78
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,254
Yes. Because it's whether he can
become a President or not.

79
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,556
He is facing a crossroad in his life.

80
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:23,496
If she pushes a Branch Manager of
the Shindo faction into a corner again…

NAOKI KODAMA

83
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,678
So scary.

84
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,714
Hey you two, don't let fear
get the best of you.

85
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,517
Why worry about something
that hasn't happened yet?

86
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,821
It's important to avoid
the worst case scenario.

87
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,325
It's all about experience.

88
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,828
There now. Get along well, you guys.

89
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,233
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

90
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:22,355
There is a delicious
minced meat cutlet restaurant around here.

91
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,791
That sounds good.

92
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,194
I will treat you on the way back if--

93
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,900
Listen to the end. If we can get
back without facing any problems.

94
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,837
Don't worry, problems don't pop up
left and right.

95
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,905
I know, but…

96
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,575
Cutlet.

97
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,477
Why is she so confident?

98
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,280
GOTANDA BRANCH

99
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,716
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

100
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,884
Based on the interviews,

101
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,288
we found out that the increase of
clerical errors last month

102
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,491
is due to a shortage of workers
since many tellers were out sick.

103
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,293
I see.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,396
Thank you for coming all the way
from headquarters.

105
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,498
Please don't worry.

106
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,201
You can request temporary clerical help.

107
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,437
Please let us know
if you have any problems.

108
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,005
I will do that.

109
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,745
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

110
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,546
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,248
You are very cheerful.

112
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,051
Yes.

113
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,654
I'm glad that there were no problems.

114
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,190
He was a calm person.

115
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,227
That's very rare for someone
in the Shindo faction.

116
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,162
He smiled at us.

117
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,532
Of course even a person
in the Shindo faction can smile…

118
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,601
He was the first one.

119
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,506
Let's go eat cutlets before we go back.

120
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,474
You remembered that, huh.

121
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,149
Hey, Matsuki.

122
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,219
Mr. Soma?

123
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,424
I haven't seen you in so long.
How are you?

124
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh right, you're at the Gotanda Branch.

125
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,930
Yes. I wrote that
on the New Year's card I sent.

126
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,366
That's right.

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,636
You never reply back to me.

128
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,639
Well, I was thinking of doing it.

129
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,075
-I'm sorry.
-I am glad to see you here.

130
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,745
I'm Matsuki from the Finance Department.

131
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,481
I'm Hanasaki from Branch Inspection.

132
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,783
You came here for an inspection?

133
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,219
Yes. For the clerical errors.
We're done now.

134
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,190
Mr. Soma, you're really an inspector, huh?

135
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,357
Yes, of course.

136
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,760
It's hard to imagine.

137
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,396
I worked under Mr. Soma
at the Marunouchi Branch.

138
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,564
I see.

139
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,766
He taught me all about loans.

140
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,237
What's with that look?

141
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,438
Nothing.

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,408
So? Are there any problems?

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,442
Yes?

144
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,578
I heard you sighing.

145
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,248
Sorry.

146
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,151
Um… Mr. Soma.

147
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,020
Do you have time?

148
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,355
Huh?

149
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,725
I want your advice regarding a loan.

150
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,661
Well… I… don't…

151
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,331
We have time. We were about to leave.

152
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,465
-Hey.
-Really?

153
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,433
Yes.

154
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,571
AZUMIYA STORE

155
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,375
This is Azumiya Store.
I'm in charge of this customer.

156
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,345
They have three branches
in the Shinagawa ward.

157
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,813
This is their main store.

158
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,282
So what's the problem?

159
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:42,788
Branch Manager suddenly told me to collect
the 100-million-yen loan from them.

160
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,790
Collect 100 million yen?

161
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,527
He said it's a branch decision.

162
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,463
Is it to prevent bad debts
from occurring because

163
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,398
this store has some management issues?

164
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,269
No. They don't turn a huge profit,
but they're in the black.

165
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,605
If they are not in the red, then why?

166
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,476
Branch Manager said that
it has no potential.

167
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,046
But you don't think that way?

168
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,548
Right.

169
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,654
President Azumi.

170
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,008
I see.

171
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,176
AZUMIYA STORE PRESIDENT
NAOTO AZUMIYA

172
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,945
They won't change their stance?

173
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,314
I am very sorry.

174
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,481
No.

175
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,852
I understand that it's not your fault.

176
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,121
You have been so good to us.

177
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,356
No.

178
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,526
But… your bank lent us the money,

179
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,495
and they suddenly pull the rug
from under us

180
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,731
without giving much thought
to our situation.

181
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,804
Isn't this called "forcible collection"?

182
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,679
<i>"Forcible collection."</i>

183
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,816
It's one of the phrases I hate.

184
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,152
But it seems that he has
a reason to say that.

185
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,554
Yes.

186
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,356
They're not in the red,

187
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,858
and they've never been behind on payments.

188
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,661
But we are trying to collect their loan
all of a sudden.

189
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,962
When is this due?

190
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,230
End of this month.

191
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,498
They have no time.

192
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,100
I know.

193
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:40,606
What will happen to Azumiya Store
if we forcibly collect 100 million yen

194
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,042
and withdraw the loan?

195
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,945
They will be in serious financial trouble.

196
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,414
Will they go bankrupt?

197
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,783
Yes.

198
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,756
Mr. Soma.

199
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,259
Will you please check
Azumiya's credit file?

200
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,827
Me?

201
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,263
Yes. I want to get your opinion.

202
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,366
I can't do anything even if I see it.

203
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,202
-We can't turn away now.
-What did you say?

204
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,470
Please.

205
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,840
-Mr. Soma.
-I really need your advice.

206
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,243
Wait! Wait a second.

207
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,950
AZUMIYA STORE

208
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,452
What do you think?

209
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,590
The sales went down temporarily
six months ago.

210
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,326
Because a new supermarket
opened around that time.

211
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,430
<i>It's called Coming Mart.</i>

212
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,467
<i>They are a big chain with 20 stores</i>
<i>in the Kanto area.</i>

213
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,870
<i>After they opened,</i>
<i>Azumiya lost many customers.</i>

214
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,775
<i>So Azumiya had to cut prices</i>
<i>in order to compete with them.</i>

215
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,244
The customers are coming back now.

216
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,815
As a result, they have as many customers
now as they did before.

217
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,816
PROFIT RATIO

218
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,983
But the profit ratio…

219
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,153
They're buying at the same price,
but selling at a discount,

220
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,855
so they can't make a profit.

221
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,290
Right.

222
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,860
That's why they need the funds right now.

223
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:13,733
I think our branch should support
mid-sized companies like Azumiya,

224
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,236
that have their main
store location in Gotanda.

225
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,775
But I have to push them into bankruptcy.

226
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,180
What are you doing?

227
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,285
I thought the two of you left already.

228
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,788
Well… yes…

229
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,023
AZUMIYA STORE

230
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,128
Branch Manager,
I asked Mr. Soma for some advice.

231
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,332
Why do you have to show this
to people from Branch Inspection?

232
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,804
Mr. Soma was my boss at the
Finance Department in Marunouchi Branch.

233
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,708
I asked him for advice on Azumiya.

234
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,811
Are you still talking about that?

235
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,214
We're withdrawing the loan.

236
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,484
Collect 100 million yen
by the end of this month.

237
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,823
Excuse me…

238
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,725
Breathe.

239
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,132
Why do you have to collect the loan
all of a sudden?

240
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,567
What?

241
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,003
They seem to be being put in a tight spot.

242
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,676
Do you think a loan is
charity or something?

243
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,945
It's business.

244
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,283
But what you're doing is
forcible collection.

245
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,753
Forcible collection?

246
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,591
Are you criticizing my decision?

247
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,761
No, I'm not criticizing.
I just don't know the reason.

248
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,563
I explained to Matsuki many times.

249
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,865
That company is a loser.

250
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,068
We'd rather finance a winner
with better performance.

251
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,636
That's a logical decision!

252
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,679
Excuse me for interrupting,

253
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:12,585
but I also don't think there is
an urgent need to collect the loan.

254
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,955
How can you be so arrogant,

255
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,724
when you're only from Branch Inspection.

256
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,327
Time always flies…

257
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,662
like an arrow.

258
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,266
You're only a former Finance Department
worker. What would you know?

259
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,238
You are a loser, too.

260
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,807
You seem to have forgotten that.

261
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:37,977
Listen.

262
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:45,384
I, as the Branch Manager, will judge
if this company is at risk or not.

263
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,559
I will report this to headquarters.

264
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,561
Yes.

265
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,081
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

266
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,886
What's up with that damn Branch Manager?

267
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,189
Hanasaki, watch your mouth.

268
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,227
I want to kick myself for thinking that
he was a nice manager.

269
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:32,298
You said, "He's rare for someone
in the Shindo faction."

270
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,533
You said that, Mr. Soma.

271
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,302
Did I?

272
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,637
I am very sorry.

273
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:44,310
Don't look so depressed.
You're ruining our dinner.

274
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,212
You were humiliated because of me.

275
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,648
It's okay. Don't worry.

276
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,251
I said some unnecessary things too.

277
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,187
I am sorry that
I made unnecessary remarks too.

278
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,289
No, no. It was my fault.

279
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,558
Here's the <i>ashitaba</i> tempura.

280
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,760
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Dad.

281
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,564
You should try this.
Everything here is delicious.

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,665
Yes.

283
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,367
I'll try.

284
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,370
How is it?

285
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,573
-Delicious!
-Thank you very much.

286
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,910
Mr. Matsuki.

287
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,146
May I ask you something? Are you married?

288
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,550
No, not yet.

289
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,285
So you're single?

290
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,320
Yes.

291
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,422
Hey!

292
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,292
Dad, stop being rude.
You haven't met him before.

293
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,128
Do you have a girlfriend by any chance?

294
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,796
No.

295
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,632
He's popular, but he's awkward.

296
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,201
Stop that.

297
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,938
He's handsome, but has a modest
and nice personality.

298
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,972
Drinks sake.

299
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,207
Dad…

300
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,609
He's also a banker,
who is single and free.

301
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,013
Everything about him is ideal.
This must be destiny.

302
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,215
We can hear what you're thinking.

303
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,784
Mai, I will help you.

304
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,819
First of all,

305
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,255
what is your favorite food?

306
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,760
Japanese-style omelet.

307
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,130
I will make a special one right away.

308
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,065
Thank you very much.

309
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes. Everything is going very well.

310
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,309
Things will be done soon.

311
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,578
AZUMIYA STORE

312
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,480
AZUMIYA STORE

313
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,251
President, regarding
what we talked about earlier…

314
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,525
Come on. Stop sighing.

315
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,093
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,929
I can't help it when I think of
President Azumi.

317
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,267
May I ask you something?

318
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,601
What is it?

319
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,303
Branch Manager said that

320
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,273
he'd rather finance a winner
with better performance,

321
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,608
than a loser with poor performance.

322
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,776
Yes.

323
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:03,215
If he thinks Azumiya Store is a loser,

324
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,684
what company does he consider
to be a winner?

325
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,621
There are several companies that
he's keen on financing.

326
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,324
They are all big companies
with financial power.

327
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,992
He is so obvious.

328
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,829
One of them is Coming Mart.

329
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,332
Is that the new store near Azumiya?

330
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,668
It's a competitor that
came in six month ago.

331
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,904
Yes. It's so ironic.

332
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,840
Are they doing that well?

333
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,075
I'm not in charge, so I don't know well.

334
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,980
But personally, I can't bring myself
to agree with their business strategy.

335
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,715
What is it like?

336
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,351
They build a store near their competitors

337
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,955
and make major discount sales
for the first six months to make

338
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,690
their competitors withdraw.

339
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,627
That's the strategy of big companies
with financial power.

340
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,064
It may not be wrong business-wise,

341
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,466
but it's not fair.

342
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,567
I know.

343
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,971
I also don't understand
the Branch Manager's complete opposite

344
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,007
lending stance towards
the nearby competitor.

345
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,978
We want to know more don't we, Mr. Soma?

346
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,983
Why don't we investigate Coming Mart?

347
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,052
Yes. Let's investigate.

348
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,494
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

349
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,704
COMING MART

350
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,677
-Were you okay?
-Yes.

351
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,280
Here it is.

352
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,115
Okay.

353
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:56,361
According to this paper,
Coming Mart is not doing that well.

354
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,598
-I agree.
-Is that so?

355
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,600
Look.

356
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,537
The store in Gotanda is doing
almost the same as Azumiya Store.

357
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,640
It seems like Azumiya Store
is doing better than they thought,

358
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,009
so they have to continue their discounts.

359
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,344
I see.

360
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:17,015
But the loan towards Coming Mart has
drastically increased the last six months.

361
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,752
It has reached the limit of
500 million yen.

362
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,221
That's huge.

363
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,489
The loan to Azumiya was 100 million.

364
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,527
I heard that he will be
increasing the credit line.

365
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,763
He sent a request
to the Finance Department.

366
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,434
Finance Department…

367
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,973
Why is he this supportive
towards Coming Mart?

368
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,976
This makes it even harder
to understand his decision.

369
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,445
I don't understand why he brands

370
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,415
Azumiya as a loser
and Coming Mart as a winner.

371
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,783
I agree.

372
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,355
But there must be something that is
making the Branch Manager do that.

373
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,659
Something that isn't showing up
among these numbers…

374
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,730
What is that "something"?

375
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,267
I don't know.

376
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,303
Thank you very much.

377
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,537
No.

378
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,073
I haven't been able to help you out.

379
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,242
That's not true.

380
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,545
Mr. Matsuki.

381
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,514
Isn't that President Azumi?

382
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,353
President Azumi.

383
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,322
Mr. Matsuki.

384
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,463
I am visiting all the banks for
a new loan request.

385
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,401
But we're such a small company,

386
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,336
that they refuse us point blank.

387
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,808
I don't think I can take it anymore.

388
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,745
Goodbye.

389
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,657
President Azumi?

390
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,993
President Azumi!

391
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,529
I'll call an ambulance.

392
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,730
Please.

393
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,437
MEIKAI HOSPITAL

394
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,210
He was always proud of his health.

395
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,113
But he got cerebral anemia from fatigue.

396
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,416
He was pushing himself too hard.

397
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,286
This is because of our bank.

398
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,562
Hanasaki.

399
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,764
I will go back to headquarters.

400
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,399
Okay.

401
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:51,570
Please stay here with Matsuki
until Mr. Azumi wakes up.

402
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,038
Okay, I will.

403
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,234
Mr. Matsuki.

404
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,070
Please don't get up.

405
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,574
Sorry for causing you trouble.

406
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,176
No…

407
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,745
What time is it now?

408
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,515
It's almost three.

409
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,117
I have to go to Mitsuba Shinkin.

410
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,787
Doctor said that you have to rest today.

411
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,190
I have no time to rest in bed.

412
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,094
Please do as the doctor says,
just for today.

413
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:59,204
Why? Why is this happening?

414
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,542
What did my company do?

415
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,280
I am sorry.

416
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,584
My late father built that company

417
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,388
and worked hard to open up more locations.

418
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:21,092
There are customers who have been
with us for two generations,

419
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,596
and those who ride their bicycles for
30 minutes to shop with us.

420
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:32,971
Everyone says they come to my store
because they love Azumiya.

421
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,810
But why…

422
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,056
I will go back to headquarters
and talk to Mr. Soma about this.

423
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,058
Thank you.

424
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,194
I will try talking
to the Branch Manager again.

425
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,330
Will you be okay?

426
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,532
Yes.

427
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,735
When it comes to loans, never give up

428
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,172
and do everything that you can.

429
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,642
That's what Mr. Soma taught me
when I started working.

430
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,777
Mr. Soma said that?

431
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,682
When I was assigned to
the Finance Department,

432
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,719
I was very ambitious,
and wanted big projects

433
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,222
and to produce better results
than my other colleagues.

434
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,193
I always postponed the small companies.

435
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,964
As a result, I once forgot to submit
a request form in time

436
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,536
and a small printing company was
about to go bankrupt because of me.

437
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,406
But Mr. Soma negotiated
with lots of people…

438
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,408
Come on, apologize to them.

439
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,509
I am very sorry.

440
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,245
Somehow we were able to pass
the loan screening,

441
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,980
and the factory survived.

442
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,184
Mr. Soma did that…

443
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,823
Doing business with loans
can crash a company,

444
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,826
and it can save a company in a pinch.

445
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,663
That's the first time I realized that.

446
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:11,436
I will never forget what
Mr. Soma told me that time.

447
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,606
What did Mr. Soma say?

448
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,077
-Matsuki.
-Yes.

449
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,846
Banks deal with money

450
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,381
but we deal with people.

451
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,684
Keep that in mind.

452
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,320
Yes.

453
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,291
What he said has been supporting me.

454
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,697
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

455
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,100
FINANCE DEPARTMENT

456
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:49,741
I have a question about
a loan in Gotanda Branch.

457
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,110
GOTANDA BRANCH

458
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,812
I am back.

459
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,031
AZUMIYA STORE
REQUEST FOR LOAN EXTENSION

460
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,277
Come in.

461
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:28,880
Excuse me.

462
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,588
What is it?

463
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,229
Will you please think about
the loan extension for Azumi Store?

464
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,300
You're still talking about that?

465
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:01,413
I have a question about your decision.

466
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,614
Really?

467
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,385
Why are you so eager to provide a loan
for Coming Mart?

468
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,923
Why do you care about Coming Mart?

469
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,527
Because your lending stance
toward Coming Mart

470
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,631
is the complete opposite of Azumiya Store.

471
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,936
You said that Coming Mart is a winner

472
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,572
and Azumiya Store is a loser.

473
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,108
But…

474
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:34,212
currently, these two stores
have been performing equally.

475
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,716
That is because you are
overly committed to Azumiya.

476
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:41,052
No. I am trying to be fair.

477
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,990
Then what?

478
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,061
Do you want to say that
I am making an unfair decision?

479
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,166
Yes.

480
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,368
Fine.

481
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,141
I don't think you're suited
for the Finance Department.

482
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,683
Good luck in the world of losers.

483
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,120
Get out.

484
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,761
-You're back.
-Yes.

485
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,830
Mr. Azumi will stay
at the hospital tonight.

486
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,999
I see.

487
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,568
Mr. Soma.

488
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,806
Isn't there anything we can do?

489
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,578
I went to the Finance Department.

490
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:46,751
I heard something very strange
concerning Coming Mart.

491
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,987
What?

492
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,256
-Is that true?
-Yes.

493
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,128
The Finance Department plans to turn down
the loan extension for Coming Mart.

494
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,697
Why?

495
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:06,271
They aren't certain enough to approve the
security and prospects of that company.

496
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,377
Branch Manager Nakakita said that
Coming Mart has possibilities, right?

497
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,849
It looks like they are doing well
because they open new stores

498
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,851
but they're operating with debts.

499
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,287
They are in debt.

500
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,625
So they don't have financial power.

501
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,530
So now it's clear that Nakakita's
credit decisions were not correct.

502
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,765
Yes.

503
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:40,038
But that won't be reason enough to
stop him from collecting Azumiya's loan.

504
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,810
Mr. Matsuki said that he would
ask the Branch Manager again.

505
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,314
What? It's going to be impossible!

506
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,519
He is as straight as an arrow.

507
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,188
It's because of you, Mr. Soma.

508
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,126
Mr. Matsuki told me…

509
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:08,333
I will never forget what
Mr. Soma told me that time.

510
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,770
Banks deal with money,

511
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,474
but we deal with people.

512
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,710
Matsuki…

513
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,547
He remembers such a thing.

514
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,850
You have to take responsibility for him.

515
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,222
You are responsible for making
Mr. Matsuki a passionate banker.

516
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,363
Mr. Soma.

517
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:44,235
I think Branch Manager Nakakita is
trying to collect the loan from Azumiya

518
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,171
for the sake of Coming Mart.

519
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,908
Why do you think so?

520
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,911
Because Coming Mart's strategy is to

521
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,346
get rid of competitors near them.

522
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,750
Azumiya is hanging on a lot longer
than they imagined,

523
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,852
so they resorted to other means.

524
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,020
Yes.

525
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,290
Everything makes sense
when you think about it that way.

526
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,958
Then…

527
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:11,829
the reason why Branch Manager Nakakita
supports Coming Mart is…

528
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:13,798
money?

529
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,368
Mr. Soma.

530
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,571
Let's check Mr. Nakakita
and Coming Mart's bank account.

531
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,707
-We might find evidence.
-Okay.

532
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,076
-You check Coming Mart.
-Okay.

533
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,613
COMING MART
PRESIDENT HIROMASA KAMIYA

534
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,618
TOMOYASU NAKAKITA

535
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,600
Please don't worry.

536
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:54,505
It's only a matter of time
before Azumiya withdraws.

537
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,307
I see.

538
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,608
COMING MART
OPENING OF THE FIRST STORE

539
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,843
Thank you very much.

540
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,579
I knew I could count on you,

541
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,915
Branch Manager Nakakita.

542
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,116
PRESIDENT OF COMING MART
HIROMASA KAMIYA

543
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,852
I am glad that we opened
our store in Gotanda.

544
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,054
Thank you.

545
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,223
<i>By the way,</i>

546
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,858
<i>are you open tomorrow?</i>

547
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,560
Yes, I am.

548
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,596
I will drop by then.

549
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,032
I want to say thank you.

550
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,235
I will be waiting for you.

551
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,776
We couldn't find anything after all.

552
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:34,979
Huh?

553
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,516
I thought so.

554
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,218
What is it?

555
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,355
All of the transfers that
Coming Mart makes,

556
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,325
are to corporate accounts,

557
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,861
except these, which are personal accounts.

558
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,663
Eriko Taguchi?

559
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,838
AZUMIYA STORE

560
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,878
KEN SOMA

561
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,019
-This is Matsuki.
<i>-Hey, where are you now?</i>

562
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:16,754
What?

563
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,663
A dummy account?

564
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,633
We checked the suspicious
money flow from Coming Mart

565
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,668
and found this personal account.

566
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:36,174
This is a dummy bank account
with an unknown account holder.

567
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,811
Coming Mart is transferring money
into this account?

568
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,845
Yes.

569
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,449
It's not limited to Coming Mart either.
That account is receiving

570
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:48,052
hundreds of thousands of yen
from several big companies.

571
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,657
These are all customers of
the Gotanda Branch.

572
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,993
They're all companies
the Branch Manager is providing loans to.

573
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,729
I thought so.

574
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:05,870
Does this mean that Mr. Nakakita is
receiving bribes through this account?

575
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,438
Probably.

576
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,742
Mr. Nakakita is trying to
crush Azumiya Store

577
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,646
in return for receiving money
from Coming Mart.

578
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,217
That's unforgivable.

579
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,586
Where are you going?

580
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,321
I will ask him directly.

581
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,656
Wait a second.

582
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,526
Even if you ask him now,

583
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:33,231
he will deny everything saying that
it's nothing but your assumption.

584
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,066
What should I do, then?

585
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,335
Well…

586
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:44,175
We need to get evidence that
he is using this account, right?

587
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,143
I see.

588
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,579
If he has the passbook
and the cash card for this account…

589
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,780
Right.

590
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:54,118
But do you think that
we can check his bag?

591
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,887
No.

592
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,956
But he's hiding it somewhere.

593
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,560
Yes. He will be in big trouble
if someone sees him

594
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:07,098
walking around with a passbook
that has someone else's name on it.

595
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,433
That's right.

596
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,738
Somewhere close and safe?

597
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,577
In his drawer.

598
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,814
I saw it earlier when I went to his room.

599
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,783
Excuse me.

600
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,319
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

601
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,656
I saw him putting a passbook
in the drawer.

602
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,126
Was it from our bank?

603
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,929
Yes. When was this account opened?

604
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:43,501
Let me check. This is it, 1996.

605
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,270
The design of his passbook
is from that time.

606
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,271
Bingo!

607
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,306
Yes.

608
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,107
If we have that passbook…

609
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,309
It'll be evidence.

610
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,512
Yes, but we are not the police.

611
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,948
We are not allowed to do such a thing.

612
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,283
That may be right, but…

613
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,019
That's the only way to save Azumiya Store.

614
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,895
The problem is that the drawer is locked.

615
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,997
I'm sure he takes the key with him.

616
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,466
Maybe he has a spare key somewhere.

617
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,468
No, he's managing it on his own.

618
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,070
Oh, no…

619
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:26,244
We may be able to find… the spare key.

620
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,079
-What?
-What?

621
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,182
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

622
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,619
No one is here yet.

623
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,853
Let's hurry.

624
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,160
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

625
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,370
This is it.

626
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,774
I knew it.

627
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,409
-Let's find it.
-Yes.

628
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,765
Mr. Soma, do you think it's really here?

629
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,902
You said the spare key is
probably in his room because

630
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,805
bankers tend to hide important things
close to them.

631
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,775
I said "probably." I didn't guarantee it.

632
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,476
Not fair.

633
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,881
-Did you find it?
-Really.

634
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,256
It's so long.

635
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,490
What is it?

636
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,127
A pen?

637
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,296
How misleading!

638
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,131
People will come to the office soon.

639
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,399
Let's hurry up.

640
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,717
-Hanasaki!
-Sorry.

641
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,263
Look.

642
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:27,798
What is it?

643
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,513
It fits.

644
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,350
It turned.

645
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,654
Someone's coming.

646
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,791
Is it the Branch Manager?

647
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:54,959
Oh my God.

648
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,160
Please hide.

649
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,095
-Where?
-Here!

650
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,401
Only one person can fit.

651
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,542
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

652
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,292
It's okay.

653
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,163
-I was so nervous.
-This is bad for my health.

654
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,330
Sorry.

655
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,999
Okay. Let's do it.

656
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,515
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
ERIKO TAGUCHI

657
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,017
ERIKO TAGUCHI

658
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,152
We found it.

659
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,525
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK GOTANDA BRANCH

660
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:09,166
Are you sure I can have
such an expensive gift?

661
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:13,304
I had it specially made for you,
Mr. Nakakita. Please take it.

662
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,306
A token of my appreciation.

663
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,241
Thank you very much.

664
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,709
Let's try it next month.

665
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,411
I found a nice golf course.

666
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,946
Sounds great.

667
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:25,049
I wish to continue
this business relationship with you.

668
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,317
Me, too.

669
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,119
Yes.

670
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,622
Excuse me.

671
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,259
Why are you guys here?

672
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,329
Matsuki! What is this all about?

673
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,000
I came here to talk to Mr. Nakakita.

674
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,170
I have a guest here.
Where are your manners?

675
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,340
I want President Kamiya
to listen to this too.

676
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,980
I am Soma from Branch Inspection
at Tokyo Daiichi Bank Headquarters.

677
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:56,881
I am Hanasaki.

678
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,318
President Kamiya,
in order to get rid of your rival,

679
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,454
Azumiya Store,

680
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,825
you paid money to Branch Manager Nakakita
and asked for his support.

681
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,193
Am I right?

682
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,062
That's ridiculous.

683
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,865
Branch Manager Nakakita.

684
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:20,704
You tried to collect the loan from
Azumiya Store in return for the money.

685
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,608
How rude! I never did such a thing.

686
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,444
Here.

687
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,215
This is a statement of
a particular bank account.

688
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,483
ERIKO TAGUCHI

689
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,755
In the last six months,
Coming Mart made two transfers

690
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,258
of one million yen each into this account.

691
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,661
That's two million yen in total.

692
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,632
So what?

693
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:54,305
The name on this account
doesn't actually exist,

694
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,041
but the person using it

695
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,077
is you, Mr. Nakakita.

696
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,746
It can't be…

697
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,757
How dare you open my drawer
without my permission?

698
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,826
I got permission from my boss.

699
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,299
No, there must be some mistake.

700
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,702
I don't know about that account.

701
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:29,306
Eleven more companies who are
customers of Gotanda Branch

702
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,809
have transferred money into this account.

703
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:37,414
And the person who has been eagerly
providing loans to all of those companies,

704
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,451
is you, Branch Manager Nakakita.

705
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,456
You received money from them

706
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,257
and gave them special treatment.

707
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:50,828
No.

708
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,565
If you don't admit it now,

709
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,201
we will ask the businesses you had
dealings with.

710
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,972
You should honestly admit it

711
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,875
if you have pride as a banker.

712
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,884
President Kamiya,

713
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,222
have you ever worked in your store?

714
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,996
Whenever President Azumi has spare time,
he works at his store,

715
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,765
to listen to his customers,

716
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,601
so that he can improve his store.

717
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:35,072
I think that is why
Azumiya has been loved by the locals,

718
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,641
for such a long time.

719
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,778
But you are trying

720
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:47,651
to crush his store
by using these dirty tricks.

721
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,857
You have failed as a businessman.

722
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,032
Excuse me.

723
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,535
President!

724
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,004
President!

725
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,144
What a mess!

726
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,950
This is all because of that loser company.

727
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,786
With all due respect…

728
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:29,126
I don't think Azumiya is a loser.

729
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:35,232
First of all, what is
a loser and a winner?

730
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,968
You have no right to decide that!

731
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,003
What?

732
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,341
Mr. Matsuki is working hard
to extend Azumiya's loan

733
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,609
to save President Azumi.

734
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,579
On the other hand,

735
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,316
you are working to provide
loans for Coming Mart,

736
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,552
to get money for yourself.

737
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,054
-Shut up!
-No, I won't.

738
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,358
Banks deal with money,

739
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,727
but we deal with people.

740
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,364
Mr. Matsuki took those words to heart,

741
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,367
as he continued to work providing loans.

742
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,038
I don't know much about loans.

743
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,208
However,

744
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,045
people who only think of money
shouldn't hurt people

745
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,249
who are working for the people.
That's wrong!

746
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,023
There were illegal dealings
behind your loan screening for Azumiya.

747
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:40,464
What you have done is completely
unforgivable as a banker.

748
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,138
Please cancel the loan collection.

749
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,530
AZUMIYA STORE

750
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,200
-Really?
-Yes.

751
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:20,270
We cancelled the collection
of one million yen.

752
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:26,977
Please let us continue the loan as before.

753
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,215
Thank you.

754
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,017
I am so glad that you are in charge.

755
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:40,224
Let's continue working together.

756
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,226
Thank you.

757
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,966
Do you need a tissue?

758
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,567
Shut up.

759
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,272
Mr. Soma must have been a great boss

760
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,275
to have raised such
a wonderful subordinate.

761
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,811
I was just lucky.

762
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,447
And look what I have now.

763
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,848
What do you mean?

764
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,885
Nothing.

765
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,228
Mr. Nakakita received
a disciplinary dismissal, huh.

766
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,097
It's reasonable.

767
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,232
Branch Inspection did a great job.

768
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,568
I'm so glad.

769
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,803
You can't be happy for long.

770
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,243
At least, Mr. Shindo
is not happy about this.

771
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,382
Mr. Nakakita was in the Shindo faction.

772
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,518
The Branch Inspection duo

773
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:46,890
may have unintentionally caused a stir
with the battle for the next Presidency

774
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,359
between Mr. Shindo and Mr. Doujima.

775
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,094
That's my guess.

776
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,731
DISCIPLINARY DISMISSAL

777
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,502
The Branch Inspection did
something unnecessary again.

778
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,937
Something unnecessary?

779
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:00,971
Yes, sir.

780
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,874
He was a Branch Manager whom you favored…

781
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,742
-Mr. Kodama.
-Yes?

782
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:13,850
I have nothing to do with
a man named Nakakita.

783
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,853
Am I right?

784
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,624
Sure. I was wrong.

785
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,660
-I think so, too.
-Yes, sir!

786
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,136
It's delicious.

787
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,007
I can tell you really like it.

788
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,610
I'm so happy because I'm finally able
to eat this.

789
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:44,281
Thank you very much.

790
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,351
I will never forget what
you and Mr. Soma did for me.

791
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,954
Stop that. Plus, you treated me to this.

792
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,423
I admire you, Ms. Hanasaki.

793
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,828
You have a strong will and firm attitude.

794
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,197
I have to be like you.

795
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,832
Not at all.

796
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,769
Mr. Matsuki, you were cool too.

797
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:15,679
-Um… Ms. Hanasaki.
-Yes?

798
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:20,183
There is a restaurant near here
that serves delicious cured meat.

799
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,120
-Would you like to come with me?
-Yes.

800
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:24,955
Really?

801
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,924
Yes, I would love to.

802
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,064
-Mr. Soma!
-What's up?

803
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,101
Mr. Matsuki says he will take us to
a restaurant with cured meat.

804
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,269
Matsuki?

805
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,370
What?

806
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,240
I was asking for a date.

807
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,878
Is that the famous one near here?

808
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,181
-Yes.
-Thanks, Matsuki.

809
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,183
This is the one.

810
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,018
It looks delicious.

811
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,720
Yes, it is.

812
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,522
I'm sure it is.

813
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:01,324
A5 ranked Japanese Black. It sounds great.

814
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,226
I can't wait.

815
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,564
Three million?

816
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,999
<i>Was it embezzled?</i>

817
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,068
<i>Are you saying that we hid it?</i>

818
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,536
<i>Cash leaves no trail.</i>

819
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,337
<i>We have to catch that moment.</i>

820
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,206
Why did you go that far?

821
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,674
I can finally end it here.

822
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,944
I will not forgive you.
