1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:07,307
It's been a while since
I came to such a fancy restaurant.

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,875
It's so exciting.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,712
Mai. You can drink as much as you want.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,514
Tell us everything. We're all ears.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,415
What?

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,018
Like why you were dumped
by your boyfriend.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,454
I was not dumped.
We just broke up, that's all.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,224
Tell us everything, including all of that.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,827
You have permission to drink
until you lose your memory and pass out.

10
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,430
Aki. Yuri.

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,034
It's so nice to have girlfriends.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,769
Same here.

13
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,471
Let's drink tonight.

14
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,372
YONOSUKE

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,974
Let's see…

16
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,111
Fried squid, beef stew…

17
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,981
The fried chicken sounds good too.

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
We just got paid, so let's go all out.

19
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,385
Yes.

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm sure my wife will understand.

21
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,757
Let's order all of it.

22
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,259
Sure.

23
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,195
Mai, is it just you and your boss
at your workplace?

24
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,230
Yup, usually.

25
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,232
How can you stand that?

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,035
I don't think I could do that.
It would be so uncomfortable.

27
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,570
He's all right.

28
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,440
He's easy-going so I don't care.

29
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,443
You sound like someone who's been
married for a long time.

30
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,877
What do you mean?

31
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,879
I have a good idea.

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,449
Can't he be your next boyfriend?

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,386
No way! Stop joking. He's kind of old.

34
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,754
How old is he?

35
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,056
He's about 15 years older than me.

36
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,525
That's not a problem.

37
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,827
That's even better.

38
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,729
Are you serious?

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,732
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

40
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,308
It's Mr. Karashima.

41
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,944
Sorry…

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,780
Cheers!

43
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,284
MR. SOMA

44
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,553
Sorry. Start without me.

45
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,555
This is Hanasaki.

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,357
Inspection.

47
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,192
Next Monday?

48
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,196
No. It's an emergency inspection.
We have to go now.

49
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,197
What?

50
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,733
Right now?

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,667
Yeah.

52
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,736
But…

53
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,038
This is delicious.

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,711
I really don't feel like going either.

55
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,348
Sorry, but I'll leave it to you.

56
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,783
Okay…

57
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,157
Cash was lost at the Roppongi Branch.

58
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,424
Cash?

59
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,296
Cash was lost? How much?

60
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,599
Three million yen.

61
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,334
Three million yen?

62
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,171
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

63
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,424
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK ROPPONGI BRANCH

64
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,526
I am Kanda, the Sales Section Chief.

65
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,664
Branch Manager is on his way
back from a business trip.

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,933
I will be in charge until he is back.

67
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,168
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

68
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,671
The Sales Department are all here.

69
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,906
TELLER, KYOKO YOSHIKAWA

70
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:31,844
I can't believe this is happening
while the Branch Manager is away.

71
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:37,150
Can you tell us the sequence of events
after you found out the cash was lost?

72
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,651
Yes.

73
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,323
It was around 3:30 p.m. when we noticed
that the cash was unbalanced.

74
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,857
What?

75
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,093
We are three million yen short?

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,896
We've calculated many times,
but it doesn't balance.

77
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,464
Whose window?

78
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,365
Ms. Masuno.

79
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,467
I am very sorry.

80
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,803
Ms. Masuno.

81
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,608
Check the slips and automatic cashier
for any errors.

82
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,543
Check everything you can think of.

83
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,611
Yes, sir.

84
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,212
Check the drawers and garbage.

85
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,381
Check everything on this floor.

86
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,349
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,119
Check the garbage room!

88
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,455
Um…

89
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,690
Let's check the security camera.

90
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,526
We've checked everything.

91
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,528
But we can't find it.

92
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,064
I see.

93
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,237
Um…

94
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,006
It's hard to say this, but…

95
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,344
We were busy today because it is
the pay-day before the weekend.

96
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:43,483
So the cash management was not
as thorough as it should've been.

97
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,717
What do you mean?

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,818
Um…

99
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,791
The tellers shared passwords
for the teller machine

100
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,793
to withdraw cash.

101
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,028
ENTER THE PASSWORD

102
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,099
We wanted to save time.

103
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,467
Thank you.

104
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,403
-I'll put it here.
-Thank you.

105
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,540
I see.

106
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,245
That made it harder
to track the money flow.

107
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,714
Yes. I am sorry.

108
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,983
I didn't take part in that.

109
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:22,121
That's why I'm always telling you guys
not to break the rules.

110
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,756
I am very sorry.

111
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,528
Could it be an over-payment?

112
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,933
We called all the customers
who received over one million yen.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,869
But they said they didn't receive extra,

114
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,907
and as far as I could see
on the security camera,

115
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,944
I didn't see Ms. Masuno giving
the customers an extra bundle of cash.

116
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,979
Did you check carefully?

117
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,816
Yes, of course.

118
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,018
Um…

119
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,455
It's probably not an over-payment.

120
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,026
Over-payments are errors by the teller.

121
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,330
It's not impossible
to mistakenly give one extra bundle of

122
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,166
a million yen.

123
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:13,973
But I think it's impossible to mistakenly
hand someone three extra bundles.

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,041
Then…

125
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,978
Do you want to say that
someone hid the cash on purpose?

126
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,080
That's not what I meant.

127
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,182
Could it be…

128
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,885
embezzlement?

129
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,789
We have to think about
that possibility too.

130
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,763
Mr. Soma.

131
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,265
What should we do?

132
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,137
We may need to check
your personal belongings.

133
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,540
-Check our personal belongings?
-You mean…

134
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,142
You mean us too?

135
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,042
Yes.

136
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,781
Everyone, I understand
your cause for complaint.

137
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,717
However, if we cannot find
the three million yen

138
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,586
everyone on this sales floor
will be called

139
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,591
to the Inquiry Commission at headquarters.

140
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,829
Let's do it.

141
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,931
We will check your personal belongings.

142
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,801
First this floor, then the locker room.

143
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,639
Please place everything in your bag
onto your desk.

144
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,274
Let's start.

145
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,511
If looks could kill…

146
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:30,383
Playing the villain at a time like this,
is also the role of a Branch Inspector.

147
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,524
Everything is okay. Thank you very much.

148
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,061
We're done with the male employees.

149
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,597
Thank you very much.

150
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,833
Next…

151
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,768
Ms. Ryoko Izawa.

152
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,070
Why do I have to do this?

153
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,739
I am sorry. Excuse me.

154
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,383
I don't see any problem.

155
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,451
Of course not.

156
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,520
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,224
Ms. Kyoko Yoshikawa.

158
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,059
Yes.

159
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,760
This is mine.

160
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,761
Excuse me.

161
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,241
Nothing.

162
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,710
Thank you very much.

163
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,949
-Ms. Rie Masuno.
-Yes.

164
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,084
Ms. Hanasaki.

165
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,553
Be extra thorough.

166
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,490
Excuse me.

167
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,404
Do you mind if I open this?

168
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,375
-But…
-Is there anything you can't show her?

169
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,046
May I?

170
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,616
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

171
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,756
You smoke?

172
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,358
-Sorry.
-So misleading!

173
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,629
Okay.

174
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,832
This is fine. Thank you very much.

175
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,903
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

176
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,406
Cash is missing?

177
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,643
Yes. Branch Inspection
is at the Roppongi Branch right now.

178
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,278
But it's not been found yet.

179
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,014
Three million yen.

180
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,319
-Who's the Branch Manager at Roppongi?
-Kubodera.

181
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,654
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TSUYOSHI SHINDO

182
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,755
Kubodera?

183
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,290
SECRETARIAL OFFICE ASSISTANT GM:
NAOKI KODAMA

184
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,260
He is in Senior Executive Director
Doujima's faction.

185
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,362
I see.

186
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,933
I feel sorry for
Senior Executive Director Doujima.

187
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,672
It's a troublesome issue right after
he landed this new post.

188
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,776
I agree.

189
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,249
You won't be able to do as you like

190
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,185
from now on.

191
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,464
The check is complete.

192
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,700
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

193
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,638
The culprit should step forward,

194
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,973
or it will make things awkward
at this branch.

195
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,378
This is not good.

196
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,349
If we find the cash, it means
there is a criminal in this branch.

197
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,085
But not finding three million
is also a problem.

198
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,453
I understand.

199
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,789
-Mr. Kanda.
-Branch Manager.

200
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,592
I'm Soma from Branch Inspection.

201
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662
I am Kubodera, the Branch Manager.

202
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,663
BRANCH MANAGER TOSHIYA KUBODERA

203
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,164
Did you find it?

204
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,199
Not yet.

205
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,335
I see.

206
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,171
This is a serious problem.

207
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,575
Um…

208
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,348
It is not fair to treat Ms. Masuno
as a criminal.

209
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,285
This is her responsibility, that's a fact.

210
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,954
If we can't find it,

211
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,025
we will continue to be suspects,
even though we are innocent.

212
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,361
All because of Ms. Masuno.

213
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,365
You'll never understand
how humiliating that is,

214
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,967
because you are from headquarters.

215
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,406
Ms. Masuno is also feeling the humiliation

216
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,508
of being suspected of embezzlement.

217
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:58,150
I know how much responsibility
a teller holds for their own window.

218
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,519
I used to be a teller.

219
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,996
We tried hard,
but we still couldn't find the cash.

220
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,665
It can't be helped.

221
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,934
Let's call it a day.

222
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,436
Thank you for your cooperation.

223
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,072
Thank you.

224
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,745
Thank you for your hard work.

225
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,846
We will come again.

226
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,948
-Thank you.
-Yes.

227
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,925
Good night.

228
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,130
Good night.

229
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,702
Thank you for everything.

230
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,636
No…

231
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,808
At this rate, everyone will be suspicious
of each other,

232
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,377
and it will end up
making the atmosphere even worse.

233
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,879
Yes.

234
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,849
Anyways, we must find the cash.

235
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,286
It's causing me stress.

236
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,026
Are you okay?

237
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,195
Yes.

238
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,531
Ms. Hanasaki.

239
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,600
Thank you for standing up for me earlier.

240
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,004
I may have overstepped my boundaries.

241
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,177
I was in a panic when it was busy
with lots of customers.

242
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,282
If someone were to ask me
if I processed the cash properly,

243
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:41,554
or if I didn't make any errors,
I couldn't answer with confidence.

244
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,858
But I swear that I did not steal it.

245
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,526
Yes.

246
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,629
Excuse me.

247
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,065
Good night.

248
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,911
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

249
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,784
I wonder if we can find
the three million yen.

250
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,586
I don't know.

251
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,122
Do you think someone embezzled it?

252
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,993
I don't want to think that,
but it's hard to deny that possibility.

253
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,098
With accidents involving cash,
even if we were to retrieve it back

254
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,702
it doesn't mean that we'll also
find the culprit behind it.

255
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,606
The principal of the bank is
"cash leaves no trail."

256
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,308
We must catch them in the act.

257
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,745
Which means we may not find out the truth.

258
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,185
You both look so gloomy.

259
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,254
We have many problems.

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,154
MAI'S DAD KOZO HANASAKI

261
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,489
What happened?

262
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,226
Listen to this. In the Roppongi Branch--

263
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,963
We can't say. It's confidential.

264
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,398
-Sorry.
-I see.

265
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,736
Ah… chocolate.

266
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,906
Give me one. I've been wanting sweets.

267
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,774
Can I have one too?

268
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,310
Sorry, but they're all gone.

269
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,280
Is that dried bonito?

270
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,615
Yes. This is the perfect size for this.

271
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,251
How misleading.

272
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,887
What's written on the box
isn't always what's inside.

273
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,924
Oh, I forgot.

274
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,994
I wanted to eat something sweet.

275
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,264
I will go to a convenience store
on my way back home.

276
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,200
-Mr. Soma.
-Yeah?

277
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,503
What will you do about
the Roppongi Branch?

278
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,874
We've done everything we can.
What else can we do?

279
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,610
I feel sorry for Ms. Masuno
with the way things are.

280
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,614
I know.

281
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,253
I wonder when the cash left that branch.

282
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,759
There is a moment when
three million yen became lost, right?

283
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,995
Yes, that moment surely exists.

284
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,166
I want to check the footage
from the security camera.

285
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,469
No, Mr. Kanda said that
he checked it already.

286
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,040
If I look at it from the point of view
of a former teller,

287
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,544
I may be able to find
something that he overlooked.

288
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,516
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK ROPPONGI BRANCH

289
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,520
These are the transaction slips
from Friday.

290
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,155
Thank you very much.

291
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,091
You're going to check them all?

292
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,594
Yes. I want to check them
in chronological order.

293
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,664
This is a lot.

294
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,600
I will help you.

295
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,770
Thank you very much.

296
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,720
The way Ms. Yoshikawa works
is very careful, fast, and precise.

297
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,722
I feel like this is double speed.

298
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,826
Yes. I feel comfortable
entrusting her with everything.

299
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,369
Is there anything?

300
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,243
There's a lady who came back
after finishing her transaction

301
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,046
and received something from Ms. Yoshikawa.

302
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,618
Look at this.

303
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,119
It can't be…

304
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,691
No. That's a pack of tissues.

305
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,599
-You are right.
-Hey!

306
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,034
Sorry.

307
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,003
I remember her.

308
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,406
She said she wanted a clock
we distribute as a novelty item.

309
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,008
The table clock?

310
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,210
Yes. Let me see.

311
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,112
This is it.

312
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,682
She saw the other customers getting it.

313
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
Yes, there are customers like that.
Here it is.

314
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,757
Yeah, this is not the kind of novelty item
we'd give to just anyone.

315
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,093
This is for the customers

316
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,696
who open a fixed deposit account
of over one million yen.

317
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,234
She came to the window just to
make a new passbook.

318
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,572
Usually we'd end up giving it to
someone who's this persistent.

319
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,374
I'm surprised she left
with just some tissues.

320
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,612
I guess Ms. Yoshikawa really
plays by the book.

321
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,515
More than that, she's very meticulous.

322
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,984
I can imagine that.

323
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,000
BRANDAGE
KOUICHI BABA

324
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:56,869
Huh?

325
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,509
What now?

326
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,347
I just found something strange…

327
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:12,518
Ms. Yoshikawa gave the clock
to this customer.

328
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,086
-A clock?
-Yes.

329
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,290
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

330
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,127
This customer only came in
to withdraw 150,000 yen.

331
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,462
What?

332
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,498
Even though she refused to
give it to the other customer.

333
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,335
This isn't like Ms. Yoshikawa.
I wonder what happened.

334
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,506
Did she give it to him
because he's her friend?

335
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,011
Well, I don't think Ms. Yoshikawa
would do something like that.

336
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,818
How misleading.

337
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,821
What's written on the box
isn't always what's inside.

338
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,859
There might have been
something else inside.

339
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,993
Inside?

340
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,128
Let me check.

341
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,264
Look at this box.

342
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,534
Don't you think it would fit
three bundles of one million yen?

343
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,971
You're right. This is the right size.

344
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,706
Wait a minute.

345
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,376
You're saying that Ms. Yoshikawa
put three million yen in here

346
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,578
and gave it to him?

347
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,381
There's no way she'd conspire with
a customer to do that.

348
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,384
But if it's placed in here and handed off,

349
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,921
cash can be taken out without
anyone realizing it.

350
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,289
Right.

351
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,557
But…

352
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,595
Customers are called,
in the order of the ticket number.

353
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:34,600
So there was no guarantee that this
customer would get Ms. Yoshikawa's window.

354
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,069
Yes, she could.

355
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,106
Ms. Yoshikawa is an experienced teller.

356
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,909
She's able to adjust
the transaction time so that

357
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,578
she gets a certain customer at her window.

358
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,982
But even if she's able to do that,

359
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,584
I don't think she would do such a thing.

360
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,119
Who is that customer?

361
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:01,426
It's Mr. Kouichi Baba of Brandage Ltd.

362
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,661
Who is he?

363
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,430
He runs an import goods store in Azabu.

364
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,099
I don't know much about him.

365
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,535
He got a loan from us.

366
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,345
Business with Brandage
started three years ago.

367
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,481
The loan balance is ten million yen?

368
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,652
Yes. He's applying for
an additional loan right now.

369
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,889
The decision will be made tomorrow,
but we will most likely turn it down.

370
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,758
They're not doing well?

371
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,460
Lately, they're in the red.

372
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,029
In the red…

373
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,665
Excuse me.

374
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,770
President Baba?
Okay. I'll be there in a minute.

375
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,273
Excuse me. Mr. Baba is here.

376
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,608
Thank you.

377
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,244
Thank you for waiting.

378
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
PRESIDENT OF BRANDAGE LTD.
KOUICHI BABA

379
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,415
I wanted to ask about the additional loan.

380
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,319
I am sorry, but we're still
in the process of discussing it.

381
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,888
I really need this.

382
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,657
I need your support, Mr. Kiyama.

383
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,726
Yes.

384
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,128
I will be waiting for a favorable answer.

385
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,500
Mr. Kanda.

386
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,870
I will borrow this.

387
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,039
-What?
-Hey.

388
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,550
-Mr. Baba.
-Yes?

389
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,552
Please take this with you.

390
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,953
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

391
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,021
What?

392
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,889
This is our popular novelty item.

393
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,659
It is a gift to you for using our bank.

394
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,430
Do you already have one, by any chance?

395
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,399
No, I don't.

396
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,803
Good. Then please take it with you.

397
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,374
Thank you.

398
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,609
Thank you for using our bank.

399
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,643
Thanks.

400
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,384
You almost gave me a heart attack.

401
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:12,257
But now we know that
Mr. Baba has never seen that clock before.

402
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,392
That's right.

403
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,062
The box Ms. Yoshikawa gave to
President Baba

404
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,765
did not have a clock in it after all.

405
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,002
Ms. Yoshikawa is a very serious
and hardworking teller,

406
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,339
who is trusted by the customers.

407
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,942
I don't want to believe it.

408
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,491
CLOSED

409
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,027
Hearing Ms. Yoshikawa's personality

410
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,130
makes me feel that
our assumptions are wrong.

411
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,601
Serious-minded people can
get out of control,

412
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,538
once they stray from the right path.

413
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,586
Mr. Soma.

414
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:15,921
Let's follow her.

415
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,256
We don't have to do that.

416
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,425
We may be able to find something.

417
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,460
Taxi.

418
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,961
Hey!

419
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,330
Excuse me!

420
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,731
Hanasaki.

421
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,799
Hurry up, Mr. Soma!

422
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,001
Damn it.

423
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,537
Please follow the taxi in front of us.

424
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,272
We are not detectives.

425
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,082
Can we get this reimbursed?

426
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,183
Hurry up.

427
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,220
It's 1,230 yen.

428
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,722
Don't push me, you idiot.

429
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,627
Isn't that Brandage?

430
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,466
-Hey. Let's go.
-Yes.

431
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,740
-Which way?
-That way.

432
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,214
They look very close.

433
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,317
I don't think they just met yesterday.

434
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,088
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

435
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,324
What? Ms. Yoshikawa and President Baba?

436
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,828
Yes. I think they are in a relationship.

437
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,168
This is the transaction record
of Ms. Yoshikawa's account.

438
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,239
Her money has been

439
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:45,043
used to pay rent and energy bills,
sending money home, fixed deposit,

440
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,678
and life insurance.

441
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:51,049
A set amount was being used
from her account every month.

442
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,921
But a year ago,

443
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,724
her withdrawals increased,
and her balance decreased.

444
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,027
She cancelled her fixed deposit too.

445
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,764
We ran a credit check on her

446
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,833
and found that she is
over ten million yen in debt.

447
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,673
Most likely, she's giving all the money
to President Baba.

448
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:21,012
I didn't know Ms. Yoshikawa
was in such trouble.

449
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,517
She gave three million yen
by hiding it in a novelty gift box.

450
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,024
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

451
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,695
We can't do anything without evidence.

452
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,030
She won't admit it even if we ask her.

453
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,765
Right.

454
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,636
Excuse me.

455
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,404
What's up, Kiyama?

456
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,107
I just met President Baba of Brandage.

457
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,811
I told him the request for
an additional loan was declined.

458
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,646
He seems to be in a dire situation.

459
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,881
-Really?
-Yes.

460
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,085
He said his request for
Hakusei Bank was turned down too.

461
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,687
He may not make it through this month.

462
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,022
When is the settlement?

463
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,023
End of the month.

464
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,492
He may not have enough funds by then.

465
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,461
That's highly possible.

466
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,363
What did Mr. Baba say?

467
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,132
He was very upset.

468
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,235
Tokyo Daiichi Bank is abandoning me?

469
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,940
I see.

470
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,212
I wanted to report to you first.
Excuse me.

471
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,647
Thank you.

472
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,019
Branch Manager Kubodera.

473
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,690
They may try the same thing again.

474
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,459
What?

475
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,497
Even though they succeeded once,
I highly doubt

476
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,000
they'll risk another attempt
in such a short span of time.

477
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,070
But his company will go bankrupt
if they don't do anything.

478
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,305
We can't rule it out.

479
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,975
I see.

480
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,848
Last time, Ms. Yoshikawa embezzled money
on the busiest day when

481
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,650
the tellers were frantic.

482
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:12,057
If she is to try again,
she will choose the busiest day.

483
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,028
Which would be the 31st.

484
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,799
If he gets money on the 31st,
Brandage will not go bankrupt.

485
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,668
If we catch the moment,

486
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,770
we'll have evidence.

487
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,306
Cash leaves no trail.

488
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,676
We must catch that moment.

489
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,057
Mai. I'm going to take a bath.

490
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,759
Go ahead.

491
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,862
What's wrong? You look serious.

492
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,399
I have a question.

493
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,802
Were you able to do anything for Mom?

494
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,405
Why this all of a sudden?

495
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,007
Just curious.

496
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,712
Well… I had regrets when she died

497
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,014
because I thought I could've done more.

498
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,684
I felt that I should've done more.

499
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,286
Even if that was against the law?

500
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,288
That sounds extreme.

501
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:23,461
But it's possible if there's something
you really want to protect.

502
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,831
Whether you carry that out or not
is another story.

503
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,702
I see.

504
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,142
I'll go now.

505
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,224
JULY 31ST

506
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,629
You look so glum.

507
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:04,402
I bet you're thinking, "I don't want
Ms. Yoshikawa to commit another crime."

508
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:11,843
But she has already committed a crime,

509
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,612
by doing something a banker
should never do.

510
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,785
She needs to be charged for that crime.
It's for her own good.

511
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,589
It has to be today.

512
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,626
Yes.

513
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,202
Today is Friday, the 31st.

514
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,571
It is expected to be very busy.

515
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,340
So I requested help from headquarters.

516
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:47,078
I am Hanasaki. I will do my best today.

517
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,413
Thank you.

518
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,382
Please do your best today.

519
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,450
Yes.

520
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,288
Ms. Hanasaki. I'm counting on you.

521
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,356
Yes.

522
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,326
What happened to the three million?

523
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,930
It was processed as
a temporary advance for now.

524
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,868
I see. Either way, don't slow us down.

525
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,670
Yes. I will do my best.

526
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,645
-I will do my best.
-Thank you.

527
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,018
Ms. Yoshikawa, let's do our best.

528
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,087
Thank you.

529
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,104
Now, let's see.

530
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,207
I wonder if he'll come.

531
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,180
Good morning.

532
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,349
Good morning.

533
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,988
Thank you for waiting.

534
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,591
-Thank you very much.
-Yes.

535
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,316
<i>Customer with ticket number 115…</i>

536
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,917
-Here it is.
-Okay.

537
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,817
He came.

538
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:06,951
CARD SLOT

539
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,455
Thank you very much.

540
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,898
Ms. Yoshikawa is an experienced teller.

541
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:24,302
She's able to adjust
the transaction time so that

542
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,738
she gets a certain customer at her window.

543
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,473
A withdrawal?

544
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,158
Thank you very much.

545
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,533
Ms. Saga.

546
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,138
Here is 500,000 yen. Please confirm.

547
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,609
Thank you very much.

548
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,611
Thank you.

549
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,148
<i>Customer with ticket number 384…</i>

550
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:18,790
<i>Customer with ticket number 385,</i>
<i>please come to window four.</i>

551
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,924
Good afternoon.

552
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,592
Hello.

553
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,494
A withdrawal?

554
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,730
Please wait a moment.

555
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,697
Okay.

556
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,180
Brandage Ltd.

557
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,085
Here is 500,000 yen. Please confirm.

558
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:55,927
Thank you.

559
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,499
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

560
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,770
This is a gift from our bank.

561
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,541
Thank you.

562
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,754
What is it?

563
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:29,293
Mr. Baba. I think we gave you
this clock the other day,

564
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,530
so we'd like to offer you
a different one today.

565
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,732
What?

566
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,604
I'm sorry, but can you
give that back to us?

567
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,027
Excuse me.

568
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,664
Would you please come with me
to the other room?

569
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,667
Excuse me, but I will step away from
my window.

570
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,071
Ms. Yoshikawa. You…

571
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,969
The police will arrive soon.

572
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,542
President Baba, would you please tell us
everything before the police arrive?

573
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,315
I will apologize in advance,

574
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:36,854
but we investigated everything about you.

575
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,259
You were…

576
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,795
giving all of your money to
Mr. Baba, right?

577
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,035
Why did you have to go that far?

578
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,239
How could you steal money from the bank?

579
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,075
You couldn't refuse?

580
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,380
It was my decision.

581
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,483
He didn't ask me to do this.

582
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,923
I don't understand
why you had to go this far.

583
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,728
-Because--
-I'm marrying him.

584
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,767
When

585
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:29,106
I met him, I felt that being
on my own until then

586
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,444
was all worth it.

587
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,180
Please check your passbook.

588
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,515
ONE YEAR AGO

589
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,416
Thank you.

590
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,657
He made…

591
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:49,760
my boring

592
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:56,033
and dull life, bright and colorful.

593
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,636
Let's go.

594
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,804
Yes.

595
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,011
SIX MONTHS BEHIND REPAYMENT SCHEDULE

596
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,679
So…

597
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,717
I wanted to do

598
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,088
all that I can for him.

599
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,802
Even if that was something
I should never do as a banker

600
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,904
and a teller.

601
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,108
This is for you from our bank.

602
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,176
Thank you.

603
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,214
I knew it was something I should never do.

604
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,531
But right now,

605
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,708
I'm feeling somewhat relieved.

606
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,548
I can finally end this.

607
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,853
I knew this would happen someday,

608
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,925
but I couldn't end it on my own.

609
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,230
I am sorry.

610
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,640
He is not bad at all.

611
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,348
I planned everything
and put it into action

612
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,052
all on my own.

613
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,768
Hanasaki.

614
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,671
Yes?

615
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,108
I had President Baba investigated.

616
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,610
INVESTIGATION REPORT

617
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,348
Ms. Yoshikawa was deceived.

618
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:38,329
Like I said, I don't know anything.

619
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,365
Why do I have to go to the police station?

620
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,768
You're suspected
as an accomplice of embezzlement.

621
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,538
She did it all by herself.

622
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,040
I didn't know about the cash.

623
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,545
But you received three million yen
on the 24th.

624
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,449
I have no idea what you are talking about.

625
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,532
You're despicable!

626
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,635
What are you doing?

627
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,436
You hit customers at this bank?

628
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,671
Hanasaki, calm down!

629
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,474
What Ms. Yoshikawa did was a crime.

630
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,845
But she had been
living an honest life until now.

631
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,551
But she lost everything

632
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,488
without knowing what
a despicable man you are.

633
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,694
There is nothing left
in Ms. Yoshikawa's account,

634
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,629
and she is in debt.

635
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,366
She will lose her job too.

636
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,577
Why are you blaming me for all of that?

637
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,412
I don't understand.

638
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,785
You may not have asked her to
give you money or commit embezzlement.

639
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:12,489
However, you drove her to do so.

640
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,227
Hey, we love each other.

641
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,496
She gave me money of her own will.

642
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,132
What's wrong with that? Is that a crime?

643
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,870
She spent money to buy love.
Isn't that fair?

644
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,443
With all due respect…

645
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:38,382
she doesn't think she bought love
with money.

646
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,687
She…

647
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:49,493
Ms. Yoshikawa just fell in love with you.

648
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,098
She dreamed of a future with you,

649
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,067
and wanted to help you

650
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,004
so she kept pushing herself,

651
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,307
although it was in the wrong way.

652
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,811
But you are different.

653
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,148
You deceived Ms. Yoshikawa.

654
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,850
So annoying.

655
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,786
You pretended to love her
in order to get money.

656
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,820
Shut up!

657
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:17,955
No, I won't.

658
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,627
Hey.

659
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,464
Did she say that she was deceived?
I don't think so.

660
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,333
Because I didn't do that.

661
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,074
President Baba.

662
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,145
It's not just Ms. Yoshikawa, right?

663
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,880
What?

664
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,051
Ms. Keiko Okada.

665
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,521
Ms. Manami Hattori.

666
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,758
Ms. Aya Uno.

667
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,464
You seem to be receiving money
from many women.

668
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:07,838
They're all saying that they're
planning to marry you.

669
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,609
Isn't this called fraud?

670
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:21,552
You will be investigated by the police
for this as well.

671
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,565
I don't know how you will be judged
by law.

672
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,136
But…

673
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,774
I will not forgive you.

674
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,510
Never!

675
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,628
We are from Azabu East Police.

676
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,196
We have been waiting for you.

677
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,302
Are you Mr. Kouichi Baba?

678
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,139
Please come with us.

679
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,775
Don't touch me.

680
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:28,846
Senior Executive Director!

681
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,480
Please give us a comment.

682
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:34,685
I am very sorry for the trouble
and worry we have caused

683
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:39,022
regarding the stolen cash incident
at our bank.

684
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:44,094
<i>The police and related authorities</i>
<i>are investigating this case.</i>

685
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,330
<i>So I will decline to</i>
<i>comment on the matter…</i>

686
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,433
You did a great job.

687
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,102
Was it a great job?

688
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,840
You prevented further crime
and helped them catch the criminal.

689
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,642
It was a great job.

690
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,480
What's wrong with Ms. Hanasaki?

691
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,851
She's dealing with a lot of
emotions right now.

692
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,553
I see.

693
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,957
I guess Ms. Hanasaki has
a sensitive side to her too.

694
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,025
Yes.

695
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,527
Surprisingly.

696
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,465
THE MAIN SUSPECT WAS A MARRIAGE CON ARTIST

697
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,333
FORMER EMPLOYEE AT TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
SUSPECT KYOKO YOSHIKAWA

698
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,049
Hello, Senior Executive Director Doujima.

699
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,653
-Hello.
-I'm sorry for your misfortune.

700
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:47,958
A scandal at the branch,
managed by someone you are favoring.

701
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,793
It was a tough inaugural gift.

702
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,295
I understand.

703
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,865
But it was not a big deal.

704
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:59,336
Something like that can't even
be called a scandal.

705
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,773
But you shouldn't let your guard down.

706
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:09,746
You never know what will cause you
to unexpectedly fall at a bank.

707
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,050
You are right.

708
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,219
I will keep that in mind.

709
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,521
Thank you.

710
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,740
Good work.

711
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,375
Excuse me.

712
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,353
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

713
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,533
What is it? You're sighing again?

714
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,105
Stop it. People will think
that my dishes aren't tasty.

715
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,473
Sorry.

716
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,475
What's wrong?

717
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,143
You're so docile today.

718
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,646
Dad.

719
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,250
I don't know what it is to love someone.

720
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,152
Huh?

721
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,422
Mai?

722
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,291
Are you in love?

723
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,562
That's why you asked me
such a serious question the other day.

724
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:33,997
No, I was just--

725
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,433
Is it Mr. Matsuki of Gotanda Branch?

726
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,535
I'm Matsuki.

727
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,338
Ms. Hanasaki,
I can tell you really like it.

728
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,272
What?

729
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,673
I fully support that.

730
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,208
Dad, listen…

731
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,443
Good evening.

732
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,980
-Welcome. Listen, Mr. Soma.
-Yes?

733
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,348
What is it?

734
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,617
Mai is in love.

735
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,519
-Love?
-No.

736
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,621
-Who is it?
-Guess who?

737
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,623
-No! Stop it.
-Okay.

738
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,224
I won't tell.

739
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,226
Do you want to know?

740
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,929
-Sure.
-No.

741
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,230
Stalker?

742
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,665
It's someone in the Loan Department.

743
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,233
Shut up.

744
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,268
Let's investigate.

745
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,969
This case is closed.

746
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,172
I won't go easy on you.

747
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,140
It's a completely different case.

748
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,376
You're the one who has to take

749
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,944
the responsibility.
