TOKYO DAIICHI BANK HEADQUARTERS

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,971
I don't wear a uniform,

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,408
so I wear clothes
that will leave a good impression.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,577
My motto is neat and tidy.

5

COMPANY NEWSLETTER

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,450
I don't wear any accessories either.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,353
They get in the way when I run.

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,088
Run?

10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,692
It happens once in a while.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,397
-I see.
-Any other questions?

12
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,433
No. Shall we go to the lobby
to take pictures?

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,368
Sure.

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,837
Let me touch up my makeup again.

15
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,774
I am Mai Hanasaki.
My motto is neat and tidy.

16
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,545
She's getting carried away.

17
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,921
-Ms. Hanasaki.
-Yes.

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,592
-Please be normal.
-Okay, then.

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,327
How about this?

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,531
Hanasaki.
This is only a company newsletter.

21
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,068
But it'll be distributed
to all the branches nationwide.

22
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,703
Sorry. How about this one next?

23
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,446
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TSUYOSHI SHINDO

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,466
Good morning, Executive Director Shindo.

25
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,767
Good morning.

26
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,504
This is a photoshoot
for the company newsletter.

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,674
This is an article about female employees.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,412
Yes. It just so happens that
I'm going to be featured this month.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,448
I hear you're doing a good job these days.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,984
Thanks.

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,823
Branch Inspection is doing
unnecessary things again.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,728
A company that has women
actively taking initiative,

33
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,097
has better future prospects.

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,968
Thank you very much.

35
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,541
-Let's go, Mr. Kodama.
-Yes.

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,318
He praised me.

37
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,923
It's about time you learn
how to read between the lines.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,026
-Let's keep going.
-You're taking more?

39
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,761
Please go ahead.

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,598
Hello.

41
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,233
Where are you guys?

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,235
What's wrong, Mr. Shibasaki?

43
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,671
There's trouble.

44
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,940
Please go to the Machida Branch right now.

45
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,775
What?

46
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,577
URGENT CASE:

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,645
INVESTIGATE A FEMALE STALKING VICTIM
IN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT

48
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,846
-Stalker?
-Stalker?

49
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,584
Yes. A female employee at Machida Branch
is being stalked.

50
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:08,688
That's awful. Stalking is a mean
and malicious crime.

51
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,123
An enemy to all women.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
But why do we have to go?

53
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,961
Right. Why don't they
report it to the police?

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,699
-Right?
-Well, it's complicated.

55
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,134
What do you mean?

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,439
I see. The stalker might be
one of our employees?

57
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,542
-What?
-It's something like that.

58
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,745
I can't believe there's
a stalker among us!

59
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,447
We don't know yet.

60
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,482
It's bad if our employee is a stalker,

61
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,585
so they want it solved quietly.

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,554
They want to sweep it under the rug, huh?

63
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,756
That's typical of top management.

64
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,492
Don't get worked up so early
in the morning.

65
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,196
You don't understand how stressful
it is for female employees

66
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,366
who are working in
a male-dominated society.

67
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,069
They say that it is time
for women to shine,

68
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,171
but they're being stalked. How horrible.

69
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,175
There aren't many men who would have
the guts to stalk Ms. Hanasaki.

70
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,177
She's so scary.

71
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,580
What did you say?

72
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,750
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

73
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,019
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

74
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,669
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK MACHIDA BRANCH

75
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,772
-Hello.
-Thank you for waiting.

76
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,073
I want to withdraw cash.

77
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,845
I've only heard of stalkers on the news.

78
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,681
I can't believe it's happening
in our branch.

79
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,050
It was very unexpected.

80
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,020
I didn't want to
report it to headquarters,

81
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,790
but our employee made such a big deal,
that I had no choice.

82
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,425
I understand.

83
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:58,564
I was wondering who would be sent from
Branch Inspection at headquarters but…

84
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,468
Nice to meet you.

85
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,872
You haven't reported this to the police?

86
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,475
Doing that will give this branch
a bad reputation.

87
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,812
Why do you think that we called you?

88
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,548
The victim is suspicious
of her colleagues,

89
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,317
so we want to keep it quiet.

90
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,385
I see.

91
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,122
It's such a big pain
during this busy season.

92
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,357
I agree.

93
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,595
That's why I was against having
a woman in the Finance Department.

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,499
We had no trouble like this before.

95
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,601
With all due res--

96
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,139
Please talk to her directly.

97
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,943
Please don't make this into a big deal.

98
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,545
Yes.

99
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,184
What's wrong with those two?

100
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,553
Branch Manager hates trouble,

101
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,421
and the Section Chief is sexist.

102
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,758
I understand, so calm down.

103
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,295
They don't care about
the female employee who is a victim.

104
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,764
I understand, so lower your voice!

105
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:08,835
I am Maehara.

106
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,039
I've been in the Finance Department
since two years ago.

107
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,243
You were hired by our bank ten years ago.

108
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,948
Starting at Otemachi Branch, you went to
Jiyugaoka Branch for three years,

109
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,384
and three years at Kawasaki Branch.

110
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,053
You are an elite.

111
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,454
Not at all.

112
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,558
The Finance Department is
a male-dominant workplace.

113
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,027
Isn't it tough
as the only female employee?

114
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,096
No, it's okay.

115
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,534
I can tell that it's not easy
to work with those managers.

116
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,437
I manage it somehow.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,543
We hear that you are being stalked.

118
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,445
Yes.

119
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,280
Will you please tell us the details?

120
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,153
It started about three months ago.

121
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,593
Hello?

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,196
First, it was a silent phone call.

123
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,330
Hello?

124
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,436
I started receiving several calls
a week at night.

125
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,336
UNKNOWN CALLER

126
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,878
Just when the calls finally stopped…

127
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:40,259
Someone started following me
on my way back home.

128
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,096
You didn't see the stalker's face?

129
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,599
I was so scared that I couldn't see.

130
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,501
I understand.

131
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,138
But it didn't stop there.

132
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,307
What else?

133
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,379
Last Friday, someone
broke into my apartment.

134
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,215
What?

135
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,820
There was trouble that day at work,

136
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,290
so I came home after midnight.

137
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:16,329
I knew something was off the moment
I stepped inside.

138
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,664
My slippers were not aligned.

139
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,968
Is that all?

140
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,737
-Could it be your mistake?
-Mr. Soma.

141
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,172
No.

142
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,978
I always straighten my slippers
at the front door before I leave.

143
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,980
It's a habit.

144
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,483
My dad does that too.

145
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,120
Was there anything stolen?

146
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,557
Luckily, nothing was stolen.

147
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,893
I checked my accessories, cash,

148
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,428
and underwear.

149
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,866
But I have no doubt that
someone entered my room.

150
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,003
There are things that only you can notice.

151
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,072
Wait a minute.

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,643
What happened to the key
to your house? Was it locked?

153
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,378
That's the point.

154
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,881
That's why I doubt my colleagues.

155
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,716
What do you mean?

156
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,721
I had lost my key that day.

157
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,361
So I went to get the spare key
from my sister who lives nearby.

158
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,867
But now that I think about it,
I don't think I lost it.

159
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,470
I think someone in this branch stole it.

160
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,975
That's why you told the Branch Manager
that you want to report it.

161
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,144
Yes.

162
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,580
Do you have any idea who it might be?

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,818
Well… I can't say for certain.

164
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,423
Section Chief told me that
I'm probably imagining things.

165
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,695
We're on your side, Ms. Maehara.
Please don't worry.

166
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,331
We will keep what you said a secret.

167
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,800
We will help you as much as possible.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,038
Thank you very much.

169
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,345
I think it is someone
in the Finance Department.

170
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:16,449
I always keep my bag under my desk.

171
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,386
That's the only way my key
could have gotten stolen.

172
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,793
Beside Ms. Maehara, there are nine people.

173
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,365
Let's ask everyone.

174
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,401
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,103
What are you going to do?

176
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,440
Are you going to ask each person
if they are stalking Ms. Maehara?

177
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,743
Good point.

178
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,047
If there is a criminal among them,
we'll be making him wary.

179
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,051
We shouldn't tell them that
we're Branch Inspection.

180
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,119
I see.

181
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,924
I have a good idea.

182
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,860
FINANCE DEPARTMENT NAOKI WADA

183
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,061
You're HR?

184
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,796
-Yes.
-Yes.

185
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,632
We are visiting all the branches
talking to everyone

186
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,601
about ways to improve the workplace.

187
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,537
Today, we are asking
people in the Finance Department.

188
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,539
I see.

189
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,642
Do you have any problems
or complaints these days?

190
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,944
Not in particular.

191
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,817
How are people in the Finance Department?

192
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,420
No problem.

193
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,656
We have good teamwork under Mr. Komiyama.

194
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,393
That sounds wonderful.

195
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,897
Stop staring, Hanasaki.

196
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,769
I have lots to say to HR.

197
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,473
My colleagues are promoted accordingly,

198
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,309
but why haven't I moved up
to the manager position?

199
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,078
Well…

200
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,946
It isn't fair!

201
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,782
You'll never understand.

202
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,153
Do you know how many years
I've been waiting?

203
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,358
HR never understood me to begin with.

204
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,862
You don't understand me at all.

205
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:16,001
Ms. Maehara seems to be working hard
as the only female employee.

206
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,270
How do you view her as a colleague?

207
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,274
I think she is very competent.

208
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,710
She's very cognizant about
the people around her,

209
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,679
so I learn a lot from her.

210
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,581
What else?

211
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,250
That's all.

212
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,786
Are you sure?

213
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,526
That's all for today.
Thank you for your cooperation.

214
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,228
Excuse me.

215
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,401
Hey.

216
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,171
Stop making things so obvious.

217
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,940
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

218
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,445
There were so many times when I almost
asked, "Aren't you the stalker?"

219
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,681
Thanks for not asking.

220
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,285
-Let's move on.
-Okay.

221
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,357
So you're saying that you didn't find
any employee that was suspicious.

222
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,626
Right. For today.

223
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,530
-Hard to tell from an interview--
-Are you satisfied?

224
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,200
We even bothered Branch Inspection,
but there was nothing.

225
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,371
Let's close this case, okay?

226
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,811
Nothing good will come
from making this into a bigger problem.

227
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,379
Maehara.

228
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,049
Branch Manager is saying this
with your best interest in mind.

229
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,919
Yes.

230
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,056
Isn't this stalker just
in your imagination to begin with?

231
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,426
Imagination?

232
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,096
There are excessively self-conscious women

233
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,933
who mistake others
as gropers on the train.

234
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,103
Try to understand the people
who have to deal with your paranoia.

235
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,706
Worst-case scenario,

236
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,109
you could have turned your colleagues
into criminals.

237
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,415
I am sorry.

238
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,251
-With all due respect--
-Hanasaki.

239
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,959
Ms. Maehara,
you have no time for this, right?

240
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,295
You should be thinking of the future.

241
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,699
You can't stay here forever, after all.

242
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,035
-What do you mean--
-Anyway.

243
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,939
This case is closed.

244
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,743
Yes.

245
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,955
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

246
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,423
One more beer.

247
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,694
What's wrong?
You seem to be having a rough day.

248
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,030
Did something happen again?

249
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,266
Yes, this and that.

250
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,469
Did my daughter cause you any trouble?

251
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,070
Not at all.

252
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,107
I'm the one causing trouble.

253
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,708
-Is that so?
-Yes.

254
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,678
This dish is our specialty.

255
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,813
The ultimate eggplant.

256
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,815
Specially made for the beautiful lady.

257
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,551
-Just for her?
-Thank you very much.

258
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,954
You're so weak with pretty girls.

259
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,856
What's wrong with that?

260
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,324
Mr. Kozo, beer please.

261
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,793
Okay. Please enjoy.

262
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,668
I am sorry that I couldn't be of any help.

263
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,771
No. I really appreciate you both.

264
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,908
Despite what Branch Manager said,
we will continue the investigation.

265
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,344
There she goes again.

266
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:51,483
I can't believe sexist people
like Mr. Komiyama still exist.

267
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,288
Does he know the time he's living in?
It's 2015.

268
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,523
I'm used to it.

269
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,591
Don't get used to it.

270
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,261
Someone has to teach him a lesson.

271
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:08,067
Must be nice for you, since you always
teach people lessons without holding back.

272
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
What?

273
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,471
Sometimes I hold back
and endure the situation too.

274
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,672
Like when?

275
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,009
I held my fist like this
and endured it earlier.

276
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,178
My nails were sticking into my palm.

277
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:25,351
It's true that patience is necessary
when working under Mr. Komiyama.

278
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,889
He hasn't liked me ever since I was
assigned to the Machida Branch.

279
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,057
Really?

280
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,495
He always found a way to pick on me.

281
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,899
So you're saying that there was an error
in my judgement?

282
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,903
-No, I just--
-Don't make excuses!

283
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,874
I am sorry.

284
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,510
You probably got carried away
because people

285
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,979
treated you well at the Kawasaki Branch.

286
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,483
But I won't go easy on you
just because you're a woman.

287
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,986
How dare he say such a thing!

288
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,189
Was he always like that?

289
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,693
I heard from my senior

290
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,064
that Mr. Komiyama was beaten to
a promotion by a female colleague.

291
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,603
They say he was probably not
happy about that.

292
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,005
That makes no sense.

293
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,643
So he's being mean to you
just because you're a woman?

294
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,780
How pathetic.

295
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,348
He can't help it.

296
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,519
His colleagues were all promoted but
he's the only one that's a Section Chief.

297
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,722
As you saw, the Branch Manager
is younger than him too.

298
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,425
-He can't help but be bitter.
-Even so…

299
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,731
By the way,
when the Branch Manager told you

300
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,634
"You can't stay here forever,"

301
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,835
what did he mean?

302
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,240
Do you know the company Aoyama Kengyou?

303
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,843
Aoyama Kengyou?

304
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,180
It is a construction company
that recently went bankrupt.

305
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,950
I was in charge of financing that company.

306
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,387
How much was it?

307
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,390
In total, 300 million yen.

308
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,027
Among that, the uncollectible amount
is 200 million yen.

309
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,263
-Two hundred million yen?
-Oh no.

310
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,432
I have to take responsibility.

311
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:24,203
I'm sure I'll be sent somewhere
during the next rotation.

312
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,606
I see.

313
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,143
I always worked hard

314
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,646
so that people would not look down on me
for being a woman.

315
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,416
I didn't think
I'd fall at a place like this.

316
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,285
It's not fair.

317
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:44,056
She was in charge of the loan
to the company that went bankrupt.

318
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,159
That's more than enough reason
to be demoted.

319
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,661
One X-mark can end everything.

320
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,665
-That's how a bank works. Right?
-That's right.

321
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,534
That slogan is wrong.

322
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,635
It's not a slogan.

323
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,571
The bank must be a tough place.

324
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,507
This is on us.

325
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,243
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.

326
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,144
Thank you.

327
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,046
Please come to my restaurant anytime.

328
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,783
Dad, you are smiling too much.

329
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,156
It looks delicious.

330
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,777
You can't feel at ease
until the stalker is caught, huh?

331
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,678
You are right.

332
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,816
How are you being followed
when you go home from the office?

333
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,187
Well…

334
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:54,026
I usually notice on my way home
from the station.

335
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,929
What day of the week?

336
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:04,169
Well, Wednesday is more likely
because there's no overtime.

337
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:09,074
Tomorrow is Wednesday, isn't it?

338
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,343
I know what you are thinking.

339
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,145
Mr. Soma, let's do a stakeout.

340
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,717
Are you trying to follow her
like a detective?

341
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,819
You're not going to do anything?

342
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,754
Ms. Maehara is so scared.

343
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,590
No, but…

344
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:29,328
Mr. Soma, you said that
you would help her as much as you can.

345
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,196
Was that touching statement a lie?

346
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,265
-It's not a lie.
-Then help her.

347
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,268
No, I can't trouble you like that.

348
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,973
Don't worry.
Let's find the stalker together.

349
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,175
Thank you.

350
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,312
You must be kidding.

351
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,056
Hanasaki speaking.

352
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,226
This is Shibasaki. I am in position. Over.

353
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,196
Roger. Thank you.

354
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,467
Why did you invite Mr. Shibasaki?

355
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,571
I didn't. But he said he wanted
to join when I talked to him.

356
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,843
Apparently, Mr. Shibasaki wanted to be
a detective when he was a child.

357
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,311
Don't look.

358
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,816
I couldn't say no to him.

359
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,458
Here she comes.

360
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,394
She left the office.

361
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,164
I will follow her to see
if there is anyone suspicious. Over.

362
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,232
<i>Roger.</i>

363
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,480
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,949
-What is it?
-I'm sorry.

365
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,851
I can't believe it.

366
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,056
Oh?

367
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,558
Hey.

368
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,233
-This is Hanasaki. Any news?
-Sorry, I lost track of her.

369
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,069
-Lost track?
-Lost track?

370
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,707
I'm busy right now.
I'll leave the rest to you.

371
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,277
He hung up.

372
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,046
I didn't expect much from him
to begin with.

373
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,595
Message from Ms. Maehara.
She's arrived at the station.

374
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,798
I wonder if the stalker will appear.

375
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,469
I don't know if things will
work out so well.

376
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,170
Here comes another message.

377
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,072
She said someone is following her.

378
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,141
Here it comes.

379
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,169
Let's go.

380
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,286
KEEP WALKING - HANASAKI

381
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,142
Wait for me.

382
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,894
Excuse me.

383
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,483
Wait!

384
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,210
Garbage?

385
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,316
You can't run away from us.

386
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,556
You are…

387
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,525
Mr. Furuhashi?

388
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,597
What's going on? Explain yourself.

389
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,200
What are you doing?

390
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,371
I liked Ms. Maehara for a long time.

391
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,675
But she wasn't interested in me.

392
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,011
Do you think that's going to be
a good enough excuse?

393
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,614
This is going to be a hassle.

394
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,849
I am sorry.

395
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,454
What were you trying to do
by following her?

396
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,556
Nothing.

397
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,626
I just wanted to see her.

398
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,164
Was it you who made
the silent calls to her?

399
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,833
Yes.

400
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,004
Do you know what you have done?

401
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,941
Ms. Maehara has been scared
for a long time.

402
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,779
I am sorry.

403
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,451
You even entered her room.
That's horrible.

404
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,219
What?

405
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,455
Don't play dumb.

406
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:08,226
You entered Ms. Maehara's room
without permission last Friday.

407
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,529
No, I didn't.

408
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,833
You're not going to admit it?

409
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,369
I don't want to have to say this,

410
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,704
but the police can uncover everything.

411
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,308
I didn't enter her room.
Please believe me.

412
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,576
Furuhashi!

413
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,413
I really didn't.

414
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,752
Anyway, stay home
until we decide how to deal with you.

415
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,053
Do you understand?

416
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:38,356
Yes.

417
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,062
I see.

418
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,165
Thank you very much.

419
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,299
No worries.

420
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,005
Will Mr. Furuhashi be fired?

421
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,807
I don't know yet.

422
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,811
But since he admitted to stalking you,

423
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,148
he will have a big X-mark
on his career as a banker.

424
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:10,288
There's something that bothers me
about this.

425
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,724
Mr. Furuhashi admitted that
he stalked her,

426
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,127
but why didn't he admit
that he entered the room?

427
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,229
He didn't admit it?

428
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:23,668
If he admits to breaking and entering,
he will be punished more severely.

429
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:28,673
But I think he made the situation
worse by denying it.

430
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,343
Don't you think it's better for him
to admit everything?

431
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,781
Hey, don't say things that will
worry Ms. Maehara even more.

432
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,719
I'm sorry. It was nothing
but my personal opinion.

433
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,422
This is all we can report.
Sorry to disturb you at night.

434
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,757
Thank you.

435
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,691
Excuse me.

436
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,864
You were working until this late?

437
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,639
These are financial documents
for Aoyama Kengyou.

438
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,746
Didn't Aoyama Kengyou go bankrupt already?

439
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes.

440
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,984
I know I'm not supposed to
bring these documents home,

441
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,721
but I made a copy
before it was sent to headquarters.

442
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,689
For what?

443
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:24,963
I suspect Aoyama Kengyou
of planned bankruptcy.

444
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,065
Planned bankruptcy?

445
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:31,903
You mean they deceived
the bank and went bankrupt on purpose?

446
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,107
What did Branch Manager or Komiyama say?

447
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,278
They didn't take me seriously.

448
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,415
Do you have any evidence
of planned bankruptcy?

449
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,585
Not yet.

450
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,054
I want to investigate it.

451
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,359
What do you think, Mr. Komiyama?

452
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:59,164
I checked the financial documents,
but I didn't see anything suspicious.

453
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,699
I think she's reading too much into it.

454
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,168
No way…

455
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,337
That's what the Section Chief is saying,
so it's settled.

456
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,306
-However--
-You.

457
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,508
You just don't want to

458
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,944
take responsibility
for the 200-million-yen loss.

459
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,079
That's not it.

460
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,383
Anyway, this case regarding
Aoyama Kengyou will be sent

461
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,019
to the Debt Recovery Department
at headquarters.

462
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,521
This is a decision by the Branch Manager.

463
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,691
You will take responsibility

464
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,727
as the one who was in charge of the loan.

465
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,767
It was no use, whatever I said.

466
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,469
So you made a copy
of the financial documents to

467
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,871
investigate it in secret.

468
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,442
I don't think the Debt Recovery Department

469
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,177
will clarify the flow of funds.

470
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:52,350
But I haven't found any evidence
regarding the planned bankruptcy either.

471
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,985
Can I see the document?

472
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,455
Here.

473
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,827
It may be hard to believe,
but Mr. Soma used to be a capable worker

474
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,629
in the Finance Department.

475
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,232
No need to say, "hard to believe."

476
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,881
It seems like a page was ripped off here.

477
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,184
Do you remember what was there?

478
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,320
I made an index.

479
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,055
Please wait a moment.

480
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,295
LIST OF TRANSFER ACCOUNTS

481
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,733
What's missing is the list of accounts
for the transfers.

482
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,301
When did you see this last?

483
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,137
When I made a copy last week.

484
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,044
Mr. Soma, what's wrong?

485
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,148
It might not be Mr. Furuhashi
who entered this room.

486
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,116
What?

487
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,318
What do you mean?

488
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,022
This is a completely separate case
from the stalker.

489
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:10,028
The target for the break-in
was not Ms. Maehara,

490
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,064
but this document.

491
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,466
He knew that you were investigating

492
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,002
the planned bankruptcy by Aoyama Kengyou

493
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,673
and tried to steal the document secretly.

494
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,810
Then the person who entered here
is someone from Aoyama Kengyou?

495
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,713
I don't know yet.

496
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,185
But there's a reason why the culprit
didn't want you to see that list.

497
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,124
The original document was sent to

498
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,794
the Debt Recovery Department
at headquarters, right?

499
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,695
Yes.

500
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,464
If we see that, we may be able
to find out something.

501
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,199
Let's check it out.

502
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,407
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

503
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,944
I can't believe Furuhashi was the stalker.

504
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,780
People are never what they appear to be.

505
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,849
Good morning.

506
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,866
DEBT RECOVERY DEPARTMENT

507
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,239
Here it is.

508
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,340
What is it?

509
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,744
We just want to check something.
I am sorry.

510
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,459
It's not in here.

511
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,461
Not in here, either.

512
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
What's happening?

513
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,865
The transfer account list

514
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,134
was removed at the Machida Branch.

515
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,071
It means that Aoyama Kengyou has
an accomplice in the branch.

516
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,906
Yes.

517
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,945
-An accomplice?
-Yes.

518
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,883
We think someone in Machida Branch
is working with the culprit.

519
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,218
No way.

520
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,721
Who knows that you took

521
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,358
Aoyama Kengyou's financial documents home?

522
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,662
Everyone in the Finance Department knows.

523
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,268
I told them during a meeting that
I made a copy to investigate it.

524
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,404
Who gave you permission to do that?

525
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,907
Section Chief was very upset.

526
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:43,848
Then everyone in the Finance Department
can be a suspect.

527
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,217
You are right.

528
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,887
The accomplice took the list
of transfer accounts before…

529
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,590
AOYAMA KENGYOU

530
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:58,729
…Aoyama Kengyou's financial documents
were sent to headquarters.

531
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,667
Later on, when he found out
that you had made a copy,

532
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,503
he secretly stole your house keys

533
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,977
and entered your room to take away
the same page from the document.

534
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,719
I can't believe it.

535
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,555
Who did such a thing?

536
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,858
We will continue to investigate.

537
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,329
Will you please keep this a secret?

538
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:34,966
I will.

539
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,103
Mr. Soma. What's your plan?

540
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,405
Let's go to Aoyama Kengyou.

541
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,342
-We might find an employee.
-Okay.

542
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,161
An accomplice?

543
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,262
Yes.

544
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,732
We think someone in Machida Branch
is working with the culprit.

545
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,182
Maehara.

546
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,184
You look lost.

547
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,519
I am sorry.

548
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,956
We're missing one employee
because of someone. Work hard.

549
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,394
-Yes.
-Damn. This is such a hassle for us.

550
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:42,833
Aren't you partly responsible
for the way Furuhashi acted?

551
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,735
Am I right?

552
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,947
NOTICE
INSOLVENT AOYAMA KENGYOU

553
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,650
Is that so. I see.

554
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,552
How was it?

555
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:06,023
They said they can't distribute
the documents to individual creditors.

556
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,993
That's the right answer for a lawyer.

557
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,095
I see.

558
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,465
I guess we have to do it the hard way.

559
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,401
Do you know of a way?

560
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,737
No…

561
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,040
but maybe yes.

BRANCH INSPECTION

564
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,549
Um…

565
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,652
This is Aoyama Kengyou's transfer data
for the last year.

566
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,723
Are we going to check all this?

567
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,025
I told you that it was the hard way.

568
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,428
This is too hard.

569
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,032
The transfer account was taken away
because there's an

570
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,135
account that they don't want to be seen.

571
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,404
It's in here.

572
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,778
We must do it.

573
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,648
Let's find any suspicious account.

574
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:08,119
Although it'll be like finding
a needle in a haystack.

575
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,158
Let's check every single one
in the database.

576
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,426
Okay.

TOKYO DAIICHI BANK MACHIDA BRANCH

582
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,925
You checked all the transfer accounts
for Aoyama Kengyou?

583
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:32,863
Yes. It was really hard,
but it was worth it.

584
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:38,335
We found one account that
does not exist in our database.

585
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,273
<i>We investigated that company</i>
<i>and found out that</i>

586
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,709
<i>it has a connection</i>
<i>with someone in the Machida Branch.</i>

587
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,981
It means that Aoyama Kengyou
was paying money to someone

588
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,783
at the Machida Branch.

589
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,387
Who was it?

590
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,790
We will tell you in person, Ms. Maehara.

591
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,091
We will be there.

592

TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

593
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,375
Branch Manager. Please check this.

594
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,678
Thank you very much.

595
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,521
Excuse me.

596
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,967
What's the matter?

597
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,238
The disciplinary action for
Mr. Yoichi Furuhashi was announced today.

598
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,306
I wanted to let you know.

599
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,741
-What?
-Really?

600
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,809
Yes.

601
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,078
What is the disciplinary action?

602
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:55,980
Official warning.

603
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,648
An official warning?

604
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,288
Is that all?

605
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,291
A transfer is being discussed as well.

606
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:08,826
What's wrong?

607
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,063
No. I'm surprised
that it's not very serious.

608
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,465
Wait a minute.

609
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,070
Furuhashi broke into Maehara's house.

610
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,307
It could become a criminal case.

611
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,142
I thought he'd be dismissed.

612
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,046
Of course, the breaking and entering
will be a criminal case.

613
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,416
He's going to the police as an employee?

614
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,884
No.

615
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,220
I don't understand at all.

616
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,023
He has to take responsibility
for what he has done.

617
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,825
We have to set an example for
the other employees.

618
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,763
The person who broke into
Ms. Maehara's house was not Mr. Furuhashi.

619
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,499
What?

620
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,602
Then who was it?

621
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:57,741
It was you, Mr. Komiyama.

622
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,647
Don't talk nonsense!

623
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,116
Why would I do that?

624
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,586
To destroy the evidence of your

625
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,654
connection with Aoyama Kengyou.

626
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,591
Is that true, Mr. Komiyama?

627
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,193
No! I had nothing to do with that.

628
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:24,368
We think Aoyama Kengyou's
bankruptcy was planned.

629
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,707
The president is most likely hiding
his funds somewhere.

630
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,677
Mr. Komiyama knew that fact

631
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,280
but purposely overlooked it

632
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,682
and received money in return.

633
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,787
You took the list of transfer accounts

634
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,590
from Aoyama Kengyou's documents
located at this branch.

635
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,829
You stole Ms. Maehara's house key.

636
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:58,602
You entered her room
and ripped out the account list.

637
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,109
You did all of that.

638
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:09,647
It's a lie.

639
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,384
That's all just your imagination.

640
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,587
Unfortunately, it's not our imagination.

641
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,958
We investigated to see what was on

642
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,427
Aoyama Kengyou's transfer account list

643
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,830
that you tried so hard to hide.

644
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,304
There is a consulting company
called Brain Institute.

645
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,740
I'm sure you know it.

646
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,977
It has no business history.

647
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,313
It's like a dummy company.

648
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,018
Aoyama Kengyou transferred
five million yen to this company

649
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,988
as a consultation fee.

650
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,894
The name of the president
is Sayoko Komiyama.

651
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,933
Mr. Komiyama, she is your wife.

652
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,204
If this company and the transfer
comes to light,

653
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,240
so will your connection
with Aoyama Kengyou.

654
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:15,679
That's why you tried to hide it,
no matter what.

655
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,355
Headquarters is investigating
this case thoroughly.

656
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,826
They are interviewing
the president of Aoyama Kengyou.

657
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,097
It's only a matter of time
before everything comes to light.

658
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,966
What have you done?

659
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,307
Damn it.

660
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,493
What do you know about me?

661
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:08,198
How many years do you think
I have worked for the bank?

662
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,536
I worked without complaining

663
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,372
and got many big loans.

664
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,040
But…

665
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,845
when will they make me a Branch Manager?

666
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,949
They never give me a fair evaluation!

667
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,220
What's wrong with receiving
five million yen?

668
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,991
Compared to the contribution
I made to this bank,

669
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,293
it's nothing.

670
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,333
With all due respect…

671
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,271
it is not "nothing."

672
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,541
You were about to cause

673
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,011
over 200 million yen in damages
to Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

674
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,647
What's more,

675
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,183
you were about to damage something that is

676
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,285
most important to a bank. Trust.

677
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,155
The person who prevented that

678
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,593
was a someone you tried to get rid of
just because she's a woman.

679
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,694
Ms. Maehara.

680
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,432
-Shut up!
-No, I won't!

681
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,537
Ms. Maehara gave her best
to produce results despite

682
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,006
all the harassment she received.

683
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:28,312
She was even ready to accept
the unreasonable grounds for her dispatch.

684
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:35,152
Although you were in the position
to lead your subordinates,

685
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,188
you lent a hand to help a customer
with planned bankruptcy.

686
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,592
That's definitely wrong!

687
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,264
You just said that one has to take
responsibility for what he has done,

688
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,800
to set a good example for the employees.

689
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,338
Then the person who has to
take responsibility right now

690
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,375
is you, Mr. Komiyama.

691
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,565
Thank you very much.

692
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,684
Aoyama Kengyou?

693
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:46,556
Mai, isn't this the company
you were talking about the other day?

694
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,659
Yes.

695
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,627
Many companies go bankrupt these days.

696
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,563
We have to be careful too.

697
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,534
We are fine, because you are working hard.

698
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,770
Planned bankruptcy, huh?

699
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,772
That's terrible.

700
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,976
But what is planned bankruptcy?

701
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,646
Well, planned bankruptcy is…

702
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,316
Wait a minute. I'm late.

703
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,452
I will explain it later.

704
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,621
Thank you for breakfast. See you later!

705
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,957
Take care.

706
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,094
Bankrupt.

707
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,063
Dad.

708
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,632
I will work hard.

709
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,871
As advised by Mr. Shindo,

710
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,841
Mr. Komiyama received
a disciplinary dismissal.

711
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,244
The Branch Manager
was transferred to a local branch.

712
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,814
Everything is settled.

713
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,215
I see.

714
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,953
We were able to avoid
tarnishing our bank's reputation.

715
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,689
Yes. It's all thanks to
Executive Director Shindo.

716
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:58,795
As a business leader, I must get used to
handling crisis management.

717
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,732
It was a beautiful job.

718
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,977
Ms. Maehara continues to work
in Machida Branch.

719
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,245
Good for her.

720
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,781
She was able to avoid
the X-mark on her career.

721
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,717
Rather, she got a big plus.

722
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,552
Good morning.

723
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,187
Good morning, Mr. Shibasaki.

724
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,990
I got this from the PR Department.
Fresh off the press.

725
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,393
I was interviewed for this.

726
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,728
-Let me see.
-Yes!

727
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,497
Where are you?

728
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,132
Here.

729
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,002
It's so small.

730
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,171
Why is it so small?

731
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,709
I guess this story came in
at the last minute.

732
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,676
I see.

733
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,013
Look at last month's issue.
It was a full-page spread.

734
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,782
Try next time.

735
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,317
I was defeated by a bear.

736
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,354
They should have added one more page.

737
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,956
They interviewed me for 30 minutes.

738
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,625
It's about three lines.

739
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,728
Why?

740
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,197
Ex-wife?

741
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,365
I'm Yumi Ishihara.

742
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,301
-Loan?
-I thought I'd ask your bank.

743
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,370
Aoi is hiding something from us.

744
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,571
Why do you defend him?

745
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,939
He's my friend.

746
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,141
Can't you see that Mr. Soma is suffering?

747
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,176
Shut up, Hanasaki.

748
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,944
That's wrong!
