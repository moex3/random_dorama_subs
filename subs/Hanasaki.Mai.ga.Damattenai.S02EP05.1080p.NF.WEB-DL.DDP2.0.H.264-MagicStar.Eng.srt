1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,874
I'm late. I have to hurry.

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,585
Oh, no. My watch isn't working.

3
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,390
Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,792
Mai! You're late.

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,794
I couldn't decide what to wear.

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,295
How do I look?

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,131
You look great.

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,932
White looks pure and innocent.

9
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,369
It's rare to see you join a mixer party.

10
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,540
-Hey, Mai just broke up recently.
-Did you?

11
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:46,946
Forget that. I'm already 27.
I thought I should find someone soon.

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,014
You can count on me.

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,684
Today I invited mature men who are
thinking seriously about their future.

14
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,855
There's a doctor, lawyer, and a president.

15
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,657
That sounds perfect.

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,492
UNIVERSITY ALUMNI REUNION

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,228
How are you?

18
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,131
-Look at your forehead.
-I know.

19
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,933
Hey, Soma!

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,437
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

21
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,639
Aoi! How have you been?

22
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,208
When did we see each other last?

23
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,644
It's been ten years.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,045
That's a long time.

25
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,548
How is your work?

26
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,783
I'm sure you got promoted.

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,821
I became independent five years ago.

28
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,156
This is my job now.

29
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,462
Hey! You're the president
of an IT company?

30
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,965
You have an office
in that Osaki skyscraper?

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,133
That's great.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,968
It's still waiting to take off.

33
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,771
How about you?

34
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,306
Are you still a banker?

35
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,976
Yes. Here you go.

36
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,779
Headquarters.

37
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,249
That sounds great.
You must be right on track.

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:00,954
Well, not really.

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,359
Long time no see.
You haven't changed at all.

40
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,495
You came here?

41
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,097
DIRECTOR/MD-PHD, LAWYER

42
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,499
PRESIDENT

43
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,769
Hello.

44
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,373
-Hello.
-Hello.

45
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,409
They look very old.

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,546
But they have the right titles.

47
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,981
Yes.

48
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,184
I am Tanaka, 46 years old,
and I'm a divorcee.

49
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,288
My wife passed away two years ago.

50
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,526
I am looking for someone
who I can build a happy family with.

51
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:46,499
So this is what they mean by men who are
"mature and serious about marriage."

52
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,434
You look good.

53
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,637
Thank you.

54
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,307
What's wrong, Soma?

55
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,843
You look awkward. You know her well.

56
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,845
I know.

57
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,514
How long have you not seen each other for?

58
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,516
Five years?

59
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,951
Nearly six years.

60
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,555
I see. No wonder we became old.

61
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,323
We?

62
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,527
That rude attitude of yours
has not changed at all.

63
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,995
Ouch.

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm sorry.
My friend introduced them to me.

65
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,869
But I didn't do enough research.

66
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,040
This is all part of the experience.

67
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,009
-Don't worry. We can try again.
-Yes.

68
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,544
Sorry.

69
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,646
See you later.

70
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,381
-Bye.
-Bye.

71
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,116
-Later.
-Bye.

72
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,453
What time is it now?

73
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,760
Mr. Soma.

74
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,195
Hanasaki.

75
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,498
Wait…

76
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,967
Hanasaki, wait!

77
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,670
-Don't jump to conclusions.
-I didn't know you had a date. Congrats!

78
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,973
-That's not it.
-Don't be shy.

79
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,140
Hello.

80
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:05,712
Hello. I'm Hanasaki.
I am nothing but his colleague.

81
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,281
I am Yumi Ishihara. Nice to meet you.

82
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,482
I…

83
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,551
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

84
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,888
-It wasn't a date?
-I said not.

85
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,658
I am his ex-wife.

86
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,060
I see, his ex…

87
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,730
Ex-wife?

88
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,136
I see.

89
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,106
Nice to meet you. I am Mai Hanasaki.

90
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:36,943
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

91
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,825
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

92
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,865
Now Mr. Soma,

93
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,868
tell us how you felt seeing
your ex-wife at the reunion.

94
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,438
Don't make fun of me. Stop it already.

95
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:09,542
How can I not? It was a rare chance
to see the two of you together.

96
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,146
Soma liked Yumi since
we were university students.

97
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:17,150
But he proposed to her over ten years
after we had graduated.

98
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,251
I didn't know.

99
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,321
Mr. Soma, you're a very devoted person.

100
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,957
-Here.
-You're rather romantic, huh.

101
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,828
See? This is why I told you
not to say anything.

102
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,533
-Can I have one more?
-Yes.

103
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,870
The three of us used to go out
for drinks like this.

104
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,708
It sounds like the good old days.
Here you go.

105
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,742
Thanks.

106
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,084
Is that your wife? You have cute children.

107
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,354
She's three and he's two.
They're such rascals.

108
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,856
I'm sure your wife has her hands full.

109
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,661
Yes. So I try to go home early
to spend time with my family.

110
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,331
Prioritizing work is out of date now.

111
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,468
You have a great job and a great family.

112
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,270
-You've always been stable.
-Compared to you.

113
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,305
Shut up.

114
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,177
Why did you get divorced, Mr. Soma?

115
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,614
Do you think this is
the right moment to ask that?

116
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,451
Because I got transferred…

117
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,221
Oh, when the Section Chief
of the Finance Department

118
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,191
pushed his responsibility on you
and got you transferred, right?

119
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,326
Hey, Mai!

120
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,133
You really like to rub salt in the wound.

121
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,401
Sorry.

122
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,203
I didn't know that. You had a hard time.

123
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,373
So I fell off the corporate ladder
a while ago.

124
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,111
But what a shame to break up
with such a beautiful lady.

125
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,314
-You won't have a second chance.
-It's not for you to decide.

126
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,419
She's happily remarried, so it's all good.

127
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,889
Then you're the only one that's lonely.

128
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,956
Same as you.

129
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,525
I'm not the same.

130
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,561
-Let's drink tonight.
-Sure.

131
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,965
Mai, you said you ran into Mr. Soma,
but what were you doing there?

132
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,602
I had dinner with my girlfriends.

133
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,338
She went to a mixer party,
but she said it wasn't good.

134
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,874
A mixer party? You attend those things?

135
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,679
Well, it's not a mixer party but…

136
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,016
Of course I go to mixer parties. I'm 27.

137
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,985
You're right. Of course you would.

138
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,892
What a hassle.
You didn't have to tell him that.

139
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,828
I just copied you.

140
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:47,166
I don't want to talk about that
terrible mixer party.

141
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,876
It's all Mr. Soma's fault.

142
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,377
Did you drink too much?

143
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,180
Yes, I ended up drinking too much…

144
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,487
Executive Director Shindo.

145
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,388
Good morning.

146
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,861
I remember you were being interviewed
for the company newsletter the other day.

147
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,664
-Yes, but…
-This is the one.

148
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,170
Here.

149
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,809
THIS MONTH'S WOMAN OF TOKYO DAIICHI

150
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,713
It was much smaller than planned.

151
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,083
I see. Work hard.

152
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,051
Thank you very much.

153
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,291
This is only for Managers.

154
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,195
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,036
You are laughing too much.

156
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,539
Don't worry. It means…

157
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,875
you're being talked about.

158
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,710
He is right, Ms. Hanasaki.

159
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,680
Even if it's only a small article,
it's still a good memory.

160
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,349
Stop it, both of you.

161
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,318
I have a phone call. Be quiet.

162
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,689
Branch Inspection. Yes.

163
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,893
It was nice meeting you yesterday.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,595
Please wait one moment.

165
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,232
Mr. Soma, it's Mr. Aoi.

166
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,934
Aoi?

167
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,271
Soma? Sorry to call you during work.

168
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,975
I had a lot of fun yesterday.

169
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,145
Yeah. What's up?

170
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,048
What? Loan?

171
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,886
I was thinking about getting one recently.

172
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:51,190
If I'm going to get one,
I want to get it at your bank.

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,492
This is a good chance.

174
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,463
I see. Thanks.
It's great news for our company too.

175
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:02,101
If you get a loan contract,
you'll get to take credit for it, right?

176
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,004
You're a busybody as usual.

177
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,442
Your company is in Osaki, right?

178
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,410
It's in the Jounan area.

179
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,414
That's great. I want to introduce you to
someone in the Finance Department.

180
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,783
Sounds great.

181
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,354
-I'll be waiting for your call.
-Okay. Bye.

182
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,258
Are we going to finance Mr. Aoi's company?

183
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,128
Yes. I guess he was thinking
of applying for a loan.

184
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,430
That's great.

185
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,532
-He's the one that owns his company?
-Yes.

186
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,868
Who are you going to introduce him to?

187
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:41,907
Remember that uncommonly
passionate man in the Finance Department?

188
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,745
He taught me all about loans.

189
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,414
-Mr. Matsuki?
-Correct.

190
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,450
This is working out so well.

191
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,518
Yes.

192
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,562
DIGITAL BLUE COMPANY

193
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,807
CREDIT FOR INCOME TAX

194
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,027
RESTAURANT HANASAKI
ONE WEEK LATER

195
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,262
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

196
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,965
Thanks to you, I'm about to get
a new loan contract.

197
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,567
Good for you.

198
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,936
-Yes.
-Enough with the greetings. Sit down.

199
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,237
Sit here.

200
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,106
Thanks.

201
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,575
I can sit next to Ms. Hanasaki?

202
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,876
Sure. Please.

203
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,646
Thank you.

204
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,452
-Let's have a toast.
-Sure.

205
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,021
Cheers!

206
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,889
Congratulations.

207
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,532
I've been having a hard time
meeting my sales target these days.

208
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,503
So thank you very much
for giving me a chance.

209
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,473
No, all I did was introduce him
to your manager.

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,244
You were recommending Mr. Matsuki
to the Gotanda Branch Manager.

211
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,314
Good for you, Mr. Matsuki.
This is from me.

212
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,016
You like Japanese-style omelet, right?

213
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,251
Thank you.

214
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,626
-This is delicious.
-I can tell you love it.

215
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,630
It was a great office.

216
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,033
It's only five years ago that
he launched his

217
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,271
company, Digital Blue, after leaving
a major IT communications company.

218
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,609
It was not long before he made
a five-billion-yen profit. He's amazing.

219
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,079
There's a high chance
the loan will get approved, right?

220
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,716
Yes. All I have to do is
send the proposal document.

221
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,452
The loan is this much.

222
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,022
Fifty million yen? That's reasonable.

223
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,125
No! It's 500 million yen.

224
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,627
Five hundred million yen?

225
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,462
That's quite a lot.

226
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,599
-Matsuki, work hard.
-Yes.

227
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,736
I want to ask you a favor.

228
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,572
Will you check the proposal document
for me tomorrow?

229
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,140
-Proposal document?
-Yes.

230
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,277
I would like you to check it
before I send it to the Manager.

231
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,346
I see. You're having a hard time with it,
aren't you?

232
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,749
Can you tell?

233
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,852
Okay. I will check it if you want.

234
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,954
Thank you.

235
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,825
Mr. Soma is respected more than I thought.

236
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,528
You just have no respect for your boss.

237
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,533
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

238
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,534
DIGITAL BLUE INC.

239
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,038
How does he plan to use
the 500 million yen?

240
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,806
Research and development.

241
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,342
He'll use that for a cloud-based

242
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,846
customer information database
and application development.

243
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,916
It's hard to understand.

244
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,854
I know. IT related work is very difficult.

245
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,658
We have no benchmark for novelty,
originality and product value.

246
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,862
-It's the bank's weak spot.
-Yes.

247
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,866
We have more experience
in evaluating existing industries

248
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,401
such as manufacturing or service.

249
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:33,706
The point is how to evaluate
the technology of Aoi's company.

250
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,841
What's the sharing rate with other banks?

251
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,142
We won't be sharing it.

252
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,380
Are we going to finance
the development cost by ourselves?

253
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,514
Yes.

254
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,751
Until now, their main bank
was Hakusui Bank.

255
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,821
But he wants to take this chance
and move to our bank.

256
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,524
He has high expectations of us.

257
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,265
-This is a good document.
-Really?

258
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:04,069
Just give a concrete explanation
about their future business plans

259
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,372
and it will be more convincing.

260
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,173
Okay.

261
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,610
Thank you very much.

262
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,180
Ms. Hanasaki, I will come again.

263
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,883
Good luck.

264
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,258
I'm glad to see that things are going well
for Mr. Matsuki.

265
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,229
What's wrong?

266
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,898
Something bothers me.

267
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,870
The loan from Hakusui Bank
wasn't reduced at all.

268
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:43,075
Isn't that because they are
expanding their business?

269
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,378
Development companies
usually reduce their loans

270
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,781
as their business performance gets better.

271
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,151
I see. That's how it goes.

272
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,755
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

273
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,393
Mr. Soma?

274
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,931
I'm going to step out.

275
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,168
Finish the report for Mukoujima Branch.

276
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,104
Where are you going, Mr. Soma?

277
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,548
28F DIGITAL BLUE INC.

278
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,718
PRESIDENT SHOUICHI AOI

279
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,455
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

280
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,559
Do you know when the floors
below Digital Blue became vacant?

281
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,794
About two months ago.

282
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,665
Originally,
this company used three floors.

283
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,267
I see. Thank you.

284
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,520
I wonder where Mr. Soma went.

285
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,561
Excuse me.

286
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,737
Bankrupt?

287
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,838
THE COMPANY IS DOWNSIZING. I WAS LAID OFF…

288
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,006
I HAVE TO LOOK FOR A JOB NOW

289
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,676
What is this?

290
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,284
Hello.

291
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,925
Sorry to call you out so suddenly.

292
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,798
Knowing you, there must be
an important reason why you called me.

293
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,536
It is about Aoi.

294
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,373
His wife is your junior, right?

295
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,410
Yes. I introduced Saori to him.

296
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,081
Have you seen her recently?
Do you know anything about Aoi?

297
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,150
Why do you want to know all of a sudden?

298
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,957
His company is applying for a loan
from our bank right now.

299
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,559
So I wanted to know.

300
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,095
I see.

301
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,066
I go out for lunch with Saori
once in a while.

302
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,070
But I haven't seen her lately.

303
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,906
I see.

304
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,080
You keep worrying about other people,

305
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,582
but are you all right?

306
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,652
Do you have any plans to remarry?

307
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,427
I was told that I won't have
a second chance since I lost you.

308
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,395
Says who?

309
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,298
How about you?

310
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,667
Are you happy?

311
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,472
Yes. Since I don't have a child,
I sometimes get envious of Saori

312
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,009
when I hear her talk about her children.

313
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:08,080
But I'm happy as long as my husband
and I can stay happy and healthy.

314
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,849
That's more than enough.

315
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,752
Oh, I remember…

316
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,723
She said that Aoi comes home
late every day.

317
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,959
He rarely eats dinner with his children.

318
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,263
She was saying that things
didn't used to be like that.

319
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,803
I try to go home early
and spend time with my family.

320
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,775
She says Aoi doesn't talk about
his business at home.

321
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,511
But being busy must be a good sign.

322
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,151
Thanks.

323
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,588
-I'll call you again.
-Hey.

324
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,234
Matsuki, are you at the branch right now?

325
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,211
Hanasaki, why are you here?

326
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,748
You have doubts about
Mr. Aoi's company, don't you?

327
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,986
I researched it too.

328
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,488
…IN TROUBLE… GOES BANKRUPT

329
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,392
Digital Blue downsized their company
two months ago.

330
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,663
That itself might not be so uncommon,

331
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,468
but the problem is that Mr. Aoi
is hiding that fact. Right?

332
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,106
This is their financial statement.

333
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:43,742
What's wrong?

334
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,379
Why did you want to see this document
in secret?

335
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,283
Just to double check. Right, Mr. Soma?

336
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:57,923
Matsuki.

337
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,794
-Did you make a copy of this by yourself?
-No.

338
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,529
Then who?

339
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,033
I called him to ask for
the financial statements.

340
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,637
The copy was already made
when I visited his company,

341
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,339
and President Aoi gave it to me directly.

342
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,942
Then you didn't check the original?

343
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,845
No.

344
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,448
That's not good.

345
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,051
Is there a problem?

346
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:30,255
As a general rule, we have to borrow
the tax documents once,

347
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,624
and make a copy of them at the bank.

348
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,862
Is that to prevent fabrication?

349
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,364
Right.

350
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,734
Fabrication? Wait a minute, Mr. Soma.

351
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,437
What are you suspicious of?

352
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,906
He is your friend from university,
isn't he?

353
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,709
I am not sure yet.

354
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:56,415
But Aoi is hiding something from us.

355
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,422
Matsuki. Please wait before submitting
the proposal document to the Manager.

356
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,024
The Branch Manager will get mad.

357
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,260
He told me to submit it
as soon as possible.

358
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
Please.

359
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,132
What are you going to do, Mr. Soma?

360
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:19,137
I will ask the companies listed here about
their transactions with Digital Blue.

361
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,573
They won't tell you.

362
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,775
If it's companies that our bank
deals with,

363
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,945
I might get some information
through the Finance Department.

364
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,683
Either way, I will do what I can.

365
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,123
President. How about the payment
to the data center?

366
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,192
Don't worry.

367
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,994
I will get funding before the due date.

368
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,230
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

369
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:02,013
According to the documents, your company
paid 30 million yen to Digital Blue.

370
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,348
Thirty million yen?

371
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,418
That must be some mistake.

372
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,953
A mistake?

373
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,589
What do you mean?

374
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,759
We only paid five million yen.

375
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,564
Then what about
the payment of 15 million yen?

376
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:25,537
We paid three million yen at most.
Look here.

377
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,508
DIGITAL BLUE INC
ANNUAL PAYMENT 2,916,000 YEN

378
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,716
We stopped using that company last year.

379
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,384
Stopped?

380
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,420
May I ask you why?

381
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,822
I hear their business is in dire straits.

382
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:54,766
Now it's clear that Digital Blue's
business is deteriorating,

383
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,335
so we will not be able to finance them.

384
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,840
That financial statement was
fabricated too, right?

385
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,842
This is terrible.

386
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,244
Isn't this fraud?

387
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,714
Why did Aoi do this?

388
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,752
-Money.
-What?

389
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,356
He tried to pull money
from Tokyo Daiichi Bank

390
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,392
using manipulated documents.

391
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,462
For 500 million yen.

392
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,499
That's unforgivable.

393
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,702
He used his friend too.

394
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,512
Matsuki.

395
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,181
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,152
Mr. Soma.

397
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,323
I should have researched it,
before introducing him.

398
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,625
It's all my fault.

399
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:59,097
I caused huge trouble for you
and the Gotanda Branch.

400
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,099
Please don't say that.

401
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,804
You're not the one to blame, Mr. Soma.
It's Mr. Aoi.

402
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,941
I will go see Mr. Aoi.

403
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,243
Please wait, Matsuki.

404
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,015
Let me go.

405
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,117
What?

406
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,020
I think…

407
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,091
he had reasons for doing this.

408
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,163
I'm sure he's dealing with
a serious problem.

409
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,232
Why are you covering for him?

410
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,335
Mr. Aoi deceived you to get money.

411
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,571
He is not your friend.

412
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,240
He is my friend.

413
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,853
Even if he betrayed me,

414
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,124
he is still my friend.

415
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,229
Please.

416
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,610
Mr. Matsuki!

417
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,846
The proposal document.

418
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,617
Um…

419
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,590
I'm sorry about the new loan contract.

420
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,094
No. I will get another one by myself.

421
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm more worried about Mr. Soma.

422
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:43,969
Yes.

423
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:45,971
See you.

424
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,800
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

425
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,540
Hello, Ms. Hanasaki.

426
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,675
Yes.

427
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,681
He forgot this when I met him today.

428
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,984
I called him many times,
but he won't answer.

429
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,554
Will you return this to Soma for me?

430
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,758
Yes. Thank you.

431
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,763
I guess there is something going on
with Aoi?

432
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,437
He's usually very calm,
but he is having a hard time right now.

433
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,172
I see.

434
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,709
-May I ask you something?
-Yes?

435
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,247
What kind of friendship did Mr. Aoi
and Mr. Soma have?

436
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,318
They were really good friends.

437
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,821
They have different personalities,

438
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,957
but they got along well
and motivated each other.

439
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,193
I see.

440
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,263
When we decided to get married,

441
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,932
Aoi was happier than anyone else.

442
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,472
But we all got busy
and didn't see each other for a while.

443
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,508
And then we ended up divorcing.

444
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,914
They hadn't seen each other
for about ten years.

445
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,784
But I'm sure they always
thought of each other.

446
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:46,624
I guess Mr. Aoi is a special friend
to Mr. Soma.

447
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,264
I've never seen Mr. Soma look so down.

448
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:07,245
But I can't be of any help to him.

449
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,318
He can be sensitive,
despite how he comes across.

450
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,557
I couldn't do anything for him either.

451
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,428
During his most difficult time…

452
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,733
TRANSFER NOTICE

453
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:44,082
All he needed me to do was to support him
by staying close to him.

454
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,486
It was a long time ago.

455
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,991
It was nice talking to you.

456
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,559
Me too.

457
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,493
Why did you come?
I told you that this is my business.

458
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,934
I will not disturb you.

459
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,339
Don't say unnecessary things.

460
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,274
Stay silent the whole time.

461
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,742
Yes, sir.

462
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,835
<i>Tokyo Daiichi Bank here to see you.</i>

463
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,074
-Let them in right away.
<i>-Okay.</i>

464
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,520
Soma.

465
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,725
I thought Mr. Matsuki had come.

466
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,226
Why?

467
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:42,133
Tokyo Daiichi Bank
can't finance Digital Blue.

468
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,804
What are you talking about?

469
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,575
Mr. Matsuki told me

470
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,544
that the loan screening was moving along.

471
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,414
What's wrong, Soma?

472
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,522
Aoi…

473
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,295
if you were worrying about something,
would you tell me?

474
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,166
What are you talking about?

475
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,435
I am not worrying about anything.

476
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,373
I will listen to your problems
if your company is in trouble.

477
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,111
It's the bank's job to offer advice
at a time like this.

478
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,782
I know that you are a competent banker.

479
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,251
But we don't need your help.

480
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,387
We have no problem.
Everything is going pretty well.

481
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,791
Then why?

482
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,163
Why did you manipulate
the financial statement?

483
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,402
What did you say?

484
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,608
Aoi.

485
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:04,215
I can imagine that it is lonely
being a business manager.

486
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:11,356
I'm sure it's hard to find someone
you can openly talk to.

487
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,827
But…

488
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,665
I'm your friend, right?

489
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,402
Whatever problem you have,

490
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,508
please tell me the truth.

491
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,459
I see.

492
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,665
You knew everything, huh?

493
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,837
Soma.

494
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,144
I'm sorry.

495
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:13,551
As you know, I was trying
to deceive you for money.

496
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,988
I've done something I shouldn't have.

497
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,557
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,731
But…

499
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:33,237
I really need money for the company.

500
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,308
Can't you turn a blind eye,
for old times' sake?

501
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,712
You're the only one I can ask for help.

502
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,116
If not 500 million, how about 100 million?

503
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,185
No, even 50 million.

504
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:52,990
-Stop it, Aoi.
-Soma, I promise that I will return it.

505
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,859
Soma…

506
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,664
Please… I beg you…

507
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,284
That's enough.

508
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,257
Don't you understand
that Mr. Soma is suffering?

509
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,925
What do you know?

510
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,828
Soma and I are old friends.

511
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,297
With all due respect…

512
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,803
if you are his old friend,
why can't you understand his feelings?

513
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,074
Mr. Soma is suffering
because you are his friend.

514
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,075
Hanasaki, shut up.

515
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,143
No, I won't!

516
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,614
Mr. Aoi.

517
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:55,586
Mr. Soma is trying to
take responsibility for everything.

518
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,860
He is a victim of fraud,

519
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,429
but he is trying so hard

520
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:10,334
to prevent you from being charged
with a criminal offense.

521
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,272
I am very sorry.

522
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,173
Headquarters…

523
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,241
I will take all responsibility.

524
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,743
…And the Gotanda Branch…

525
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,810
I'm sorry.

526
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,547
…He went to those places to apologize.

527
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,849
He did so because

528
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,654
you are his precious friend.

529
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,558
Because you are his friend
that he trusted.

530
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:39,397
It's wrong for you to deceive
and use Mr. Soma

531
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,900
in order to get money out of him.

532
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,703
It's wrong!

533
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,242
Was your friendship

534
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,313
with Mr. Soma nothing more than this?

535
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,950
Hanasaki, that's enough.

536
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,890
Sorry.

537
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,332
Soma…

538
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,702
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,441
I'm sorry.

540
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,084
-Mr. Soma!
-Mr. Matsuki.

541
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,421
I got something.

542
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:42,893
Mr. Aoi is borrowing money
from several financial institutions.

543
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,197
One of them is troubling.

544
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,735
-Is that…
-Yes. Loan sharks.

545
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,478
What happened, Aoi?

546
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:12,690
Business started going down
about two years ago.

547
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,128
I couldn't get a loan extension
from the bank.

548
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,131
I was left with no choice.

549
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:29,640
That's when a person I knew introduced me
to a company that lends money,

550
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,409
and I jumped at it.

551
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:33,978
But…

552
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,179
Here it is, Mr. Aoi.

553
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,248
…I found out later…

554
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,716
Please confirm.

555
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,318
…That the company was…

556
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,353
Loan sharks?

557
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,063
At first, I was planning to
repay them right away.

558
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:57,001
But I got deeper and deeper in debt.

559
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:05,509
And my wife is the joint guarantor.

560
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,086
They said that if I can't repay,

561
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:19,090
my family will not be safe.

562
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:25,563
That's when I saw you at the reunion.

563
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:31,635
I had no time to be attending a party,

564
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,740
but I was able to turn back time
for a while.

565
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,309
It was fun.

566
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,116
But after that…

567
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,752
Tokyo Daiichi Bank, huh?

568
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,623
Mr. Aoi, you have a good friend.

569
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,129
Let's borrow money from him
since he is your old classmate.

570
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,565
No. I can't cause him any trouble.

571
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:05,035
Don't you understand your situation?

572
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,308
Deceive him
and get 500 million yen from him.

573
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,311
Do you understand?

574
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,618
So you followed his order.

575
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:30,060
I planned to repay all the money
I borrowed from Tokyo Daiichi Bank,

576
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,300
and make my company go bankrupt
with a debt of 500 million yen.

577
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,171
That was the scenario.

578
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,241
I…

579
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,914
I really wanted to protect
my family, no matter what.

580
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,785
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,926
I'm sorry.

582
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,569
I'm over.

583
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,941
I'm over.

584
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,785
You are not over yet.

585
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,473
SHIROYAMA FINANCE

586
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,981
Who are you?

587
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,619
I am Soma from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

588
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,655
What does a bank want from us?

589
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:09,760
I came here as an agent
for Aoi of Digital Blue.

590
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,134
Tokyo Daiichi Bank examined

591
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:22,039
the loan application of
500 million yen for Digital Blue

592
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,075
and decided to turn it down.

593
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,080
That has nothing to do with us.

594
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,650
It sure does.

595
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,589
This is a very important document.

596
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,898
Shouichi Aoi,
the President of Digital Blue

597
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,100
filed for voluntary bankruptcy.

598
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,136
What?

599
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,273
COMMENCEMENT OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS

600
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,845
From now on, please refrain from
contacting him and his family.

601
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,015
What are you talking about?

602
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,617
One more thing.

603
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:12,756
Precisely speaking,
what you did was blackmail and fraud.

604
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:20,230
We will also take legal action,
depending on your future actions.

605
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,365
Please be aware.

606
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,880
I hope Mr. Soma is okay.

607
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,583
He's back.

608
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,053
-Mr. Soma!
-Mr. Soma!

609
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,290
Are you okay?

610
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,461
That was so scary.

611
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,696
They pulled no punches.

612
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,933
It's because you went all by yourself.

613
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,167
She is right.

614
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,638
If I had known, I should have asked you
to go in place of me.

615
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:06,110
-What do you mean? Not Mr. Matsuki?
-What? No way.

616
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,378
Hey!

617
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,812
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

618
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,915
I wonder how Mr. Aoi is doing.

619
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:17,054
He said he would start all over
and work hard.

620
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,223
I see.

621
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,295
He has a family, so he has to
protect them no matter what.

622
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,032
Although that doesn't justify everything.

623
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,803
Yes. Women become strong
when they have something to protect,

624
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:38,008
as opposed to men, who become weak
when they have something to protect.

625
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:45,816
He was building not only his career,
but also a happy family.

626
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,253
I couldn't do any of them.

627
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,858
So I wanted to prevent
his family from breaking apart.

628
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,096
It's nice to have that kind of friendship.

629
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,267
There will come a day when
you can laugh about this over some drinks.

630
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,435
I hope so.

631
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,007
By the way, she was really sweet.

632
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,108
I mean Yumi.

633
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,779
What are you bringing her up
all of a sudden?

634
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,582
It's too bad she got remarried.

635
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:22,252
I don't feel bad about that at all.

636
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,292
-Do you still love her?
-Don't be stupid.

637
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,664
-It may be Yumi.
-No way.

638
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,169
How come she's so sharp sometimes?

639
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,074
Mai. I have a watermelon. Help me cut it.

640
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,109
Okay.

641
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,747
Hello, what's up?

642
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:54,151
I heard about Aoi from Saori.

643
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,786
<i>It must have been tough.</i>

644
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,724
Apparently, Aoi is consolidating
his company's debts

645
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,993
while going around places to apologize.

646
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,495
I see.

647
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,865
He still has lots of things to do.

648
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,833
<i>Aoi should be fine.</i>

649
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,337
He established his company from scratch.

650
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,507
He can do anything now.

651
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,645
Saori says she will support him
with the children.

652
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,082
That's good for him.

653
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:31,155
I'm sorry that I couldn't support you.

654
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,259
<i>When you had a really hard time.</i>

655
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:39,763
When you were depressed saying that
your life as a banker had ended.

656
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,301
I stepped away from you.

657
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,306
It was my bad.

658
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,579
But you got over it. You have changed.

659
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,348
Changed? Have I?

660
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,820
It's either your current job
suits you very well,

661
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:08,225
or is it because of Ms. Hanasaki?

662
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,296
What are you talking about?

663
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,800
She is always causing me trouble.

664
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,137
Take care of yourself.

665
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,277
You too. Take care.

666
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,755
Here it comes. It's ready.

667
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,425
-Let's eat.
-It looks delicious.

668
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,027
-We need salt.
-Thank you.

669
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:47,965
What's wrong?

670
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,670
My grandma told me to face east
and laugh before eating the first fruit

671
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:54,938
of the season.

672
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,140
-What?
-Didn't you know that?

673
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,475
Let's do it together.

674
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,412
Let's eat it.

675
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,119
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

676
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,089
There was trouble in the Gotanda Branch.

677
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,894
The news reached you too,
Executive Director Shindo?

678
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,530
I heard that Branch Inspection
was involved again.

679
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,698
Yes.

680
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,371
They probably wanted to create results
by making a big loan contract,

681
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:31,041
but they ended up causing
lots of trouble for everyone.

682
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,844
They really don't know their place.

683
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,781
If I remember correctly,
you and Soma are colleagues, right?

684
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,216
Yes.

685
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,520
I will make sure to tell him

686
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,723
not to exceed the responsibilities
of a Branch Inspector.

687
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,862
It seems like he's a man with a backbone.

688
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,864
-What?
-Huh?

689
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,933
Nothing.

690
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:06,443
I am very sorry for causing you trouble,
Mr. Shibasaki.

691
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,247
Not at all.

692
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,650
In the end, our bank didn't
have to suffer any loss.

693
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,752
I'm glad.

694
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,457
I'd understand it if it was Ms. Hanasaki,

695
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,527
but I didn't expect Mr. Soma
to cause a problem.

696
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,663
I'd understand if it was Ms. Hanasaki.

697
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:32,235
Old men are so disorganized.

698
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,404
Good morning.

699
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,574
Mr. Matsuki, good morning.

700
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,343
Mr. Soma hasn't come in yet.

701
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,878
-Ms. Hanasaki. I did it.
-Yes.

702
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,549
-You did what?
-A new loan contract.

703
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,918
Oh, really?

704
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,488
It's a vegetable store
in the shopping district.

705
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,857
It is not as big as Digital Blue,

706
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:57,194
but I realized that I prefer
supporting smaller businesses

707
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,896
even if that means
dealing with less money.

708
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,867
That's great. Congratulations.

709
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,369
Thank you very much.

710
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,940
Ms. Hanasaki.

711
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,174
Yes?

712
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,176
To celebrate the new loan,

713
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,181
would you like to join me?

714
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,220
GRILLED MEAT

715
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,924
I wanted to go to this restaurant.

716
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,826
How did you get this?

717
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,463
Oh, I just happened to get it
from someone.

718
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,401
I was hoping we could go out
with just the two of us…

719
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,936
Good morning, Mr. Soma. Look at this.

720
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,373
Mr. Matsuki wants the three of us
to celebrate his new contract.

721
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,709
Not three, two.

722
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,277
Great job, Matsuki.

723
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,079
-Thank you.
-Look.

724
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,317
I wanted to go to this restaurant.

725
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,853
-It's three of us again.
-I'm so excited.

726
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,856
When will we go? How about tonight?

727
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,191
I am free, of course.

728
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,526
And you, Mr. Matsuki?

729
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,862
-Yes.
-That's cool.

730
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,764
I'm from the Inspection Unit.

731
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,000
I won't lose.

732
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,701
Illegal credit inspection?

733
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,471
This is the bottom of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

734
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,174
We have to let them go scot-free?

735
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,944
People like you
prevent this bank from improving.
