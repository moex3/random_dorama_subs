1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,537
One, two, three, four.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,549
Good morning.

3
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,918
What are you doing?

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,922
I came to the office early
so I was exercising to prepare for work.

5
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,791
You're always full of energy.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,861
This is not a gym.

7
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,197
My body is out of shape
because we haven't had any inspections.

8
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,233
I have good news, Ms. Hanasaki.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,801
Inspection?

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,970
It's not an inspection, but…

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,106
We're going to be helping
the Inspection Unit for two days.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,908
Help the Inspection Unit?

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,711
They are short-handed
for credit examinations.

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,348
What is a credit examination?

15
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,085
It's to check whether the loans
are processed correctly at the branches.

16
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,390
Mr. Soma was in the Finance Department
so he will be a big help.

17
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,193
I don't know much about loans.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,130
You'll just be tagging along,
like an extra.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,965
An extra?

20
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,600
It's the Fukagawa Branch.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,136
I'm lucky. It's close to my house.

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,841
I wouldn't say that you're lucky.

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,742
Why?

24
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,813
Fukagawa's Branch Manager is in the…

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,049
Shindo faction.

26
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,984
Exactly.

27
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,152
I feel sick.

28
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,421
That's not all, either.

29
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,689
What else is there?

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,126
It's Chief Himuro, the leader
of the credit examination.

31
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,427
Who is he?

32
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,696
People call him the Branch Crusher.

33
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,832
Branch Crusher?

34
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:43,036
If he finds even a single error
he will attack you mercilessly,

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,272
damaging your body and soul.

36
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,274
That's what I heard.

37
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:54,581
Not a single weed will be able grow on
the path that Chief Himuro passes through.

38
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,818
You two are being overly dramatic.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:04,858
I'm sure people are
just exaggerating these rumors.

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,394
You're from Branch Inspection?

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,230
Yes. I am Soma.

42
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,565
-I am Hanasaki--
-Last name only.

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,801
Sorr--

44
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,471
I'm Himuro, from the Inspection Unit.

45
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,440
I will head the credit examination.

46
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,944
Please follow my instructions. Understand?

47
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,279
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,616
-Work hard.
-Yes.

49
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,187
-I heard that you were a teller.
-Yes.

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,328
What is HR thinking? They don't understand
what credit examination does at all.

51
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,796
Why call a former teller?

52
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,700
She'll only slow us down.

53
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,005
Listen.

54
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,808
Credit examination is to find
and correct unforgivable errors

55
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,911
in a bank where trust is a priority.

56
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,712
Yes.

57
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:04,350
We have to right the wrongs
and protect the justice of the bank.

58
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,087
In other words, it's a job to improve
Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

59
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,689
Yes.

60
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,959
I doubt an amateur will be of help,

61
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,662
but I will have to follow HR's decision.

62
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,199
I want to ask you for one thing.

63
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,568
Don't slow us down.

64
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,540
Yes, sir.

65
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:39,419
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK FUKAGAWA BRANCH

66
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,228
Hanasaki. Let me repeat this just in case.

67
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,764
Don't ever say anything unnecessary
to Chief Himuro.

68
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,099
Yes.

69
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,500
What's with that face?

70
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,737
I'm not quite sure if I can do that.

71
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,839
Come on.

72
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,842
Bear with it for just two days.

73
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,744
Let's go.

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,716
Thank you for your time.

75
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,518
I am Branch Manager Tayama.

76
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,021
I'm Kitamura of the Finance Department.

77
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,425
This is the list of companies
that are subject to inspection.

78
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,894
Please bring the credit files.

79
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,529
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,566
If we find any loans in question,

81
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,903
we will conduct strict training on it
during a review meeting at 4 p.m.

82
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,205
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,975
-One more thing.
-Yes?

84
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,711
I am a little hot.

85
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,314
Can you change the AC setting?

86
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,449
I will check it right away.

87
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,419
Anything else?

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,168
Nothing in particular.

89
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,137
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,377
Just as I heard, Mr. Himuro seems
to be a very difficult person.

91
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,380
Yes. We have to be prepared.

92
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,515
Yes.

93
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,089
-Ms. Hanasaki.
-Yes.

94
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,124
Go help the Finance Department.

95
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,459
Yes.

96
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,528
Collect files, make copies, make tea,

97
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,163
and do all miscellaneous tasks.

98
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,231
Yes.

99
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,467
That's all you can do anyway.

100
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,552
Smile.

101
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,624
I won't get beaten down!

102
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,762
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

103
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,276
Tomeoka Logistics.

104
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,078
Okuzawa Corporation.

105
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,813
Sugikawa Construction.

106
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,715
Narikura Construction…

107
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,952
-Excuse me.
-Oogoshi Estate.

108
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,255
Mr. Kitamura. I came to help.

109
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,157
You are…

110
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,159
I am Hanasaki.

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,128
I'm here to help out today.

112
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,429
Hanasaki?

113
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,366
-Etou?
-Hi. Long time no see. How are you?

114
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,236
Do you know each other?

115
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,037
Yes, we were colleagues.

116
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,406
I see.

117
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,576
You work at headquarters?
You're climbing up the ladder.

118
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,714
Not at all. I'm only being used for
miscellaneous tasks.

119
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,848
How about you, Etou?

120
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,817
Since when are you in Finance?

121
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,087
Since two years ago.
My wish finally came true.

122
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,990
I see. You are working hard.

123
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,258
You too.

124
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,561
There are so many documents.

125
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,265
There are more. They will check
about 100 companies a day.

126
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,167
That many?

127
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,649
Excuse me.

128
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,394
Check thoroughly and look for

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,596
anything that is questionable or unclear.

130
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,497
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,634
The companies in question will be
brought up at the review meeting,

132
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,336
and I will investigate it.

133
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,138
I understand.

134
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,776
Keep in mind that this is a task
to improve the bank.

135
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,677
Yes, sir.

136
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,245
Listen.

137
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,280
Don't cut corners.

138
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,882
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,892
-Foul play with credit examination?
-Yes.

140
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,695
We received an anonymous tip.

141
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,899
It says that Mr. Himuro threatens
Branch Managers and Chiefs of Finance

142
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,502
whenever he goes in for inspection.

143
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,670
By threatening, you mean…

144
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:29,542
He finds faults with the branches
and blackmails them to extort money.

145
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,244
Extortion…

146
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,716
We found out that although Mr. Himuro is
notorious for his severe inspections,

147
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,785
his evaluation has been varied
the last two to three years.

148
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,857
The results of the credit examination
influences personnel evaluations.

149
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,260
So it might be possible.

150
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,630
So you'd like us to investigate this
a little further?

151
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,000
It's like an undercover investigation.

152
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,835
I understand.

153
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,139
Please make sure Mr. Himuro
doesn't find out.

154
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:05,177
Then it's better not to tell Hanasaki.

155
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:09,415
I agree. She's too transparent.

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,417
Yes.

157
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,489
Mr. Soma. What's wrong?

158
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,291
Nothing.

159
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,826
-Ms. Hanasaki.
-Yes.

160
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,596
-Make ten copies.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,966
And get coffee for everyone.

162
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,101
Yes, sir.

163
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,571
-Ms. Hanasaki.
-Yes?

164
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,373
-No sugar for me.
-Yes.

165
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,483
Congratulations on the merger
and acquisition in New York.

166
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,422
I just happened to be lucky this time.
It's no big deal.

167
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,690
That was not just luck.

168
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:55,161
Everyone says the next President
will be you, Mr. Doujima.

169
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,965
That's just because I became
the Senior Executive Director.

170
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,168
No. I'm sure Executive Director Shindo
is feeling impatient.

171
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,243
Hello, Executive Director Shindo.

172
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,782
How are you,
Senior Executive Director Doujima?

173
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,795
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S ROOM

174
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:34,567
Those are just rumors people are
saying to please them.

175
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,235
-Mr. Kodama.
-Yes.

176
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,644
One small scratch can become lethal.

177
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:49,315
-We must be even more cautious.
-Yes.

178
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:54,820
You never know what will happen
until we see the results.

179
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,891
That goes for both them and us.

180
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,293
You're right.

181
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,207
Hello, Branch Manager Tayama?

182
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,743
It's been a while, Mr. Kodama.

183
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,881
I believe the Fukagawa Branch
is now under credit examination.

184
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:22,948
Yes.

185
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,084
The review meeting will start soon.

186
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,419
<i>Let me ask, just in case.</i>

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,056
You don't have any problems
with the loans, do you?

188
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,024
Of course not.

189
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,961
<i>I heard that Chief Himuro</i>
<i>of the Inspection Unit is very tough.</i>

190
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,496
<i>Please be careful.</i>

191
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,665
Yes.

192
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:45,971
Even a small scratch by his subordinates

193
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,409
can affect the next presidential race
for Executive Director Shindo.

194
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,945
Please bear that in mind.

195
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,314
I understand.

196
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,618
Please be careful.

197
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,762
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK FUKAGAWA BRANCH

198
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,699
CREDIT EXAMINATION REVIEW MEETING DAY ONE

199
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,167
What is going on here?

200
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,504
26 out of 94 companies

201
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,640
we've examined today
are reported to have some issues.

202
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,843
That's almost a third!

203
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,912
The Fukagawa Branch is slacking off.

204
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,047
I am sorry.

205
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,052
The Finance Department
is the backbone of the branch.

206
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,653
Look how bad it is.

207
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,090
This reveals the level of this branch.

208
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,392
We have to review many companies.

209
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,497
First company is Fukagawa Print.

210
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,266
-Who is in charge?
-I am.

211
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,467
The Section Chief?

212
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,971
Yes. Their performance was down
so I took that on myself.

213
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,006
What kind of company is this?

214
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,276
It's a mid-sized printing company and--

215
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,713
Do you think that I can't read
the credit files?

216
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,081
No…

217
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,117
I am asking you for information
that is not written here.

218
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,619
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,622
Their performance is down
the last six months.

220
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,358
It might go bankrupt anytime.

221
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,062
But they received funding
of 30 million yen last month

222
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,632
and used it to pay their customers.

223
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,933
How did they get it?

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,268
Is it from other banks?

225
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,371
I don't know exactly.

226
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,472
What?

227
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,042
They seem to have borrowed it
from somewhere.

228
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,878
"Seem" to? What is that?

229
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,317
You are in charge of Fukagawa Print.

230
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,318
Yes.

231
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,022
How come you don't know
the source of the 30 million yen?

232
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,424
I am sorry.

233
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,197
How are you the Section Chief of Finance?

234
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,967
Isn't he being too mean?

235
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,203
Hey! No talking.

236
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,771
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,476
The level of this branch is really low.

238
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,347
I don't think you're training them well,
Branch Manager Tayama.

239
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,682
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,687
Next!

241
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,165
Checking the main figures,
is not enough for cases like these.

242
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,703
Thoroughly check
all the additional statements.

244
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,540
To whom and how much are they selling?
Who are they paying?

245
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,076
Important information is hidden there.

246
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,144
Yes.

247
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,348
How long have you been working in Finance?

248
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,883
Two years.

249
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,618
That's why.

250
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,521
You're a rookie, so you're spoiled.

251
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,724
I'm not…

252
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,493
If you can't discern these things
at a glance,

253
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,162
you're not suited for Finance.

254
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,136
In fact, you're disqualified as a banker.

255
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,040
-I'm sorry.
-Next!

256
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,409
Who is in charge of Machiyama?

257
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,443
I am.

258
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,981
They've been in the red
for three consecutive terms.

259
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,251
But got an additional 20 million yen
in June.

260
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,819
Why is that?

261
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,159
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

262
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,965
The loans at this branch
are of the lowest level.

263
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,403
This is the bottom of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

264
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:45,577
That's caused by your low sense
of awareness as bankers.

265
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,181
With all due… Ouch!

266
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,751
What is it?

267
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,887
No…

268
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,088
Nothing.

269
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,858
That's all for today.

270
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,301
Branch Manager Tayama, I'm warning you.

271
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,971
At this rate,

272
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,375
I may have to question
your qualifications as a Branch Manager.

273
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,461
What is wrong with that damn chief!

274
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,565
Hanasaki, you are too loud
and you have a bad mouth.

275
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,768
He is right. There are other customers.

276
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,037
-Here you go.
-Sorry.

277
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,739
Hey.

278
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,842
But he just wanted to pick on them.

279
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,078
He kept on endlessly nitpicking
tiny errors.

280
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,880
There's someone like that?

281
00:16:54,947 --> 00:17:00,285
Yes. He's so arrogant and condescending
just because no one can talk back to him.

282
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,821
-He's abusing his power and position?
-Yes.

283
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,591
He releases his stress like that?

284
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,792
Exactly.

285
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,030
He said they were at the "bottom"
and "disqualified as a banker."

286
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,167
-Who does he think he is?
-Be quiet.

287
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,536
Etou?

288
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,304
Hanasaki.

289
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,941
Steamed pike conger. This is on us.

290
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,743
Are you sure?

291
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,879
Yes. It's a welcome dish.

292
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,314
Thank you.

293
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,919
I didn't know that this was
your dad's restaurant, Hanasaki.

294
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,388
But the name of the restaurant
is Hanasaki.

295
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,357
I didn't put two and two together.

296
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,093
-We've been wanting to come here.
-Yes.

297
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,163
We heard that this place is good.

298
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,099
Hanasaki's father's dishes
are really tasty.

299
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,568
Thank you very much.

300
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,439
Branch Manager Tayama
came here before too.

301
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,706
Really?

302
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,043
Please come again. Since we are neighbors.

303
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,245
We will.

304
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,616
Wow. This steamed pike conger is the best.

305
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,452
I'm so glad.

306
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,221
By the way, Mr. Etou. Are you married?

307
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,291
-Dad.
-No.

308
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,592
Oh, really?

309
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,828
-Please introduce him to someone.
-Sure.

310
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,363
He is the same age.

311
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,868
A little young, but looks healthy.
He is nice and his workplace is close by.

312
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,105
Dad, we can hear everything.

313
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,442
Mai, your dream of becoming
a banker's wife is just within reach.

314
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,912
I've never dreamed of such a thing.

315
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,881
This is not funny anymore.

316
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,484
Yes, it is.

317
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,785
Mr. Soma.

318
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,020
-Same here.
-Nice.

319
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,893
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

320
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:53,932
Yes.

321
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,437
Mr. Himuro.

322
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,306
Is there anything wrong?

323
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,576
I wanted to talk to you.

324
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,111
Yes.

325
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,718
Tomorrow is daunting.

326
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,286
I know.

327
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,755
He just loves making sarcastic remarks.

328
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,292
I get so mad when I think about
Chief Himuro.

329
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,728
-What?
-Hanasaki.

330
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,900
Let me remind you that we are
in the Inspection Unit right now.

331
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,172
Sorry.

332
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,575
But it angers me to see him
using his power and position

333
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:41,013
against people in the branch
just to release his stress.

334
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,016
Well, I was thinking the same thing too.

335
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,152
I don't mind.

336
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,822
Since I am not as good as my other
colleagues in the Finance Department.

337
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,993
But he was so harsh on you, Mr. Kitamura.

338
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,495
It can't be helped.

339
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,163
Don't say that.

340
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,867
He shouldn't have attacked you
about Fukagawa Print.

341
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,969
-Etou!
-It was the Branch Manager--

342
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,437
Etou!

343
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,275
Fukagawa Print is the company
that received the 30 million yen fund

344
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,944
from an unknown source?

345
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,645
Yes. Mysterious 30 million yen.

346
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,113
Is there anything else?

347
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,351
Well, nothing.

348
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,787
Don't say unnecessary things.

349
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,789
-I'm sorry.
-Mr. Kitamura.

350
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,259
We won't tell Mr. Himuro.

351
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,495
We came to help the Inspection Unit
this time,

352
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,632
but Branch Inspection
supports everyone in the branch.

353
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:42,441
Fukagawa Print is run by
a friend of the Branch Manager.

354
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,511
Everyone in our branch knows it.

355
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,382
No one mentions it,
and it's like an unspoken rule.

356
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,918
Since they're a customer
of the branch office,

357
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,287
I can't investigate too far.

358
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,791
I didn't know what to answer
when I was asked those questions today.

359
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,426
I see.

360
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,795
That's wrong of the Branch Manager.

361
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,433
Mr. Himuro was attacking
Mr. Kitamura badly,

362
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,802
but he didn't say anything.

363
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,239
-You are right.
-It's okay.

364
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,511
I wonder how things will go tomorrow.

365
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,013
Yes.

366
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,986
There is a company
I want to know more about.

367
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,988
Which company is it?

368
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,028
Natsume Mokuzai.

369
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,634
There seems to be an interesting
connection with Fukagawa Print,

370
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,436
which we discussed earlier.

371
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,039
NATSUME MOKUZAI

372
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,708
-Um…
-Branch Manager Tayama.

373
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,712
It seems like you are doing
something that you should

374
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,113
not be doing as a banker.

375
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:01,920
I haven't mentioned this to anyone yet.

376
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,290
But everyone will find out
at the meeting tomorrow.

377
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,061
Can you please refrain from doing that?

378
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,430
No. I am in the Inspection Unit,

379
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,032
so I can't overlook foul play.

380
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,034
Mr. Himuro. Please.

381
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,539
Doing that would be a huge risk for me.

382
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,141
Then what should I do?

383
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,313
Let me see.

384
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,451
One Section Chief
of the Finance Department…

385
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,787
paid me this much.

386
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,426
Okay. I promise to pay you that amount
tomorrow morning.

387
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,964
I will rethink it if you say so.

388
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,267
Please.

389
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,640
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
FUKAGAWA BRANCH

390
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,480
Good morning.

391
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,549
Good morning.

392
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,253
NATSUME MOKUZAI

393
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,389
Ms. Hanasaki.

394
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,724
Return this to the Finance Department.

395
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,059
Yes, sir.

396
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,195
But Natsume Mokuzai
is on the review list for today.

397
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,296
It's okay.

398
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,299
It didn't have any problems.

399
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:22,968
Is that so?

400
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,972
Hurry up and go.

401
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,474
Yes, sir.

402
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,280
Make sure to check thoroughly
and scrutinize every detail.

403
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,915
Yes.

404
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,989
Oh, it hurts. What is this? It hurts.

405
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,056
What is it?

406
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,593
Sorry, but my stomach hurts.

407
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,196
I might have had too much for breakfast.

408
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,131
I have to go to the bathroom.

409
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,834
I have a stomachache.

410
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,302
What's that?

411
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,539
My stomach hurts.

412
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,674
-Hanasaki!
-Mr. Soma.

413
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,778
-Let me see that file.
-Here.

414
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,182
-What's the matter?
-Well…

415
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,687
I wanted to know why Mr. Himuro
excluded this company from the list.

416
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,823
Isn't it because it has no problems?

417
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,393
No… This company has something.

418
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,361
What?

419
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,531
-Natsume Mokuzai?
-Yes.

420
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,434
-Who is in charge?
-Me.

421
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,669
How's the business?

422
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:36,141
Not bad. They are not in the red,
nor do they get behind in repayments.

423
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,278
Natsume Mokuzai is an old company.

424
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,815
-Do you know them?
-Yes. It's near my house.

425
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,017
The President comes to my restaurant.

426
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,119
I see.

427
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,890
They received an urgent loan addition
last month.

428
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes. Honestly, I didn't think
it would be approved,

429
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,562
but the Manager approved it
on the same day.

430
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,130
Same day?

431
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,501
-May I use the computer?
-Please.

432
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,772
NATSUME MOKUZAI

433
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,775
NATSUME MOKUZAI INC.

434
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:21,019
On July 10th, they withdrew the entire
amount they received from the loan.

435
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,091
How did they spend that 30 million yen?

436
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:32,631
Weren't you talking about
a 30-million-yen fund yesterday?

437
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,800
The mysterious 30 million yen
of Fukagawa Print.

438
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,437
-Yes.
-That was also on July 10th.

439
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,742
Fukagawa Print borrowed 30 million yen

440
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,810
from an unknown source,

441
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,147
and Natsume Mokuzai spent
30 million yen on an unknown source.

442
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:53,318
Is it just a coincidence
that both happened on the same day?

443
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,821
Sublease…

444
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,592
The loan of 30 million yen
to Natsume Mokuzai

445
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,395
might have been
subleased to Fukagawa Print.

446
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,565
What's their connection?

447
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,601
I don't think there is any.

448
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,769
Right.

449
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,807
Maybe the Branch Manager
is in between them.

450
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,945
Fukagawa Print is run by
a friend of the Branch Manager.

451
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:25,150
What if he asked Natsume Mokuzai
to sublease to Fukagawa Print because

452
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,252
the bank can't finance them.

453
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,690
Wait a minute. That's a bypass loan.

454
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,225
I can't believe
the Branch Manager would do that.

455
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,327
That's not allowed.

456
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,162
It's against the Investment Act.

457
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,298
But we can't determine that yet.

458
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,636
I will go to Natsume Mokuzai.

459
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,839
I have to investigate the truth.

460
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,242
I don't think they will
tell you the truth that easily.

461
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,179
The Branch Manager might be
in this with Natsume Mokuzai.

462
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,449
That President is not that kind of a man.

463
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,952
I think so too. I'll ask him anyway.

464
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,587
-I'm coming.
-Etou.

465
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,858
I am in charge of Natsume Mokuzai.

466
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,728
-See you later.
-See you.

467
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,702
I'm ashamed that I didn't notice this
even though I was in charge.

468
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,537
I'm disqualified to be in Finance.

469
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,208
Why are you being so blue. Cheer up.

470
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,676
Hey, Mai.

471
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,311
Dad.

472
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,846
Hello.

473
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,048
Hello, Mr. Etou.

474
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,618
Did you change your business partner
from Mr. Soma?

475
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,520
No. It's just today.

476
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,323
I see. But you look good together.

477
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,561
Did the President of Natsume Mokuzai
come to our restaurant recently?

478
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,730
Mr. Natsume?

479
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,634
He came last month with
the Branch Manager of this bank.

480
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,837
-What?
-What? With our Branch Manager?

481
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,072
Yes.

482
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,275
I'm sure there is something.

483
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,344
-Something?
-Thanks, Dad.

484
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,815
-Excuse me.
-Be careful.

485
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,788
She'll have him under her thumb
if they get married.

486
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,062
NATSUME MOKUZAI

487
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,039
Hi, Mr. Etou. What's the matter?

488
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,340
Long time no see.

489
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,145
Are you Mai? Mr. Hanasaki's daughter?

490
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,649
Today, I come as an employee
of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

491
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,584
I see.

492
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,220
What is it?

493
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:47,926
It is about the loan of 30 million yen
we offered last month.

494
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,098
Ms. Hanasaki. Please copy this file.

495
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm sorry.

496
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,103
Hanasaki has a stomachache
so she's in the bathroom.

497
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,540
-She is no help at all.
-I'll do it.

498
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,417
You immediately withdrew 30 million yen.

499
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,887
How did you spend that cash?

500
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,892
I used it as an operating fund.

501
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,195
Are you close to Branch Manager Tayama?

502
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,532
My father said you came
to his restaurant with him.

503
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,369
That was a coincidence.

504
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,338
Did he ask you to

505
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,476
sublease 30 million yen to Fukagawa Print?

506
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,348
That's nonsense.

507
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,185
What Branch Manager Tayama did
is prohibited as a banker.

508
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,824
If this is left alone, you will also
be charged for lending a hand.

509
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,527
What? Is that so?

510
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,199
Did you sublease 30 million yen
to Fukagawa Print?

511
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,537
If he asked you to do such a thing,

512
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:09,407
I have the responsibility
for not realizing what was happening.

513
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,110
I am very sorry.

514
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:20,218
President Natsume.
Would you please tell us the truth?

515
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,088
I promise that we will not
cause you trouble.

516
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,692
Please.

517
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,627
Please.

518
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,118
I have a stomachache again.

519
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,354
Excuse me for a moment.

520
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,490
Branch Inspection is so useless.

521
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,961
-You scared me.
-Please come with me.

522
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,163
Did you find out anything?

523
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,531
PROMISSORY NOTE
30 MILLION YEN

524
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,499
This is…

525
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,336
This is an IOU from Natsume Mokuzai
when they

526
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,538
lent 30 million yen to Fukagawa Print.

527
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,308
Can we use this as evidence
of a bypass loan?

528
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,810
Yes.

529
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,780
It's hard to believe that
the Branch Manager did a bypass loan.

530
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,217
President Natsume told me…

531
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,821
A small company like us will go down

532
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,425
if the bank turns us down.

533
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,429
I can't turn down an offer from

534
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,498
a Branch Manager.

535
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,768
I can't forgive the Branch Manager.

536
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,071
Please investigate this thoroughly.

537
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,140
Mr. Soma.

538
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,011
Please bring it up
at the review meeting today.

539
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,879
But that means

540
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,082
this branch will have to take
responsibility.

541
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,983
Yes.

542
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,687
I don't want to bring shame on the branch,

543
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,990
but involving our customers in
something like this

544
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,059
is unacceptable.

545
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,064
I understand.

546
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,733
Thank you very much.

547
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,040
The Branch Manager is horrible.

548
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,008
I feel bad for the employees.

549
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,449
What's wrong? You seem unsatisfied.

550
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,019
Listen, Hanasaki.

551
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,690
Come here.

552
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,567
There is one more person who's doing
something unacceptable as a banker.

553
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:51,836
Who is it?

554
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,404
Chief Himuro.

555
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,043
There was a report
about Chief Himuro's foul play.

556
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,580
We were sent to help the Inspection Unit

557
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,382
in order to investigate.

558
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,985
Foul play? What do you mean?

559
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,189
He's blackmailing people using errors
found in the branch to extort money.

560
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:18,663
Mr. Himuro excluded Natsume Mokuzai
from the list because of that?

561
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,999
He's returning the favor.

562
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,268
Since he received money from
the Branch Manager

563
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,304
after threatening him.

564
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,913
This is Branch Manager Tayama's
account statement.

565
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,118
He withdrew 500,000 yen from
this branch's ATM

566
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,053
at 8:02 a.m. today.

567
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,290
That means this
500,000 yen was hush money?

568
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,658
Probably.

569
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,063
Mr. Soma. Let's investigate Chief Himuro.

570
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,766
No, we can't.

571
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,205
This is Chief Himuro's bank statement.

572
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,041
There is no money received.

573
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,711
He received money by cash
to leave no trace.

574
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,847
Then we have no evidence.

575
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,953
We can prove the bypass loan
by Branch Manager Tayama.

576
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:21,059
But it may be difficult to
investigate Chief Himuro's foul play.

577
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,230
Then do we have to overlook Chief Himuro?

578
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,302
It's frustrating,
but we have to give up for today.

579
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,604
No way.

580
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,507
He arrogantly told us
to correct the wrongdoings,

581
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,276
while he's doing the opposite.

582
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,544
This is so wrong!

583
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,512
You are too loud!

584
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,981
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,684
This is so frustrating.

586
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:54,792
But why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?

587
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,062
I kept it secret
because you can't hide your feelings.

588
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,298
That's not true.

589
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,201
Look! It's clear on your face.

590
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,916
We can nail Chief Himuro and his foul play

591
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,019
if we can prove that he received
the 500,000 yen

592
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,690
that Branch Manager Tayama
withdrew this morning, right?

593
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,626
Yes, but how?

594
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:30,928
Look.

595
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,531
Camera?

596
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,135
I will trace the 500,000 yen.

597
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,836
Hey, wait!

598
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,006
Oh, my God.

599
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,398
CREDIT EXAMINATION REVIEW MEETING DAY TWO

600
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,301
Let's start the second review meeting.

601
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,376
First from Hirakawa Chemical.

602
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,111
-Who is in charge?
-I am.

603
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,580
I see an equipment fund estimation,
but where's

604
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,282
the transfer details and receipt?

605
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,918
That's not ready yet…

606
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,020
What do you mean?

607
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,123
Do you think it is over
once you offer a loan?

608
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,460
It's important to manage it
once the loan is approved.

609
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,030
Here he comes.

610
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,548
What's next?

611
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,886
First, he went to the hallway.

612
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,397
Where did he go?

613
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,000
Let's check.

614
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,940
He went this way.

615
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,217
And he opened this door.

616
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,822
NO PARKING

617
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,292
The parking lot.

618
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:48,199
A 40-million-yen loan is
a little excessive for this company, no?

619
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,635
Their performance is expected to improve.

620
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,802
How do you know?

621
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,474
According to the business plan and the--

622
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,410
I am asking if it's absolutely possible.

623
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,614
Don't you have any proof?

624
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,725
Here he is.

625
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,541
It's strange that the estimated amount
and the amount spent doesn't match.

626
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,609
I am sorry.

627
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,312
Don't you have a sense of responsibility?

628
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,881
How are you still
in the Finance Department?

629
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,616
Next!

630
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,871
I wish I could tell if this is cash.

631
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,252
Bingo!

632
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,593
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,130
Next!

634
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,881
That's all. I will send a list
of needed improvements later on.

635
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,084
Thank you very much.

636
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,625
Excuse me.

637
00:39:56,026 --> 00:40:00,598
I would like to review one more company.

638
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,473
-Which company?
-Yes.

639
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,911
It's Natsume Mokuzai.

640
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,279
NATSUME MOKUZAI

641
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,384
I told you that it had no problems.

642
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,653
Actually, it did.

643
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,222
A 30-million-yen loan was approved

644
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,458
by the Branch Manager on July 10th.

645
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,627
Then they withdrew

646
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,797
all the cash within the same day.

647
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,267
What's wrong with that?

648
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,213
Natsume Mokuzai subleased that entire
amount to Fukagawa Print, as instructed

649
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,650
by Manager Tayama.

650
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,154
Branch Manager Tayama.

651
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,156
You were asked for a loan

652
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,459
from your friend who runs Fukagawa Print.

653
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,162
But Fukagawa Print is in danger
of bankruptcy,

654
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,031
so our bank cannot finance them.

655
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,402
So you planned and executed
the bypass loan

656
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,438
by involving Natsume Mokuzai.

657
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,341
Am I right?

658
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,312
Why do you have that IOU?

659
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,682
I borrowed this from Natsume Mokuzai.

660
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,990
You forced our customer into
committing wrongdoing.

661
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,762
This is absolutely prohibited as a banker.

662
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,102
Branch Manager Tayama.

663
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,172
I will report this.

664
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,375
This is not what we agreed on, Mr. Himuro.

665
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,248
What are you talking about?

666
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,258
Thanks to you, we were able to
reveal the wrongdoing.

667
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,159
Great job.

668
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,107
Wait a moment.

669
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,052
What are you doing here now?

670
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,353
It is not over yet.

671
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,191
Chief Himuro. You knew about
the bypass loan, didn't you?

672
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,626
What?

673
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,763
You knew but tried to overlook it.

674
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,500
Because you received money
from Branch Manager Tayama.

675
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,338
Or did you blackmail him?

676
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,307
Blackmail?

677
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,377
Stop insulting me!

678
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,647
How dare you say such a thing to me?

679
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:12,590
These are pictures printed from
the security cameras in this branch.

680
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:23,067
This morning, Branch Manager Tayama
withdrew 500,000 yen from an ATM,

681
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,870
went to the parking garage,

682
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,577
and gave it to Chief Himuro.

683
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,089
This 500,000 yen was hush money
to overlook the bypass loan.

684
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,926
Was it true, Branch Manager Tayama?

685
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,761
Yes.

686
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:56,400
Don't you still have that money
inside your jacket?

687
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,776
Will you show us what's in your pocket?

688
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,445
Are you kidding me?

689
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,854
I am not obligated to do that.

690
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,256
It's all a lie.

691
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,525
What is this nonsense?

692
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,528
Don't get me involved in this.

693
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,831
With all due respect…

694
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,702
you told me yesterday that

695
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,540
credit examination is to find
and correct unforgivable errors

696
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,376
in a bank, where trust is a priority.

697
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,783
You are the leader of credit examination.

698
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,385
But instead of finding an error
and correcting it,

699
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,154
you took money and overlooked it.

700
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,356
You're doing the opposite.

701
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,525
-Shut up!
-No, I won't!

702
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,494
Before correcting the branch,

703
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,597
you should correct your own errors.

704
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,302
Making Tokyo Daiichi Bank better
is your job?

705
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,871
Give me a break.

706
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:12,109
This bank will never get better,
because of people like you.

707
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,355
Excuse me.

708
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,694
This is the money… right?

709
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,332
It looks like it's about 500,000 yen.

710
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,627
Hanasaki!

711
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,029
Etou?

712
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,935
Hanasaki. Mr. Soma. Thank you very much.

713
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:16,006
No. It's all thanks to you, Etou.

714
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,843
We couldn't have done anything
without that IOU.

715
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,313
Your passion moved President Natsume
to action.

716
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,082
No.

717
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,718
You're not a half-baked banker.

718
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,353
You are competent.

719
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,624
Thank you.

720
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,060
Hanasaki.

721
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,097
Tell your father that
I will go to his restaurant.

722
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,939
Senior Executive Director
called us to come to his office…

723
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,941
Is he going to scold us?

724
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,044
I don't know.

725
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,081
SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

726
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,453
You are in the Branch Inspection, right?

727
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,689
Yes. I am Soma.

728
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,057
I am Mai Hanasaki.

729
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,527
I see. You did a great job.

730
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,596
Not at all.

731
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,436
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

732
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,175
Executive Director Shindo,
I was waiting for you.

733
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,476
You called for me?

734
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:30,480
I was just thanking them for
their recent work.

735
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:32,783
I see.

736
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,554
I thought you'd also want to
thank the Branch Inspection.

737
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,994
I heard that you were taking good care
of the Branch Manager at Fukagawa.

738
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,163
I wasn't really taking care of him.

739
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:52,002
These two solved the scandal
that happened in the Fukagawa Branch.

740
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:57,841
Thanks to them, it didn't become public,
and it spared our bank from disgrace.

741
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,444
I think we should thank them. Don't you?

742
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,186
I see.

743
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,622
I think you are right.

744
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,601
I appreciate it.

745
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,971
Thank you.

746
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,340
Not at all.

747
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,044
Excuse me.

748
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,622
I am looking forward to
your future endeavors. Work hard.

749
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,624
Yes.

750
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,230
He is declaring war against me.

751
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,631
Yes?

752
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,669
This is only the beginning.

753
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,878
Mr. Doujima said that?

754
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,579
You two did a great job.

755
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,014
-Not much.
-Not much.

756
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,551
Mr. Tayama was dispatched
to Tokyo First Electrics.

757
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,754
Mr. Himuro is now under HR investigation

758
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,324
to reveal all of his misconduct.

759
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,959
I see.

760
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,829
By the way, it seems like
Mr. Soma predicted correctly.

761
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,432
About you.

762
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,336
It's better not to tell Hanasaki.

763
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,638
I agree. She's too transparent.

764
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,872
Yes.

765
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,444
And plus, if there's any wrongdoing
at the branch

766
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,980
Hanasaki will definitely find out,

767
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,882
whether we tell her beforehand or not.

768
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,887
Did I say such a thing?

769
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,158
I see, Mr. Soma is praising me
when I'm not around.

770
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,560
No, I didn't praise you.

771
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,761
Don't get it wrong.

772
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,396
Don't be shy.

773
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,031
I didn't.

774
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,000
I just said that your unnecessary

775
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,268
actions work out occasionally.

776
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,705
-Occasionally? It happens a lot.
-What are you talking about?

777
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,041
You have an inspection to go to.

778
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,977
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

779
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,947
Work hard!

780
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:24,254
Minowa Branch. Meaning lunch is eel.

781
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:28,592
Minowa… Eel is not bad.
Curry is good there too.

782
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:29,926
Hey, look at this.

783
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:33,263
There is a famous restaurant
with horse meat hot pot.

784
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,698
That's it.

785
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,334
But it's hot today. Should we have eel?

786
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,569
I want horse meat hot pot.

787
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:43,907
Okay. Let's be fair
and allow the winner to choose.

788
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,208
That's fine with me.

789
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,612
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

790
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,516
It was stolen?

791
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,018
An information leak from our bank?

792
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,086
It's your fault.

793
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,288
I got an X-mark.

794
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,689
The culprit is here.

795
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,159
His passion for work became his downfall.

796
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,194
Why isn't his hard work paying off?

797
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,929
That's wrong!
