1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,638
Dad, your breakfast is really the best.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,141
I really admire you.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:12,812
-But you can't eat my breakfast forever.
-Why?

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,584
You have to be the one making breakfast
when you get married.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,653
That's still a long way off.

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:27,060
I saved this omelet for last.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,862
Mai Hanasaki.

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,399
What is it? You sound serious.

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,036
I was thinking about many things,
but I really think Mr. Matsuki

10
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,170
is the best for you.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,540
A man like him is hard to find.

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,343
And I also found out that
he likes fishing.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,844
He has the same hobby as me.

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,680
Your hobby has nothing to do with this.

15
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,718
Yes, it does. Marriage will fail
if families can't get along.

16
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,255
It's no use for you to get fired up
over this.

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:01:00,360
Nothing will start unless
the couple themselves want to pursue it.

18
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,064
Oh, no. I'm late.

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,699
Don't worry. I'll do it.

20
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,934
I'm off.

21
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,070
-Take care.
-Okay.

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,480
I forgot to eat that omelet
I saved for last.

23
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,383
I should have eaten it.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,820
What are you wailing about
this early in the morning.

25
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,055
-What's this about the egg?
-Nothing.

26
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,858
Bad news, guys.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,227
What's wrong, Mr. Shibasaki?

28
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,463
Go to the Gotanda Branch now.

29
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,730
Gotanda Branch?

30
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:43,136
Is that the one where
Mr. Matsuki is working?

31
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,504
Yes.

32
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,274
Thanks to Dad, I'm super conscious now.

33
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,243
What happened at the Gotanda Branch?

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,148
Apparently, a customer's
financial information was leaked.

35
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,549
-Really?
-Yes.

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,286
Someone sent a fax to the Branch Manager.

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,657
It was a financial document
managed by the branch office.

38
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,726
This is a big problem.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,929
Information leaked from our bank.

40
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,664
Information…

41
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,366
Leakage…

42
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,935
Hey, it's leaking!

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,174
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,755
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK GOTANDA BRANCH

45
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,924
I don't feel like going in.

46
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,927
What are you doing? Let's go.

47
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,463
Yes.

48
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,169
Excuse me.

49
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,336
Excuse me.

50
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,106
I am Hanasaki, from…

51
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,111
-Mr. Matsuki?
-Ms. Hanasaki.

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,882
You're in charge of the company
from which the information leaked?

53
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,450
Yes.

54
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,587
I am Takeuchi, the Branch Manager.

55
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,190
I am so sorry for this.

56
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,893
We're placed in a very serious situation.

57
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,263
I am Kadota, from the Finance Department.

58
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,901
This is the fax I received.

59
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,136
May I see it?

60
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,905
CLIENT'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT

61
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,709
Sure enough it seems to be a part
of our credit file.

62
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:36,416
Credit file is a document that manages
all the company information, right?

63
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:40,019
It's an important document containing
all information about the company

64
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,423
such as business overview,
shareholder composition,

65
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,258
and financial conditions.

66
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,928
Why was such an important document leaked?

67
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,299
I took the credit files out yesterday

68
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,468
because I wanted to work at home.

69
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,369
What?

70
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,943
Did you leave it somewhere?

71
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,414
No, I had the file with me
in a small paper bag.

72
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,684
I didn't lose anything
other than the file.

73
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,654
Then does that mean it was stolen?

74
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,257
What have you done?

75
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,826
I am sorry.

76
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,463
What does the culprit want?

77
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,933
Actually, I just received a phone call.

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,937
<i>-Did you see the fax?</i>
-Yes.

79
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:36,509
I found this file.
This belongs to your bank, right.

80
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,544
<i>Yes. Thank you very much.</i>

81
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,080
Can I get a reward?

82
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,081
<i>What?</i>

83
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,685
<i>Usually people get a reward</i>
<i>for returning a lost item.</i>

84
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,387
<i>How much will you pay?</i>

85
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,988
How much?

86
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:54,460
It looks like an important document,
so how about a million yen?

87
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,795
A million?

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,765
I can't decide by myself.

89
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,901
<i>Would it be okay if I put this</i>
<i>up on the internet?</i>

90
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,802
Oh, no…

91
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,840
<i>If people know that you lost this,</i>
<i>it will damage your bank's trust.</i>

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,310
Please wait, don't do that.

93
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,379
<i>I will call you again tomorrow.</i>

94
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,682
How terrible.

95
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,151
She said she found it even though
she stole it.

96
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,620
There is no way that
we can pay a million yen.

97
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,724
If we really pay, it will be
a big minus point for the branch.

98
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,795
Branch Manager,
let's report this to the police.

99
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,363
But…

100
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,199
She said she found it.

101
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,735
We have no evidence that it was stolen.

102
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,470
That is true, but…

103
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,775
Although it was indirect,
she is demanding money.

104
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,346
I think it's better
to report this to the police.

105
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,551
-The credit file was stolen?
-Yes.

106
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,520
What's wrong with
their information management?

107
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,888
It's unacceptable.

108
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,859
Branch Inspection is there
to solve this issue.

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,562
-Branch Inspection?
-Yes.

110
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,735
We just made news with
the embezzlement at Roppongi Branch.

111
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,640
A scandal about a data breach
is unacceptable.

112
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,610
-Am I right?
-Exactly.

113
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,545
Kodama.

114
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,048
As you already know,

115
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,818
make sure to settle this issue in-house.

116
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,056
What do you mean by in-house?

117
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,495
In-house means in-house.

118
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,063
In-house. Yes!

119
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,302
I guess we have to report it.

120
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,904
Branch Manager!

121
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,706
Excuse me.

122
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,412
-Yes?
-Soma?

123
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,647
You're at the Gotanda Branch, right?

124
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,582
Yes. What's up?

125
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,052
How is it? Do you think you can settle it?

126
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,555
It's not that easy.

127
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,225
Listen. Don't even think
about reporting it to the police.

128
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,327
What?

129
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,300
If you report it to the police
it will become public,

130
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,503
and people will lose their trust
in Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

131
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,906
We have to avoid that.

132
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,507
However…

133
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,911
This is an order from
Executive Director Shindo.

134
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,182
Make sure to settle it in-house.

135
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,883
Hey, Kodama.

136
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,889
What did Mr. Kodama say?

137
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,400
For the time being,

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,973
we have one more day
because she said she will call tomorrow.

139
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,776
We can decide

140
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,313
whether to call the police or not
after that call.

141
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,682
He did say something.

142
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:09,055
Plus, it's not easy to steal just
the credit file from the paper bag.

143
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,092
So if we check Mr. Matsuki's
activities yesterday…

144
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,928
Then we will be able
to narrow down the suspects.

145
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,432
Please do so.

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,401
Please cooperate and help them.

147
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,938
Please go and explain this situation
to Sawada Kengyou.

148
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,375
Yes.

149
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,579
Please help us.

150
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:41,087
I'm working on a proposal for
Sawada Kengyou's additional loan.

151
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,789
Their target loan day was on the 20th,

152
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,125
so I wanted to finish it yesterday.

153
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,530
But I couldn't finish it
within business hours.

154
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,370
You took out the credit file
to finish the document at home?

155
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,640
You're an amateur.

156
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,577
How long are you taking to finish
an application that's only 20 million yen?

157
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,245
Not only that,

158
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:12,051
you even broke the rules and
took the credit file out of the branch.

159
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,452
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,389
Well, Managers say not to work overtime.

161
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,760
So I'm sure hard-working employees are
taking their work back home.

162
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,996
But that doesn't justify
breaking the rules.

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
So you left the bank?

164
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:32,939
Yes. I ran into Mr. Kadota
when I went out of the door.

165
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,579
-Hey, Matsuki.
-Yes?

166
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,880
Great timing.

167
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,617
I am going to dinner with
Shinagawa Butsuryu. Come with me.

168
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,587
I thought we were turning down their loan.

169
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,025
Don't worry about it. Just come with me.

170
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,463
I see.
He wasn't allowed to go directly home.

171
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,802
If I knew that you had
the credit file with you,

172
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,403
I wouldn't have invited you.

173
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,441
Wait a minute. You were
entertained by a company

174
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,177
you were about to turn down?

175
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,715
Well, yes.

176
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,250
Where did you go?

177
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,555
A Japanese restaurant
named Tsujihashi in Takanawa.

178
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,524
They serve delicious crab.

179
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,727
Did you drink?

180
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,596
I did.

181
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,565
Thank you.

182
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,735
-Matsuki.
-I don't…

183
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,703
You're turning down President Kasai?

184
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,073
-Then just a little.
-Please.

185
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,042
You're not a strong drinker…

186
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,247
Your face turns red
with just one glass of beer.

187
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,487
How did you get home after dinner?

188
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,790
-Well…
-Well?

189
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,460
We went to a bar in Gotanda after dinner.

190
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,295
You went to another place?

191
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,968
We can't end the night with just dinner.

192
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,873
We were there for about two hours
and then I went home by train.

193
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,475
Is it possible that it was stolen
in the train?

194
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,277
I don't think so.

195
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,613
I was holding the paper bag
in front of me.

196
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,085
You got drunk with that little amount?
Either way, I can't count on your memory.

197
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,455
Why do you talk like…

198
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,562
After I got home, I ended up
going to sleep without working.

199
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:42,735
I noticed that the credit file was missing
after I came to the office today.

200
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,976
Then it is highly possible that it was
stolen in either of the two restaurants.

201
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,111
I think so.

202
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,313
Oh, my God.

203
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,450
What if I have to take responsibility
as the Section Chief

204
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,752
of the Finance Department?

205
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,690
With all due respect…

206
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,358
What?

207
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,794
Section Chief Kadota.

208
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:13,599
As the Chief of the Finance Department,
isn't it careless of you to be entertained

209
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,302
by a company you won't be financing?

210
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,706
It has nothing to do with this problem.

211
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,210
Anyway, the entire responsibility
lies with you for

212
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,079
taking out the credit file
and getting it stolen.

213
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,715
Keep that in mind.

214
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,923
Go to Sawada Kengyou by yourself.

215
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,525
It's not my business!

216
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:48,834
What was that? He talked as if
this is all Mr. Matsuki's responsibility.

217
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,970
How frustrating.

218
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,239
Calm down.

219
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,075
But it's true that this is my fault.

220
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,212
But if Mr. Kadota hadn't asked you
to join the dinner with his customer,

221
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,749
you would have gone home and worked.

222
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,655
Isn't Mr. Kadota
partly responsible for this too?

223
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,457
Hanasaki.

224
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:17,396
First, let's go to Sawada Kengyou
and explain the situation.

225
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,397
Here.

226
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,336
Yes.

227
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,174
Sawada Kengyou is a very solid company,

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,010
which makes me want to support them
with all my heart.

229
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,778
The President is very nice too.

230
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,049
So I am hoping
their additional loan gets approved.

231
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,185
Is it difficult?

232
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,119
Yes.

233
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,988
They have been in the red, so it's tough.

234
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,891
Oh, no…

235
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,161
Our financial information leaked outside?

236
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,030
I am sorry.

237
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,937
Of course, we are working hard
to get it back.

238
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,472
Is everything really okay?

239
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,778
If people in our industry see it,
we will be over.

240
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
Over…

241
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,582
We're pretending to be doing well,

242
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,251
but we've been in the red.

243
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,255
We've managed to survive
with a loan from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

244
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,960
If people find out
our financial information,

245
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,395
we will lose our customers.

246
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,432
We won't be able to keep going.

247
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,136
I am very sorry.

248
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,075
Will you bring it back for me?

249
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,845
You can do it, right Mr. Matsuki?

250
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,391
This puts Mr. Matsuki in a pinch,

251
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,461
but it also puts Sawada Kengyou
in a pinch too.

252
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,332
We have to solve this somehow
for President Sawada.

253
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,868
Let's go to see President Kasai

254
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,804
of Shinagawa Butsuryu
who entertained them last night.

255
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,906
Yes.

256
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:07,940
SHINAGAWA BUTSURYU

257
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,608
A document file?

258
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,412
It was a very important file of a company.

259
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,148
It was in a paper bag.

260
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,516
I don't remember.

261
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,753
I wasn't paying much attention.

262
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,322
I understand.

263
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,325
President Kasai, you invited
Kadota for dinner last night?

264
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,395
Yes. We are applying for a loan right now.

265
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,402
So I was hoping I could
push things forward by doing that.

266
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,105
Do you hold dinner meetings often?

267
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,342
Yes. We can talk well
over a nice dinner and drinks.

268
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,579
Mr. Matsuki, I'm sorry for
dragging you to two places

269
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,516
without knowing that you
had such an important file.

270
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,018
No. I wasn't careful.

271
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,555
I can call the places we went to
last night.

272
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,358
It's okay. We will go there now.

273
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,593
I see. I hope you can find it.

274
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,863
Yes. Thank you.

275
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,669
This is the room you used last night.

276
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,138
-Thank you.
-I see, it was a private room.

277
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,507
Yes. I put my bag in here.

278
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,278
It might not have been stolen
in this room.

279
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,047
Okay. Let's go to the next one.

280
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,083
Was it in Gotanda?

281
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,017
Yes.

282
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,588
But that place is…

283
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,357
A hostess bar?

284
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,159
-See you. Come again.
-Yes.

285
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,129
That's why I didn't want to
bring Ms. Hanasaki.

286
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,732
Mr. Matsuki,
you come to this kind of bar too?

287
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,102
No. Personally, I don't like
these types of places…

288
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,004
I know, I know. Let's go.

289
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,805
Okay.

290
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,742
Excuse me.

291
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,912
How old are you?

292
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,583
I am 27.

293
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,320
You're pretty old.
You are too old to work here.

294
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,789
You're not here for the trial?

295
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,057
Trial?

296
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,925
FREE TRIAL - NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED!

297
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,863
AGE 18 TO 23

298
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:16,468
He assumed I came for the trial
and tells me I'm pretty old. How rude!

299
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,203
I will take your bag.

300
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,805
Here.

301
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,048
So you have to leave your bag
at the entrance, huh.

302
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,682
-Yes.
-Mr. Soma.

303
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,852
If it was stolen,
it most likely happened here.

304
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,121
And the caller was a woman too.

305
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,692
Then the culprit is in this bar?

306
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,171
Excuse me.

307
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,708
Is there a particular girl you'd like?

308
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,777
Oh… ah… yes. Matsuki!

309
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,912
Yes.

310
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,247
EMILY

311
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:07,252
Emily, Honoka, and Sara, please.

312
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,554
Sure.

313
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,526
Excuse me.

314
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,361
I'm Emily.

315
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm Honoka.

316
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,997
Hello.

317
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,866
You look so happy.

318
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,601
Move aside.

319
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,770
Mr. Matsuki!

320
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,239
-You came again!
-Hi.

321
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,910
Stop looking so serious.
They will be suspicious.

322
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,814
Mr. Matsuki, you work for a bank, right?

323
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,282
Yes.

324
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,819
Then are you the Branch Manager?

325
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,088
Something like that.

326
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,424
He is telling a lie.

327
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,227
He said that he met many
pretty girls last night,

328
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,561
so I came along.

329
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,929
-Really?
-Yeah.

330
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,031
Thank you for waiting. Here is Sara.

331
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,634
Hello. I am Sara.

332
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,810
I'm glad to see you again.

333
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,711
Hi.

334
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,382
Branch Manager makes lots of money, right?

335
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,719
No. I just get used to
seeing a lot of money.

336
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,222
I envy you. We don't have any at all.

337
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,925
Really? I thought you were paid well.

338
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,326
Tomorrow is payday.

339
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,828
You are right.

340
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,064
-I can't wait.
-I see.

341
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,966
Excuse me.

342
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,651
Your lipstick is the latest color.

343
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,186
Yes.

344
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,291
This is a nice clutch.
Is it the latest design?

345
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,258
Yes.

346
00:19:55,394 --> 00:20:00,365
Did Mr. Matsuki leave anything
when he came last night?

347
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,100
It's an important document.

348
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,469
I don't know anything.

349
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,541
There's going to be trouble
if we can't find it.

350
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,811
We may have to report it to the police.

351
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,983
Police? Does that mean the police
will be asking us questions?

352
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,688
No. We will report it as a missing item.

353
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,824
Sure, of course.

354
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,834
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

355
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,837
Sara is suspicious.

356
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,875
Suspicious of what?

357
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,045
I only said we "may" report to the police,

358
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,314
but she became very flustered.

359
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,317
Is Sara the culprit then?

360
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,319
We don't know yet.

361
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:59,958
But she could have left her seat
for a while to steal the file.

362
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,130
Do you think she did it for the money?

363
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,667
They were saying that their work is tough.

364
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,672
Shall we check if she is in debt?

365
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,540
We might find a lead.

366
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,276
That's a good point.

367
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,511
I don't think you can do it.

368
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,113
Why?

369
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,251
Sara at Paradise. That's all we know.

370
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,189
I see. That's a nickname
and we don't know her real name.

371
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,891
Can we ask the bar?

372
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,560
Do you think they'll give us
her personal information

373
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,529
when we're not the police?

374
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,198
We are very close, though.

375
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:45,637
If we want to investigate Sara any further
we'll have to report it to the police.

376
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,640
But we're not certain enough
to do that yet.

377
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,042
You are right.

378
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,814
Let's report to the Branch Manager
tomorrow and think about the plan.

379
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:57,983
Okay.

380
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,921
I'll go home.

381
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,990
Are you going home, Mr. Soma?

382
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,258
Yes. Thanks.

383
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,759
Thank you.

384
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,496
-See you tomorrow.
-Take care.

385
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,908
Oh, I forgot I ran out of sudachi.
I'll go buy them.

386
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,410
Do you have to get them now?

387
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,381
I'm going to be tactful and step out.
Good luck.

388
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,417
Enjoy.

389
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,319
-Yes.
-Hey.

390
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,526
Well…

391
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,102
I got an X-mark.

392
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,204
X-mark?

393
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:58,810
I will have to take responsibility
for what I've done.

394
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,748
Once you get an X-mark, that's the end.

395
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,450
That's banks for you.

396
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,960
That's not true.
That's definitely not true.

397
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,264
Everyone can make a mistake.

398
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,568
But that shouldn't end everything.
That's wrong.

399
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:29,474
Everyone has as many chances
as they need to try again.

400
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,111
You shouldn't be saying things
like that, Mr. Matsuki.

401
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,747
Ms. Hanasaki.

402
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,852
Besides, what you should be
thinking about the most right now

403
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,522
is Sawada Kengyou, isn't it?

404
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,227
You can feel blue
after we settle this problem.

405
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,765
You are right.

406
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,403
I will think about what I can do for now.

407
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,538
Yes.

408
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,877
Eat some more.

409
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,013
I didn't eat at all.

410
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,549
You need to eat to gain energy.

411
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,683
Yes.

412
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,024
Is that the girl you like?

413
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,459
Ms. Saito.

414
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,862
-You like young girls, huh.
-No…

415
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,096
Guys! I got something.

416
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,431
Ms. Saito!

417
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,600
I was just joking.

418
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,604
-Oh. She's our customer.
-What?

419
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,973
I see her often at the ATM.

420
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,209
Are you sure?

421
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,412
I've been working here for ten years.

422
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,280
I remember the customers.

423
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,751
Thank you very much!

424
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,589
She's a customer of Gotanda Branch?

425
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,259
Yes. I heard that she uses
our ATM very often.

426
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,431
If she uses the ATM,
we can check her account number.

427
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,100
-Then we will know who Sara is.
-Yes.

428
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,703
But we don't know when she is coming.

429
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:10,175
That's right. We have no time
to just wait for her.

430
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,013
She may come today.

431
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,749
How do you know?

432
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,017
Tomorrow is payday.

433
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,452
You are right.

434
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,820
I can't wait.

435
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,557
Today is payday at Paradise.

436
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,559
She will come for a withdrawal.

437
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,943
She isn't coming.

438
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:51,049
Maybe she's using a different ATM today.

439
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,753
Sorry.

440
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,789
Don't give up. Let's wait.

441
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,324
Yes.

442
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,963
Look. We met her in Paradise.

443
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,831
Emily.

444
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,569
You remember her name?

445
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,104
But we need Sara.

446
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,473
She is not here yet.

447
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,044
Thank you very much.

448
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,745
Thank you very much.

449
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,253
I wonder if she's not coming today.

450
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,594
Here she comes.

451
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,529
-Which one?
-Where?

452
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,564
Here. It's her.

453
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,834
Is that really her?

454
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,770
True, she looks different today
with jeans,

455
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,405
and no makeup.

456
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,375
But that's Sara.

457
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,048
Ms. Saito. Please.

458
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,750
Okay.

459
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,656
ATM ROOM

460
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,362
I'm ready.

461
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,529
Okay.

462
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,469
Which machine is she going to use?

463
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:21,139
We won't know until the last moment.

464
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,892
-Number three!
-Mr. Matsuki. Number three.

465
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,028
-Number three.
-Okay.

466
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,234
IN USE

467
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,786
OPEN

468
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,753
BUSY

469
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,288
ELECTRONIC JOURNAL

470
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,859
This is who she is.

471
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,631
Yuriko Kawashima.

472
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,904
Yuriko Kawashima.

473
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,006
That's Sara's real name.

474
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,943
Yes. She opened a bank account
at this branch two years ago.

475
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,814
Paradise pays her
about 500,000 yen every month.

476
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,752
Her credit card payment
is between 250,000 to 300,000 yen.

477
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,721
Rent is 200,000 yen.

478
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,790
That's a pretty extravagant lifestyle.

479
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:50,061
If she pays the water and energy bills,
she will be in the red.

480
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:54,132
Her income is 500,000 yen,
but she spends 600,000 yen.

481
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,037
There is a transfer.

482
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,541
She's receiving it every month.

483
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,278
-Who's transferring it?
-Norio Kasai?

484
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,613
Norio Kasai!

485
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,982
It's President Kasai.

486
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:11,950
President Kasai…

487
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,752
SHINAGAWA BUTSURYU

488
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,959
President Kasai is regularly transferring
money into Sara's account?

489
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,795
Is she his mistress?

490
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,564
-What?
-What do you mean?

491
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,600
I am not quite sure,

492
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,103
but Sara might be
President Kasai's mistress.

493
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,574
Then they're accomplices?

494
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,012
President Kasai asked Sara
to steal the credit file?

495
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,618
Shinagawa Butsuryu isn't doing well
financially, right?

496
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:51,923
It is very bad. We are planning
to turn down their loan application too.

497
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,026
He's unbelievable!

498
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:01,366
Matsuki! What are you doing?
Go to Kasai and bring it back.

499
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,670
Wait a minute.

500
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,239
Even if we approach President Kasai,

501
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,742
if he feigns innocence,
we'll have no solution.

502
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,977
That's right.

503
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,446
Then what should we do?

504
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,489
Yes.

505
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,925
Wait a moment.

506
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,627
The woman is calling.

507
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,197
What are you going to do?

508
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,709
Let's pay the reward money.

509
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,147
Branch Manager. If you do such a thing…

510
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,650
Our priority right now
is to take back that credit file.

511
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,020
I'll talk to her.

512
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,223
I'm Takeuchi, the Branch Manager.

513
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,660
Yes. I would like to pay you a reward.

514
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,629
Thank you very much.

515
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,132
3 p.m. tomorrow at the lobby
of the Tokyo Hills Hotel.

516
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,500
I understand.

517
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,206
Are you sure it's okay for us to do this?

518
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,544
It's only natural that they reward us
since we're returning what we found.

519
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,012
Don't worry.

520
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,982
But I didn't find it.

521
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,385
You just follow what I say.

522
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,792
Now our branch has a big X-mark.

523
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,229
-It's your fault! Do you understand?
-Branch Manager.

524
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,302
Please take me with you tomorrow.

525
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,606
I will take all the responsibility.

526
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,643
No. Don't get involved
with this any further.

527
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:57,248
No matter how this problem is solved,
you'll face disciplinary action.

528
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,817
Be prepared.

529
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,088
Yes.

530
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,193
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

531
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:22,473
I reported to the top management
with the Branch Manager.

532
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,575
What did they say?

533
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,477
Of course, they got mad

534
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,481
for agreeing to pay the million yen
without getting their permission.

535
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,749
Understandable.

536
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:38,456
I was scolded by the Director saying
that I should have reported to him first.

537
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,794
Now that this problem has become this big,

538
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,763
the branch will have to
take serious responsibility for it.

539
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,067
Will Mr. Matsuki get punished?

540
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:55,173
Probably. His earnest attitude
towards his job backfired on him.

541
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:03,982
I think banks need someone earnest
and serious like Mr. Matsuki.

542
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,452
I think so too.

543
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,957
I am going to Sawada Kengyou.

544
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,197
The bank can't help running around
in a panic about what happened.

545
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:23,001
But Mr. Sawada is probably more worried.

546
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,103
So I will go and inform him.

547
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,473
-Okay. Go see him.
-Yes.

548
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,843
-Please come in.
-Thank you.

549
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,249
Mr. Matsuki?

550
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,118
Ms. Hanasaki!

551
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,054
Why are you here?

552
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,393
I wanted to do what I can do right now.

553
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,963
You're writing the proposal
for an additional loan?

554
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,267
Since I lost the credit file,
I came here to see the documents.

555
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,171
He said that he wanted to do this
by any means.

556
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,340
I see.

557
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:08,813
Mr. Matsuki is doing his best.
I understand that.

558
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,918
I'll make some tea.

559
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,566
Mr. Matsuki, you're a great banker.

560
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:33,871
No. I just want Sawada Kengyou's
loan application to move forward

561
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,940
even after I leave.

562
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,042
I'll ask the Branch Manager too.

563
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:44,348
In order to do that, I have to prepare
a good proposal document.

564
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,587
I am very sorry. Please wait.

565
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,859
I promise to pay you
by the end of the month.

566
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,795
Yes. Thank you.

567
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,535
Excuse me.

568
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:10,274
I have to keep the company
for my employees.

569
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:18,483
Mr. Soma,
I really can't forgive Mr. Kasai.

570
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,619
Is there anything we can do?

571
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,555
I talked to the Legal Department.

572
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,760
What he has done is regarded as extortion.

573
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,331
Then we will go to the hotel tomorrow…

574
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,433
<i>President Kasai won't appear.</i>

575
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:42,507
He used Sara for everything from
stealing the file, to making the calls.

576
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,210
Sara will most likely come
to receive the reward money.

577
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,612
I guess so.

578
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:52,683
If anything happens,
he will probably blame everything on her.

579
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,589
In order to prove that
President Kasai is behind all this,

580
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,292
we will need Sara to testify against him.

581
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,200
Mr. Soma. Let's ask her to testify.

582
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,269
Huh?

583
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,840
SAWADA KENGYOU

584
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,936
-Are you the Branch Manager?
-Yes.

585
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,944
Thank you very much for bringing us
the important document.

586
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,052
Please take this.

587
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,721
Here you go.

588
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,196
Yes, this is it.

589
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,436
If you take that money,

590
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,572
we will have to take you to court.

591
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,809
Is that okay with you, Sara?

592
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,247
I mean, Ms. Yuriko Kawashima.

593
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,958
SARA (YURIKO)

594
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,894
What are you doing?
Did you receive the money?

595
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:49,133
<i>By money, do you mean</i>
<i>the money you were trying to extort?</i>

596
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,279
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

597
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,487
Will you tell us everything, Mr. Kasai?

598
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,256
What's everything?

599
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,126
Sara was honest and told us everything.

600
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,431
She said she stole the credit file.

601
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,402
I stole the file.

602
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,775
Since Sara is your lover,

603
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:34,011
she has no choice but to follow
your instructions.

604
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,914
Will you admit everything?

605
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,552
Damn.

606
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,155
What's wrong with that?

607
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,958
First of all,
this is all the bank's fault.

608
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,397
I wanted to rebuild my company,

609
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,634
so I took Mr. Kadota out
for meals and drinks many times.

610
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,173
But you never planned to finance us
from the beginning, right?

611
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,745
That's not true.
I assess the loan in a fair manner--

612
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,846
That's a lie.

613
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,918
I asked you out for a dinner on that day

614
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,187
to get approval for the loan.

615
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:20,057
But what you said changed everything.

616
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,801
Mr. Kadota, please help us with the loans.

617
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,572
You should know by now…

618
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,307
With your business performance,

619
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,376
we can't give you an additional loan.

620
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,411
But…

621
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,548
A bank is not a charity.

622
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,152
Mr. Kadota, you better not…

623
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,988
I said no.

624
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,957
That's too bad.

625
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,960
So I changed my mind.

626
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,563
If I stole Mr. Matsuki's file,

627
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,599
Tokyo Daiichi Bank would be in trouble,

628
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,568
and you would be punished too, Mr. Kadota.

629
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,910
I also thought I could get a reward

630
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,012
if I said that I found it.

631
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,884
Steal a file from that paper bag that says
Sawada Kengyou on it.

632
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,993
This is all because of the bank.
It's Mr. Kadota's fault.

633
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,531
What are you talking about?
Branch Manager!

634
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,833
He is trying to pin the blame on me.

635
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,001
You are right.

636
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,303
Kadota went out with you

637
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,807
although he was planning
to refuse the loan.

638
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,575
What he did is wrong.

639
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,779
We will investigate him thoroughly
in this regard.

640
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,859
However, Mr. Kasai…

641
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,299
that will not get erase
what you have done.

642
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,972
In the end, I didn't get any money.

643
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,576
I returned the file,
so the bank didn't lose anything.

644
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,679
Isn't that enough?

645
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,716
I told you, it's all his fault.
I didn't do anything wrong.

646
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,755
With all due respect…

647
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:40,064
do you know how much President Sawada
suffered the last two days?

648
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,868
As a fellow business manager,
don't you understand that?

649
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,571
What'll happen to the company?

650
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,276
How will he support the employees,
if the company goes bankrupt?

651
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,547
President Sawada was worrying
about all that.

652
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:01,685
Your selfish behavior kept
an innocent person

653
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,221
awake all night with worry.

654
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:07,091
How do you not know that?

655
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,427
What you did is wrong.

656
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,497
What? Just shut up.

657
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,532
No, I won't!

658
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,203
There's more to this.

659
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,643
There is one more person

660
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,380
who is suffering a lot.

661
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,349
It's Mr. Matsuki.

662
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:42,927
Mr. Matsuki has been working hard
in the Finance Department because

663
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,729
he wants to help out small companies.

664
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,367
He is making an effort to support
Sawada Kengyou

665
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,437
because they are having
financial difficulties.

666
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:58,576
Sadly, he broke the rules of the bank
by doing that.

667
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,517
Because you stole the credit file,

668
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,853
Mr. Matsuki will have to
take responsibility.

669
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,691
He may lose his job
at the Finance Department.

670
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,264
Can you still say that you
haven't done anything bad?

671
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:30,407
Someone who works hard
shouldn't be penalized for it.

672
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:36,513
Those who are earnestly working hard
are not evaluated.

673
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,217
And those who cheat get the benefit.

674
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,154
That's definitely wrong!

675
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,319
Mr. Matsuki.

676
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,724
Everything was settled.

677
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,627
Thank you.

678
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,132
-I'm relieved.
-Mr. Matsuki.

679
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,169
President Sawada!

680
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,008
Thank you. Thank you very much.

681
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,278
I am sorry for causing you trouble.

682
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,681
Don't worry.

683
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,418
The file was returned safe and sound.

684
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,922
Please continue working with us.

685
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:04,902
Yes. I am more than happy to work
with you.

686
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,712
The additional loan to
Sawada Kengyou was approved.

687
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,113
Really?

688
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:21,418
That's good. Mr. Matsuki was working
so hard to prepare the proposal.

689
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,153
Right.

690
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:27,458
But he will be transferred, right?

691
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,795
Yes. To Okayama Branch.

692
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,735
I know someone has to take responsibility,

693
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:43,373
but isn't it wrong that Mr. Matsuki is
the only one that's being punished?

694
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,978
But there are people who see everything.

695
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:54,485
Mr. Kadota's numerous wrongdoings
came to light during the investigation,

696
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,888
so he received a strict disciplinary
action of one month's suspension.

697
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,526
We didn't report President Kasai
to the police,

698
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,496
but our bank cancelled all business
with his company.

699
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:10,901
He may not be able
to maintain his company anymore.

700
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,474
In short, the bank is not
completely rotten yet.

701
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,043
Yes.

702
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,147
I am so sorry.

703
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,617
Senior Executive Director Doujima
took the first move

704
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:30,854
to handle the police and the media.

705
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,755
I see.

706
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,927
He was one step ahead of us
regarding this case.

707
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,065
One step ahead of us?

708
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,302
Yes.

709
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,374
That's fine.

710
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,779
Tokyo Daiichi Bank was able to
maintain their pride.

711
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,616
It doesn't matter who took care of it.

712
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,487
Am I right?

713
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,322
Yes.

714
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:10,093
Excuse me.

715
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,100
Doujima!

716
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,973
-By the way, Hanasaki.
-Yes?

717
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,212
Matsuki said that he is leaving for
Okayama on the 10:50 a.m. bullet train.

718
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,147
Today?

719
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,052
-This is a gift for him. Pass it to him.
-Yes.

720
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,922
Let's go together, Mr. Soma.

721
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:44,928
I… I have a meeting with
the Director. Sorry.

722
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,363
Yes.

723
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,033
BRANCH INSPECTION

724
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,274
Mr. Matsuki.

725
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,409
Ms. Hanasaki.

726
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,580
This is from Mr. Soma.

727
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,951
Thank you very much.

728
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:15,626
I'll miss you when you go to Okayama.

729
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:23,033
I'm so thankful to you and Mr. Soma
for working hard to

730
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,102
find out the truth for me.

731
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,140
I couldn't help you much.

732
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,911
I am fine.

733
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:40,284
I'm surprised at how
I'm not feeling down at all.

734
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:47,824
I once said that it's the end
when you get a X-mark,

735
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,193
and that's how banks work.

736
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,063
But I was wrong.

737
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:59,736
Wherever I go, there are things I can do.

738
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,607
There will always be a way,
as long as I don't give up.

739
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:11,048
I learned that from you, Ms. Hanasaki.

740
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,717
Mr. Matsuki…

741
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,189
The bank will change
if there are more people like you.

742
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:24,628
I want to be like you. I honestly do.

743
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,300
I will come back with confidence.

744
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:36,807
When I do, will you go out with me to
have a nice meal? This time…

745
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,647
This time with just the two of us.

746
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,716
Yes.

747
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,455
See you.

748
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,292
-I'll do my best.
-Yes.

749
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,803
This time with just the two of us…

750
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,007
Could it be…

751
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,442
No way.

752
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,546
Mr. Matsuki moved away, huh?

753
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,317
The biggest fish is the one
that always gets away.

754
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,553
-That's big!
-That's enough, Dad.

755
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,826
I see. In the end, he left without
confessing his true feelings.

756
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,094
What?

757
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,797
Was there something going on?

758
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,299
Not at all…

759
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,338
Wait. What he said when he left…

760
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,173
Could it be…

761
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,576
When he asked me out for dinner
and the grilled meat…

762
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,744
That's right.

763
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,381
Why didn't you tell me?
You even came with us to eat grilled meat!

764
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,850
Because you asked me to come.

765
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,987
What should I do? What?

766
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,123
Mai, it's still not too late.
Go to Okayama.

767
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,225
-No way.
-Just go.

768
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,361
You can do it if you have the will.

769
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,929
Okayama?

770
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,297
Attacked?

771
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,032
Branch Manager was pushed down the stairs.

772
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,234
Stop insulting me, Branch Inspectors.

773
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,336
They had a fight concerning bankruptcy.

774
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,905
That was harassment.

775
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,640
-Do it over.
-What a stupid man.

776
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,809
The position you gained by doing that,

777
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,944
is not worth anything!
