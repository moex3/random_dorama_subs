00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,868
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,703
These are souvenirs for you guys.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,405
How nice!

4
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,740
Thanks.

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:11,544
Local sake, a lucky charm
and a phone strap for Dad.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,514
A power stone bracelet
and rice cakes for Mr. Soma.

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,484
Shrine tour with girlfriends
on a summer vacation?

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,121
I'd rather get a souvenir
from your honeymoon.

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,722
Come on, Dad.

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,026
This Enishi Shrine
is a popular power spot right now.

11
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,294
After a three-day visit,
I am fully charged.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,963
Power spot?

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,334
Walking around this sacred tree
will grant your wish.

14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,468
I did it three times.

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,736
What did you wish for?

16
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,738
I'm not telling you.

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,673
Not that I care to know.

18
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:47,347
If I remember correctly, Enishi Shrine
is famous for matchmaking, right?

19
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,283
Really?

20
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,852
I see.

21
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,889
My friend really wanted to go.

22
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:01,394
Don't worry. I understand that there are
times when you need God's help.

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,863
I am not desperate like you, Mr. Soma.

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,198
I'm not desperate.

25
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,436
Mai. This lucky charm
is for love and romance.

26
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,072
I thought it was for business.

27
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,442
-It's okay. I'll keep it.
-Sorry.

28
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,310
After all, I'm single too.

29
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,547
Dad will get all the benefits
from the sacred tree.

30
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,416
-That'll be nice.
-Come on.

31
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,986
KAWASAKI BRANCH

32
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,056
Get that contract with Sumikura Shoji.

33
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,024
Leave it to us.

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,493
Branch Manager, we'll be off.

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,295
-Okay.
-Good night.

36
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,966
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

37
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,936
We're in trouble…

38
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,072
We're in trouble.

39
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,241
What's wrong, Mr. Shibasaki?

40
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,776
Did they find something odd
during your check-up?

41
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,078
No.

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,248
Kawasaki's Branch Manager was attacked.

43
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,282
Attacked?

44
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,586
Someone shoved him off the stairs
on his way home from the branch.

45
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:34,888
And the culprit?

46
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,789
He ran away.

47
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,293
The Branch Manager broke his leg
and was hospitalized.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,561
That's scary.

49
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,429
Was it a random attack?

50
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,433
I can't say that for sure.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,404
That Branch Manager has always been
notorious for being domineering.

52
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,907
He doesn't have a good reputation.

53
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,709
He might have…

54
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,779
Incurred someone's hatred?

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,950
He filed a claim with the police.

56
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,153
But we don't want him to
make a big deal about this.

57
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,256
We must avoid involving the police,

58
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,127
or it will diminish the credibility
of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

59
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,328
You are right.

60
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,364
So please run over to Kawasaki
and assess the situation.

61
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,466
Run over? It's in Kawasaki.

62
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,868
Kawasaki!

63
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,470
That's nice. Let's go, Mr. Soma.

64
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,072
Why are you up for it?

65
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,910
Kawasaki Daishi is a famous shrine
and it's also a popular power spot.

66
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,645
Let's go pray at lunchtime.

67
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,781
She's going for the wrong reasons.

68
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,716
What are you doing, Mr. Soma? Hurry!

69
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,152
Good luck.

70
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,255
Okay.

71
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,324
KAWASAKI HOSPITAL

72
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,928
Branch Manager Mizuhara
has received many awards.

73
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,832
He will come back
to Headquarters in a few years.

74
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,669
He's successfully going up
the corporate ladder.

75
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,072
Ah, is he possibly in…

76
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,874
Yes. Shindo faction.

77
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,447
I pray that nothing will happen.

78
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,249
What are you praying for?

79
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,453
All right! I can feel luck on my side.

80
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,356
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

81
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,604
It's here.

82
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,906
What is this proposal document?

83
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,242
Do you think this will be approved?

84
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,844
You're so incompetent.

85
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,612
Do it again.

86
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,713
I am sorry.

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
I can't believe you're
the head of Finance. And you!

88
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,183
Yes.

89
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,086
As the Deputy Manager,
you should be training him!

90
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,254
I am sorry.

91
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,957
-Um…
-Who are you?

92
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:51,991
Excuse me.

93
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,561
You must be Kawasaki's
Branch Manager Mizuhara.

94
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,465
I am Soma from Branch Inspection
at headquarters.

95
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,366
I am Hanasaki.

96
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,567
What do you need?

97
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,937
I am sorry to hear about
what happened to you.

98
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,840
Can we ask for more details
about what happened?

99
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,442
There are no more details.

100
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,578
A man shoved me off the stairs
all of a sudden.

101
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,581
I heard you filed a claim with the police.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,851
Of course. I won't stay quiet about this.

103
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,088
But they just came for a brief moment
and left right away.

104
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,724
They didn't even try
to investigate the case,

105
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,093
even though an honest citizen got hurt.

106
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,365
Are you certain that you were shoved?

107
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,900
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,070
Do you think I just slipped?

109
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,741
No. I just heard that
there were no witnesses.

110
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,443
Stay quiet, Branch Inspection.

111
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,916
All you have to do is solve
tiny problems occurring at the branches.

112
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,618
With all due respect…

113
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,790
Do you have any ideas about
who it might be?

114
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,592
Of course not.

115
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,662
Either way, this doesn't concern you.

116
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,863
Just leave.

117
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,533
I understand. Thank you for your time.

118
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,973
Keep an eye on our staff and make sure
they don't slack off while I'm away.

119
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,041
I will.

120
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,009
They're good at slacking off.

121
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,279
-Do you understand?
-Yes, I do.

122
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,385
What's wrong with that arrogant
Branch Manager? He gets me so mad!

123
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,652
Hanasaki! Look back.

124
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,522
I am sorry.

125
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,893
We are also sorry for causing such a scene
in front of you.

126
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,465
I'm sure everyone working with him
is having a hard time.

127
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,501
Don't talk about unnecessary things.

128
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,506
I heard that Mr. Mizuhara came to
this post a year ago.

129
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,407
Yes.

130
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:51,644
Do you think he incurred someone's hatred
during that time?

131
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,282
As you saw earlier, he has
a difficult personality. So he's had

132
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,050
trouble with many people.

133
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,521
He has had many problems
concerning loans, too.

134
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,625
You were with Mr. Mizuhara last night,
until just before the incident.

135
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,227
Did you see anything strange?

136
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,164
I don't think so.

137
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,065
I didn't notice anything either.

138
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,033
I see.

139
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,404
May I see the list of customers that
went bankrupt in the last year and a half?

140
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,672
Okay.

141
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,209
-Mizuhara was hospitalized?
-Yes.

142
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,647
Someone shoved him off the stairs
on his way home.

143
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,083
We live in dangerous times.

144
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,154
They haven't made it clear
whether it's a criminal case or not.

145
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,356
That's all from me.

146
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,761
He's always had lots of enemies.

147
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,962
Pardon?

148
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,831
No. Nothing.

149
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:00,213
It's true that he cuts off
all companies that aren't performing well.

150
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,550
It's understandable that these companies
would hold a grudge against him.

151
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,956
It all makes sense when you think
about his personality.

152
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,226
He threw the proposal documents
at his subordinates

153
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,027
and called them incompetent.

154
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,633
I feel so sorry for the people
who have to work under him.

155
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,468
I agree.

156
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:27,673
In that sense, I am so lucky to have you
as my boss, Mr. Soma.

157
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,911
You're sloppy and not ambitious,

158
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,448
and all I have to do is bear
your cheesy jokes sometimes.

159
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,649
I have no complaints.

160
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,484
That's not a compliment.

161
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,887
-Yes, it is.
-How?

162
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:47,326
Anyway, we can't say for certain
if Mr. Mizuhara was attacked or not.

163
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,929
Right.

164
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,933
MUSASHIKOSUGI BRANCH

165
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,671
BRANCH MANAGER RYOJI KANEDA

166
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,617
Who is it?

167
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,292
Good morning, Dad.

168
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,762
Mai, your bank is in big trouble.

169
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,132
What do you mean?
You sound like Mr. Shibasaki.

170
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,702
A Branch Manager was attacked last night.

171
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,837
TWO BRANCH MANAGERS ATTACKED
ONE AFTER THE OTHER

172
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,406
Musashikosugi Branch?

173
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,709
It says that he was hit by a pole.

174
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,411
How scary.

175
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,451
<i>-This is Hanasaki.</i>
-Did you check the newspaper?

176
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,554
This can't be a coincidence.

177
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,459
It seems that
they purposely attacked those two people.

178
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,028
<i>Luckily, he wasn't seriously injured.</i>

179
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,199
Hanasaki, let's go see
Musashikosugi's Branch Manager.

180
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,334
Okay.

181
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,706
I was surprised
because he attacked me all of a sudden.

182
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,008
I knew what had happened to Mr. Mizuhara,

183
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,610
but I can't believe this.

184
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,081
Do you have any idea
about who the criminal might be?

185
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,882
None at all.

186
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,354
I can't believe
I was involved in such a thing.

187
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,324
Do you know Mr. Mizuhara
from the Kawasaki branch?

188
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:30,563
I worked with him at the Toranomon Branch
eight years ago.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,002
What were your job titles at the time?

190
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,304
Mr. Mizuhara was
the Section Chief of Finance,

191
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,505
and I was Deputy Manager.

192
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,073
Were there any problems with

193
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,509
loans when you were
at the Toranomon branch?

194
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,811
I don't remember.

195
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,914
There's always problems everywhere.

196
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,551
There are countless numbers
of customers who complain.

197
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,592
The two who were attacked
had something in common.

198
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,261
Yes, they are both jerks.

199
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,696
Stop it.

200
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,966
Toranomon Branch.

201
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,336
Did they incur someone's hatred there?

202
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,804
It is possible.

203
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,008
It could be that this case started
at the Toranomon Branch.

204
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,677
Let's go.

205
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,422
This is Mizuhara.

206
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,258
<i>Branch Inspection just came to see me.</i>

207
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,593
They came to see me yesterday.

208
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,529
Ignore them. They are useless.

209
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:41,133
<i>Did you see the culprit's face?</i>

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,102
No, it was too dark.

211
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,905
It could be the same guy that attacked me.

212
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,608
<i>But… why did he attack us?</i>

213
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,910
How would I know?

214
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:56,515
Anyway, let me know if you find out
anything about the culprit. Okay?

215
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,616
Yes, I will.

216
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,724
Now Kaneda was attacked?

217
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,858
Yes.

218
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,360
It's troubling.

219
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,832
Especially since you've been
looking favorably upon those two.

220
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,571
Please be careful, just in case.

221
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,906
Why do I have to be careful?

222
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,746
Just in case. I am sorry.

223
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,521
TORANOMON BRANCH

224
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,658
Unfortunately, I don't know much about
what happened seven or eight years ago.

225
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,593
BRANCH MANAGER HISAYUKI HENMI

226
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,596
It hasn't been long since I came here.

227
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,264
I understand.

228
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,701
I am sorry that I couldn't be of any help…

229
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,102
Well…

230
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,473
There is a lady who has been working
in the Finance Department since then.

231
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,810
She is an experienced member
of the department.

232
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,846
I would like to see her.

233
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,517
I was so shocked.

234
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,119
After all, they were attacked in a row.

235
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,489
Everyone is talking about it.

236
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,459
Can you tell us about those two bankers?

237
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,761
Let me see.

238
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,131
Mr. Mizuhara is the stereotypical
alpha male.

239
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,001
He spoiled those who he liked,

240
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,738
but he was super harsh on those
who showed even a hint of defiance.

241
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,706
No wonder he has many enemies.

242
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,476
-I see.
-What about Mr. Kaneda?

243
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,878
He is Mr. Mizuhara's follower.

244
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,047
He's like a sidekick.

245
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,817
He is a timid man
who can't say no to his boss.

246
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,952
I see.

247
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,855
They are the kind of men
you want to talk back to.

248
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,456
Shut up.

249
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,961
Did they have any problems
with the customers?

250
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm sure they had many problems.

251
00:13:54,533 --> 00:14:00,039
But I think the biggest problem
they had was…

252
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,707
Yes?

253
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:03,976
Wait a second.

254
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,448
Here.

255
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,416
OKAMURA STEEL

256
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,718
This is a file from seven years ago.

257
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,720
You still have this?

258
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,656
The Branch Manager at that time
was very strict.

259
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,658
We have all the files saved here.

260
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,261
Okamura Steel?

261
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,664
This company went bankrupt
seven years ago.

262
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,134
The president came to
the Finance Department and got violent.

263
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,603
Violent?

264
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,138
He barged in and punched
Mr. Mizuhara who was

265
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,574
the Section Chief
of the Finance Department.

266
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,612
It's all because of you.

267
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,515
We had to call the police
and it was a big mess.

268
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,985
Why did he do that?

269
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,188
I don't know much,

270
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,225
but people said that there was
a problem before the bankruptcy.

271
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,029
Do you know how the President
is doing now?

272
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,998
I don't know.

273
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,134
We have had no business with him
since then.

274
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:09,541
Oh no… Is President Okamura the one
that attacked Mr. Mizuhara?

275
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,077
No. We don't know yet.

276
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,383
How scary.

277
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,789
Is there anything else
that you can think of?

278
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,929
That's the only thing that left
an impression on me.

279
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,966
There were lots
of smaller problems, though.

280
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,170
Okay. Thank you for your time.

281
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,072
It was very useful information.

282
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,542
Really? That's good.

283
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,810
Excuse me.

284
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,781
Um…

285
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,950
Yes?

286
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,221
I hope they catch the criminal soon.

287
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,223
Yes.

288
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:14,273
Mr. Mizuhara didn't mention anything
about the physical attack.

289
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,445
We have to ask him again
about Okamura Steel.

290
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,215
Do we have to see him again?

291
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,250
I really don't like him.

292
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,887
Don't say unnecessary things,
whether you like him or not.

293
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,156
Whatever he says, just smile.

294
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,392
I'll try.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,961
Okamura Steel?

296
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,998
The police just asked me the same thing.

297
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,899
The police?

298
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,269
It seems like they suspect Okamura.

299
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,306
What do you think, Mr. Mizuhara?

300
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,676
If he's the culprit, then this is insane.

301
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,645
I heard you had a dispute with Okamura

302
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,148
at the Toranomon Branch
over the bankruptcy issue.

303
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,487
We heard that you were
struck by President Okamura.

304
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,255
Who said that?

305
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,456
Um, well…

306
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,027
He resented me
because his business didn't work out.

307
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,996
First of all, that was Isobe's client.

308
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,399
Why is he holding a grudge against me?

309
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,967
Sorry.

310
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,670
So the person in charge of Okamura Steel
was someone named Isobe?

311
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,409
I was the Section Chief
of the Finance Department

312
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,344
and Kaneda was previously in charge.

313
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,678
It's not our fault.

314
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,582
Do you know which branch
Mr. Isobe is working at now?

315
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,253
He could be attacked next.

316
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,855
I don't know.

317
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,125
He was transferred somewhere
because of Okamura Steel.

318
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,127
Ask HR.

319
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,497
His name is Mr. Takahiko Isobe.

320
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,266
Yes.

321
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,068
Do you know which branch…

322
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,171
He quit?

323
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,175
Two months ago… Yes…

324
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,312
Can you give me his contact number?

325
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,750
I am Soma from the Branch Inspection.

326
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,318
I am Hanasaki.

327
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,020
I am Isobe.

328
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:08,921
FORMER EMPLOYEE

329
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,989
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

330
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,357
It's okay.

331
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,595
I wanted to ask you about the incident
regarding our employees

332
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,831
who were attacked.

333
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,500
I read about it in the newspaper.

334
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,369
Mr. Mizuhara from the Kawasaki Branch

335
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,707
and Mr. Kaneda from
Musashikosugi Branch. Do you know them?

336
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,412
I worked with them
at the Toranomon Branch.

337
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,081
The police think that

338
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:40,152
Okamura Steel has something
to do with this case.

339
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,956
You were in charge of that company, right?

340
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,958
Yes.

341
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,762
Would you tell us in detail
about the company's bankruptcy?

342
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,266
It's very simple.

343
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,537
The company couldn't receive the loan.

344
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,708
Okamura Steel was performing badly
at that time.

345
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,377
They applied for the additional loan.

346
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,315
Please! Tokyo Daiichi Bank
is my last hope.

347
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,986
If you lend me 50 million yen,
I can get back into shape.

348
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,589
Okay.

349
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,659
Let me submit the application immediately.

350
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:26,532
I worked hard on the proposal document
because I wanted to help Mr. Okamura.

351
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:31,336
But by the time I took over the case
from Kaneda,

352
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,107
Okamura Steel was experiencing
a significant drop in performance.

353
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,712
This company has been in the red
for three years in a row.

354
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,650
They may go bankrupt if we don't
offer them a loan this time.

355
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:49,821
Did you think that you can get an approval
with what you've presented here?

356
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,791
Okay. I'll rewrite it.

357
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,131
He ordered me to rewrite
the proposal over and over again.

358
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,600
No.

359
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,269
RETURN

360
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,671
Do it again.

361
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,076
RETURN

362
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,179
The loan isn't approved yet?

363
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,515
The Chief hasn't approved it yet.

364
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,950
Please give me some time.

365
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,454
I have no time.

366
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,524
My company will be finished
if I can't get it

367
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,059
by the day after tomorrow.

368
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:35,067
In the end, the settlement day came
before the approval for the loan.

369
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,503
Denied? Why?

370
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,439
Why?

371
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:44,209
The Manager yelled at me
for submitting this at the last moment.

372
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,812
But it was because of you…

373
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,047
Me? Is it my fault?

374
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,716
The time was up.

375
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:57,322
President Okamura got very upset
and came yelling at us.

376
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,125
This is all because of you.

377
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,298
Please stop it, Mr. Okamura.

378
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,968
-Shut up!
-Mr. Okamura!

379
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,237
That's terrible.

380
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,539
You couldn't submit it in time

381
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,910
because Section Chief Mizuhara made you
rewrite it so many times.

382
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,583
No, it was because I wasn't good enough.

383
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,855
I felt so sorry for President Okamura.

384
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,861
How is President Okamura doing?

385
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,931
The police are looking for him
as a potential suspect.

386
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,436
Mr. Isobe, you were also
involved at that time.

387
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,071
Please be careful.

388
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,740
I'll be okay.

389
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,747
I have nothing to do with the bank now.

390
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,819
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

391
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,189
Do you think he's really the culprit?

392
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,391
He does have a motive.

393
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,728
But why do this now?

394
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:14,266
I don't know. Maybe the opportunity arose.

395
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:19,538
If he had received the loan
seven years ago,

396
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,973
would the company have survived?

397
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,144
No one knows the answer to that.

398
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,251
Banks can make people happy,

399
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,253
but they make them unhappy too.

400
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,559
But everything won't work out
just because of a loan.

401
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,595
Even if he had gotten it,
he still could have failed.

402
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,232
Even if bankruptcy was postponed
for a moment,

403
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,437
it's hard to determine if that
was best for the company.

404
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,707
I know, but…

405
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,411
But from the customer's point of view,
they must think that

406
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:04,349
things would have been better
if only the bank had approved the loan.

407
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,124
We're in trouble…

408
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,326
That was delicious.

409
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,162
Today's daily lunch was very--

410
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,331
We're in trouble!

411
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,302
-I just had…
-Have some tea. This is a new one.

412
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,670
The police called.

413
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,608
They found the President of Okamura Steel.

414
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,411
Where is he?

415
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,046
He is in Shanghai.

416
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,481
Shanghai?

417
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,352
He started a business there
and has not come back since then.

418
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,887
Then…

419
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,688
He has an alibi.

420
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,958
President Okamura is not the culprit.

421
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,495
Then who attacked Mr. Mizuhara?

422
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,300
Branch Inspection.

423
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,302
This is the front desk.

424
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,540
Ms. Tagawa
from the Toranomon Branch is here.

425
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,777
What's the matter?

426
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:10,115
I couldn't tell you something yesterday.

427
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,583
What is it?

428
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,087
It was about the man
who was in charge of Okamura Steel.

429
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,257
-Mr. Isobe?
-Do you know him?

430
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,227
We met and talked to him.

431
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,429
How is he doing? Was he okay?

432
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,065
I heard that he was really depressed.

433
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,336
He seemed to be a little tired.

434
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,205
No wonder…

435
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:39,311
Someone with a gentle heart is bound
to get hurt in a place like a bank.

436
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,648
Were you close to Mr. Isobe?

437
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,655
Mr. Mizuhara didn't like us.

438
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,190
So we complained together.

439
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:57,095
I heard that he was transferred
because of Okamura Steel.

440
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,632
Is it true?

441
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,903
I am sorry.

442
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,541
Yesterday, I told you that
I didn't know, but…

443
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,111
Mr. Isobe is not the one
who should be blamed.

444
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,081
What do you mean?

445
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:17,916
It was bullying.

446
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,085
Bullying?

447
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,822
Mr. Mizuhara was not planning to
offer the loan from the beginning.

448
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:30,228
Mr. Mizuhara was taking good care
of Mr. Kaneda because he followed him,

449
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,696
but he hated Mr. Isobe.

450
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:39,471
It was because Mr. Isobe opposed
Mr. Mizuhara's way of doing things.

451
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,775
Are you trying to say that I am wrong?

452
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,610
Yes.

453
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:51,149
As you know, he can't stand
people who won't flatter him.

454
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,084
So he really got upset.

455
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,186
Who do you think you are talking to?

456
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,991
That's when Mr. Mizuhara started
blatantly bullying him.

457
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,465
How long have you been working in Finance?

458
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,237
Ask the new employee
how to write a proposal document.

459
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,046
Let's go out for drinks tonight.

460
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,047
Yes.

461
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,485
You stay until you finish.

462
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,090
Let's go.

463
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,959
-Yes.
-Where do you want to go?

464
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,394
-How about Akasaka?
-You like Akasaka.

465
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,400
I can't believe it.

466
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,736
Okamura Steel was the final straw.

467
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,006
Mr. Mizuhara wanted
to cut off Okamura Steel

468
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,408
because it was performing badly.

469
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,412
So he made Mr. Isobe take over
Okamura Steel from Mr. Kaneda

470
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,481
and nitpicked his proposal document.

471
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,352
Do you really want to save this company?

472
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,386
Yes.

473
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,688
Then what is this?

474
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,890
Is it that bad?

475
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,759
Please be more concrete…

476
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,495
Use your brain to find that out.

477
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,497
Section Chief.

478
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,001
Okamoto Steel definitely needs this loan.

479
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,503
If we're going to deny them, do it now

480
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,438
so that they have other options.

481
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,208
Shut up and rewrite it!

482
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:29,214
In the end, he couldn't submit the
proposal document in time to get the loan,

483
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,082
and Okamura Steel went bankrupt.

484
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,753
Mr. Isobe took the responsibility
and was transferred.

485
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,189
That's horrible.

486
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,791
I agree.

487
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:45,997
He knew that Mr. Okamoto would
be short of cash without the loan.

488
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,200
This was all
because he didn't like Mr. Isobe.

489
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,838
Mr. Isobe was excellent
in the Finance Department, but he was

490
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,707
pushed off the promotional ladder

491
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,610
and was transferred to many branches.

492
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:00,945
Um…

493
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:06,985
Do you think Mr. Isobe
is the culprit behind this case?

494
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,161
If so, I want you to persuade him
to turn himself in.

495
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,299
Back then, everyone in
the Finance Department including myself,

496
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,135
wanted to save Mr. Isobe by any means.

497
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,405
Although we knew the truth,

498
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,042
we couldn't say a word
because we were afraid of Mr. Mizuhara.

499
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,779
I have been regretting it all this time.

500
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,950
I beg you…

501
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,757
I understand.

502
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,902
I don't want to believe
that Mr. Isobe did it.

503
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,807
Maybe this is the reason why

504
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,044
Mr. Isobe said that he'll be okay.

505
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,646
I'll be okay.

506
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,816
Because he's the culprit.

507
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,203
He's not answering.

508
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,775
<i>Yes.</i>

509
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,844
<i>Hello, Mr. Isobe?</i>

510
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,451
Hello, Mr. Isobe?

511
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,554
This is Soma from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

512
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,291
<i>I heard from Ms. Tagawa that</i>
<i>you experienced a difficult time</i>

513
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,727
<i>at the Toranomon Branch seven years ago.</i>

514
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,562
<i>Please tell me.</i>

515
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,133
<i>Did you attack</i>
<i>Mr. Mizuhara and Mr. Kaneda?</i>

516
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,235
<i>Mr. Isobe…</i>

517
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:13,077
I worked for the bank for 20 years,
but what was it all for?

518
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,551
<i>I wanted to start over in a new place</i>

519
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,555
when I was transferred to
a local branch from Toranomon.

520
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,294
But I soon found out that I was naïve.

521
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,363
Mr. Isobe, please.

522
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,100
<i>Wherever I went,</i>
<i>there were rumors that I was</i>

523
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:41,139
<i>difficult to handle,</i>
<i>because I had an X-mark on my career.</i>

524
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,742
<i>I felt humiliated,</i>

525
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,079
<i>but I tried to keep working</i>
<i>to take care of my family.</i>

526
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:50,915
<i>However…</i>

527
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,687
<i>I reached my limit.</i>

528
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:04,796
I thought that I would be free
from everything if I quit my job.

529
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,333
My wife was worrying about my health,

530
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,202
and I thought I did enough.

531
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:18,543
<i>But I was shocked</i>
<i>after I left the company.</i>

532
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,714
After I stopped wearing my suit
and carrying my business cards,

533
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,285
I had nothing to prove
that I once worked for a bank.

534
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,790
<i>I had nothing that could prove</i>
<i>myself as a former banker.</i>

535
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:40,498
<i>The moment I quit the bank,</i>
<i>I lost everything.</i>

536
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,670
<i>I came to that realization.</i>

537
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,041
<i>That's when I happened to walk in front</i>
<i>of the Kawasaki Branch.</i>

538
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,110
Let me carry your bag.

539
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,646
-Hurry up and get a taxi.
-Yes.

540
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,849
-Where are you going tonight?
-Akasaka.

541
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,184
<i>I couldn't forgive him.</i>

542
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:06,491
<i>He didn't get hurt at all.</i>

543
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,229
<i>At that moment,</i>

544
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:18,703
<i>I decided to remind them</i>
<i>of what they'd done to ruin my life.</i>

545
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,807
<i>I would take my revenge…</i>

546
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:23,875
Who is it?

547
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,944
<i>…on those who made me a scapegoat.</i>

548
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,480
Mr. Isobe.

549
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:35,453
Please turn yourself in.

550
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,024
<i>You are not an employee</i>
<i>of the Tokyo Daiichi Bank.</i>

551
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,327
<i>You are free.</i>

552
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,464
You don't have to deal with
the humiliation from the past.

553
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,200
<i>Please think of the future,</i>

554
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,804
for the sake of your family.

555
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,173
I am not done yet.

556
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,240
Mr. Isobe.

557
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,543
<i>There is one more person</i>
<i>that I can't forgive.</i>

558
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,181
Someone who knew everything
but turned a blind eye.

559
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,249
Who is it?

560
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,518
Hello?

561
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,654
Hello?

562
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,665
Who is the person that turned a blind eye?

563
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,035
Mr. Mizuhara's boss…
So the Branch Manager?

564
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,170
Who was it?

565
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,006
Let me check.

566
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,908
TORANOMON BRANCH

567
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,949
BRANCH MANAGER TSUYOSHI SHINDO

568
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,218
Executive Director Shindo.

569
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,695
It was Executive Director Shindo.

570
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,097
Mr. Soma…

571
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,165
Let's go.

572
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:04,509
Yes.

573
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,245
Excuse me.

574
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,748
It's time for
the finance committee meeting.

575
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,983
Okay.

576
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,122
Mr. Shindo.

577
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,360
Who is it?

578
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,464
It was you.

579
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,152
Let me go.

580
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,290
Stop it, Mr. Isobe!

581
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,793
Let me go!

582
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,961
Mr. Isobe.

583
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,130
Please stop it.

584
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,902
Are you all right?

585
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,656
Stupid man.

586
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,233
Come on.

587
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,587
BRANCH INSPECTION

588
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,323
How was it?

589
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,828
He is being questioned
at the police station.

590
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,067
So everything is solved now?

591
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,771
I guess so.

592
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:52,176
What Mr. Isobe has done is not acceptable.

593
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,882
But I think the one
that drives an innocent person

594
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,520
into committing a crime,
is guilty of a more serious offense.

595
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,756
Mr. Isobe said that

596
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:11,662
Mr. Mizuhara and the rest
had ruined his life.

597
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:20,671
What kind of place is a bank,
where those people get promoted?

598
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,410
You are right.

599
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,512
Can't we do anything?

600
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,084
We are not the police.

601
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:34,919
But…

602
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:39,690
But there are things that only we can do.

603
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,463
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,269
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK TORANOMON BRANCH

605
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,974
All right… Yes?

606
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,076
Excuse me.

607
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,513
Nice to see you again.

608
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,482
What happened?

609
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,784
I want to ask you for a favor.

610
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,325
Here it is.

611
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,535
TORANOMON BRANCH FINANCE DOCUMENT

612
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,905
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

613
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,342
You're up and about now?

614
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,546
I can't take any more time off
just because of this.

615
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,416
I can't rely on the Deputy Manager either.

616
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,452
If he does a poor job,
I will have to be responsible.

617
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,589
But I can't believe I had to
experience that.

618
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,125
I heard that you did too.

619
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,126
Yeah.

620
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,263
HR should be blamed for keeping that

621
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,732
criminal at our bank all this time.

622
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,902
I want him to stay in prison
for several years.

623
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,505
Yes.

624
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,307
Excuse me.

625
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,178
You two again?

626
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,279
Do you need anything?

627
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,516
-I heard that Mr. Mizuhara is here.
-What?

628
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,618
Mr. Shindo should hear this too.

629
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,123
You're being rude. Please leave.

630
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,327
Yes. This is not a place for you to visit.

631
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,696
I'll listen.

632
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:31,001
This case goes all the way to
the Toranomon Branch seven years ago.

633
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,204
Mr. Mizuhara,

634
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,109
you delayed Okamura Steel's
loan application on purpose, right?

635
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,913
What?

636
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,281
Please answer me.

637
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:48,619
I don't know. Why would I do such a thing?

638
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,623
It was to demean Mr. Isobe,
who was in charge of it.

639
00:39:55,459 --> 00:40:00,831
You disliked Mr. Isobe because
he had opposed you.

640
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,600
Okamura Steel's

641
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:08,572
performance was declining, so you put
Mr. Isobe in charge of it, and made it

642
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,107
go bankrupt.

643
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,781
I didn't do that.

644
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,250
Just as you planned,

645
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,020
Mr. Isobe took responsibility
and was transferred.

646
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,023
Give me a break! You made up everything.

647
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,959
You have no evidence of that.

648
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,029
I have evidence here.

649
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:40,504
These are the proposal documents
you ordered Mr. Isobe to rewrite.

650
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,840
Why do you have those?

651
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,848
I found it.

652
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:55,786
They were in the storage room
at the Toranomon branch.

653
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,589
We were able to find it
because Mr. Shindo,

654
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:04,628
the Branch Manager at that time,
was very strict with managing documents.

655
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:10,968
From July 21st to August 28th,
Mr. Isobe rewrote the documents

656
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,103
a total of 17 times.

657
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:19,844
The 17th document was submitted
two days before the settlement day.

658
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,448
"A loan denial should be
determined quickly."

659
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,885
That is the rule regarding loans.

660
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:30,588
Mr. Mizuhara.

661
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,160
What you did was clearly against
the principle of faith and trust.

662
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,634
Executive Director Shindo.
Please believe me.

663
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,570
I never did such a thing.

664
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,246
I can't submit an application
that's brought in at the last minute.

665
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,481
Aren't you training your men?

666
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,517
I am sorry.

667
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:03,587
I told Isobe so many times.
He is such a problem.

668
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,256
I won't approve this.

669
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,091
Is this company okay?

670
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,393
This company is performing poorly.

671
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,694
We can't help it.

672
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,798
Anyway, this is all Isobe's doing.

673
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,868
I will make him take responsibility.

674
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,643
What are you guys trying to do?

675
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,513
Listen, I am a victim.

676
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,482
Isobe committed a crime.

677
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,286
Are you going to overlook
what he did to Kaneda and me?

678
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,023
With all due respect…

679
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,992
what Mr. Isobe did is not acceptable.

680
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:48,799
But you're the one
who made him into a criminal.

681
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,370
Shut up. What do you know about me?

682
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,672
I don't know.

683
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,876
I don't understand someone
who demeans their subordinates just to

684
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,711
protect his stupid pride.

685
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,179
What?

686
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,451
What you have done
may not be against the law.

687
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,253
There is no record

688
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,490
of you bullying Mr. Isobe or kicking him
out of the branch, and it won't

689
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,292
mark your career, either.

690
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,864
In fact, you didn't even realize that
you had incurred such hatred.

691
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:27,771
It is wrong for the life of a man
with a family and future to be ruined by

692
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,106
a man like you.

693
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,874
-Shut up!
-No, I won't!

694
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,511
You used dirty tricks
and cornered your subordinate.

695
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,448
Even worse, you let a company go bankrupt.

696
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,319
The position you got by doing that
holds no worth!

697
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,295
Mr. Mizuhara, we've already
reported everything to HR.

698
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:56,634
HR said they will interview
all related parties to investigate this.

699
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,638
I'm sure they will be calling you too.

700
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,277
Mr. Shindo, help me.

701
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,914
Please… Executive Director Shindo!

702
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:31,068
Executive Director Shindo.
May I ask you a question?

703
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,504
Yes.

704
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,007
You were the Toranomon Branch Manager
at the time.

705
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,944
Did you really think that

706
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,615
Mr. Isobe was responsible
for Okamura Steel's bankruptcy?

707
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,754
Or did you turn a blind eye knowing that
it was planned

708
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,856
by Mr. Mizuhara?

709
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,493
Ms. Hanasaki, restrain yourself.

710
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,631
That was an important time for you
as a Branch Manager.

711
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,835
If there was a rumor about
bullying at your branch,

712
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,705
your career would suffer.

713
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,273
That's why…

714
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,141
I don't have to answer that.

715
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,746
But I can say one thing.

716
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:21,785
In order to protect and promote
the bank as an organization,

717
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,988
I can't help everybody.

718
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,763
Even if it ruins the life of a person?

719
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:40,537
If you didn't overlook
what Mr. Mizuhara did,

720
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:46,143
don't you think that
Mr. Isobe would still be working here?

721
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,781
Maybe this sad case

722
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,951
wouldn't have occurred.

723
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,557
I have been trying to maintain

724
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:07,297
the honor of the Tokyo Daiichi Bank
at all times.

725
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:16,340
I have avoided hurting the name
of our bank by all means.

726
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,443
That's all.

727
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,680
Excuse me.

728
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,976
A FEW DAYS LATER

729
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,179
Did they reach a settlement?

730
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:00,150
Both Mr. Mizuhara and Mr. Kaneda
dropped their charges.

731
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,007
Making a big deal out of this

732
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,043
will hurt the reputation of the bank.

733
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,547
The media died down too, so it's all done.

734
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,751
Today's inspection is the Ueno Branch.

735
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,688
Four administrative mistakes. Good luck.

736
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:39,756
Okay.

737
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,829
I can't be happy about the way this ended.

738
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:51,735
It seems that everything was done
to protect the reputation of the bank.

739
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,804
Maybe.

740
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,108
But that turned out to be
favorable for Mr. Isobe.

741
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,245
I know, but…

742
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,248
Kodama.

743
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,922
I wanted to inform you about this.

744
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,727
Mr. Mizuhara was demoted

745
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,229
and got dispatched to
an affiliate company.

746
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,035
Mr. Kaneda will receive
an official warning for having a part in

747
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,803
Mr. Mizuhara's misconduct.

748
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,406
I see.

749
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,611
I don't care what you think,

750
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,048
but let me tell you one thing.

751
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,085
It was Executive Director Shindo

752
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,590
who persuaded them to drop the charges.

753
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,429
He introduced Isobe
to an attorney he knows.

754
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,335
It is not only to protect
the name of our bank.

755
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,372
But he is also thinking
about Isobe's future.

756
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,709
He is that kind of a person.

757
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,681
That's all.

758
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,622
Do you think that's true?

759
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:20,991
I don't know.

760
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,197
But it's not bad
to believe in him sometimes.

761
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,167
Yes.

762
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,322
Cheers!

763
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,195
Ms. Tagawa, thank you very much
for your cooperation.

764
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:02,032
-Thank you.
-No, I want to thank you instead.

765
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,802
Mr. Isobe called to thank me today.

766
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,772
Now I can finally let go of my guilt.

767
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,341
-That's good.
-Yes.

768
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,747
This is delicious.

769
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,884
Master, this carpaccio is wonderful.

770
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,354
-Master?
-Really? Thank you.

771
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,791
The flounder is a little salty,
so it goes well with cold sake.

772
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,860
Can you tell?

773
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:34,598
This also goes well with
Kabosu or wasabi soy sauce.

774
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,933
Really? Will you give me the recipe?

775
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,902
Sure. Please come this way.

776
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:44,741
A man who can whip up these
dishes is so cool.

777
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,843
I am happy.

778
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,347
Hey, they look good together.

779
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
Right.

780
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,851
Is it that lucky charm you gave him?

781
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,487
The love charm!

782
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,556
I bought the same one too!

783
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,526
You said you didn't need any lucky charm.

784
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,929
It might work for me too.

785
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,230
Ten million?

786
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,633
We'll be in big trouble
if we can't find it.

787
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,734
I don't know.

788
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,736
There must be a clue here.

789
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,804
Time's up.

790
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,106
-Mr. Hotta?
-I will take responsibility.

791
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,041
A banker's job is not that simple.

792
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,944
That's wrong.
