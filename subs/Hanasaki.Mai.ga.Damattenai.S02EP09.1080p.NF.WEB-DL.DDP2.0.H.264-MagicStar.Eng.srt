1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,105
KANDA BRANCH

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,208
Yes! Our work is done for the day.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,945
SPECIAL LUNCH SET / TEMPURA

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,614
There are so many nice restaurants.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,283
The chicken hot pot looked delicious too.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,387
I wish we came here during lunchtime.

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,890
Tempura, western style dishes, and… what?

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,329
No, Kanda is famous for soba.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,598
Hey, what are you doing? Hanasaki?

10
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,966
Don't call my name.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,004
That was so close.

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,106
Who is that man? Your friend?

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,710
I don't know if I'd
call him my friend, but…

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,545
Your ex-boyfriend?

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,981
Yes. I told you about him before.

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,316
The civil servant two years older than you

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,352
who you broke up with last May.

18
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,120
How do you remember all that?

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:01:00,693
I didn't know that you're the type that
hides when you run into your ex.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,296
Yes, of course. It's uncomfortable.

21
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,334
No, you should be able to say hi
if you ended things in a nice way.

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,272
Oh? I remember you acting weird
when you met your ex-wife.

23
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,544
Okay, you can tell me all about your

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,513
heartbreak today over a nice drink.

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,716
No, thank you.
I have an appointment tonight.

26
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,389
What are you looking for?

27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,757
Nothing…

28
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,628
That was close.

29
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,397
What are you doing?

30
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,434
It's all your fault
for not keeping things organized.

31
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,869
I know. Sorry.

32
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,210
Free 30-minute shoulder massage
for the working girl.

33
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,544
I was looking for this.

34
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm glad you're still here.

35
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,715
Mr. Shibasaki.

36
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,285
I want you to go to
the Mitaka Branch right now.

37
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,355
Now? But this expires today…

38
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,190
What happened at the Mitaka Branch?

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,226
I just had a call.

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,563
They lost a promissory note
from a customer.

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:11,898
-What?
-What?

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,300
They are searching for it right now.

43
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,569
A promissory note has value.

44
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,938
It's the same as losing cash.

45
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:24,344
Yeah. But a promissory note
is a piece of paper like this, right?

46
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,613
It'll be so difficult to find.

47
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:31,217
It's not that simple. If it's really gone,
it is going to be a big problem.

48
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,554
It will harm not only the branch
but the entire bank.

49
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,992
That's why headquarters want you
to go and investigate it.

50
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,861
And please help them find
the promissory note, too.

51
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,829
Okay.

52
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,200
How much was that promissory note for?

53
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,602
Ten million yen.

54
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,704
Ten million yen?

55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:53,973
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

56
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,223
MITAKA BRANCH

57
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,963
All hands on deck, huh?

58
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,432
You can't find it yet?

59
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,967
No.

60
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,101
BRANCH MANAGER HAJIME NOGUCHI

61
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,338
It should be somewhere.

62
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,841
Listen. We must find it no matter what.

63
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,842
Yes, sir.

64
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,843
Excuse me…

65
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,646
You are?

66
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,516
I am Soma from Branch Inspection
at headquarters.

67
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,884
I am Hanasaki.

68
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,786
I see.

69
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,055
I am Noguchi, the Branch Manager.

70
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,291
I only called because I knew
I had to report it.

71
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,329
But I didn't need
Branch Inspection to come.

72
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,331
I understand.

73
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,467
It is our job to understand
the situation of the branches.

74
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:59,005
I was also told to help you
find the promissory note.

75
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:05,044
It's not something Branch Inspection
will be able to find that easily.

76
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,452
Please don't disturb us.

77
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,620
Yes.

78
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,687
Branch Manager.

79
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,459
I went to Kawabata Kikai
and told them that we lost it.

80
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,195
-How was it?
-The President was very upset.

81
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,564
I can imagine that.

82
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,532
I am sorry.

83
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,235
Let me introduce them.

84
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,705
They are from Branch Inspection
at headquarters.

85
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,308
I am Koizumi, Chief of Finance.

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,276
I am Hotta.

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,646
I am very sorry about all this.

88
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,485
He is the man that lost
the promissory note.

89
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,720
Right?

90
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,227
-A promissory note was lost?
-Yes.

91
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,597
It's the Mitaka Branch.

92
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,033
Mitaka Branch?

93
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,269
-I remember…
-Yes.

94
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,974
Yes. Branch Manager Noguchi
is in the Doujima faction.

95
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,444
I feel sorry for him.

96
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,113
-Kodama.
-Yes.

97
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,520
A lost promissory note
will be a scandal that will hurt

98
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,789
the credibility of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

99
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,761
It is not the time to be talking about
small issues like factions.

100
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,698
I am very sorry.

101
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,169
I hope they solve this problem.

102
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,607
Just as I expected
of Executive Director Shindo!

103
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,077
You see the bigger picture.

104
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,313
I am so impressed.

105
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:53,886
Can you tell us the details of how
this promissory note got lost?

106
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,955
Yes.

107
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,593
I went to visit several customers
this morning.

108
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,764
I visited Kawabata Kikai at 11:30 a.m.

109
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,965
KAWABATA KIKAI

110
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,402
I talked with President Kawabata
about a loan.

111
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,272
And he gave me the promissory note
before I left.

112
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,476
Did you put it in the collection envelope?

113
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,577
Yes, I did.

114
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,247
I remember that for sure.

115
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,384
What time did you leave Kawabata Kikai?

116
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,755
I think it was around 12:30 p.m.

117
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,523
Then?

118
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,825
I came straight back to the branch.

119
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,595
Did you open your bag on the way?

120
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,063
Not even once.

121
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,834
Then the promissory note
should be in this branch, right?

122
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,703
Yes, it should be.

123
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,773
What do you mean by "should be"?

124
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,444
What about after you returned?

125
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,879
Well…

126
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,983
I went to the Sales Department
to process the promissory note

127
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,118
but the person in charge was out.

128
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,287
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

129
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,523
So I processed other deposits.

130
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,060
Then I went to the Foreign Exchange
Department for a money transfer.

131
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,961
Thank you.

132
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,433
I went to the Operation Department
to register the online banking.

133
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,934
Thank you.

134
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,503
You visited so many places.

135
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,806
While carrying ten million yen.

136
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,141
I am sorry.

137
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,446
The note could have fallen out
in any of those places.

138
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,615
What did you do after that?

139
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,687
I had a phone call
when I returned to my seat.

140
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,355
Hotta speaking.

141
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,324
Hello.

142
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,759
Yes.

143
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,295
I see. I'll go there right away.

144
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,599
I put the collection envelope in my desk.

145
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,537
And went out right away.

146
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,872
Okay.

147
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,842
When did you notice that it was missing?

148
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,878
It was after 4 p.m.

149
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,279
I'm back.

150
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,320
I came back to the branch

151
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,523
and opened the collection envelope
to process it.

152
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,893
Just the promissory note was missing.

153
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,532
I looked everywhere right away.

154
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,439
But it was nowhere.

155
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:33,145
Did you take it out by mistake
when you were processing other things?

156
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,948
I don't think so.

157
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
Then what?

158
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,120
The promissory note had feet
and walked away by itself?

159
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,056
But I really don't know where it could be.

160
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,459
Do you understand this situation?

161
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,861
This is an emergency.

162
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,197
If you can't find that note,

163
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,967
we will have to report it to the FSA
and it's going to be a big scandal.

164
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,837
I will have to take responsibility
as Branch Manager.

165
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,138
I am sorry.

166
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,108
When will Kawabata Kikai need the money?

167
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,175
Friday.

168
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,712
We have to find it by tomorrow
or we can't process it in time.

169
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,082
-We must find it now.
-Yes.

170
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,720
But we looked everywhere we could
think of. Even the garbage cans.

171
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,423
Where else can we look?

172
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,726
I see.

173
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,199
-Hanasaki?
-What?

174
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,872
One of my colleagues once put
a seal registration certificate

175
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,575
through the shredder by mistake.

176
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,742
Shredder?

177
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,679
Hanasaki, you don't have to
talk about that now.

178
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:44,517
I remember it was payday.

179
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,255
People make unbelievable mistakes
when they are busy.

180
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,523
Don't say that.

181
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,026
But I guess that wouldn't happen…

182
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,561
That's enough.

183
00:09:55,628 --> 00:10:00,066
I guess it's impossible to put
a promissory note through a shredder.

184
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,068
Mr. Koizumi!

185
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,035
Yes!

186
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,649
You're always saying unnecessary things.

187
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,683
Sorry.

188
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,586
This is from
the Public Relations Department.

189
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,121
That's a lot.

190
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,256
Here.

191
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,693
Oh… Kasumi?

192
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,396
Mai!

193
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,831
What are you doing here?

194
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,733
I am in Branch Inspection now.

195
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,102
I came because of the promissory note.

196
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,670
I see.

197
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,505
I am in the PR Department here.

198
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,508
Hanasaki, do you know her?

199
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,811
She was my senior
when I was in the Akasaka Branch.

200
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,380
Ms. Kasumi Nishihara.

201
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,914
Hello, I'm Soma.

202
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,249
I am Nishihara.

203
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,654
I am glad to see you, Kasumi.
How have you been?

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,091
I've been doing well.
You haven't changed at all.

205
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,163
Let's get to work.

206
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,972
I haven't seen you in three years,
ever since I moved to the Nakano Branch.

207
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,874
Has it been that long?

208
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,311
I ran into someone I didn't want to see,
so I thought it was a bad day.

209
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,481
But it turned out to be a lucky day
because I got to meet you.

210
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,517
Move your hands.

211
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,420
Sorry.

212
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,293
Why can't you find it?

213
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,162
Everyone.

214
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,032
Are you sure you looked in every corner?

215
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,934
Hotta!

216
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,805
You caused huge trouble
to the Mitaka Branch.

217
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,774
One person's careless behavior

218
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,310
puts an entire branch in crisis.

219
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,312
How do you plan to make up for this?

220
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,614
I am sorry.

221
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,949
You shouldn't say…

222
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,251
Keep quiet.

223
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,888
Branch Manager. It's time…

224
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,156
I know.

225
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,128
If we stay here any longer,

226
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,163
it will affect business tomorrow.

227
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,065
Please go home.

228
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay.

229
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,035
Thank you for your hard work.

230
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,537
I will see you tomorrow.

231
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,840
See you tomorrow.

232
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,142
It's so late.

233
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,544
Today was my daughter's birthday.

234
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,581
-My wife's going to be mad.
-I am sorry.

235
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,416
I am very sorry.

236
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,053
You also have a wife
waiting for you at home.

237
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,755
So you know how they feel.

238
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:37,890
Yes.

239
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:44,396
I don't want to take responsibility
as a Branch Manager for something

240
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,365
stupid like this.

241
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,001
If we can't find the note,

242
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,571
you will have to take
responsibility for it.

243
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,345
-Hey!
-With all due respect…

244
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,579
Oh, no…

245
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,585
How the promissory note came to be lost
is not clear yet.

246
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,855
Before holding Mr. Hotta accountable,

247
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,992
thinking of ways to find the note
should be our priority.

248
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,860
What?

249
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:35,915
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

250
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,418
Cheers! We worked hard today.

251
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,090
Mai, you haven't changed at all.

252
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,527
You spoke out to the Branch Manager
in Akasaka too.

253
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,131
I know. Dad, do you remember Kasumi?

254
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,066
Yes, of course.

255
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,704
You were the number one teller in Akasaka
that everyone wanted to marry.

256
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,940
That's not true.

257
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,409
This is from me, Kasumi.

258
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,945
Eggplant sashimi.

259
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,514
-It looks delicious.
-It's for Kasumi.

260
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,518
You are too nice to beautiful women.

261
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,521
-So Ms. Nishihara, you were a teller?
-Yes.

262
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,491
She was my mentor when I entered the bank.

263
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,097
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

264
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:29,768
She taught me everything
about the bank from scratch.

265
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,837
Thank you very much.

266
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:37,076
I see. Then Hanasaki is who she is today
because of Ms. Nishihara.

267
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,478
Yes. I admire her.

268
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
Mai, you are too nice.

269
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,781
I mean it.

270
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,852
I miss the days
when we worked together as tellers.

271
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,022
Do you remember our leader, Ms. Yamada?

272
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,190
She's getting married.

273
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,059
Really? That old bossy-pants?

274
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,963
You never know what will happen.

275
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,932
Do you plan to marry?

276
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,204
I broke up with my boyfriend recently.

277
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,273
Me too.

278
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,541
Really? Did you break up?

279
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,044
Yes, her relationships never last.

280
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,445
Dad, keep quiet.

281
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,715
I never thought of marrying him anyway.

282
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,617
I see.

283
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,189
-Let's drink tonight.
-Sure.

284
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,557
Kasumi.

285
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,794
-Eat this and cheer up.
-Again?

286
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,596
I love deep-fried tofu.

287
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,399
I am glad to hear that. You know what?

288
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,402
I'll bring out the homemade pickled squid.

289
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,737
He is serving us so many dishes today.

290
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,772
Oh well.

291
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,910
By the way,
I wonder where the promissory note went.

292
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:51,550
Yeah. It's going to be a serious problem
if we can't find it by tomorrow.

293
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,651
Right.

294
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:58,424
First, we have to ask the remitter to
issue an accident report to the bank.

295
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,560
Then Kawabata Kikai will
report the loss to the police

296
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,496
and go to the court for
a public notification process.

297
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,200
My head is hurting just hearing all that.

298
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:12,171
There is no doubt that we received
the promissory note, so we must

299
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,207
deposit ten million yen
to Kawabata Kikai on Friday.

300
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,245
Our bank must pay the ten million yen
in place of the remitter

301
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,514
until we find the promissory note.

302
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,950
That's going to be trouble.

303
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:29,254
That's why it's somewhat understandable
for Branch Manager Noguchi

304
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,657
to worry about taking responsibility.

305
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,060
But he shouldn't have talked like that.

306
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,732
Kasumi, tell me about Mr. Hotta.

307
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,266
Yes?

308
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,903
I understand that it's his mistake.

309
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,839
But I feel sorry for him.

310
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,208
Right.

311
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:54,179
Mr. Hotta is a little unreliable.

312
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,217
But he is serious about his job,
and he'd never do anything irresponsible.

313
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,120
I see.

314
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,990
-Okay.
-You came up with an idea?

315
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,227
Mr. Soma. Let's trace his steps.

316
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,328
Steps?

317
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,830
Let's inspect every step he took
starting at

318
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,066
Kawabata Kikai where he received the note,

319
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,002
until the moment he realized
that it was lost.

320
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,038
The clues are at the scene.

321
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,672
Let's do it.

322
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,044
We are not the police, you know.

323
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:31,450
Therefore, we will be requiring
Mr. Hotta's help.

324
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,054
Retrace his steps?

325
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,390
I don't think you'll find it
by doing that.

326
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,159
Me neither.

327
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,227
It's no use.

328
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,630
No use.

329
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,569
People at headquarters
seem to have a lot of time.

330
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,505
With all due respect…

331
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,741
I understand what you are saying,

332
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,745
but we have to make sure we cover
all bases with situations like this.

333
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,846
Okay, then.

334
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,116
I can't assign important jobs to Hotta

335
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,419
until we find the promissory note anyway.

336
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,657
Thank you for your support.

337
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,827
Hi, Kasumi.

338
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,463
Do you know if they found
the promissory note?

339
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,933
They haven't found it yet.

340
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,470
Do we have to stay late
to look for it again?

341
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,005
I have a date today.

342
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,007
This is such a hassle.

343
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,209
Right.

344
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,644
I am going out.

345
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,280
KAWABATA KIKAI

346
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,151
Headquarters?

347
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,689
What is headquarters doing here
when you haven't

348
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,924
even found the promissory note yet?

349
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,496
We understand that
this is a serious problem.

350
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,700
I would like to ask for time
to confirm the details.

351
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,869
What if someone else finds it…

352
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,803
PRESIDENT OF KAWABATA KIKAI

353
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,340
…and abuses it while you're
going about asking questions.

354
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,843
-I am not responsible for this.
-I'm sorry.

355
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,081
I don't care if you find
the promissory note or not.

356
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,483
I just need you to deposit the money.

357
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,552
Ten million yen by Friday.

358
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,789
I can't manage the operation
if the payment is delayed.

359
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:22,528
We will handle the situation
so that it will not affect your business.

360
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:28,333
We want to do our best
to find the promissory note for now.

361
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,504
So, what do you want to know?

362
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,976
May I confirm that Hotta visited
here at 11:30 a.m. yesterday?

363
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,212
Let me see.

364
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,518
The appointment was 11:30 a.m.

365
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,489
He talked about the loan,
received the promissory note,

366
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,758
and he left here at 12:30 p.m. Am I right?

367
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,694
I don't remember the exact time.

368
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,565
-Is there something wrong?
-I remember…

369
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,235
Another person visited me
at noon yesterday.

370
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,440
You saw him come in
as you were leaving, right?

371
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:10,809
Yes.

372
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,246
What time did he come?

373
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,216
He came at 12 p.m. as promised.

374
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,020
Then you left here at 12 p.m.?

375
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,692
Why did you lie to us?

376
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,296
You left here at 12 p.m.

378
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,433
And what time did you
get back to the branch?

379
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,035
Around 1 p.m.

380
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,139
It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes
to get to the branch.

381
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,675
Where did you go?

382
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,546
-I went to a diner.
-A diner?

383
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,915
I was having a cup of coffee.

384
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:55,320
Why didn't you tell us
that you went to a diner?

385
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,823
Um… well…

386
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,793
I didn't want people to know that
I was slacking off.

387
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,295
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,897
Just because of that?

389
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,333
I am sorry.

390
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,935
-Mr. Soma.
-Yeah?

391
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,938
Let's go to that diner right now.

392
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,940
Okay.

393
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,411
We want to check and see
if we left something here yesterday.

394
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,380
Sure.

395
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,948
It's something like this.

396
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,484
No, we didn't find anything
like that here.

397
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,586
I see.

398
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,290
May I check the table he used yesterday?

399
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,893
But there are customers
sitting at that table right now.

400
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,296
I understand.
But may I please take a look?

401
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,430
Please.

402
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,166
I am very sorry to interrupt your lunch.

403
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,636
It's not here.

404
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:49,141
I didn't open my bag here even once.

405
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,442
I don't think it's here.

406
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,910
Just in case.

407
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,211
Just in case!

408
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,917
Whose fault does he think this is…

409
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,555
I will process the fixed deposit amount
as soon I get back.

410
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,390
-Thanks.
-Sure.

411
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:31,717
Come on, Hanasaki.
It wouldn't have fallen along the street.

412
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,919
Just in case.

413
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,457
Do you remember anything?

414
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,891
Yes.

415
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,427
I bought a bottle of tea
from this vending machine.

416
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,262
Did you open your bag at that time?

417
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,567
No, I have my wallet right here.

418
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,638
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

419
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,342
We couldn't find any clues.

420
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,112
You were so hyped up when we started.

421
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,683
Mr. Hotta. There's nothing else
you're hiding, right?

422
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,919
There's nothing. I'm sorry.

423
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,188
Can you think of anything else?

424
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,057
Anything else?

425
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,726
For example, does someone have
a grudge against you?

426
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,895
A grudge…

427
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,498
Someone in the branch stole…

428
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,834
You're too loud, you idiot.
I said, "for example."

429
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,104
We did everything but couldn't find it.

430
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,640
Someone could be bullying him.

431
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,710
But who would do such a thing?

432
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,550
What's the matter?

433
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,920
Nothing.

434
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,560
Um…

435
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,765
I will take responsibility for this.

436
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,233
Responsibility?

437
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,003
How would you do that?

438
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,707
I will reimburse ten million yen myself.

439
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,777
How will you get that money?

440
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,315
I will sell the land that
my grandfather left me.

441
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,585
I will also use my savings

442
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,789
and pay the rest
from my salary every month.

443
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,392
I'll pay no matter how long it takes.

444
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:25,230
Then it would be the same as
finding the promissory note, right?

445
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,531
That's not…

446
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,200
No, it wouldn't be the same.

447
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,269
The promissory note was lost.

448
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,273
This problem won't be solved
even if you pay for it.

449
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,276
Please don't misunderstand.

450
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,980
The banking business is not that simple.

451
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,819
You say you will pay by yourself
because you lost it?

452
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,356
That's the same as using your
customer's money.

453
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,528
It is something that
a banker should never do.

454
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,936
This is preposterous!

455
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,438
You were at a diner

456
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,074
with a promissory note
for ten million yen?

457
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,176
I am sorry.

458
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,648
Koizumi, isn't this your fault
for not training him well enough?

459
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,383
I am sorry.

460
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,286
We don't have time.

461
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,590
We have no choice but to
pay ten million yen for now.

462
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,295
This is unprecedented.

463
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,429
I am sorry.

464
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,800
This is no longer a problem
just within Mitaka Branch.

465
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:42,207
It is a big scandal that affects
the entire Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

466
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,310
Your responsibility is serious.

467
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,817
After all that you've done,
you won't have a place here anymore.

468
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,688
Be prepared to be transferred.

469
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,869
Oh, no… a transfer…

470
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:18,109
If someone has to
take responsibility for this,

471
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,445
it should be me.

472
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,748
It can't be helped.

473
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,657
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

474
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,927
You worked so hard.

475
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,962
Here you go.

476
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,531
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

477
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:44,336
We walked and looked everywhere
but it was all in vain.

478
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,039
When he mentioned the diner,
I was so sure it'd be there.

479
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,508
A diner…

480
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,478
I used to go there often
to slack off when I stepped out

481
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,679
to meet customers.

482
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,514
Really?

483
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,651
Yes. When I got tired
after visiting customers,

484
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,420
I craved something sweet

485
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,023
like parfait and cake…

486
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,958
I see. That's why.

487
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:11,329
I also stopped by diners all the time
when I was working for a company.

488
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,731
You too, Dad?

489
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,567
Yes. There are many businessmen
that go to diners.

490
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,168
There are counter seats

491
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,004
so we can be at ease when it's busy.

492
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,472
You are right.

493
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,307
We can get along, Mr. Shibasaki.

494
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,175
How about a drink?

495
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,712
That's nice.
I got some good sake in today.

496
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,116
-All of these.
-Which one should I choose?

497
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,417
I recommend this.

498
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,952
Dad, don't drink too much.

499
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,788
Seat at a counter…

500
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,524
What's wrong, Mr. Soma?

501
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,462
Mr. Hotta said that he went to
the diner around noon, right?

502
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,299
Yes. It was a little past 12 p.m.

503
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,703
The diner should be busy around that time.

504
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,440
But Mr. Hotta sat at a table for four
by the window.

505
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,443
That's kind of bold…

506
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,347
Or he wasn't by himself.

507
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,416
That's very likely.

508
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,353
I assumed he was alone when he said
that he slacked off at a diner.

509
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,189
Mr. Hotta might have met someone
at the diner.

510
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,591
That person may know
about the promissory note.

511
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,662
-Let's ask Mr. Hotta.
-Hey, wait a second.

512
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,231
Mr. Hotta has been trying to
hide that from us.

513
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,868
He may not tell us the truth
even if we ask him.

514
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,470
You are right.

515
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,773
Let's go to the diner again tomorrow.

516
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:33,011
You're fired up, Mr. Soma.

517
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,147
Not really.

518
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,421
-Two coffees, please.
-Okay.

519
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:50,628
Do you remember the customer who sat
at that table around noon two days ago?

520
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,231
This is what he looks like.

521
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,235
-No, I don't remember.
-I see.

522
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,373
Excuse me. Do you remember this customer?

523
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,609
He came here around noon two days ago.

524
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,744
I have no idea.

525
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,012
I see.

526
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,984
They don't remember every customer's face.

527
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,420
Makes sense.

528
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,790
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

529
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,625
Do you remember…

530
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,560
I'm sorry, but they are working.

531
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,865
I am very sorry.

532
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,570
We got nothing.
I thought we'd be able to find something.

533
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,540
Of course not. We are not the police.

534
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,212
Excuse me.

535
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,514
You never give up.

536
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,585
This is a man who sat by the window
at lunch two days ago.

537
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,255
May I ask if you remember him?

538
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,258
-Yes. I remember him.
-Really?

539
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,828
-Yes.
-Was he alone?

540
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,664
No. He was with a woman.

541
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,332
A woman?

542
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:07,272
He got a phone call while
he was meeting with that woman.

543
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,339
A phone call?

544
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,775
He went out to talk for a while.

545
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:15,580
I remember very well
because the woman looked really sad.

546
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,918
Then he must have left his bag
when he went to take the call.

547
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,854
Can you describe that woman?

548
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:27,192
She seemed to be in her thirties…

549
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,128
She was wearing a black jacket.

550
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,598
It might be a uniform.

551
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,066
Uniform?

552
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,069
She was wearing an orange scarf.

553
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,379
That's our uniform, isn't it?

554
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,548
No doubt about it.

555
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:55,587
Mr. Hotta was meeting someone
from the branch.

556
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,957
But why is he hiding it?

557
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,227
There must be a reason why
he can't tell us.

558
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,965
We need to know who he was meeting.

559
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,067
But how can we do that?

560
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,638
Ah… how about the business log?

561
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,009
We may find out who it was
by looking at the business log.

562
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,578
That's a good idea.

563
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,481
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK MITAKA BRANCH

564
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,820
Let's check for someone who went
to the southeast area

565
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,124
from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.
while Mr. Hotta was at the diner.

566
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,828
Or someone who didn't
report anything during that time.

567
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,266
Employees of the PR Department
and Sales Department

568
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,001
all wear uniforms.

569
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,872
I should check their lunch time
and the customer visitation records.

570
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:54,112
Monday… around noon in the southeast area.

571
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,149
There is no one.

572
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,885
I found it, Hanasaki.

573
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,221
Just one person.

574
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,324
12:40 - SOUTHEAST

575
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,592
KASUMI NISHIHARA

576
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,194
Kasumi Nishihara?

577
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,433
Why did Kasumi meet Mr. Hotta?

578
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,702
I don't know.

579
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,539
She didn't mention it at all.

580
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,744
Maybe…

581
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,013
-Do you plan to marry?
-No.

582
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,216
I broke up with my boyfriend recently.

583
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,220
I never thought of marrying him anyway.

584
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,325
No… it can't be…

585
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,193
What's wrong?

586
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,765
I just thought that
maybe they're in a relationship.

587
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,269
But Mr. Hotta is married, so it can't be.

588
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,772
An affair, huh…

589
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:02,246
That would explain why Mr. Hotta tried to
hide the fact that he met up with her.

590
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,317
Banks are strict with office romances.

591
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:11,022
He could get a disciplinary action
for something like an affair.

592
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,524
Oh, no…

593
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,230
Let's go back to the diner and confirm.

594
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,387
Mr. Hotta.

595
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,556
Yes?

596
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,658
I want to ask you something.

597
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,927
Yes.

598
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:54,799
You were not alone at the diner that day.

599
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,202
You met a woman.

600
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,941
That woman is Ms. Kasumi Nishihara, right?

601
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,050
I confirmed it at the diner.

602
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,921
Yes. They were here.

603
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,224
Why didn't you tell us that?

604
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:26,464
Mr. Hotta. What kind of relationship
do you have with her?

605
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,201
Please tell us the truth.

606
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:40,878
I was in a relationship with
Ms. Nishihara.

607
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,585
Would you tell us everything?

608
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,014
What's wrong?

609
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,918
Kasumi.

610
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,156
You met up with Mr. Hotta that day, right?

611
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,162
You had an affair with him.

612
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,707
Why did you have an affair with him?

613
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,643
You know that Mr. Hotta has a wife.

614
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,178
Why?

615
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,218
You may not understand, Mai.

616
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,556
But you can't control loving someone.

617
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,996
Our relationship started two years ago.

618
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,566
I knew that he was married, of course.

619
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,137
But that didn't bother me.

620
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,675
I was happy just being with him.

621
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,649
Did Mr. Hotta tell you that
he would divorce his wife?

622
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,918
No.

623
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,089
He's not someone that would
make promises he can't keep.

624
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,259
And I didn't

625
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,664
want to break up his family either.

626
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,133
Then…

627
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,337
why did you steal the note?

628
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,248
You stole the promissory note
from him, didn't you?

629
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,890
Two days ago…

630
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,761
He said he had to tell me
something important.

631
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,497
To tell you the truth…

632
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,502
My wife is pregnant.

633
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,441
I'm sorry, but…

634
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,310
I want to end this.

635
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,947
He always told me that

636
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,684
he was in a loveless marriage
with his wife.

637
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,089
That he hasn't slept with her in years.

638
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:46,364
Of course, a man having an affair
would say something like that.

639
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,805
But that was my source of comfort.

640
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:01,779
That's why I was able to believe that
he loved me more than his wife.

641
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,417
But his wife got pregnant.

642
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,689
It was a horrible betrayal.

643
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,200
His wife called him while
he was breaking up with me.

644
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,144
That's when I thought that

645
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,781
I wanted to get him into trouble.

646
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,057
So I opened his bag.

647
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,625
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

648
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,433
Then I found a promissory note
for ten million yen.

649
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,870
I thought he would be in
serious trouble if he lost it.

650
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,682
It was just that and nothing more.

651
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,820
I didn't think that it would
become this big.

652
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,592
I couldn't forgive him.

653
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,063
I was the only one who got hurt.

654
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,101
I couldn't forgive him for
going back home to his

655
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,605
wife and child as if nothing
had ever happened.

656
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,309
I couldn't forgive him.

657
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,881
Even so…

658
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,452
You were hurt, but does that

659
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,021
justify everything?

660
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:59,930
I also can't forgive Mr. Hotta
for trampling over your feelings.

661
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,734
However…

662
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:11,375
you taught me what it means
to be a banker.

663
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,579
Yet…

664
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:22,019
you let your emotions get the best of you
and did something wrong.

665
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,122
It…

666
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,559
It is so wrong.

667
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,498
I am disqualified as a banker.

668
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,803
No wonder you are mad at me.

669
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,374
I am not mad at you.

670
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,610
I am sad.

671
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,385
Kasumi, you taught me that

672
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,891
we're not only holding onto
our customer's money.

673
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,361
We're holding onto their trust as well.

674
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,735
You said that our job

675
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,473
is to make our customers happy.

676
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,382
You taught me that,

677
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,554
but you did something that
a banker should never do.

678
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,258
So I am sad.

679
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,963
I understand that no one can

680
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,700
stop you from loving someone.

681
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,136
But…

682
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,273
I wish I had become your confidant

683
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,245
before all of this came to be.

684
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:02,453
I am who I am today all thanks to you.

685
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,689
So…

686
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,562
I wish I could have stopped you.

687
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,474
I…

688
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,945
I did a stupid thing.

689
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,317
I was so stupid.

690
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,593
I have been working so hard
for eight years.

691
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,300
But I ruined everything by doing this.

692
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,201
Kasumi…

693
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,049
I'm sure Mr. Hotta told you

694
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,652
that he suspects me.

695
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,523
I can't blame him.

696
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,726
He has people to protect.

697
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,630
You are wrong.

698
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,601
You are wrong about that.

699
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:30,774
Mr. Hotta never said that he suspects you.

700
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:40,351
He keeps saying that you have
nothing to do with the promissory note.

701
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,153
No way.

702
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,957
You are lying.

703
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,926
No, she's not.

704
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,298
Mr. Hotta told us that

705
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,267
he was with you at the diner on that day

706
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,339
and that he was having an affair with you.

707
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,578
But he kept on saying that

708
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:13,050
losing the promissory note
is all his fault,

709
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,920
and that you had nothing to do with it.

710
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,724
I didn't answer any phone calls that time.

711
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,895
I didn't leave my seat
when I met with her.

712
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,299
So she couldn't have
stolen the promissory note from me.

713
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,969
I lost it.

714
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,706
It is all my fault. Just myself.

715
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:41,779
Mr. Hotta most likely knew
what you had done.

716
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,515
And yet…

717
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,553
he tried to take all
the responsibility by himself.

718
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,791
There is one more thing.

719
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,931
An office affair is a scandal that can
end a baker's career.

720
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,101
He would be punished,

721
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,604
and he won't be promoted.

722
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,343
But Mr. Hotta readily admitted the affair.

723
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,682
Because he wanted to protect you.

724
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,422
Kasumi.

725
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,359
I don't know much about romance.

726
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,163
But what he did for you…

727
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,234
that's Mr. Hotta's true feelings for you.

728
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,240
I don't think his love for you was a lie.

729
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,880
I am sorry.

730
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,717
I am sorry.

731
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:13,403
I was overwhelmed with guilt.

732
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,743
I am glad that you found it.

733
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,427
PROMISSORY NOTE

734
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,669
Mr. Hotta.

735
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:02,853
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

736
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,957
The loss of the promissory note
at Mitaka Branch has come to a close.

737
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:11,595
Yes. Ms. Kasumi Nishihara received
a disciplinary dismissal.

738
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,997
Mr. Hotta was transferred to
another branch.

739
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,036
This put a big X-mark on his career.

740
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,874
Although there was
no practical damage to Kawabata Kikai,

741
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,844
he caused them a lot of trouble.

742
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,745
He brought this upon himself.

743
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:34,251
But I still can't believe that
Kasumi did such a thing.

744
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,955
Anyone can fall into temptation.

745
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:42,860
She was probably planning to
return it secretly, but she couldn't

746
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,862
because it became a huge issue.

747
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:52,236
Branch Manager Noguchi
received an admonition.

748
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,206
Not one word leaked to the media,

749
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,109
so we avoided damaging
the reputation of our bank.

750
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,981
Branch Inspection does something good
once in a while.

751
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,817
Ouch!

752
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,585
That's good news.

753
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:13,056
Senior Executive Director Doujima
must be really relieved too.

754
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:19,696
It was about to become a big scandal
for the Doujima faction.

755
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,200
I am so glad.

756
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,037
Excuse me.

757
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,080
Branch Inspection.

758
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,149
Yes.

759
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,884
A guest for me?

760
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,553
Ms. Nishihara?

761
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,659
I'm sure you heard that I was fired.

762
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,495
Yes.

763
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,731
It's no surprise since I did
something worthy of a dismissal.

764
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,735
What are you going to do?

765
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,172
I am thinking of going
to a business school

766
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,174
to study accounting.

767
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,779
Once I get the qualification,
I want to find a job to put that to use.

768
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,914
I see.

769
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,551
I have been saving money,

770
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,887
so I think I am okay for a while.

771
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,123
The truth is,

772
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:27,164
I had been saving money because
I was prepared to pay the compensation

773
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,368
for Mr. Hotta's place
in case he ever divorced his wife.

774
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,105
I was stupid.

775
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:40,444
I said that I wasn't expecting anything,
but I was trying to get everything.

776
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:49,052
So I will use all that money
to get rid of my past self

777
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,954
and reset myself.

778
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,592
I'm hoping I can do that.

779
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,797
I'm sure you can do it, Kasumi.
Do your best.

780
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:03,967
Thank you.

781
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,172
Take care of yourself.

782
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,508
Thanks. You too.

783
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,721
-She's a good woman.
-Mr. Soma.

784
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,058
Okay. It's time to reset.
We have an inspection to go to.

785
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,693
We're heading to Sendai.

786
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,330
Sendai is beef tongue,
but is that too boring?

787
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:37,534
Hiyashi Chuka is delicious right now.

788
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,804
We can have Hiyashi Chuka for lunch
if we go now. Let's go.

789
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,806
Wait, Hanasaki.

790
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,107
Where is your bag?

791
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,577
But you don't have your bag, either.

792
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,547
-It's not like me.
-Let's go.

793
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,185
Destroy our bank?

794
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,953
Someone posted it online.

795
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,722
Hey Branch Inspection!

796
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
Weren't you on watch?

797
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,058
What happened?

798
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,659
Tokyo Daiichi Bank killed him.

799
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,594
You destroyed the company.

800
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,931
That's definitely wrong.
