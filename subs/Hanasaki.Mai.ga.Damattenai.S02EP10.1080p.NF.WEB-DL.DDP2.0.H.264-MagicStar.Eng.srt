1
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,242
Wow, Dad, this is delicious.

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,411
You like it?

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,414
That's braised pork. It's new on the menu.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,649
It's soft and melts in my mouth.

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,753
It's very mild, but it has a deep flavor.

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,922
Mr. Soma, you're the only one
that can word it so well.

7
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,424
I said it well too.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:29,029
Your restaurant has good ratings
on gourmet sites.

9
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,331
-This restaurant is listed on that site?
-Yes.

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,867
-I've never seen it before.
-Check it out.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,168
Hanasaki.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,369
There it is.

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,107
You have 4.21 stars. That's really good.

14
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,542
Really?

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,846
Five is the highest rating you can get,
so anything over four is very good.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,152
"The owner runs the restaurant by himself,
and makes mild, yet unforgettable dishes.

17
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,854
It makes you want to come back for more.
Five stars."

18
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,358
"Comfortable interior.

19
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,827
You must try the sashimi and stew.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,930
You can also enjoy
the downtown atmosphere.

21
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,965
-However…"
-However?

22
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,369
"The owner was offering free appetizers
to the female customers,

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,339
but he didn't offer any to us older men.
So we give it three stars."

24
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,109
Dad…

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,144
I've never done such a thing.

26
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,413
I serve all customers equally.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,452
In fact, I just saw you giving free
stewed beef tendons to a female customer.

28
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,253
I just had an extra plate.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,922
You didn't give it to us.

30
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,124
Yes. I was wondering why.

31
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,426
But you are like my family.

32
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,662
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:45,972
NAME: FOX
I WILL DESTROY THAT BANK TOMORROW

34
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,640
WHICH BANK?

35
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,810
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK TOYOSU BRANCH

36
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,014
Destroy the bank?

37
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,650
It was an anonymous post
on a message board,

38
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,919
so it could very well be a prank.

39
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,855
It's so scary.

40
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,091
We often see this type of death threat
on the internet,

41
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,428
but I never thought it would happen to us.

42
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,798
Yes. So I want you to go
and check out the Toyosu Branch.

43
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,366
Just to be safe.

44
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,537
I wonder why this person used
Fox as their username?

45
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,073
Yeah, it's a little creepy.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,509
Don't let it bother you.

47
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:27,113
TOYOSU BRANCH

48
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,149
What is it?

49
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:33,386
I feel like the Fox is watching us.

50
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,722
That's the Inari Shrine.

51
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,897
I'm sorry to drag you from headquarters
for something like this.

52
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,031
No.

53
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,633
It's no problem.

54
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,836
But Branch Inspection must have
lots of time to spare…

55
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:50,970
DEPUTY BRANCH MANAGER HIDEO NAKANO

56
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,741
…since you're responding to
internet messages like these.

57
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,478
Well, they came to help us
so we should be appreciative.

58
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,412
Okay.

59
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,549
By the way, are there any problems with

60
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,953
customers or loan clients at this bank?

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,454
Of course not.

62
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,725
The Toyosu Branch has
the least complaints from customers.

63
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,960
Didn't you know that?

64
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,896
Yes, I'm aware of that.
I asked just in case.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,206
Can you let us watch over the sales floor
and the ATM corner today?

66
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,106
No, you can't.

67
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,843
The customers will get wary
if they see you wandering around.

68
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,415
Then what if we stand there
as an attendant?

69
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,816
That's not necessary.

70
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,786
Let them do it, Nakano.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,722
If the branch manager says so.

72
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,328
But please don't disturb our business.

73
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,264
-Yes.
-Of course.

74
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,601
I'm sure nothing will happen.

75
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:59,072
Ms. Hanasaki, I'm sorry for making you
take on such a dangerous job.

76
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,775
Oh, no problem at all. I am okay--

77
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,511
She is okay. Hanasaki is very tough.

78
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,616
I think she is stronger than me.

79
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,354
Good luck.

80
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,788
Yes.

81
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,958
The branch manager is really nice.

82
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,262
No one has ever worried about me before.

83
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,264
He was so calm.

84
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,866
It's surprising for someone
in the Shindo faction.

85
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,470
Branch Manager Saegusa is
in the Shindo faction?

86
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,671
Didn't I tell you?

87
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,640
I didn't expect that.

88
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,711
I can understand it if that Deputy Branch
Manager was in the Shindo faction.

89
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,980
That's enough. Let's go.

90
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,091
Hanasaki.

91
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,761
You're scowling.

92
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,666
Sorry, I was concentrating on the Fox,
so I couldn't resist.

93
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,634
You can never resist.

94
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,671
How about this?

95
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,708
-Fox!
-What?

96
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,912
"Sad Fox."

97
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,250
This is nothing but a picture book.

98
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,320
-I know.
-Fox!

99
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,856
Where is the Fox?

100
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,391
Over there!

101
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,198
-Fox…
-It's cute.

102
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,236
I can't get the Fox out of my mind.

103
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,207
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

104
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,123
Everything is balanced.
Thank you for your hard work.

105
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,958
Thank you.

106
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,564
I'm glad nothing happened.

107
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,534
That message was a prank,
just as we expected.

108
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,305
I'm so relieved that I'm getting hungry.

109
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,143
Hey, we didn't eat lunch today.

110
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,611
You are right.

111
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,949
-Let's eat something on our way back.
-Sounds good.

112
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,752
How about Fox Noodle to end this day?

113
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,086
No way.

114
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,023
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

115
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,825
-Go check it out.
-Yes!

116
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,727
-Hanasaki!
-Yes.

117
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,596
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

118
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,600
FIRE ALARM

119
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,368
The garbage room.

120
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,137
Where is it?

121
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,938
-Around that corner.
-Yes.

122
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,441
There's smoke.

123
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,411
-We need the key.
-Here.

124
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,216
-Fire extinguisher!
-Right here!

125
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,051
Please step back.

126
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,326
ATM CORNER

127
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,629
Why did the fire break out in there?

128
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,230
How did this happen?

129
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,600
The silver lining is that
we caught it early on.

130
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,102
But this is a problem.

131
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,371
Did Fox set the fire?

132
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,406
It's possible.

133
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,308
Excuse me.

134
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,011
I am Kadokura
of the Toyosu police station.

135
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,180
-I am Saito.
-Did you find anything?

136
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,817
The garbage collected at the ATM corner
was the source of fire.

137
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,052
ATM?

138
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,788
The suspect placed a timed ignition advice

139
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,490
in the garbage by the ATM corner.

140
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,627
It ignited after it was collected
into the garbage room?

141
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,728
Right.

142
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,631
Can I check the footage
from the security camera?

143
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,968
-Yes.
-This way, please.

144
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,243
There is no one suspicious.

145
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,412
Not yet.

146
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,348
What is it?

147
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,951
There's a deposit of one yen
to a donation account.

148
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,854
-One yen?
-Please check the name.

149
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,091
Cash transfer at 12:50 p.m.
The remitter is…

150
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,795
I will punish the rotten bank.

151
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,230
Fox.

152
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,599
Fox?

153
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,767
Do you know about this Fox?

154
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,639
There was a message on the internet
threatening to destroy the Toyosu Branch.

155
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,376
That message was posted
under the username Fox.

156
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,845
-Who is this?
-Check the video.

157
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,247
Yes.

158
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,419
12:50…

159
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
It's him.

160
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,892
We can't see his face.

161
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,228
It seems to be a young man
around 20 years old.

162
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,640
-Is that the ignition device?
-Maybe.

163
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,675
This is ridiculous.

164
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,876
Can you identify him?

165
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,947
No, because this is a cash transfer.

166
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,449
How did he get his name to be
printed like this?

167
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,318
When cash is transferred at the ATM,

168
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,689
the remitter enters their own name.

169
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,925
It can be anything within 40 characters.

170
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,893
Branch Inspection!

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,497
You didn't notice that a crime
was happening right in front of you?

172
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,167
You were keeping watch
to prevent this from happening.

173
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,270
-I am sorry.
-Sorry.

174
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,273
This is all your fault, Branch Inspection.

175
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,176
RESTAURANT HANASAKI

176
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,916
Of course, I feel bad that
we couldn't catch the culprit.

177
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,219
But I don't think we deserved to be
yelled at like that.

178
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,755
He looked like an ordinary young man,

179
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,724
and it's natural to put garbage

180
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,061
in the garbage can, so no one would think
that it's suspicious.

181
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:59,365
The branch manager suddenly changed
his attitude once something happened.

182
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,070
He has two very different sides to him,
that's for sure.

183
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,907
I want to solve this case
and teach that branch manager a lesson.

184
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,077
Mai, I heard that there was a fire
at your bank.

185
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,379
-How did you know?
-I saw it on TV.

186
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,283
They said it was arson. Is that true?

187
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,787
It was okay because it was caught
before it escalated.

188
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,323
How scary.

189
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,860
It would be great if it ends here.

190
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,597
What's wrong? You both look so tired.

191
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,200
There's a lot going on.

192
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,869
Eat this and cheer up. It's on me.

193
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,270
Thank you.

194
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,041
This is new on the menu.
Crown daisy and daikon fox salad.

195
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,343
Fox?

196
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,345
It's called Fox?

197
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,785
ARSON ATTACK AT TOKYO DAIICHI BANK'S
TOYOSU BRANCH

198
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,054
NAME: FOX

199
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,025
NEVER FORGIVE TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
TOYOSU BRANCH

200
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:06,732
PUNISH BRANCH MANAGER SAEGUSA

201
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,006
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK TOYOSU BRANCH

202
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,242
SMALL FIRE AT TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
POSSIBLY ARSON

203
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,045
Did you see the new post by the arsonist?

204
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,781
I did. He mentioned
the name of the branch manager.

205
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,783
How scary.

206
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,321
PUNISH BRANCH MANAGER SAEGUSA

207
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,925
Why is he mentioning my name?

208
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,463
This is Saegusa.

209
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,600
Good morning, Mr. Kodama.

210
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,345
Is it just me or is he glaring at us?

211
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,949
He's trying to tell us that this is
all our fault.

212
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,723
Executive Director Shindo,
I am sorry for troubling you.

213
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,193
-Don't say unnecessary things.
-I know.

214
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,663
Explain this to me.

215
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,764
Yes.

216
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,769
Someone placed a timed ignition device

217
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,405
into the garbage can
at 12:50 p.m. yesterday.

218
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,409
It's believed to have ignited
in the garbage collection room.

219
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,614
The criminal gave prior notice of this
crime by posting it on the internet, yes?

220
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,950
Well… he implied that he would.

221
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,519
What does the culprit want?

222
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,087
We don't know.

223
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,356
Why is he targeting the Toyosu Branch?

224
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:42,328
Do you have any problems with
customers that went bankrupt?

225
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,697
-No, we do not.
-Nothing.

226
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,901
-Excuse me.
-Huh?

227
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,372
The culprit who calls himself Fox,
mentioned

228
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,776
Branch Manager Saegusa
by name on yesterday's post.

229
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,211
Why was that?

230
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,981
That's my question.

231
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:06,619
I think the suspect holds a grudge,
not against the Toyosu Branch,

232
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,988
but against Branch Manager Saegusa.

233
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,890
Are you saying

234
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,061
that someone has
a personal grudge against me?

235
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,130
Stop being so rude.

236
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,298
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,502
It doesn't matter whether the target
is the bank or the branch manager.

238
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,742
In any case, the public will think that
Tokyo Daiichi Bank is the target.

239
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,880
There are two things that
we should do right now.

240
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,819
Cooperate with police to
arrest the suspect

241
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,254
and wrap up this case as soon as possible.

242
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,427
We must stop this case from destroying
our bank's credibility.

243
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,434
Therefore, we need to conduct
an internal investigation.

244
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,471
There may be information
that can't be publicized.

245
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,310
Let's get Branch Inspection
to investigate.

246
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,314
No. You should be in charge, Kodama.

247
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,783
Why is that?

248
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,921
Branch Inspection overlooked
the criminal yesterday.

249
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,256
I am sorry.

250
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:23,562
First of all, I will make a list
of customers from the Toyosu Branch

251
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,098
that have gone bankrupt
in the last five years--

252
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,272
Mr. Doujima.

253
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,610
I think Branch Inspection
would be ideal for this case.

254
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:45,050
They have solved many problems
at different branches.

255
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,522
We should rely on them
for a serious case such as this.

256
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,659
But they made a mistake.

257
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,829
If someone on your side is in charge,

258
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,600
things can be covered up
before it's reported to me.

259
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,870
I wouldn't do such a thing.

260
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,849
I understand.

261
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,659
I want you to get the job done this time.

262
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,328
This is your last chance.

263
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,263
-Yes.
-Yes.

264
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,473
BRANCH INSPECTION

265
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
MEETING RECORD

266
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:54,920
I can't find anything just by looking at
the numbers on the credit files.

267
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,889
I agree.

268
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,059
This doesn't record people's feelings.

269
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,330
They know what caused the fire.

270
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,600
We got a report from the police.

271
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,304
Apparently, the fire was set
using alkali metal.

272
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,839
Alkali metal?

273
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,109
It ignites once it comes into contact
with air.

274
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,744
CHEMICAL COMPOUND OF ALKALI METAL

275
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:24,049
<i>The culprit put a piece of that meal in</i>
<i>a plastic bag with preservative solution,</i>

276
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,688
<i>poked a small hole in it</i>
<i>and put it in the garbage can.</i>

277
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,259
<i>The preservative solution</i>
<i>gradually leaked,</i>

278
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,031
<i>and the alkali metal ignited</i>
<i>when it came into contact with air.</i>

279
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,066
I see.

280
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,437
Is it easy to obtain that alkali metal?

281
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,273
No. It is usually unavailable
to the general public.

282
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,910
So the culprit must be someone
who has a way to obtain it.

283
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:56,081
Then the culprit must be someone
who is or was working

284
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,585
for a company that handles alkali metal.

285
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,421
What kind of company is that?

286
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,025
A battery factory, university laboratory,

287
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,528
a company that processes glass, and so on.

288
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,166
Glass… there was a company among
these files that handles glass.

289
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,802
-Tokita Glass.
-Here it is.

290
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,171
-What kind of company was that?
-Yes.

291
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,175
They seemed to have maintained
a stable performance

292
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,979
but failed to expand their business
and went bankrupt a year ago.

293
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,147
How about debt?

294
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,549
No debt.

295
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,918
All of their debts were settled.

296
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,490
Okay. Let's go to the Toyosu Branch
and get some details.

297
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,725
Okay.

298
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,994
Tokita Glass?

299
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,031
We would like to know the details
that led to their bankruptcy.

300
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,869
For example, did you have
problems with this company?

301
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,473
Do you think the manager is
calm when his company goes bankrupt?

302
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,679
They often become emotional
and end up screaming and cursing at us.

303
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,715
I can't be a banker if I let
something like that bother me.

304
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,151
I understand.

305
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,689
-But if you remember anything--
-I don't remember anything.

306
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,861
It's a waste of time to look into this.
Go back to your office.

307
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,231
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

308
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,902
He's so suspicious.

309
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,271
Yes. He's hiding something.

310
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,508
Let's ask the Finance Department.

311
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,110
Don't let him find out.

312
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,744
Okay.

313
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,379
Tokita Glass?

314
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,318
That can't be…

315
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,590
Damn it!

316
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,431
I was in charge of Tokita Glass.

317
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,501
But I don't know much about the details.

318
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,938
So the actual negotiation
was done by your boss.

319
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,509
Yes. It was Branch Manager Saegusa.

320
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,144
Why was that?

321
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,515
It was when he was trying really hard
to improve the numbers at this branch,

322
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,484
so he personally went to Tokita Glass
to offer the loan.

323
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,090
It seems like they paid off the loan
before they went bankrupt.

324
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,293
You don't know anything about that either?

325
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,261
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,300
But I heard the other banks couldn't
get their loans recovered, so I'm sure

327
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,270
our branch manager aggressively
demanded it back.

328
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,705
I see.

329
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,544
We want to talk with someone
from Tokita Glass.

330
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:49,121
The president and his son moved to
an apartment after they went bankrupt.

331
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,157
The senior executive director moved to
his hometown, Iwate.

332
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,027
Do you have their contact information?

333
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,862
PRESIDENT KIICHIRO TOKITA

334
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,500
President Tokita's house
should be around here.

335
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,104
There it is. Shiomi Corp.

336
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,974
TOKITA

337
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,948
Maybe they're out.

338
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:24,489
Excuse me. Does Mr. Tokita live here?

339
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,960
-Yes.
-We are from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

340
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,896
We'd like to talk to Mr. Kiichiro Tokita.

341
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,299
He passed away recently.

342
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,669
It was about a month ago.

343
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,639
I guess he had a chronic heart disease.

344
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,475
But he was a president, right?

345
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,812
I heard he had a hard time
because his company went bankrupt.

346
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,083
Apparently, that took a toll on him
and worsened his condition.

347
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,818
Oh, really…

348
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,355
I heard that his son lives here, too.

349
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,558
I haven't seen him recently.

350
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,127
According to rumors, he's a recluse.

351
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,963
Do you know how old his son is?

352
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,768
I remember hearing that he had
a Coming-of-age ceremony last year.

353
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,404
May I go now?

354
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,139
Sure. Thank you for your time.

355
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,907
Thank you very much.

356
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:25,417
The Fox we saw on the security
footage seemed to be around 20 years old.

357
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:26,918
Yes.

358
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,195
His son's name is Tsuneo, huh?

359
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,196
KIICHIRO, TSUNEO TOKITA

360
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,097
Yes.

361
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,899
Tsuneo…

362
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,105
-Fox!
-Again?

363
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,308
Look here, Mr. Soma.

364
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,809
What is it?

365
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,411
Read this vertically.

366
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,548
F… ox.

367
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,618
-Fox?
-Yes.

368
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,888
Is Tsuneo Tokita the Fox?

369
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,791
It is possible.

370
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,894
But why?

371
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,763
The president of Tokita Glass died,

372
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,233
and his son holds a grudge against
Branch Manager Saegusa.

373
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,471
There might have been something
behind the bankruptcy.

374
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,775
NAME: FOX

375
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,915
I WILL NEVER STOP UNTIL
BRANCH MANAGER SAEGUSA IS PUNISHED

376
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,531
Have you seen this young man?

377
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,067
I know a man who looks similar.

378
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,645
The police are searching for
Tsuneo Tokita as the suspect.

379
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:01,980
I see.

380
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:07,452
He worked for Tokita Glass
after he graduated high school.

381
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,021
But he became a recluse
after the bankruptcy,

382
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,657
and he wasn't working either.

383
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,894
He probably hates and blames the bank

384
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,297
for the bankruptcy and his father's death.

385
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,168
We will have to leave the rest
to the police.

386
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,637
You did a good job.

387
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,008
What's wrong, Hanasaki?

388
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:36,248
I've been thinking about
what his objective is for doing this.

389
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,887
He posted a message saying,
"Punish Branch Manager Saegusa."

390
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,791
But I don't think he's planning
to actually cause him harm.

391
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,428
What do you think he wants?

392
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,268
There might be something that he wants
the public to know about.

393
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,073
I think he created this fuss
in order to reveal the truth

394
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,378
hidden behind the bankruptcy
of Tokita Glass.

395
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,384
Mr. Karashima. Can I go to Iwate tomorrow?

396
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,318
Iwate?

397
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,020
Why would you go so far?

398
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,658
Mr. Kuga, former senior executive director
of Tokita Glass, lives in Iwate now.

399
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,294
You want to see him,
and get some information?

400
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,062
Yes.

401
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,732
Since President Tokita passed away
and his son is in hiding,

402
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,837
he is the only one
who knows what happened a year ago.

403
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,907
Okay. Go to Iwate.

404
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,476
But Mr. Karashima…

405
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,246
It's their job to solve problems
at the branch.

406
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,549
This problem has not been solved yet.

407
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,952
Thank you very much.

408
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,231
It's that way.

409
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,933
The air is clear.

410
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,073
It's here.

411
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,040
Okay.

412
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,141
KUGA

413
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,445
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

414
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,716
I am Soma from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

415
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,453
I would like to meet Mr. Yasuhiko Kuga,

416
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,356
who was the senior executive director
of Tokita Glass.

417
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:28,660
That's my husband.
He is in the backyard. But…

418
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,500
Is that him?

419
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,006
Hello!

420
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,908
You must be Mr. Kuga.

421
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,849
I am Soma from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

422
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,584
I am Hanasaki.

423
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,885
FORMER SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OF TOKITA GLASS

424
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,420
Why is Tokyo Daiichi Bank here?

425
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,424
I would like to know about
the bankruptcy of Tokita Glass.

426
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,659
Go away.

427
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,328
I have nothing to say.

428
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,365
But Mr. Kuga…

429
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,768
Don't come in here with those shoes.

430
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,337
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,471
Damn it.

432
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,075
The police are looking for
Mr. Tsuneo Tokita

433
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,313
as a suspect for the arson attack
at Toyosu Branch.

434
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,719
Could you tell us what happened
behind the bankruptcy a year ago?

435
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,690
I think it's connected to the reason
why he planned this attack.

436
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,762
Do you know where Mr. Tsuneo Tokita is?

437
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,734
Even if I did, why would I tell you guys?

438
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,975
You probably want to find Tsuneo
before the police catch him

439
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,511
so that you can stop him
from exposing the truth.

440
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,615
-No, we would never do such a thing.
-You guys…

441
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,651
You lie with a straight face.

442
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,056
Your bank destroyed
the lives of the Tokita family.

443
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,562
President Tokita was killed by
Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

444
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,166
What do you mean by that?

445
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,236
Go away. I am busy. Don't disturb me.

446
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,350
I'm sorry. He's so stubborn.

447
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,451
No.

448
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,360
Um… may I ask you a favor?

449
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,295
What is it?

450
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,664
What is it?

451
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,678
Please let me help you.

452
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,814
I knew it.

453
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:15,560
Should I cut like this?

454
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:22,133
May I ask you something after this?

455
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,102
I won't promise you such a thing.

456
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,472
What if we harvest all the way over there?

457
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,974
That's impossible for an amateur.

458
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,779
But what if we do it?

459
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,848
You can't do it.

460
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,849
May I use this?

461
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,983
It's done.

462
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,720
Wow! You did a great job.

463
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,656
We did it!

464
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,994
Aren't you glad they helped?

465
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:31,002
Would you like to have dinner with us?

466
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:32,971
Really?

467
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,740
Enjoy the freshly harvested vegetables.

468
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,976
Thank you!

469
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,391
I never knew that it tastes
this good when you harvest it yourself.

470
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,693
This cutlet is delicious too.

471
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,429
It makes me happy to see you enjoying it.

472
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,269
<i>The suspect of the arson attack</i>
<i>at Tokyo Daiichi Bank was arrested.</i>

473
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:09,607
<i>They arrested Tsuneo Tokita, an unemployed</i>
<i>21-year-old living in the Koto ward.</i>

474
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,178
<i>He was arrested under suspicion</i>
<i>of setting fire to</i>

475
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:17,015
<i>Tokyo Daiichi Bank Toyosu Branch</i>
<i>by placing alkali metal</i>

476
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,651
<i>in a garbage can near the ATM corner.</i>

477
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,253
<i>It has been reported that</i>

478
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,024
<i>he admitted to all charges</i>
<i>during the questioning.</i>

479
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,136
Mr. Kuga…

480
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,073
would you please
tell us about the details?

481
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,979
We think that Tsuneo was willing to
commit a crime in order to punish

482
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,782
Branch Manager Saegusa
because of something

483
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,651
that happened with the bankruptcy.

484
00:30:56,487 --> 00:31:00,325
I don't know if we will be able to
do anything.

485
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:05,763
But we will not conceal the truth.

486
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,925
Um… may I open this?

487
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,727
Yes.

488
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,271
CREDIT FILE

489
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,772
TOKITA GLASS CORPORATION

490
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:56,014
Tsuneo didn't know anything
until a month ago.

491
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:04,222
The president told him everything
before he died last month.

492
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,861
He apologized to Tsuneo
for bankrupting the company.

493
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,733
He said he was deceived by the bank
because he was stupid.

494
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,271
What do you mean he was deceived?

495
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:29,247
Branch Manager Saegusa is the one
that proposed the business expansion

496
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,417
two years ago.

497
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,661
You have a chance at expanding
your business overseas

498
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,831
if you move your production base
to Thailand.

499
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,166
Please think about it.

500
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:54,605
No. I am not planning to expand
my company like that.

501
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,775
We're happy with the size
of our company right now.

502
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,378
I see.

503
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,314
<i>We were planning to decline</i>
<i>the offer at first.</i>

504
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,650
Good morning.

505
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,353
It's hot today.

506
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,323
May I see the factory?

507
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,329
<i>But the branch manager came to our</i>
<i>company many times to persuade us.</i>

508
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:24,369
<i>The president was a nice man,</i>
<i>so he felt like he should trust the bank.</i>

509
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,039
I have decided to take
Branch Manager Saegusa's suggestion.

510
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,807
That's wonderful.

511
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,111
I'm sure it will go well.

512
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,048
<i>In the end, he decided</i>
<i>to expand the business.</i>

513
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,349
-Thank you.
-Yes.

514
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,152
<i>He got a loan of 1.5 billion yen</i>
<i>from the bank.</i>

515
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,123
<i>But as we were building the factory…</i>

516
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,359
-President.
<i>-…Thailand became politically unstable.</i>

517
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,794
Please look at this.

518
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,729
ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATION IN THAILAND
JAPANESE BUSINESS SUFFERS

519
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,933
<i>The company had to withdraw</i>
<i>while shouldering the loss.</i>

520
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,205
All of a sudden, we had a huge debt.

521
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,508
The cash-flow became tight,

522
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,179
and when our situation became
very critical a year ago,

523
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,950
Branch Manager Saegusa noticed it
right away and visited us.

524
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,652
We need an additional loan,

525
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,689
or our company will go bankrupt.

526
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,590
Please.

527
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,261
Okay.

528
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:25,963
Really?

529
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,733
Of course, President Tokita.

530
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,272
But I need to discuss this with
headquarters as well.

531
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:38,910
In order to do that,
will you pay off your loan first?

532
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,579
What do you mean?

533
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,583
Don't worry. It is a temporary measure.

534
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,085
Look here.

535
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
3.6% - REFINANCE WITH 1%,
2 MILLION, 7 - 12 YEARS

536
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,330
Currently you get a loan
at an annual interest rate of 3.6%.

537
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,468
If you pay it off in a lump sum,
you can obtain a good credit history.

538
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,405
Then you will get refinanced

539
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,409
with 1% interest.

540
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,610
Yes.

541
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,179
As a result, you can lower
the amount you owe

542
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,683
and extend the pay-back period
by a considerable amount.

543
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,588
Your company will only reap benefits
with this deal.

544
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,256
But it's hard for us

545
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,226
to pay off the entire loan,
even if it's temporary.

546
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,898
You need to scrape the money together
somehow.

547
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,034
It is worth doing.

548
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,637
I understand.

549
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,972
President…

550
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:45,977
This is the only way for you
to save your company.

551
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:54,051
I understand. I will prepare the money.

552
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,723
He ran around borrowing money,

553
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,361
and even gathered his personal
and family assets together.

554
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:09,000
He somehow gathered enough to pay off

555
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,935
the entire loan.

556
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,838
However…

557
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,676
He couldn't get the additional loan.

558
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,418
Please wait.

559
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,154
That's not what you promised.

560
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,591
You said that if I paid off my loan,

561
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,427
you would help me refinance
with a better rate.

562
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,296
I didn't promise you such a thing.

563
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,664
What?

564
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,165
What you're talking about

565
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,400
is called

566
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:47,004
"loan commitment" and it's something
a banker should never promise.

567
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,539
No way…

568
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:53,077
Our bank collected the money
that we had loaned. That's all.

569
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,947
Branch Manager. You deceived us?

570
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,150
Stop accusing me of such a thing.

571
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,018
How dare you?

572
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:05,656
Our company declined because of
the business expansion last year.

573
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,858
You advised me to do so.

574
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,296
You're blaming others because you failed?

575
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,436
You are the one that ruined your company.

576
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,443
-Please wait.
-President.

577
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,645
Please, Branch Manager Saegusa!

578
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,480
I am begging you.

579
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,317
Please help us.

580
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,323
President Tokita, you're finished.

581
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:49,166
President! Are you okay?

582
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:56,774
Soon after, Tokita Glass couldn't keep up
with the payments and went bankrupt.

583
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,914
Banks…

584
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,618
lend an umbrella when it's sunny

585
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:09,920
and take it away

586
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,825
when it is raining.

587
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,897
They forced a loan on us

588
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,235
when our business was good
and didn't require financing.

589
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,975
But when our performance went bad,
they forced us to pay it back

590
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,979
without showing us any consideration.

591
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,953
Hey…

592
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,827
is that what your bank does?

593
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,342
No…

594
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,013
That is…

595
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,416
so wrong.

596
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,122
It is definitely wrong.

597
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,776
They were able to collect the loan
from Tokita Glass

598
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,214
because Branch Manager Saegusa
used a dirty trick.

599
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,582
Yes.

600
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:50,654
On paper, it just shows that
Tokita Glass paid it off by themselves.

601
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,558
The branch manager
won't be penalized for this?

602
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,295
Promising a loan,
is called "loan commitment"

603
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:03,067
and it's something a banker
should never do.

604
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,702
Right.

605
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,104
But he just made a verbal promise.

606
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,641
There is no signed promise
nor was it recorded.

607
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,510
There is no evidence.

608
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,015
That's why President Tokita couldn't
do anything but give up.

609
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:25,189
There is a customer experiencing
so much pain just because of one banker.

610
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,959
It's so unfair that we can't do
anything about it.

611
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,963
I know what you are saying.

612
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,604
Isn't this the piece of paper

613
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,908
that Mr. Saegusa used
to explain the refinancing plan?

614
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,378
Yes, you are right.

615
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,547
Can we use it as evidence?

616
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,383
No, this is too weak.

617
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:59,023
Huh? Give it to me, Hanasaki.

618
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,831
This could be evidence.

619
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,867
Look here.

620
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:33,224
I am very sorry to have caused
you trouble with this case.

621
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,995
I am relieved the suspect
was arrested so quickly.

622
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,331
But this experience has taught me that

623
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:45,302
we can be harmed even though we have
nothing to be blamed for.

624
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,672
This was a case of unjustified resentment.

625
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,976
But please be careful
so that this never happens again.

626
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,377
Yes, I will.

627
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,745
Executive Director Shindo.

628
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,116
I want to confirm something.

629
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,551
Yes?

630
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:02,920
Come in!

631
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,157
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

632
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,327
Why is Branch Inspection here?

633
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,165
They'd like to reveal some new information
regarding Tokita Glass.

634
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,301
May we?

635
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,170
What is it?

636
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,739
Branch Manager Saegusa.

637
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:26,110
You offered a loan of 1.5 billion yen
to Tokita Glass two years ago

638
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,979
and advised them to expand their business.

639
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,349
But it failed.

640
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,519
I didn't force them to do so.

641
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,321
They agreed to do so.

642
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:42,826
But once you knew that Tokita Glass
was in serious financial trouble,

643
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,329
you tried to collect the loan by force.

644
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,967
Is there something wrong with
trying to recover a loan?

645
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,068
No.

646
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:55,272
There's no problem with that.
On paper, that is.

647
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,744
But the way you went about it, was wrong.

648
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:06,317
This is the evidence to prove that.

649
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:15,259
I borrowed this from the former
senior executive director of Tokita Glass.

650
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:21,231
This is a memo promising that
he would refinance them

651
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,334
at a better rate if they

652
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,135
paid off their loan first.

653
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,236
REFINANCE

654
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,076
You deceived President Tokita

655
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,347
by using a method
called a "loan commitment."

656
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,090
I didn't write that.

657
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,359
No,

658
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:53,230
you did write this,
Branch Manager Saegusa.

659
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,900
This is the basis for that claim.

660
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:03,407
All documents printed
from computers within our bank

661
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,377
have an identification code like this.

662
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:10,814
This code can track
when the document was printed out,

663
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,685
from which computer, and by whom.

664
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,221
You should know this, of course.

665
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,258
So we asked the System Department.

666
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,961
-Please check this code.
-Okay.

667
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:35,606
This document was printed out
by Branch Manager Saegusa.

668
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,344
If you disagree,

669
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:46,116
we can take it to an appropriate agency
for a handwriting analysis.

670
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:52,022
All I did was recover the loan
for the sake of our bank.

671
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,724
What's wrong with that?

672
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,959
I might have been a little aggressive.

673
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,628
But that company was done with

674
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,596
whether I collected the money or not.

675
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:06,170
It is so annoying that you're bringing up
an old loan that ended over a year ago.

676
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,304
It's over.

677
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,709
With all due respect…

678
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,645
it isn't over yet.

679
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,247
What isn't over yet?

680
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:24,188
The lives of the people who used to
work for Tokita Glass.

681
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,156
What?

682
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,327
You pushed a loan on them
when their business was good

683
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,397
but forced it back
when their business went down.

684
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:39,603
Do loans only exist for the selfish
benefit and profit of the bank?

685
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,439
You don't understand anything.

686
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,274
The bank is…

687
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,211
Putting the bank first won't justify
all your actions.

688
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,681
-You are so arrogant. Shut up!
-No, I won't!

689
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:57,988
What you did robbed people
of their livelihood.

690
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,960
But their lives have continued on.

691
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,332
So don't you dare say that it's all over.

692
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,970
Lend an umbrella when it is sunny

693
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,239
and take it away when it rains.

694
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:20,844
Branch Manager Saegusa,
you just bullied the weak.

695
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,347
That's definitely wrong!

696
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:34,291
I did nothing wrong.

697
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,762
I… I…

698
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,264
Mr. Saegusa.

699
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,200
Yes, Executive Director Shindo.

700
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,003
You…

701
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,072
did a wrong thing.

702
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,917
I heard that you will bring in Saegusa
to be questioned

703
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,319
by the inquiry commission.

704
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:36,787
Yes.

705
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,292
You're okay with that?
He was in your faction.

706
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,029
No problem.

707
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:51,235
I'm not so weak as to sway
over a small matter such as this.

708
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,471
I see.

709
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:03,513
You are a stronger rival than I thought.

710
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,649
Thank you.

711
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,094
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

712
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,463
Yes. I will be happy to visit.

713
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,099
Okay. We'll be waiting for you.

714
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,167
My wife wants to see you too.

715
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:29,072
Please say hello to Mr. Soma.

716
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,042
Yes, I will. See you then.

717
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,146
What did Mr. Kuga say?

718
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,817
He said he will be a guarantor
for Mr. Tsuneo Tokita.

719
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,653
I see.

720
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,156
What kind of sentence will he receive?

721
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,693
I'm sure they will take
his situation into consideration.

722
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,828
I don't think he'll get a heavy penalty.

723
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,530
You're right.

724
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,734
Guess what Mr. Kuga said?

725
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,340
He said, "I wish I had met bankers
like you a lot sooner."

726
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,745
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

727
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:14,251
Mr. Soma, I will work hard.

728
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,353
I gained a little courage.

729
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,356
I think both Mr. Kuga

730
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:24,761
and Executive Director Shindo
changed a little bit.

731
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:30,233
Maybe I can make some changes
if I work even harder.

732
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,604
So I will keep a positive attitude.

733
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,974
-Hanasaki.
-Yes.

734
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:38,942
Don't work hard.

735
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,510
Huh?

736
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,779
It's nice to be positive.

737
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,349
But nothing good happens when
you work too hard.

738
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,917
That's not true.

739
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,853
Yes, it is. Yes. Definitely yes.

740
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,221
-No.
-Yes.

741
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,890
-No!
-Yes!

742
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,032
Kuranaka Kensetsu?

743
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:07,204
Yes. There is a rumor that
they will go bankrupt soon.

744
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,275
We gave a substantial loan
to that company.

745
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,712
It will be a problem if they go bankrupt.

746
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,550
Hopefully it's just a rumor.

747
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,621
Excuse me.

748
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,793
Kuranaka Kensetsu…

749
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,036
Executive Director Shindo
accepted a bribe?

750
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,638
Are you admitting that it happened?

751
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,939
This bank is finished.

752
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,508
Why did you do it?

753
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,742
Enough. Shut up.

754
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,878
Let's go find the 100 million yen.

755
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,981
You're saying that you still want to
protect this bank?
