1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,804
BRANCH INSPECTION

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,842
I'm so bored.

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,043
Really?

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,847
There's been no branch inspection
since yesterday.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,382
That's a good thing.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:19,686
If we're bored, it means all the branches
nationwide are running smoothly.

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,820
There's peace.

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,924
I know, but I feel like
I'm getting out of shape.

9
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,895
Can I ask you something?

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,597
Inspection?

11
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:34,000
Well… not really.

12
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,635
Administrative support?

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,536
No.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,439
Well…

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:44,044
I want you to help the Secretarial Office.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,079
-Help them?
-I'll do it.

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,314
Really?

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,617
-Thanks. I appreciate it.
-Yes.

19
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,652
I have a bad feeling about this.

20
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,429
Thank you for coming.

21
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,631
Welcome. Please enjoy.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,872
You have to be a wife
of the bank's president

23
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,909
in order to open an art exhibition
at a place like this.

24
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,179
This is clearly not a job
for Branch Inspection.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,415
It's better than sitting all day.

26
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,221
This is all very new since I've never seen
the world of the bankers' wives.

27
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,989
Congratulations.

28
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,559
Thank you for coming.

29
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,761
It's an honor.

30
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,363
I was moved by the art.
They are all wonderful.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,034
I would like to buy
the picture over there.

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,702
Me, too.

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,439
That seems to be a pretty tough world.

34
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,474
I agree.

35
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,312
Oh. Here comes the president.

36
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,154
PRESIDENT OF TOKYO DAIICHI BANK
RYUICHI SERIZAWA

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,357
I'm glad you came.

38
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,526
I happened to have some time.

39
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,727
It seems to be busy.

40
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,295
Thank you.

41
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,265
He seems to be a calm person.

42
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,434
You talk as if you've never met him.

43
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,936
I haven't seen him
since the welcoming ceremony.

44
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,240
Yeah, ordinary employees like us
don't see him that often.

45
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,442
Excuse me, can I have a glass of wine?

46
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,710
Sure.

47
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,713
What are you doing, Hanasaki?

48
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,181
I am sorry.

49
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,150
Here you are.

50
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,218
Thank you.

51
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,689
Ms. Hanasaki,
are you in Branch Inspection?

52
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,057
Yes.

53
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,194
I see. It was you.

54
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,863
I am Shindo's wife.

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,431
Executive Director Shindo?

56
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,069
But, how do you know me?

57
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,704
SHINDO'S WIFE YOSHIKO SHINDO

58
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:56,009
He doesn't usually talk about
his work at home.

59
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,744
But he told me once that

60
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,448
he was scolded by
a high-spirited female employee.

61
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,517
That person was you, Ms. Hanasaki.

62
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,853
Oh, I wouldn't say that I scolded…

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,321
It's not a compliment.

64
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,090
Mrs. Shindo.

65
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,195
Congratulations.

66
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,629
Thank you for coming.

67
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,666
Even their wives have a good relationship.

68
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,234
It seems like it.

69
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,637
President Serizawa likes
Executive Director Shindo.

70
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,808
Please come visit us
with your husband. Right, dear?

71
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,843
Yes. Please come.

72
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,245
Thank you very much.

73
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,949
Look! Mr. Soma.

74
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,854
How scary!

75
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,793
At first glance, it's a world of shining
glamor with lots of smiling faces,

76
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,696
but it's actually filled
with lots of drama.

77
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,566
Executive Director Shindo is
a candidate for the next president,

78
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,868
so his wife seemed to be
the object of envy.

79
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,939
It must be tough for the wives who are
affected by their husband's careers.

80
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,208
People say that President Serizawa

81
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,078
recommended Mr. Shindo
to become the executive director.

82
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,113
So it probably makes everyone jealous.

83
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,185
The president's wife is
at the top of all the bankers' wives.

84
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,921
What? What about a banker's wife?

85
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,055
-Here.
-Thank you.

86
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,324
You never miss that kind of thing.

87
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,227
We had a chance to see their world today.

88
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,529
How was it?

89
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,932
Do you think you can be a banker's wife?

90
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,935
Me, too!

91
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,737
I don't think I can do that.

92
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,738
What is that?

93
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,241
By the way, I found an article
in the magazine.

94
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,342
About what?

95
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,678
About the president of your bank.

96
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,880
-Right.
-It's him.

97
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,716
He's the president, so I thought
he'd be arrogant.

98
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,085
But he is smiling with a bear.

99
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,222
He seems to be a friendly person.

100
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,224
I have a good idea, Mai.

101
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,594
Why don't you become the president's wife?

102
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,564
I told you that I never
dreamed of such a thing.

103
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,433
You should dream big.

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,734
I agree.

105
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,837
The president's wife is
at the top of all the bankers' wives.

106
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,673
That's a great idea!

107
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,976
Good morning.

108
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,344
Good morning.

109
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,614
It's shocking. That was a big company.

110
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,215
There were rumors.

111
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,318
Can't believe Kuranaka went bankrupt.

112
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,053
Bankrupt?

113
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,658
Did our bank have any business with
Kuranaka Kensetsu?

114
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,592
Yes.

115
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,263
Will they have unrecoverable debts?

116
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm sure we won't come out of this
unscathed.

117
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,369
We're in trouble.

118
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,839
What's wrong, Mr. Shibasaki?

119
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,308
We know that Kuranaka Kensetsu
went bankrupt.

120
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,911
No, it's not that.

121
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,013
He is asking you to come.

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,214
Who is?

123
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,849
Mr. Doujima.

124
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,117
Mr. Doujima?

125
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,928
He apparently has
a secret mission for the two of you.

126
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,096
A secret mission?

127
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,166
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

128
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,715
What do you think the secret mission is?

129
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,050
I have no idea.

130
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,454
Senior Executive Director must trust us
a lot to send us on a mission.

131
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,191
Hanasaki.

132
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,394
Don't work too hard.

133
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,963
Bad things happen when you work too hard.

134
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,599
-Okay?
-That's not nice.

135
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,835
I want you to do me a favor.

136
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,272
You know that Kuranaka Kensetsu
went bankrupt, right?

137
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,673
Yes.

138
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,943
We've provided them
with 50 billion yen in loans.

139
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,580
It seems like five billion yen will be
unrecoverable.

140
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,449
Five billion yen…

141
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,553
The Finance Department
is working on that right now.

142
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,356
But there is an even bigger problem.

143
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,658
May I ask what that is?

144
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,962
President Kuranaka's chaotic management
has been revealed.

145
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,199
It seems like he has billions
in a slush fund.

146
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,169
The Director of Finance received an email

147
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,939
from a whistleblower who claims to be
an employee

148
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,775
of Kuranaka Kensetsu.

149
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,076
May I see it?

150
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,547
One hundred million yen
from the slush fund

151
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,850
was given to
Tokyo Daiichi Bank as a bribe.

152
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,084
Bribery…

153
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:37,490
So I want you to contact this person
and confirm the facts.

154
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,061
Why have you assigned us
with such an important task?

155
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,832
If what is written in the email is true,

156
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,669
it must be someone
of considerable power within our bank.

157
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,307
If that person found out about this,
he would try to cover up the truth.

158
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,643
But no one cares about what you are doing.

159
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,279
I see.

160
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,681
Will you work on this?

161
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,150
Yes, I will.

162
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,351
Yes.

163
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:10,656
This could become a serious scandal
that will shake our bank to its roots.

164
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,925
Please take care of this.

165
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,561
-Yes!
-You are so loud.

166
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,666
Do you think he will really come?

167
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,769
He replied and said that he would.
Let's wait.

168
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,205
You're right…

169
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,908
Why are you carrying this?

170
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,644
I thought I'd carry this
so that he can recognize us.

171
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,312
Is that him?

172
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,150
No.

173
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,620
Why couldn't you bring

174
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,889
something like an envelope.

175
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:43,890
Who cares?

176
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,725
Are you from Tokyo Daiichi Bank?

177
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes.

178
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,462
I am Nishizaki.

179
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,365
I was the administrative manager
of Kuranaka Kensetsu.

180
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,933
MASATO NISHIZAKI

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,472
Our company's bankruptcy has caused
a lot of trouble for our customers.

182
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,609
I feel a sense of responsibility
as an employee.

183
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,179
You wrote in your email that

184
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,350
our bank received a bribe
of 100 million yen.

185
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,952
Yes.

186
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,387
It is true.

187
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,958
Five years ago, our company failed
in a real-estate investment

188
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,760
and faced serious financial crisis.

189
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:27,166
We applied for an unreasonable
additional loan from Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

190
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,304
Did our bank approve the loan
and receive money in return?

191
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,272
Yes.

192
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,643
If this information becomes public,

193
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,713
it will cause a huge scandal
for Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

194
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,951
So I thought I should let you know
as soon as possible.

195
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,419
I see.

196
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:53,259
Do you know the name of the employee
who received the 100 million yen?

197
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,563
He was the Director of Finance
at the time of the loan approval.

198
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,669
This is a copy of the secret account

199
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,405
the president had been hiding.

200
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,644
TAKESHI SHINDO

201
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,180
Takeshi Shindo…

202
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,848
It's Executive Director Shindo.

203
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,822
He was the Director of Finance
at headquarters five years ago.

204
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,626
I can't believe it's him.

205
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,228
But Mr. Soma,

206
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,799
this can't be enough evidence to prove
that he received a bribe, right?

207
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,669
No. This is not enough.

208
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,805
But the money was transferred to
the account at Hakusui Bank.

209
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,009
So we can't investigate any further.

210
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,545
I got it.

211
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,884
Do you have a copy of the transfer
request form for this transaction?

212
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,420
That will give us proof.

213
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:00,626
It might be stored
in the president's secret storage.

214
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,028
His secret storage?

215
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:06,132
I found storage that the president
is using for personal purposes.

216
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,336
So I made a spare key and inspected it.

217
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,238
That's where I found this list.

218
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,407
I see.

219
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,244
Will you take us there?

220
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,483
But the president may have
gotten rid of them already.

221
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,318
Please take us there.

222
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,826
This way.

223
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,463
Please wait here.

224
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,843
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

225
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,863
TAKESHI SHINDO

226
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,100
Did you find it?

227
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,903
TAKESHI SHINDO

228
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,806
This is clear evidence, isn't it?

229
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,942
Yes.

230
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,147
Someone is coming. Please hurry up.

231
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,496
I think the president
sent his people here.

232
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,464
That was close.

233
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:52,338
There's no doubt that
Executive Director Shindo received money.

234
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,340
That seems to be the case.

235
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,576
Why did he do such a thing?

236
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,413
He's got rank and honor,

237
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,183
and is expected to be
the president someday.

238
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,486
Isn't it weird that he was swayed
with some money?

239
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,055
But he received 100 million yen.
That's a fact.

240
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,323
I know, but…

241
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,324
Hanasaki.

242
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,928
We will leave it to
the management from here on.

243
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,297
Our assignment is done.

244
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,501
Tomorrow, we will report this to
Senior Executive Director Doujima.

245
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,170
And that's it.

246
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,844
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

247
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,180
Good morning.

248
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,850
She isn't usually late…

249
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,193
That idiot.

250
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,002
Yes.

251
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,105
Excuse me.

252
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,413
This is not a place
that an ordinary banker can freely visit.

253
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:12,251
I would like to ask you something
as an ordinary banker.

254
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,352
What is it?

255
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,589
It's about the loan to Kuranaka Kensetsu.

256
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,161
You approved an additional loan
for Kuranaka Kensetsu

257
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,563
five years ago when you were in Finance.

258
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,633
I have been in charge of many loans.

259
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,502
I don't remember everything.

260
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,106
I'm sure you remember this one.

261
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,310
This is a copy
of the transfer request form

262
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,248
issued on June 10th, 2010
when Kuranaka Kensetsu

263
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:47,586
transferred 100 million yen to
Takeshi Shindo's account at Hakusui Bank.

264
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,858
This is your personal account,
isn't it Mr. Shindo?

265
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,527
Where was that?

266
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,597
I found it inside President Kuranaka's
secret storage.

267
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,702
Did you receive the money?

268
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,908
What am I supposed to deny,

269
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,945
after you showed me such a thing?

270
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,815
Why?

271
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,318
Why did you do this?

272
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,590
Whenever you covered up scandals
within our bank,

273
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:30,062
you always said that
you're doing it for the bank.

274
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,135
I couldn't understand your ways at all.

275
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,774
But I understood that you always had

276
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,944
a strong conviction
for doing what's best for the bank.

277
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:51,150
But receiving a bribe from a company,

278
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,751
doesn't benefit the bank.

279
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,487
It's for your personal benefit.

280
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,822
It is not like you--

281
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,757
Hanasaki, that's enough. Shut up.

282
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,925
No, I won't!

283
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:06,131
I still can't believe that you did
something illegal like this.

284
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,335
Please explain to me why you did this.

285
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,944
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Soma.

286
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,118
Executive Director Shindo,
I will apologize on her behalf.

287
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,888
Let's go, Hanasaki.

288
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,325
What are you doing? Come on.

289
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
What are you doing without me?

290
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,339
But…

291
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,343
-Soma?
-Kodama.

292
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,180
What happened?

293
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,332
TSUYOSHI SHINDO

294
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,301
So that's what it was.

295
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,371
I can't believe that it was
Executive Director Shindo.

296
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,275
You did a great job.

297
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,209
Not at all.

298
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,812
Um…

299
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,649
What will happen to
Executive Director Shindo?

300
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,722
I can't decide that by myself.

301
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,594
But he must take responsibility for this.

302
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,109
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

303
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,244
I see.

304
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,146
This is going to be a problem.

305
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,047
Yes.

306
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,515
SECRETARIAL OFFICE ARAKI MAKOTO

307
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,984
President, what should we do?

308
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,222
Arrange an emergency meeting
with the Board of Directors.

309
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:11,924
Huh?

310
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:17,763
These things must be dealt with
quickly and fairly.

311
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:20,966
Right away.

312
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,236
I had great hopes for Mr. Shindo.

313
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,773
I am disappointed.

314
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,385
KURANAKA KENSETSU

315
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,554
Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office
has started

316
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,756
an investigation with Kuranaka Kensetsu.

317
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:49,094
It is suspected that there are slush funds
worth billions of yen.

318
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,997
<i>Their fraudulent management</i>
<i>is about to be revealed.</i>

319
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,668
The investigation has finally started.

320
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:01,507
Will they know that our bank
received a part of the slush fund?

321
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,542
It's possible.

322
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,146
In that case, it is going to be
a big scandal for Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

323
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,552
Thank you for working hard for our bank

324
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,087
until now.

325
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:20,225
But now that it's come to this,
we have no other choice.

326
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,961
I'm sure you know

327
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,632
what to do.

328
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,235
Yes, I do.

329
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,750
Kodama.

330
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,054
What is it?

331
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,989
I have something.

332
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,258
-What?
-May I?

333
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes.

334
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,765
Hakusui Bank's account activity statement?

335
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,801
It's Executive Director Shindo's account.

336
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,538
How did you get this?

337
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,508
I went to Hakusui Bank and met

338
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,243
the person in charge of Kuranaka.

339
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,682
<i>Kuranaka Kensetsu's bankruptcy</i>
<i>has caused serious problems</i>

340
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,317
<i>for Hakusui Bank as well.</i>

341
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,319
<i>Their loss is huge like us.</i>

342
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>I asked them to exchange information</i>
<i>and they agreed.</i>

343
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,159
And they gave you this?

344
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,130
I also offered information
that is hidden from the public.

345
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,266
You did a great job.

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,068
Look here.

347
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,672
Kuranaka transferred 100 million yen to
his account on June 10th.

348
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,308
He withdrew all the money
in cash on the same day.

349
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,044
It's the entire amount.

350
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,914
-Don't you think it's strange?
-Yes.

351
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,417
Why did he withdraw this huge
amount of money in cash?

352
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,087
What did he do with the 100 million yen?

353
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,589
I think he withdrew the money

354
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,058
from his account
to give it to someone else.

355
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,959
What?

356
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,795
I heard from someone in Finance

357
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:08,700
that Mr. Shindo was strongly opposed
to approving Kuranaka's additional loan.

358
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,337
But he approved it at the last minute.

359
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,241
They said someone must have pressured him.

360
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,579
I'm confused.

361
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,813
Listen.

362
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,482
Approving the additional loan

363
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,584
that he was originally opposed to,

364
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,820
and receiving the bribe
were all not done by his own will.

365
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,457
Someone ordered him to do so.

366
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,261
Do you mean that someone
put pressure on him

367
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,398
to receive 100 million yen
and approve the loan?

368
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,102
Executive Director Shindo
was used by someone.

369
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,774
Is Executive Director Shindo
taking the blame for someone?

370
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,609
Most likely.

371
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,014
Mr. Kodama.
Do you know where Mr. Shindo is now?

372
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,482
What?

373
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,356
Please wait, Mr. Shindo.

374
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,091
What is it now?

375
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,797
Who are you trying to cover for?

376
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:13,865
Cover?

377
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,934
What are you saying?

378
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,439
You didn't receive
the 100 million yen, right?

379
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,844
Mr. Shindo,

380
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,648
you withdrew the entire 100 million yen

381
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,718
soon after it was transferred from
Kuranaka Kensetsu.

382
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,725
Didn't you give it to someone else?

383
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,229
If so, who was it?

384
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,669
Why won't you tell us?

385
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,807
Is it for the bank?

386
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,548
Hanasaki.

387
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,388
You told me before that
you will change the bank.

388
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:15,193
But I'm sure you're starting to
understand that such a thing

389
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,029
is impossible.

390
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,500
The bank will never change.

391
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,169
You can never change it.

392
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:30,609
There are rules
and unspoken agreements in the bank

393
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,979
that people within the bank
can understand. That's--

394
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,248
That's how a bank works?

395
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,118
-Right.
-That's not right.

396
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,623
It's wrong that you can't change anything
even when things aren't right.

397
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,425
I can't ruin this bank.

398
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,900
Are you saying that this bank will
be ruined if the truth comes out?

399
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,205
Answer me, Executive Director Shindo.

400
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,678
If so…

401
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,083
if that will ruin this bank,
then this bank should be ruined.

402
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,518
Don't say such a thing.

403
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,924
Excuse me.

404
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,975
You've been going back and forth,
like a tiger in a zoo.

405
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,510
Mr. Soma.

406
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,946
Isn't there anything we can do?

407
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,715
I understand that, but…

408
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,153
I know that Executive Director Shindo
is covering for someone.

409
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,389
But he himself is keeping silent.

410
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,791
There is nothing we can do.

411
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,030
Branch Inspection.

412
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>This is Shindo.</i>

413
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes?

414
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,611
I'm sorry to bother you.

415
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,779
It's okay. Is there anything wrong?

416
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,481
Yes…

417
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,451
Um…

418
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,420
Shindo came home earlier.

419
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,924
He looked strange,
so I asked him what happened.

420
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,227
He said that he will probably
have to quit the bank.

421
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,698
Quit? Why?

422
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:39,571
I am not doing anything wrong as a banker.

423
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,041
I want you to know that.

424
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,644
Yes…

425
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,355
I think he is trying to protect the bank.

426
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,928
But Ms. Hanasaki, I don't get it.

427
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,331
I don't understand why
he is trying to protect the bank.

428
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,035
What's the point of sacrificing his life

429
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,570
for the bank?

430
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,676
For me, the honor of my husband,
Takeshi Shindo, is far more important

431
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:22,213
than the honor of the bank.

432
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:29,888
Ms. Hanasaki, would you please
save Shindo for me?

433
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,868
Is this Executive Director Shindo's
schedule book?

434
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,370
Yes.

435
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,440
I secretly brought a few years' worth.

436
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,242
I think you can find something in them.

437
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,211
He always takes notes.

438
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,549
But why are you asking me to do this?

439
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,786
He told me before that

440
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:08,994
you are a young, naïve idealist
who knows nothing about banks.

441
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,328
However…

442
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:15,700
A reckless banker like her
might be the one

443
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:21,606
who can change an old-fashioned bank
that is bound by its habits.

444
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:28,046
That's why I think I can trust you,
Ms. Hanasaki.

445
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,152
I will take these.

446
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,322
Thank you.

447
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,332
June 10th…

448
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,907
HAKUSUI BANK 100M TO RS

449
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,712
What is this?

450
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,848
What does this mean?

451
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:08,086
100M should be the amount of money.
He gave it to a person named RS.

452
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,421
RS?

453
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,656
Oh, no…

454
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,091
Could it be…

455
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,161
Ryuichi Serizawa.

456
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,364
President Serizawa.

457
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,001
Huh?

458
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,404
I can't believe this.

459
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:32,777
But it explains why
Mr. Shindo is keeping this a secret.

460
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,712
Yeah.

461
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,450
Is Executive Director Shindo trying
to cover for President Serizawa?

462
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,487
He feels indebted to President Serizawa.

463
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,357
And if the president's fraudulent act
is brought to light,

464
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,359
it would be an unprecedented scandal.

465
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,730
It could ruin Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

466
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,603
Mr. Shindo is trying
to prevent that by sacrificing himself.

467
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,341
But on paper, Mr. Shindo is the one
that received the money.

468
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,478
It doesn't say anything
about the president.

469
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,181
The schedule book can't be evidence?

470
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,916
No, that's not enough.

471
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,324
Kodama.

472
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,126
What are you doing here?

473
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,828
Mr. Araki. What's the matter?

474
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,396
I want to ask you something.

475
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,566
You investigated

476
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,702
Kuranaka's slush fund, right?

477
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,036
Yes.

478
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,907
Report it at a special board meeting
the day after tomorrow.

479
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,210
But it is…

480
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,478
Is there a problem?

481
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,814
No.

482
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,851
But we haven't found out the truth yet.

483
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,853
The truth?

484
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,125
Executive Director Shindo
received a bribe.

485
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,795
That's everything.

486
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,300
The entire bank may suffer the consequence
because of him.

487
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,869
This is unacceptable.

488
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,207
Listen.
Reveal all of Mr. Shindo's bad deeds.

489
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,113
Soma, this is a chance for you
to distinguish yourself.

490
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,985
You don't want to stay here forever
taking care of small assignments, right?

491
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,024
-Let's go, Kodama.
-Okay.

492
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,477
Is this how it should be?

493
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,750
Executive Director Shindo
will take responsibility,

494
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,320
and President Serizawa

495
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,188
will be left unharmed.

496
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,126
This is supposed to be wrong.

497
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:11,769
For the first time in my life,
I seriously want to

498
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,773
quit this bank.

499
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,012
Hanasaki.

500
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,550
You can't quit.

501
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,922
If you leave the bank,

502
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,526
you won't be able to raise your voice
against the wrong deeds anymore.

503
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,903
We can't change things
even when we speak out.

504
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,271
That's our bank.

505
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,675
But Hanasaki,

506
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,812
when everyone stops speaking up,

507
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,982
this bank will really see its end.

508
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,724
Let's go find the 100 million yen.

509
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,863
The president received money
from Kuranaka Kensetsu.

510
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,098
We will find the evidence.

511
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,100
That's the only way.

512
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,871
But if you do such a thing you'll…

513
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:25,009
Do you think I want to be
promoted at this bank right now?

514
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,052
If I have to keep my mouth shut
in order to survive here,

515
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,488
they can kiss my ass. Am I right?

516
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,858
Yes.

517
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,198
See you tomorrow.

518
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,172
-Come in.
-Thanks. Let's go.

519
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,807
This way.

520
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,144
Let's check the president's schedule
on June 10th, 2010.

521
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,212
Okay.

522
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,218
He must have received
the cash from Mr. Shindo somewhere

523
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,286
outside the bank.

524
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,221
SCHEDULE
JUNE 10TH 2010

525
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,155
SEARCH

526
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,826
Huh?

527
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,062
It seems like he stayed
at the bank all day.

528
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,465
He didn't go out.

529
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,266
I see.

530
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,870
He might not have gone on his own.

531
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,240
He wouldn't want to attract attention.

532
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,843
Maybe he sent his secretary.

533
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,080
How about checking the records
of the company car?

534
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,920
This is the record for
the president's car in June 2010.

535
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:44,989
Thank you.

536
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,125
DRIVING RECORD

537
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,262
He came to headquarters
from his house in Yoyogi-Uehara.

538
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,498
This car went out after that.

539
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,269
At 11:30 a.m., this car went
from headquarters to Kyobashi.

540
00:33:58,936 --> 00:33:59,837
Araki?

541
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,042
It seems like Mr. Araki used this car.

542
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,011
He was the president's secretary
five years ago.

543
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,850
This is the address
of Hakusui Bank's Kyobashi Branch.

544
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,919
Really?

545
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,322
So Mr. Shindo withdrew the 100 million yen

546
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,691
that was transferred from
Kuranaka Kensetsu,

547
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,662
and Mr. Araki received it
in place of the president?

548
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,231
What's important is
where the money went after that.

549
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,133
After that, the car went to…

550
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,169
The address is Ginza.

551
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,370
GINZA

552
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,978
It's the address of Fujiyama Kikinzoku.

553
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,314
Why did he go there?

554
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,018
Did he buy gold worth 100 million yen?

555
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,024
Gold bars worth 100 million yen…

556
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,026
It is about 5,000 yen per gram,

557
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:58,029
so gold bars worth
100 million yen would weigh 20 kg.

558
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,033
Considering the weight of gold,
it must be about this size.

559
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,001
It is smaller than I thought.

560
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,803
This is not good.

561
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,740
If he stored that in a deposit,
we'll never be able to find it.

562
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,676
Where did he go next?

563
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,378
-Minami-Senju.
-Minami-Senju?

564
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,950
He went back to headquarters after that.

565
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,887
Is there a place to store the gold bars?

566
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,190
I can't tell what's there from this map.

567
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,460
He visited those two places
after receiving the cash,

568
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,729
so there should be something there.

569
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,100
We must go there.

570
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,269
Okay.

571
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,240
FUJIYAMA KIKINZOKU

572
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,545
Hello.

573
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,823
There are many things other than
gold bars and accessories.

574
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,363
Hello, Hanasaki. How is it going?

575
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,901
The place Mr. Araki visited
after Fujiyama Kikinzoku,

576
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,203
is a paint factory in Minami-Senju.

577
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,738
Paint company?

578
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,407
Yes. It doesn't seem like

579
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,544
gold bars worth 100 million yen
are hidden in here.

580
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,616
I see people coloring statues
and artworks.

581
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,385
Coloring?

582
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,055
<i>Yes. I wonder why he came here.</i>

583
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,358
Hanasaki.

584
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,262
I think I know
where the 100 million yen went.

585
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,398
What?

586
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,535
DAY OF THE MEETING
WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

587
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,236
Let's start the meeting
with the Board of Directors.

588
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,941
As you may know,
today's topic is about the money

589
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,579
from Kuranaka Kensetsu's slush fund
that was

590
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,348
given to our bank.

591
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,252
Branch Inspection has
investigated this case.

592
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,021
They will give us the report.

593
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,158
I am Soma from Branch Inspection.

594
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,526
I am Hanasaki.

595
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,769
Let me explain what we have found.

596
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,873
It is said that Kuranaka Kensetsu

597
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,776
has a slush fund worth billions of yen.

598
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,913
We were told that our bank
received some of that money.

599
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,086
So we met the former administrative
manager of Kuranaka Kensetsu.

600
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,456
From there, we found out that

601
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:18,496
an employee at our bank had received
100 million yen as a bribe five years ago.

602
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,067
Kuranaka Kensetsu had
financial problems at the time,

603
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,571
so they paid money in order to
get approved for an additional loan.

604
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,942
This is a copy of the transfer request
form for that transaction.

605
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,482
June 10th, 2010.
The total amount is 100 million yen.

606
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,287
Transferred to a personal account
at Hakusui Bank.

607
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,924
The account holder is Takeshi Shindo.

608
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,327
It's Mr. Shindo's account.

609
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,531
It was Mr. Shindo.

610
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,932
It wasn't a rumor?

611
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,203
Executive Director Shindo.

612
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:06,143
Do you admit that this is true?

613
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,114
Mr. Shindo!

614
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,985
Is that true, Mr. Shindo?

615
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,531
Please wait.

616
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,502
What is it?

617
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,971
We haven't finished yet.

618
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,172
Huh?

619
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,710
It is true that 100 million yen
was transferred to

620
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,645
Mr. Shindo's account five years ago.

621
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:47,118
However, Executive Director Shindo
didn't receive that money.

622
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,154
He was just used by someone.

623
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,090
What does that mean?

624
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,193
After 100 million yen was transferred,

625
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,764
it was immediately withdrawn by
Mr. Shindo on the same day

626
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,868
at Hakusui Bank Kyobashi Branch,
and it was handed over to Mr. Araki.

627
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,773
Am I right, Mr. Araki?

628
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,778
What are you talking about?

629
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,180
I know nothing about that.

630
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,948
I have never gone to Hakusui Bank.

631
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,886
This is a record
of the president's company car.

632
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,023
It is recorded that on June 10th, 2010,

633
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,926
Mr. Araki used the president's company car

634
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,963
to go to Hakusui Bank's Kyobashi Branch.

635
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,936
I don't know.

636
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,005
I didn't do that.

637
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:46,043
We understand that you would do
no such a thing on your own.

638
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,382
Everything was done
by the order of one person.

639
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,454
This person put pressure on Mr. Shindo,

640
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,590
who was the Director of Finance
five years ago,

641
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:05,196
to approve the additional loan for
Kuranaka Kensetsu.

642
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,567
In return,
he had 100 million yen transferred

643
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:14,505
not to his personal account,
but to Mr. Shindo's account,

644
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,608
and sent his secretary Mr. Araki,
to receive the money.

645
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:24,281
There's only one person at this bank
who could have done such a thing.

646
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,953
It was you, President Serizawa.

647
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,327
How could you say such a thing
to the president?

648
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,561
It is an insult.

649
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,197
Do you know what you are saying?

650
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,866
Ms. Hanasaki.

651
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,436
Do you have any evidence
to prove what you have just said?

652
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,805
Yes, I do.

653
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,920
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

654
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,529
Why did you bring such a thing?

655
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,598
I am sorry.

656
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,935
But I borrowed it
because we really needed this.

657
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,575
As you know, this is our bank's mascot,
named Daichi-kun, created to

658
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,844
commemorate the first anniversary of

659
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,245
Mr. Serizawa's presidency.

660
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,716
This is to be given to you as a gift
when you retire.

661
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,286
-Am I right?
-Yes.

662
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,087
So what?

663
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,061
Please look.

664
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,605
Hey! What are you doing?

665
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,511
This is pure gold.

666
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,586
This evidence proves that
President Serizawa

667
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,822
received the 100 million yen.

668
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,663
I will explain where
the 100 million yen went

669
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,234
after Mr. Shindo withdrew it in cash
and handed it over to Mr. Araki.

670
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,871
We traced the records of his car.

671
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,209
<i>Mr. Araki went to</i>
<i>Fujiyama Kikinzoku in Ginza</i>

672
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:36,680
<i>and received the golden statue</i>
<i>of Daichi-kun that was ordered beforehand.</i>

673
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,918
<i>He paid for the statue with</i>
<i>100 million yen in cash.</i>

674
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,356
<i>Right after that, he went to</i>
<i>a paint factory in Minami-Senju,</i>

675
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,258
<i>to cover the gold statue with paint.</i>

676
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,232
It was to camouflage the fact
that this statue is pure gold.

677
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,903
This is a copy of the receipt
for the gold statue,

678
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,641
that we borrowed from Fujiyama Kikinzoku.

679
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,878
This is the order form
received by the paint factory

680
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,314
to paint the statue.

681
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:15,919
Both were clearly signed by Mr. Araki.

682
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,156
No, it was…

683
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,028
Everything was done by President Serizawa

684
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,665
because he received 100 million yen
from Kuranaka Kensetsu

685
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:33,237
and wanted to keep it at hand
without causing any suspicion.

686
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,807
Do you admit it?

687
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,150
I don't know anything about that.

688
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,589
I am the president of Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

689
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,892
I would never do such a thing.

690
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,064
Wasn't it Mr. Shindo
who received the bribe?

691
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,869
This scandal was caused by Shindo.

692
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,239
I have nothing to do with it.

693
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,717
I don't get it.

694
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,721
I don't understand why he is trying
so hard to protect the bank.

695
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,357
What's the point of sacrificing his life

696
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,892
for the bank?

697
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,530
<i>Would you please save Shindo for me?</i>

698
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,035
With all due respect…

699
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:47,911
The person who caused this scandal
is you, President Serizawa.

700
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,247
What?

701
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,850
You're just an ordinary employee.

702
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,285
-Shut up.
-No, I won't!

703
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,922
The boss takes credit for the achievements

704
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,858
but blames his subordinates.

705
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,394
That rule is only accepted at this bank.

706
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:13,003
Even a child can tell that it is wrong.

707
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,408
But at this bank,
bosses naturally force their subordinates

708
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,412
to take blame for their mistakes,
responsibilities,

709
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,381
and even wrongdoings.

710
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,487
However, everyone working at this bank

711
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,892
is a human being before they are a banker.

712
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,564
Everyone has their own precious family
and personal lives to look after.

713
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,670
That's why they all grit their teeth
and continue to work.

714
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,943
When I see those people suffering,
I get so frustrated

715
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,346
that I have to speak out.

716
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,318
This bank is wrong.

717
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,088
Mr. Shindo.

718
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:07,524
Do you…

719
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,830
still insist on protecting
this kind of a bank?

720
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:19,670
Is it worth sacrificing your faith,
life, and family

721
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,806
to protect this bank?

722
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:42,359
Is there anyone who can teach
this rude employee a lesson?

723
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,070
Ms. Hanasaki.

724
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,574
You might be right.

725
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,216
When I was the Director of Finance
five years ago,

726
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,821
I approved the additional loan for
Kuranaka Kensetsu.

727
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,827
A few days after that,
100 million yen was transferred

728
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,530
from Kuranaka Kensetsu
to my personal account.

729
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,168
I handed…

730
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,405
the money over to Mr. Araki…

731
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,743
even though I knew that it was a bribe.

732
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,481
Everything…

733
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,051
was ordered by President Serizawa.

734
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,222
Shindo!

735
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,230
I accepted everything because

736
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,199
I always thought it was best for the bank.

737
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,739
If it came out that the president
did something illegal,

738
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,676
this bank would be ruined.

739
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,245
That's what I thought.

740
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:13,283
But I was wrong.

741
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,020
If we keep doing such things,

742
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,058
this bank will one day rot and decay.

743
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,828
It needs to be changed
before that happens.

744
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,631
I mean,

745
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,968
we must change it.

746
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,203
Change?

747
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,841
Are you trying to deny
the history of our bank? Then try that!

748
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,343
It will ruin this bank!

749
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,380
With all due respect…

750
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,953
if that will ruin this bank,

751
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,458
then this rotten bank should be ruined.

752
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:10,741
Here I witness the incident of injustice

753
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:13,810
by President Serizawa,

754
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,481
and apologize for having taken part in it.

755
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,416
I am very sorry.

756
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,859
Shindo!

757
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,394
Damn you…

758
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,797
I have been taking special care of you.

759
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,999
Who do you think put you in that position?

760
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:48,111
I call for the president's removal.

761
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,049
Please stand up…

762
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,218
if you give your approval.

763
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,476
The president has been removed
from his post

764
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,978
by unanimous vote.

765
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:11,962
<i>We have news that</i>

766
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,531
<i>the top management of Tokyo Daiichi Bank</i>

767
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,167
<i>received 100 million yen of illegal funds</i>

768
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,035
<i>from Kuranaka Kensetsu.</i>

769
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,738
<i>Former President Serizawa</i>
<i>is under investigation now</i>

770
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,674
<i>by the Tokyo District Public</i>
<i>Prosecutors Office.</i>

771
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,011
Mom.

772
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,215
I really wanted to quit
the bank this time.

773
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:38,488
But the bank is not as rotten
as I thought.

774
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:44,227
So I will work harder.

775
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,266
Whoa.

776
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:53,103
Don't come in so quietly.

777
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,804
You were just absentminded.

778
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,273
No, I wasn't.

779
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,977
I heard from Mr. Soma that you
spoke out in front of the president.

780
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,713
That blabbermouth.

781
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,617
I can't even ask for a discount
when I purchase ingredients.

782
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,321
You are just like your mom.

783
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,123
Am I?

784
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,327
That's what I really loved about your mom.

785
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,163
Dad.

786
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,734
-That's a little creepy.
-Mai.

787
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,503
I have to go now.

788
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,371
Do you have everything you need?

789
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,608
I am not a kid in elementary school.

790
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,677
-Oops.
-See?

791
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,178
TOKYO DAIICHI BANK

792
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,181
Please go to the Takasaki Branch
for an inspection.

793
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,316
Good luck.

794
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,550
Yes.

795
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,287
It's time for the speech
by our new president.

796
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,495
Hello, everyone at Tokyo Daiichi Bank.

797
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:58,235
I am Doujima, and I have been
appointed as the new president.

798
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,673
Kodama.

799
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,542
Yes!

800
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,550
Thank you.

801
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,154
I can't agree with this.

802
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,525
Why have you been transferred
to a subsidiary company?

803
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,696
Even though I was just being used,

804
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,567
I kept hiding the injustice.

805
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,838
I have to take responsibility for that.

806
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,179
I will wait for your return.

807
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:59,162
As a result of the reports
regarding the recent incident,

808
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,564
many customers have closed their accounts

809
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,502
<i>and we have lost many business partners.</i>

810
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:10,774
It must be tough to become
the president at a time like this.

811
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,311
Mr. Karashima.

812
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,881
Those two left already for the inspection.

813
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,717
I didn't notice.

814
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:26,089
<i>Until now, our bank had been relying on</i>
<i>our position as a mega bank</i>

815
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,826
<i>that supported the Japanese economy.</i>

816
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,562
<i>But I can make it clear now that</i>

817
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,568
Tokyo Daiichi Bank was wrong.

818
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,975
What are you doing?

819
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,512
We are going to the Takasaki Branch
to inspect the loss of passbooks.

820
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,415
-I see.
-Yes.

821
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,855
Um…

822
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:04,627
I will continue to work hard
and do my best from now on.

823
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:10,033
So that when you come back,
you will notice the difference

824
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,436
in this bank,
even if it's only a small change.

825
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,307
You may not have enough time.

826
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,345
I will be back soon.

827
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,617
With all due respect…

828
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,954
I will be fine

829
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,691
because I will start working hard
right away.

830
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,867
Excuse me.

831
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,282
<i>I will get rid of this bank's</i>
<i>internal rules.</i>

832
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,584
<i>We must change our bank.</i>

833
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,353
-We are late.
-Let's go.

834
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,022
<i>If the bank is ruined by doing that,</i>

835
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:10,593
then such a rotten bank should be ruined.

836
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:16,032
<i>A female employee taught me that.</i>

837
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,868
Who is he talking about?

838
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:26,476
Today's lunch is Himokawa udon.

839
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,545
No. Let's eat pasta.

840
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:34,150
I want to ask for help from
all employees all over Japan.

841
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,686
<i>Each person's power may be meager,</i>

842
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:42,091
<i>but it will become a bigger power</i>
<i>when we work together.</i>

843
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,995
<i>Today is the day we take our first step.</i>

844
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:53,470
<i>Let's change Tokyo Daiichi Bank together.</i>

845
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:59,676
-Why don't we eat both?
-Sure.

846
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,480
Okay. Let's work hard!

847
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,848
Okay.

848
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,617
Hey! Wait for me.

849
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,887
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL
