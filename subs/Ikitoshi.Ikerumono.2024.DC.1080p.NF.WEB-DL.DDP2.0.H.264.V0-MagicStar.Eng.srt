1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,806
This is it.

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,850
This…

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,518
will make it…

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,521
into the shape of fire.

5
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,453
You really like that.

6
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,875
A miniature bonfire.

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,878
Please enjoy.

8
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,967
SCOTT JOPLIN

9
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,730
Did you officially stamp it?

10
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,107
Yes…

11
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,818
my kids were taken too.

12
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,073
When you gaze at this fire,

13
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,743
don't you feel as if you're being
left behind in time?

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,456
An escape from reality.

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,083
Should I…

16
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,086
quit being a doctor?

17
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,422
That again.

18
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,775
500 ML

19
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,111
NURSE STATION

20
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,123
Watching it slowly burn is quite boring.

21
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,689
ETIZOLAM

22
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,883
You told him?

23
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,470
I did.

24
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,266
I told him
that he's got three months left.

25
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,226
Why?

26
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,770
I was going to tell him.

27
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
But you weren't telling him.

28
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,486
Or perhaps you can't.

29
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,284
Is it even necessary

30
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,578
to tell people how much time
they have left?

31
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,881
Good work today, Mr. Naruse.

32
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,508
Yes.

33
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,260
How are you feeling today?

34
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,846
I'm doing okay.

35
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,431
I see.

36
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,933
-I'll open the door.
-Thank you very much.

37
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,476
Pardon us. We're coming in.

38
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
Excuse me.

39
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,772
Hello.

40
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,651
Let's turn here.

41
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,952
Heave-ho.

42
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,537
Here we go.

43
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,004
Would you like a blanket?

44
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,558
You're playing a crossword puzzle?

45
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,476
Yeah.

46
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,061
CROSSWORD PUZZLE

47
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,479
I'll excuse myself.

48
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,856
Chat…

49
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,359
Cha-, Cha-, Cha-, GP…

50
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,697
Chat…

51
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,536
That's not right.

52
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,925
Pardon me.

53
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,472
Mr. Naruse, how are you feeling?

54
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,974
At least knock before coming in.

55
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,351
It's a curtain.

56
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,441
You're finally here, Dr. Youngster.

57
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,443
"Dr. Youngster".

58
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,070
Quit calling me that.

59
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,031
If you can joke around, you must be fine…

60
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,200
or not.

61
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,035
I can't take painkillers yet.

62
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,870
It's only been two hours.

63
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,458
Then, maybe we can use a stabilizer.

64
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,045
Nothing can help this amount of pain.

65
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,050
Doctor,

66
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,886
I can't help how bad it hurts.

67
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,596
Yes.

68
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,142
Whenever I can bear it,

69
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,894
I only stare at the ceiling.

70
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,563
Right.

71
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,774
Why am I alive?

72
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,070
Doctor,

73
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,741
have you ever spent a day
staring at the ceiling?

74
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,828
Yes.

75
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,996
Huh?

76
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,083
To understand the lives

77
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,128
of my patients who can't get up from bed,

78
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,922
I spent one of my days off
lying on the sofa

79
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,217
for a full 24 hours without moving once.

80
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,303
Not for the bathroom?

81
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,513
I wore a diaper.

82
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,558
-Seriously?
-Yes.

83
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,811
I couldn't use a feeding tube,

84
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,813
so, I just kept
a Vitamin Jelly next to me.

85
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:07,737
I just thought
it was incredibly difficult.

86
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,658
You're amazing, Doctor.

87
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,327
Somehow…

88
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,287
I just had the time.

89
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:24,170
Doctor, I've heard
how much time I have left.

90
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,297
Yes.

91
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,882
I've heard.

92
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,300
From Mr. Komiya.

93
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,053
Won't you just kill me?

94
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,311
It's spread from my colon to my liver.

95
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
How many years has it been?

96
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,275
I've gone through
so many operations and medicines.

97
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:53,533
There's no point in living just to suffer.

98
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,537
It'll only get worse from here.

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,458
I'm scared, and I want to die.

100
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,633
Okay.

101
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
I can

102
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,473
accept that.

103
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,354
Really?

104
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,815
Yes.

105
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,276
You're my Lucky Seventh.

106
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,281
Ever since I joined internal medicine,

107
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,284
I've heard people tell me,
"Doctor, I've had enough."

108
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,077
You're the seventh person

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,540
to tell me that they want to die.

110
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,627
I can't move. I'm bedridden.

111
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,131
Some people die of the pain.

112
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,844
Only five minutes with potassium.

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,266
If we first administer Propofol,

114
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,059
it can be just like falling asleep.

115
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,067
Is that potassium…

116
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,362
available immediately?

117
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,616
Not immediately, but we can get it.

118
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,493
It's in our medicine storage.

119
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,866
Mr. Naruse,

120
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,870
won't you try to live?

121
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,166
Won't you try to live before you die?

122
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,759
Before you die…

123
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,970
won't you live?

124
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,730
You measured 75/115.

125
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,777
"Ten things to do before I die."

126
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,155
That Youngster Doctor
told me to write it today.

127
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,409
"Live before you die."

128
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,661
What is this, some teen movie?

129
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:44,995
Ninety-eight.

130
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,123
Thank you very much.

131
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,792
Youngster.

132
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,838
Oh, that must be Doctor Sakura.

133
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,966
I secretly think of him
as a lifelong teenager.

134
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,636
Do you like him?

135
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,138
Huh?

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,473
Hit the mark.

137
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,641
Stop that!

138
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,060
-A forbidden love.
-Hey.

139
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,190
"Ten things to do before I die."

140
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,444
I want to do a quadruple jump.

141
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,653
Like Yuzuru Hanyu.

142
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,906
I can't think of anything.

143
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,784
Even if you ask me, there's nothing.

144
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,996
I'm just scared.

145
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm kidding. Don't make that face.

146
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,174
How's it looking?

147
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,508
Welcome back.

148
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,806
Huh? It's blank.

149
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,308
You see,

150
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,768
you watch too many stupid movies.

151
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,187
Those movies

152
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,106
with a dog that jumps in the water
and saves his owner

153
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,734
or patients with only a few months
to live hits it big.

154
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,237
I thought we could at least
check off your bucket list.

155
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,829
This isn't something worth
writing out, but…

156
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,830
Yes?

157
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,126
Don't you have pictures
hanging around here?

158
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,507
<i>Those pictures don't move.</i>

159
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,718
And the windows only open an inch.

160
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,012
So that no one jumps out.

161
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,140
You don't need to say all that.

162
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,101
We can't feel the wind here.

163
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,562
Although it's windy somewhere,

164
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,356
I could never feel it.

165
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,903
I may want to feel the breeze again.

166
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,995
Please hop on.

167
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,753
Hang on tight.

168
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,380
-You got it.
-Hey!

169
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,923
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much.

170
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,008
-That's dangerous.
-Let's go.

171
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,480
KANTO GENERAL HOSPITAL

172
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,170
That's dangerous.

173
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,922
Quit it!

174
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,048
Seriously.

175
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,302
It feels good.

176
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,150
We've come pretty far.

177
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,407
That's dangerous.

178
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,909
Don't do that!

179
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,911
That's dangerous!

180
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,791
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

181
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,793
My legs are all cramped.

182
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm beat.

183
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,599
That seems good.

184
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,896
Here you go.

185
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,732
Wow.

186
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,776
-It's hot!
-Yeah, it's hot.

187
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,194
It's been a while.

188
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,912
Delicious.

189
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
This sausage is great.

190
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,418
Eating is life.

191
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,133
That's not to say
hospital food is killing me,

192
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,552
but it's just sad.

193
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,516
Hot, hot, hot!

194
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,434
So hot!

195
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,227
Please be careful.

196
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,687
Yeah.

197
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,316
Mr. Naruse is temporarily discharged,

198
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,902
and Mr. Sakura has resigned.

199
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,489
No, I still have his resignation letter.

200
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,327
I'll tell the board chairman
that he's taking a day off.

201
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,500
Besides, isn't that guy still going
to a mental hospital?

202
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,003
Right, only just after the incident.

203
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,505
He's not going anymore.

204
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,800
So, they're just out on a trip?

205
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,051
Yes.

206
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
I received this from them.

207
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,314
<i>Shooting the gun we can't see</i>

208
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,024
Looks like they're having fun.

209
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>Your true voice</i>

210
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>This isn't heaven</i>

211
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,212
-Whoa!
-Oh, no!

212
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,214
Mr. Naruse, be careful!

213
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,177
Be careful.

214
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,775
Let's go!

215
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,698
Wow.

216
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,617
I've never seen this.

217
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
Isn't it cool?

218
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,042
It's like the fire
is trying to keep living.

219
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,378
Huh?

220
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,756
Just as it starts to fade,

221
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,218
each time,

222
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,888
it changes shape and burns on.

223
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,022
It looks to me as if it's desperately
trying to stay alive.

224
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,948
Maybe because I'll be dying first.

225
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,120
No,

226
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,749
it's because you're trying to stay alive.

227
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,083
Isn't that so?

228
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,380
Well said.

229
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,758
You almost made me feel better.

230
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,845
Mr. Naruse,
you've gotten hold of a Platinum Card.

231
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,430
That's me.

232
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,891
I'm your exclusive medical specialist.

233
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,268
Youngster, my exclusive specialist.

234
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,145
That's concerning.

235
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,148
Why do you keep calling me that?

236
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,359
You've got a baby face.

237
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
A little youngster. Dr. Youngster.

238
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,615
Old Man.

239
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,743
Shut up!

240
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,669
-Ms. Kanda.
-Yes?

241
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,462
I saw what happened.

242
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,256
REPORT ALL MEDICATION THAT IS TAKEN OUT

243
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
POTASSIUM

244
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,440
That seemed like potassium to me.

245
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,112
Mr. Yoshioka,

246
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,074
don't tell anyone.

247
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,334
So pretty.

248
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,339
-Hey, what's that?
-Don't worry about it.

249
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,843
That sausage was delicious.

250
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,723
Let me tell you the most
delicious thing I've ever eaten.

251
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,226
When I was in university,

252
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,020
I was camping out in nature

253
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
and cooked a sausage over charcoal.

254
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,233
That's youth.

255
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,655
I'm still not sure where I want to go,

256
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,866
but let's stay here for a minute.

257
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,867
Okay.

258
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,119
You must like it here?

259
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,372
Yes.

260
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,336
It's just that…

261
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,130
I'm a bit scared.

262
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,007
Huh?

263
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,427
For years now,

264
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,971
I've been in and out of the hospital,

265
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,057
and I think I've spent
more time inside it now.

266
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,645
I'll be discharged soon, and that's great,

267
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,024
but without a nurse,

268
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,567
I feel helpless.

269
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,945
I understand.

270
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,864
I'm scared

271
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,450
because this isn't a hospital.

272
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,331
-Mr. Naruse.
-No,

273
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,291
it's not that I want to go back.

274
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,876
Right.

275
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,048
I'm just a coward.

276
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,975
Two vials of 20cc potassium.

277
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,685
Yes.

278
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,066
Dr. Sakura.

279
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,070
We're missing two potassium vials.

280
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,948
I accidentally dropped them,

281
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,242
but I submitted a breakage report.

282
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,869
I gave the breakage report
to the head nurse

283
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,746
and tried to cover it up the best I could.

284
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,666
I see.

285
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,002
I understand.

286
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,382
I understand,

287
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,259
so, don't mention it.

288
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,053
Don't say anything.

289
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,013
Okay.

290
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:55,976
I know.

291
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,438
Just don't say anything.

292
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,541
Don't rich people

293
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,877
go to Switzerland or something?

294
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,003
Huh?

295
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,839
For euthanasia.

296
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,593
As of now,

297
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,512
several other countries
recognize the practice too.

298
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,515
For people who really can't live on,

299
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,101
several places accept it,

300
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,645
even without proof of life expectancy.

301
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,230
I see.

302
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,069
But in places like Switzerland,

303
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,406
doesn't the doctor
make the final judgment?

304
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,993
Thank you very much. I'll enjoy this.

305
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,245
Thank you.

306
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,335
Yes, there are several regulations

307
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,253
to determine

308
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,548
whether euthanasia is appropriate.

309
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,426
That's strange.

310
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,804
If I was given the option of euthanasia,

311
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,932
I'd be relieved,

312
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:21,102
but it'll still be a little shocking.

313
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,271
Huh?

314
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,233
I'm wondering if I'm doing that poorly,

315
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,943
objectively speaking.

316
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,491
I understand.

317
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,201
Really.

318
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,120
-You understand?
-Yes.

319
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,459
Although you want to die,

320
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,920
you want someone to say it's not that bad.

321
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,632
You want someone to tell you
to just hang on.

322
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,634
Isn't that right?

323
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,016
I suppose so.

324
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,143
-Don't push yourself.
-Okay.

325
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,106
Let's eat.

326
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,749
This is the magic potion number one.

327
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,837
And magic potion number two.

328
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,881
The first will kill you.

329
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,800
It will let you immediately go to rest.

330
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,053
The second will comfort you
for a short while.

331
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,139
It's a powerful painkiller.

332
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,099
Is this…

333
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,476
These are…

334
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,938
scary.

335
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,066
I was longing for them.

336
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,361
You can use them when you want.

337
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,947
The ingredients to peace.

338
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,118
I can choose to live or die.

339
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,330
If we have the right to live,
shouldn't we have the right to die?

340
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,457
No.

341
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,377
Or is living our duty?

342
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,425
A room deep in the hospital ward,

343
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,595
being unable to eat alone,

344
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,472
and a body full of tubes,

345
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,892
only feeding tubes, and never getting up,

346
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,729
and only wearing a diaper.

347
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,982
Do I really want to live for that?

348
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,735
Is that what everyone wants?

349
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,155
No, I'm not sure.

350
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,285
Doctors live to save people.

351
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,872
But I…

352
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,208
think that may be abuse.

353
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,713
Ever since you were born, Mr. Naruse,

354
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,757
medicine has evolved,

355
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,343
and average life expectancy has increased.

356
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,011
Yet,

357
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:05,683
does that really make people happy?

358
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,021
Well,

359
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,191
we die either way.

360
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,820
Whether it's by that magic potion

361
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,030
or by nature.

362
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,909
Mr. Naruse, aren't you a novelist?

363
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,744
Not so much anymore.

364
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,080
You're a writer,

365
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,124
so, you'll be leaving your work behind.

366
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,459
Whether I leave those behind or not

367
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,254
won't matter when I die.

368
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,341
Being born into this world
is overwhelming.

369
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,265
May I touch this?

370
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,149
This feeling is proof that I'm alive.

371
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,025
If I die,

372
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,237
I won't be able to touch it.

373
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,867
-Mr. Naruse.
-Call me Old Man.

374
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,787
There's no future for me.

375
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,331
I only have this time.

376
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,592
What are you doing, weirdo?

377
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,684
People's bodies…

378
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,063
are quite warm.

379
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,484
You're alive.

380
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,946
Both me and this old man.

381
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,962
What is he up to?

382
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,719
What are you doing, Sakura?

383
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,263
Hey! Sakura!

384
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,824
Hey! Wake up!

385
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,535
Wake up! It's coming!

386
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,539
Even the steam
from this coffee you've made

387
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,499
is once in a lifetime.

388
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,751
I don't know if it'll taste good.

389
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,919
It's good.

390
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,552
But why you?

391
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,013
What do you mean?

392
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,098
You're not a pretty girl or anything.

393
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,100
That'd be nice for my last vacation.

394
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,562
Don't expect too much. I'll go home.

395
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,565
Don't say all that. It was a joke.

396
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,239
This world is beautiful.

397
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,825
Now that I'm facing death,

398
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,911
this world doesn't seem so bad anymore.

399
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,914
It's beautiful.

400
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,710
Am I seeing things through a filter?

401
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,253
No.

402
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,048
This world is simply beautiful.

403
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,511
The sky above,

404
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,057
the clouds, even the scent…

405
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,977
are all part of this world.

406
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,437
Yes.

407
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,357
I can't enjoy it once I die.

408
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,651
That's true.

409
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,988
Should I enjoy
all the beauty before I die?

410
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,323
Huh?

411
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,910
I'd like to relive my life again.

412
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,122
This right here is where my memories are.

413
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,668
I want to live them out again.

414
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,861
ROBINSON 771

415
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,239
Where are you from, Old Man?

416
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,325
Far, far out that way.

417
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
I swear it was around here.

418
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,583
Things have changed a lot.

419
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,253
This used to be a bookstore,
but now, it's karaoke.

420
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,298
You don't know where your own house was?

421
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,842
Our place was big.

422
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,304
It was a brewery from the Meiji period.

423
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,932
We were well-known around here.

424
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,434
We owned the land.

425
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,479
This entire area
was where my house used to be.

426
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,023
There must have been
some land readjustment.

427
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,578
Huh?

428
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,559
Even the middle school,

429
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,312
it's been rebuilt.

430
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,107
It seems so. It's been decades.

431
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,776
Hello!

432
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,362
Hello.

433
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,404
I'm an alum.

434
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,198
-Is that so?
-Yes.

435
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,158
-Do your best!
-Thank you!

436
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,425
That's okay. I'll take that.

437
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,052
Thank you!

438
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,182
-Good work today.
-Yes.

439
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,809
Welcome back.

440
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,354
The stars are beautiful.

441
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,566
Isn't this great?

442
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,525
Huh?

443
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,610
There's even a bar counter!

444
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,529
Old man, there's a bar counter--

445
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,282
Old man. Old man!

446
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,658
Old Man, are you okay?

447
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,791
Just a bit…

448
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,460
Just wait a bit longer.

449
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:15,173
We last used painkillers at five,
so, we have to wait three hours.

450
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,221
These hours feel so long.

451
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,726
It's like a vortex of pain.

452
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,816
I don't know just how much it hurts,

453
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,526
but I'm with you.

454
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,403
Why?

455
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,280
Because I'm free?

456
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,282
That's great.

457
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,620
This is your way of killing time?

458
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
Oh, you can see the moon!

459
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,172
I can't even move.

460
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,466
I guess so.

461
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,509
Ouch.

462
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,353
I can't eat natto.

463
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,146
Who cares?

464
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,774
I mean…

465
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,734
I thought I should say something.

466
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,924
PENTAZOCINE

467
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,468
It's time. Eight o'clock.

468
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,971
This has pentazocine
and hydroxyzine in it.

469
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,849
Customized just for me.

470
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,726
Like going to Starbucks.

471
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,353
Give me the usual…

472
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,069
Is it working?

473
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,405
How did you know?

474
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,200
You've stopped tensing
your shoulders, Old Man.

475
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,332
Customization, success.

476
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,300
If you're feeling well tomorrow,

477
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,010
let's go to the high school.

478
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,803
The one you went to.

479
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,430
I…

480
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,933
don't even know if it's there.

481
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,019
I already checked.

482
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,480
The school closed down three years ago,

483
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,858
but the building is still there.

484
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,788
First to five wins.

485
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,790
-Here I come.
-Okay.

486
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,503
Hey!

487
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,421
That's crazy.

488
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,214
Here I go!

489
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,132
Come at me!

490
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,596
-Ah, sorry!
-Wait a minute.

491
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,474
That was way too good. No way.

492
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,684
Try me.

493
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,229
I missed.

494
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,272
So close.

495
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,612
The sky makes a good ceiling.

496
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,323
Huh? A ceiling?

497
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,283
I'm sick of the hospital ceiling.

498
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,536
I just get moved around

499
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,914
from one white ceiling to another.

500
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,960
Speaking of which,
don't you have a home?

501
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,254
Huh?

502
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,799
You've just been out with me.

503
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,387
I've got a broken family.

504
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,141
What?

505
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,853
More importantly,
what was your youth like?

506
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,152
I was a soccer player.

507
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,695
I played in the inter-high league.

508
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,739
Kimura Kazushi was my rival.

509
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,075
What? Seriously?

510
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,868
Really?

511
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,289
-You're way too gullible.
-Huh?

512
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,083
Of course I'm lying.

513
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,628
Damn…

514
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,048
Huh, what…

515
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:31,804
But were you lying about living here
and being rich?

516
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,931
Pretty much.

517
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,317
Listen, if you were going to die,

518
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,488
would it even matter what's truth or lie?

519
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,118
I lied a little, creating a life
that I wish I had.

520
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,119
Right.

521
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,497
The truth about me

522
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,375
was that I worked at a brewery,

523
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,836
all through middle and high school,

524
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,212
doing nothing else.

525
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,550
I wish I played soccer.

526
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,011
Oh, look.

527
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,933
-Hello.
-Please come in!

528
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,436
-Welcome!
-Hello.

529
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,230
What is this?

530
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,024
I got a phone call from him,

531
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,693
so, I thought why not, and invited him.

532
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,030
Looks good.

533
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,116
I'm excited.

534
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,410
Time for some beer.

535
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,037
One beer coming up.

536
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,413
-And for you?
-The same.

537
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,456
Okay.

538
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,708
-Three, please.
-Three beers!

539
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,127
KUSHIAGE

540
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,297
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

541
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,388
So good.

542
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,767
Dr. Sakura, you don't pick up your phone.

543
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,560
I saw Mr. Naruse's clinical records,

544
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,020
and I was worried.

545
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,481
But I never thought

546
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,692
you'd both be traveling
all the way out here.

547
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,613
You told him everything, huh?

548
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,490
We're following our life paths.

549
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,618
-Your life paths?
-Yes.

550
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,581
When you're about to die,
you lose all sense of time.

551
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,417
There's no difference
whether you're 18 or 45.

552
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,545
It all feels the same.

553
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,798
And it's full of memories.

554
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,842
Today will be nothing
but a memory tomorrow.

555
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,887
It sounds sad.

556
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,681
Despite how I may seem,

557
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,849
I've achieved everything.

558
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,853
I became a writer.

559
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,356
I won awards. I was a hit.

560
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,233
I'm dead broke now, though.

561
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,656
If I must say,

562
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,451
I have no memories of youth.

563
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,620
That's my biggest regret.

564
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,707
Memories of youth…

565
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,883
Would you like something?

566
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,345
Oh, no.

567
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,100
Hey, wait!

568
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,352
Naruse…

569
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,229
Aren't you Naruse?

570
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,359
Yes.

571
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,506
I'm dying.

572
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,468
Perhaps you drank too much.

573
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,015
I have good medicine for that.

574
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,808
-Let's have him take it.
-Okay.

575
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,034
Hey, don't tell Nakano.

576
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,827
What?

577
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,413
Don't tell Yuri.

578
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,166
Your old schoolmate?

579
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,292
Did you like her?

580
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,211
Ouch, ouch.

581
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,796
You're doing that on purpose.

582
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,382
No, it hurts!

583
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,599
I brought Wuling San Wan.

584
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,768
-Want to try?
-No.

585
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,895
-Take it.
-Fine.

586
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,438
Seriously.

587
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,488
I don't want to die.

588
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,786
I don't want to die, Doctor.

589
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,000
Only in times like this

590
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,836
do you call me doctor.

591
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:19,258
I feel like if I call you that,
you can do something for me.

592
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,763
I also feel like I have to do something.

593
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,354
Sometimes I say I want to die,

594
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,482
and I also say that I want to live.

595
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,443
I'm so weird.

596
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,239
Aren't all humans that way?

597
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,870
That's what they all say.

598
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,163
As if it were a movie.

599
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,623
Huh?

600
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,752
I know because I'm a writer.

601
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,965
Stories are far too happy.

602
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,550
That's why…

603
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,303
they're beautiful.

604
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:14,521
Death itself is indescribable.
Because you're dead.

605
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,274
That's why

606
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,527
the people around us,

607
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,489
who are alive, tell the stories.

608
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,283
Beautifully.

609
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,289
I suppose you're right.

610
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,210
You can't know a person's feelings.

611
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,254
In the movies,

612
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,592
things wrap up nicely.

613
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,927
Their ashes

614
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,972
are scattered on Mt. Fuji or Mt. Everest,

615
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,015
and the movie ends.

616
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,186
The characters only fear death,

617
00:46:55,687 --> 00:47:00,067
feel pain, and suffer for five seconds,

618
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,403
then the scene ends.

619
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:10,244
But in real life, it's much longer.

620
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,872
It feels so long I could die.

621
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,960
There's no end to it.

622
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:33,809
<i>One hour of love</i>

623
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,937
<i>Is a thousand years of loneliness</i>

624
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,730
What is that?

625
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,900
My mom used to sing it.

626
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:43,986
Oh.

627
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,781
I know that too.

628
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,117
It's Yuming.

629
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,167
It hurts, but I can laugh.

630
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm scared, but I laugh.

631
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,260
I can forget it all for a moment.

632
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,806
Yes.

633
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,314
There are so many forms of time.

634
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,066
There's a moment.

635
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,447
Perhaps a collection of moments
is what we call life.

636
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:42,044
KOZUYU

637
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,546
Here you go.

638
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,840
Thank you very much.

639
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,216
It looks great.

640
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,264
I didn't know.

641
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,227
Who'd think his condition was that bad.

642
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,731
I wanted to bring him today too,

643
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,608
but his condition wasn't great.

644
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,369
Hey, what about the hospital?

645
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,122
I'll go back tomorrow morning.

646
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,417
Were you let go?

647
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,336
No.

648
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,176
I was a student library assistant.

649
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,054
I can somewhat tell.

650
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,857
-Please take these.
-Okay.

651
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,900
OEDIPUS THE KING

652
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,576
You must like reading.

653
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,289
I'm a writer. Occasionally.

654
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,294
Really?

655
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,921
Yes.

656
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,010
Would you like to read my work?

657
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,308
Of course.

658
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,562
Thank you.

659
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,483
It never happened, though.

660
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,860
He was all talk.

661
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,698
Hey…

662
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,908
I have a favor to ask.

663
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,745
For bringing back memories of his youth.

664
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,059
POTASSIUM

665
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,314
What are you looking for?

666
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,609
What do you want to take?

667
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,450
POTASSIUM

668
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,534
This.

669
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,370
Did the higher-ups tell you to?

670
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,208
No.

671
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,460
It's my decision.

672
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,673
Can't you leave it here?

673
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,350
It was given to me as a charm.

674
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,393
A charm?

675
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,897
Only because…

676
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,067
I have that am I able to live.

677
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,362
My journey can continue.

678
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,826
Do you understand me?

679
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,872
I'm completely terrified.

680
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,252
Please don't take it from me.

681
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,395
I saw nothing.

682
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,064
Let's leave it at that.

683
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,707
It's freezing.

684
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,376
Yes.

685
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,049
So,

686
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,260
what are you here for?

687
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,482
Well, that's fine.

688
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,405
Yes?

689
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,077
I can't explain it well.

690
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,120
What?

691
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,957
The day before last,

692
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,127
I heard you and Mr. Naruse's conversation.

693
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,089
It made me realize something.

694
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,218
What's this about?

695
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,054
You want to save him,

696
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,515
but you can't,

697
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,185
so, you just stay by his side

698
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,022
and talk with him.

699
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,652
It reminded me of being a kid.

700
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,784
What's up with that?

701
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,536
We…

702
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,123
I mean, I don't mean to speak for you,

703
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,712
but we are humans before we are doctors.

704
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,095
We're human.

705
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,308
Doctors and patients,

706
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,936
we're all human.

707
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:29,534
EXIT

708
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,716
Naruse!

709
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,683
Come on. What are you doing?

710
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,810
Come on.

711
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,062
Quickly.

712
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,987
Naruse!

713
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,495
Yo.

714
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,121
Let's go.

715
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,219
It's the music room.

716
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,012
Do you remember?

717
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,981
If I remember, behind this door…

718
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,238
Look, it's still there!

719
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,782
I WANT TO BECOME A NOVELIST - NARUSE
I WANT TO BE A DESIGNER IN TOKYO - NAKANO

720
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,828
I remember us messing around here,

721
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,704
like we were in a drama.

722
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,543
Here.

723
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,920
Right here.

724
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,465
Okay.

725
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,388
Go to Tokyo…

726
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,108
So embarrassing.

727
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,947
I heard fireworks.

728
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,455
Everyone

729
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,666
must have forgotten by now.

730
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,585
Huh?

731
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,295
Once I die…

732
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,047
Hey, Old Man.

733
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,675
Didn't you forget until Yuri told you?

734
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,177
You just remembered now.

735
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:56,806
Honestly, I still can't remember.

736
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,725
I'm still wondering if it happened.

737
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,728
I mean, why the music room--

738
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:07,567
Old men like you usually live 22,000 days.

739
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,903
It's only natural to forget a few.

740
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,116
But something this important…

741
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,702
It makes me think.

742
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,873
People only remember the good times.

743
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,042
My memories might be broken up.

744
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,877
I think your life

745
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,254
has been even better than you remember.

746
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,506
You've just forgotten.

747
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,466
That sounds nice.

748
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:38,014
People don't usually
prepare so thoroughly to die.

749
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,558
Lots of people die

750
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,061
despite having plans for the next day.

751
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,979
That's true.

752
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,981
But that's just

753
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,692
one of the many ways to die.

754
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,575
-I found a great spot.
-Huh?

755
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,958
For a picnic. A rooftop picnic.

756
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,834
A nighttime rooftop picnic.

757
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,337
I'm having so much fun.

758
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,048
How amazing.

759
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,550
And with fireworks included.

760
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,640
Well then, I'll sit here.

761
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,517
-If anything happens…
-What?

762
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:23,851
Hey!

763
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,478
-Doctor, take this.
-Hey!

764
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,942
Well, that's fine.

765
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,321
What's this?

766
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,574
Am I supposed to do this?

767
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,825
Yes, just like that.

768
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,214
It hasn't changed at all.

769
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,384
There's no reason it shouldn't.

770
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,846
How should I say?

771
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,016
Neither has your laugh.

772
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,479
Did we always have winter fireworks?

773
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,983
I think it started seven years ago.

774
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,235
For tourism or something.

775
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,617
<i>Mama!</i>

776
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,745
<i>Mom, come here!</i>

777
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,163
<i>Okay!</i>

778
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,999
<i>Wow, look at this.</i>

779
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,792
<i>Look, look.</i>

780
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,212
<i>Look this way!</i>

781
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,214
<i>Look at the camera.</i>

782
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,594
<i>Smile.</i>

783
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,891
<i>Oh, it finished!</i>

784
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,700
I've lost…

785
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,329
everything.

786
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,128
Thank you for coming.

787
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,715
I didn't expect you to be here.

788
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,261
I moved around a bit
after getting married,

789
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,055
but I came back.

790
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,060
I wonder how many years it's been.

791
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:30,895
Do you have kids?

792
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,731
I couldn't.

793
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:40,822
That may be why I got divorced.

794
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,629
Oh, it looks like a heart!

795
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,047
There are so many now.

796
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,258
There are.

797
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,511
Hey,

798
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,392
you never showed me
what you wrote in high school.

799
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,691
Is your book finished?

800
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,027
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

801
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,488
I've just got a bit more left.

802
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,376
Do your best.

803
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,884
I never finished it.

804
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,804
But I still read it.

805
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,098
Since you became a pro.

806
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,270
You've been amazing, a real novelist.

807
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,396
Not at all.

808
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,444
Naruse?

809
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,280
Naruse?

810
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,537
-Who are you calling?
-Doctor Sakura.

811
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,998
-Hang on.
-What?

812
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,001
Could we stay together a bit longer?

813
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,003
I just called.

814
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,421
Really?

815
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,217
Hang on.

816
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,053
I liked you.

817
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,518
Really?

818
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,567
Me too.

819
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,569
What?

820
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,659
I could never work up
the courage to say it.

821
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,335
Naruse.

822
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,629
He must have said something.

823
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,340
Even though I told him not to.

824
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,177
Old Man, are you okay?

825
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,930
You…

826
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,648
Naruse, you're wrong!

827
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,619
I've applied a stabilizer and sedative,

828
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,580
so, he should be resting for a bit.

829
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,167
Um…

830
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,752
Yes?

831
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,716
Um…

832
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,426
What is it?

833
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,309
Are you stupid?

834
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,480
Oh, I'm sorry!

835
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,316
But we'd be worried without you.

836
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,819
No, he'll be fine.

837
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,196
Let me know if anything happens.

838
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,490
I'm going out to smoke…

839
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,326
I don't smoke.

840
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,493
I've got some work to do.

841
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,047
Naruse.

842
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,257
What?

843
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,134
You're wrong.

844
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,223
It's not because you're dying.

845
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,850
I really liked you.

846
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,687
Don't say I'm going to die.

847
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,357
Sorry.

848
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,193
Although it's true.

849
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,742
Can I touch your face?

850
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,371
That's…

851
01:05:58,955 --> 01:05:59,872
Does it hurt?

852
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,084
My face doesn't hurt.

853
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,882
Then…

854
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:56,220
I just now did what I couldn't back then.

855
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:02,518
I'm no longer a high school student.

856
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,397
I'm no longer young.

857
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,108
Sorry about that.

858
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,071
Idiot.

859
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,256
-Okay.
<i>-Oh.</i>

860
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,341
<i>Oh, you're alive.</i>

861
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,761
Yes, I'm alive.

862
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,221
I threw out your resignation letter.

863
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,724
You're coming back.

864
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,309
Huh?

865
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,685
I'm not coming back.

866
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,897
I believe you.

867
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,651
What do you mean?

868
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,074
That I'll go back
to forcing patients to live?

869
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,248
I…

870
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,585
I don't think

871
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,923
that the last three months
of my mother's life

872
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,469
were needed for her at all.

873
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,514
We were just delaying the inevitable.

874
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,142
What did she do for those three months?

875
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,062
She only suffered.

876
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,564
The doctors did nothing for her!

877
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,073
Aren't humans

878
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:44,620
so greedy to keep reproducing?

879
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,706
We have infertility treatment,

880
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:51,085
egg cryopreservation,

881
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,837
and sperm banks.

882
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,297
When it comes to giving birth,

883
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,716
we do so much that defies God's will.

884
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,594
And yet,

885
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,598
why must it all end in death?

886
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,643
As if He pretends not to see.

887
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,731
Giving birth is more interesting.

888
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,028
May I hang up?

889
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,446
Listen, Sakura.

890
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,742
Doctors save people's lives.

891
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,994
That is our duty.

892
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,328
You're wrong.

893
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,249
I want to save their view of life.

894
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,668
Is that why you brought the potassium?

895
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,128
Are you a God?

896
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,173
Choosing whether people live or die

897
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,509
is not your right to decide.

898
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,429
Nobody has that right.

899
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,182
But there is no God!

900
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,518
There is no God…

901
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:52,980
so, I must do it.

902
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:58,944
Sakura.

903
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,448
Don't persevere too much.

904
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,826
Don't become too soft.

905
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,915
I'm worried about you.

906
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,592
Hey…

907
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,220
-Yes?
-Naruse needs you.

908
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,888
I'll be right there.

909
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,890
Sorry, I have to hang up.

910
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,401
It's okay. He's alive.

911
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,654
The medicine makes people sleepy.

912
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,822
I see.

913
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,204
I see…

914
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,754
Here.

915
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,256
Oh, thank you.

916
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,136
Will you be back tomorrow?

917
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:11,892
He said to stop.

918
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,396
He said this would be the last time.

919
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,774
Old Man said that?
Oh, I mean, Mr. Naruse said that?

920
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,862
He wanted to keep things beautiful.

921
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,409
He wanted me to remember him that way.

922
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,330
He didn't want to show me when he's weak.

923
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,001
It's so like him.

924
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,548
I'll be off.

925
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,054
-Be safe.
-Thank you.

926
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,912
Old Man.

927
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,205
Old Man?

928
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,751
Please let me die. Please.

929
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,961
-What?
-I've…

930
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,423
I've had enough.

931
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,764
I've had this strange adventure with you

932
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,561
and remembered my youth.

933
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,148
Now, let me die.

934
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,172
I understand.

935
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,245
I don't want to.

936
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,501
I don't want

937
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,005
-you to die.
-What?

938
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,217
I want to talk to you again tomorrow.

939
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,053
I want to see your smiling face.

940
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,514
You don't even need to smile.

941
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,474
You can even sleep.

942
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:03,147
I don't want you to leave this world.

943
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,400
What are you talking about?

944
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,653
That's your ego talking.

945
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,614
Just as you always say,

946
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,284
I don't want to be full of tubes

947
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,621
and be forced to stay alive.

948
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,418
Fine, it's my ego.

949
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,337
I just don't want you to die.

950
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:33,051
I like being with you.

951
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,680
Gross!

952
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,318
That hurts!

953
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,612
Why…

954
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:57,159
Why must the dying person's feelings
come before mine?

955
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,870
I have feelings too.

956
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,581
The person you leave has feelings too.

957
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:05,000
It's my illness.

958
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,961
It's my life!

959
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,631
Even so…

960
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:14,801
Even so,

961
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:24,603
would you live for me instead?

962
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:30,108
At least until tomorrow?

963
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,089
If I must.

964
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,222
If Dr. Youngster wants it that bad…

965
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,183
I'll eventually die anyway, so, no rush.

966
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,436
I already suffered today anyway.

967
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,233
I'll live another day.

968
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:22,119
When tomorrow comes,
your mood will change.

969
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,495
I don't care!

970
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:28,000
It hurts.

971
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,919
Three hours haven't passed yet.

972
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,212
You devil.

973
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,889
I suppose you're right.

974
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,770
Humans live not just for themselves

975
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,942
but for others as well.

976
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,988
If it were only for themselves,

977
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:01,700
it'd be quite dull.

978
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,253
You can sleep great after all that.

979
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,140
Saying you'd be left behind…

980
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,493
The sea?

981
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,496
Yes.

982
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,749
I want to see

983
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,419
the sea again.

984
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,070
The Torii at the sea…

985
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,492
Daddy!

986
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:27,452
Look!

987
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,248
Wait, wait.

988
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,292
Chihiro, don't go.

989
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,504
I won't.

990
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,595
I got it!

991
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,314
I had a daughter.

992
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:58,859
Really?

993
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,862
My wife died,

994
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,741
and I haven't seen her since.

995
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,033
I haven't seen

996
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,288
my daughter for decades.

997
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,415
Where is she?

998
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,025
Old Man!

999
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,987
Let's go!

1000
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:51,161
Shouldn't the final destination
for our journey be right here?

1001
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:55,791
Miyagi Prefecture, Sendai City.

1002
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,715
NARUSE CHIHIRO
MIYAGI SENDAI

1003
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,053
Are you okay?

1004
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,431
I've become light.

1005
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:15,018
-Your weight?
-No.

1006
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:18,438
The weight of my life has decreased.

1007
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,536
It should be around here.

1008
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,256
NO BIKING

1009
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,841
Huh?

1010
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,594
-That's her.
-Huh?

1011
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,179
That's Chihiro.

1012
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,945
She seems happy.

1013
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,282
That's good. That's enough.

1014
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:13,034
Mrs. Chihiro.

1015
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,245
Mrs. Chihiro!

1016
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,299
I'm sorry.

1017
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,051
Old Man. Old Man!

1018
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:34,097
We've come this far.

1019
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:36,892
Please come in.

1020
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:47,110
Sorry, my house was a mess, so…

1021
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:52,157
Well, I'll be out for a walk.

1022
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:07,422
Do you want something to drink?

1023
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,884
Some coffee.

1024
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:13,678
Excuse me. One more coffee.

1025
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,513
Okay, got it!

1026
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,234
I've gotten old, haven't I?

1027
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,533
I don't remember the past that well.

1028
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,163
I see.

1029
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,713
You've gotten bigger.

1030
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,883
Bigger, but…

1031
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,720
I'm over 30 years old.

1032
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,522
You didn't come to Mom's funeral.

1033
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,273
I'm sorry.

1034
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,442
It's almost her seventh anniversary.

1035
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,780
I didn't know if I had the right to go.

1036
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:17,659
And I didn't know anything
until I heard about her death.

1037
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,168
But when I go to Heaven,

1038
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,670
I'll apologize to her.

1039
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:30,338
Huh?

1040
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:32,424
I mean,

1041
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,844
I'm going to die too.

1042
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,101
Thank you for waiting.

1043
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,436
Thank you.

1044
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:48,273
That's right.

1045
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,526
I never wrote back
to your New Year's card.

1046
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,323
It was just a generic one
that I sent as a formality.

1047
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,163
Is your marriage going well?

1048
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,837
Sorry for being nosy.

1049
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:17,969
I was lonely after mom died,
so, I got married.

1050
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,680
I see.

1051
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,935
But I'm happy.

1052
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,439
That's good.

1053
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:36,029
Um…

1054
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,993
Mom had a boyfriend.

1055
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,791
After you left,

1056
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:50,043
she worked as a temporary employee,

1057
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,921
as she built her own company.

1058
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,340
It was a small company.

1059
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:58,635
She did that, huh?

1060
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,845
That's crazy.

1061
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:08,144
Her life completely changed,
and I had no idea.

1062
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,188
What?

1063
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,815
What is it?

1064
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,276
I was naive.

1065
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,197
I thought she would always think of me.

1066
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,157
Or so I thought.

1067
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,579
That's why

1068
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,583
she didn't call you until she died.

1069
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,921
I think Mom didn't want her boyfriend
to find out.

1070
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:36,881
I see.

1071
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,467
She loved him that much, huh?

1072
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,097
I'm sorry for coming by.

1073
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,682
It'll be dinnertime soon.

1074
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,267
Yes.

1075
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:52,230
Don't think anything of it.

1076
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,859
I thought I might write a book
about this area,

1077
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,443
so…

1078
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,571
you know,

1079
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,323
I was just peeking around.

1080
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:05,076
-See you.
-I see.

1081
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,750
Dad.

1082
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,336
Stay healthy.

1083
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,005
Yeah.

1084
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,966
You too.

1085
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,287
The medicine isn't working anymore.

1086
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,208
Even an amateur like me can tell.

1087
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:26,592
Isn't it time for me to go?

1088
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,724
It's hard and painful.

1089
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,477
Please put me to rest…

1090
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,274
with your magic potion.

1091
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,319
It's time.

1092
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:51,117
I understand.

1093
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:54,579
Thank you.

1094
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:03,838
First, I'll administer Propofol.

1095
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:09,177
When I do,
you will peacefully come to rest.

1096
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,397
PROPOFOL

1097
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:36,788
Why are there two?

1098
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:42,418
Are you…

1099
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:45,963
planning to die?

1100
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,930
After I die,

1101
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,183
are you planning to die too?

1102
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,023
For what?

1103
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:08,069
It's true

1104
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:13,866
that I don't understand your bodily pain.

1105
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:16,285
But…

1106
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:20,498
my heart has come to hurt too.

1107
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,795
My chest hurts. Ever since then.

1108
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:32,969
Because you failed that operation?

1109
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:35,221
I didn't fail the operation!

1110
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,017
That was the rumor among the nurses.

1111
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:44,105
Your mentor's operation.

1112
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,442
During your high school
mentor's operation,

1113
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,237
your hand began to shake.

1114
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,783
-Metzen.
-Okay.

1115
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:04,959
Hey.

1116
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,383
What are you doing, Sakura?

1117
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,344
Hey, Sakura!

1118
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:18,431
-Replace him.
-Yes, sir.

1119
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,391
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

1120
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:24,020
Tweezers.

1121
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:31,152
Since then,

1122
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:34,197
I could never hold a scalpel again.

1123
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,076
And then,

1124
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,871
my wife left me.

1125
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,501
She didn't like me

1126
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,755
but the genius surgeon that I once was.

1127
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:52,840
She lost interest

1128
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:56,302
when I went to the department
of psychosomatic medicine.

1129
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:02,391
There was another man.

1130
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,021
That…

1131
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,317
is in your past.

1132
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:17,281
You have a future.

1133
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:23,913
You have a future.

1134
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,418
Live on.

1135
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,755
You must live on.

1136
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:40,846
The tomorrow you're throwing away

1137
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:46,686
is what another person
would give an arm and a leg for.

1138
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:54,277
Live for me.

1139
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:00,992
Why…

1140
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:06,414
Why do I have to live? Tell me!

1141
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,963
Because you were born.

1142
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,635
You were born so you can live.

1143
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:43,326
Exploring the past made my heart open up.

1144
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,997
I've lived until now.

1145
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:52,835
I…

1146
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,214
want to go to your hospital

1147
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,345
and die under your care.

1148
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:06,307
Let's go back.

1149
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,559
What?

1150
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,686
Until then,

1151
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:17,568
I will live until death.

1152
01:34:20,863 --> 01:34:22,365
Old Man.

1153
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,455
Old Man.

1154
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:30,664
Come here.

1155
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:06,700
THREE YEARS LATER

1156
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:11,789
Pardon me.

1157
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,709
RELIEF CARE SPECIALIST TEAM

1158
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,504
These are Mr. Tsukino
and Mr. Akiyama's files.

1159
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:20,381
Please return them by this weekend.

1160
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:27,930
And with that,
I'd like to continue the medication.

1161
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:29,432
Thank you very much.

1162
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,978
Her feelings have not once changed.

1163
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:37,857
For the past month,
she's wanted to be sedated.

1164
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,775
SEDATION: A SEDATIVE IS ADMINISTERED

1165
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,485
TO PUT THE PATIENT UNCONSCIOUS
FOR THEIR COMFORT

1166
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:45,030
She's in pain every moment she's awake.

1167
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:51,162
Isn't it too early? What about her family?

1168
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:56,333
It can be appealed
and puts the hospital at risk.

1169
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,210
It'd be scary.

1170
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,130
Risk to the hospital?

1171
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:04,884
Who are we caring for?

1172
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:07,720
Who is the sedative for?

1173
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,181
Why can't the patient decide how they go?

1174
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:12,349
Doctor.

1175
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,354
Doctor.

1176
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,815
We'll never come to a resolution that way.

1177
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,817
It got heated.

1178
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:25,196
Let's plan a strategy
for the next conference.

1179
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,531
Look who's talking.

1180
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:30,701
-Alright.
-I'll have the fish.

1181
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,453
And it took two hours…

1182
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:35,623
I'm beat.

1183
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:39,460
At Relief Care,
anybody can administer sedatives.

1184
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:42,796
There's no technique needed.

1185
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,048
The doctors are what makes them better.

1186
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,132
What?

1187
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,763
I think it's more difficult
than the Batista operation.

1188
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,097
What?

1189
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:54,808
It's not here,

1190
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:57,061
but here and here. You need a heart.

1191
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,313
You all could never do it.

1192
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:01,398
<i>Old Man, are you well?</i>

1193
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,694
<i>I'm doing fine. I'm trying my best.</i>

1194
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:10,115
<i>I ended up moving to Relief Care.</i>

1195
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:14,161
<i>I still don't understand this field,</i>

1196
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,622
<i>but I want to protect the patients' lives.</i>

1197
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:20,793
<i>I want to allow the patients</i>
<i>to die peacefully.</i>

1198
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:26,048
<i>I don't want them to think,</i>
<i>"I can finally leave this world behind."</i>

1199
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:29,343
<i>I want them to end their life thinking,</i>
<i>"This world wasn't so bad after all."</i>

1200
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:35,558
<i>Because this world isn't bad at all.</i>

1201
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,063
<i>That's what you taught me.</i>

1202
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:48,445
It was so good, those sausages.

1203
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:51,615
They were.

1204
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:54,410
When I die,

1205
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:58,497
it'll all be gone.

1206
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:09,925
I'll remember you. I'll never forget.

1207
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,472
Become a good doctor.

1208
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,770
Make more patients happy,

1209
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,568
just like me.

1210
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:45,377
Don't cry.

1211
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:48,881
Don't cry.

1212
01:38:58,182 --> 01:38:59,683
Dr. Youngster.

1213
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:14,198
Old Man.

1214
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:18,243
Hang on. Just a bit more.

1215
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:20,287
I called Mrs. Chihiro.

1216
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,081
Old Man.

1217
01:39:36,011 --> 01:39:38,347
Old Man! Mrs. Chihiro is here.

1218
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:46,105
Dad.

1219
01:39:50,192 --> 01:39:51,735
Dad.

1220
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:06,041
Dad, I wanted to introduce you to someone.

1221
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,964
This is my son.

1222
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,717
Kai.

1223
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,220
Grandpa.

1224
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,934
Look,

1225
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:26,895
he's your grandson.

1226
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,606
He's a boy,

1227
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,651
but he loves stuffed animals,

1228
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:39,408
and I gave him my favorite bunny.

1229
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,166
He's your grandpa.

1230
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:01,722
Dad.

1231
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:18,238
<i>Old Man smiled for the last time.</i>

1232
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:22,576
<i>He shouldn't have been conscious,</i>
<i>but I'm sure he smiled.</i>

1233
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,037
<i>It was the biggest smile I've ever seen.</i>

1234
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:27,498
<i>It's still etched in my memory.</i>

1235
01:41:33,378 --> 01:41:35,130
Your condition seems great.

1236
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,385
As long as

1237
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:44,264
I'm still me,

1238
01:41:45,724 --> 01:41:47,935
I can't become happy.

1239
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:55,400
This illness

1240
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:59,404
has always been with me.

1241
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,913
That may be true.

1242
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:16,797
But even if you can't become happy,

1243
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:21,260
haven't you had moments of happiness?

1244
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,806
Don't you occasionally

1245
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:27,432
laugh at people's jokes?

1246
01:42:29,434 --> 01:42:31,520
When the weather is great,

1247
01:42:31,603 --> 01:42:33,522
doesn't your mood get a little better?

1248
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:37,067
Look, that tea over there,

1249
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:39,027
didn't it taste good?

1250
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:42,823
Doctor.

1251
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:49,788
Do you ever feel glad
that you're handsome?

1252
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,416
Thanks.

1253
01:42:57,754 --> 01:43:02,009
Is happiness the goal?

1254
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,804
I think it's more like

1255
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,515
a nice, rewarding breeze

1256
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:11,643
that you feel when you're alive.

1257
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,611
Doctor,

1258
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:23,655
I'm going to have a quick nap.

1259
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:29,703
I'm falling asleep.

1260
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:34,625
Speaking of which,

1261
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,920
sleeping brings me happiness too.

1262
01:43:38,003 --> 01:43:41,882
Oh. Your sedative may be taking effect.

1263
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:43,300
Doctor?

1264
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:46,094
Would you

1265
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:49,181
hold my hand?

1266
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,058
Huh?

1267
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,480
I mean, if you're okay with it.

1268
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:11,828
It feels just like when my son was young,

1269
01:44:13,872 --> 01:44:16,124
and my husband's hand,

1270
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,628
who passed away long ago.

1271
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:25,884
It feels like when I was young

1272
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,557
and held my mother's hand.

1273
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:38,730
I wish my hands were so perfect.

1274
01:44:47,406 --> 01:44:49,157
Doctor…

1275
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,333
These are tears of joy.

1276
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:01,586
I know.

1277
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:56,118
<i>Old Man, I am alive.</i>

1278
01:48:50,982 --> 01:48:54,110
