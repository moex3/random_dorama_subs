1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,069
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:07,440
IF YOU WERE ARRESTED FOR
A CRIME YOU DIDN'T COMMIT?

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,344
I would fight until the end
because I didn't do anything bad.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,914
You didn't do anything?
Don't be ridiculous!

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,916
I know you did it!

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,019
They're called false charges, right?

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,122
It doesn't really happen
nowadays, does it?

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,290
Don't underestimate
the police investigation.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,326
Only you were at the crime scene!

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,596
If I didn't do it, I could stay calm
during the questioning.

11
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:34,034
People who are innocent but say
they did it are too weak-minded!

12
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,271
If you still won't admit it, I'll really…

13
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,939
I did it.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,875
I…

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,511
set the house on fire.

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,449
THERE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER
WHO CHALLENGES FALSE VERDICTS

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,185
Oh, Mr. Kurokawa?

18
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,488
It is unusual for young lawyers nowadays

19
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,125
to have so much passion
for criminal cases.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,629
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,900
INDICTMENT

22
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,502
"Set his home on fire…"

23
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,503
<i>Mr. Kurokawa?</i>

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,705
He's a good senior.

25
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,141
He's easy-going,
even towards me, a paralegal--

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,209
Hey!

27
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,111
-Go over there and do some work.
-Okay.

28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,612
I'm the head of the office, Beppu.

29
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,416
Kurokawa is brilliant as the lawyer
in charge of criminal cases,

30
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,519
but our office puts most of our resources
into corporate law cases.

31
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,122
We also deal with difficult mergers
and acquisitions cases.

32
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:35,095
For legal consultation, please
contact us at Hoshundo Law Office.

33
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,163
FALSE CHARGES, DEATH PENALTY

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,699
SET IT ON FIRE, ESCAPED THE HOME

35
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,136
He confessed his crime.

36
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,571
Mr. Kurokawa?

37
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:45,472
KAEDE WAKURA, LAWYER

38
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,541
Frankly, his behavior
is entirely unacceptable.

39
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,543
Look at his desk!

40
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,912
It's a mess, isn't it?

41
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,782
He's sloppy by nature.

42
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,550
The most unbelievable thing is

43
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,920
he is poor, so he lives in
our office's storage room.

44
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,391
Anyway, why don't you cover me
in your show instead?

45
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,727
-Ouch!
-I am sorry!

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,229
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,031
Calm down, Miss Wakura.

48
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,299
I'm sorry!

49
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,336
Hey, please don't get in the way
of our filming.

50
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,304
I am sorry.

51
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,841
She just joined our office a month ago.

52
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,443
It's a long story.

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,980
Yeah, many things happened,
and Miss Wakura is desperate.

54
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,916
After all, she used to work at
James Yuri Law Office

55
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,351
and she was the promising rookie.

56
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,553
James Yuri?

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,622
-The largest law firm in Tokyo?
-Here!

58
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,057
-Why did you come to this law office?
-Here you are. Sorry.

59
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,492
It's a long story.

60
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,960
She punched her boss and got fired.

61
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,196
If you're telling a story,
tell it accurately.

62
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,733
I was sexually assaulted
and my self-defense resulted

63
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,834
in an unjust dismissal.

64
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,136
Sorry to hear that.

65
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,040
By the way, where is
the center of our attention today?

66
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,177
He shut himself in at home because
he doesn't want to be interviewed.

67
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,812
It isn't his home, it's our storage room.

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,215
TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

69
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,653
Yes? Oh. Good afternoon.

70
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,588
-Good afternoon.
-What's the matter?

71
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,192
We told you that we would be
visiting today, Mr. Taku Kurokawa.

72
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm sorry,

73
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,029
but I think I turned down your request.

74
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,532
Your office's head and Mr. Yufuin
gave us permission.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,670
Kurokawa, is it really not okay?

76
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,806
I'm just really not good at this,
and I'm afraid that

77
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,309
people will get the wrong idea
if I appear on TV.

78
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,779
I am really sorry… Thanks.

79
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,585
I think we should come again another day.

80
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,587
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,522
You came a long way here, but he did this.

82
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,125
Let's go.

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,629
The guy seems laid back.

84
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,132
Is the lawyer so brilliant that
he's worth covering, Miss Arima?

85
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,736
Taku Kurokawa, 29 years old.
He's in the third year of his law career.

86
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,806
He has won and overturned
five false charges so far.

87
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,075
<i>Five in three years?</i>

88
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,644
<i>Do you know how hard it is</i>
<i>to overturn a false charge</i>

89
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,112
<i>under Japan's current judicial system?</i>

90
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,213
No.

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,183
If a person is prosecuted,
they are almost 100% guilty.

92
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,985
-Then--
-Yes.

93
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,355
Five cases in three years
is an amazing number.

94
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,193
But is he so good that
a TV show would interview him?

95
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,595
All five cases were theft
or minor bodily injury.

96
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,131
The cases weren't very difficult.

97
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,902
Miss Arima has always been
interested in false convictions.

98
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,472
I've known her for a long time too.

99
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,842
Even theft and assault charges
are difficult to win in court.

100
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,845
Well, he's worth interviewing
more than someone

101
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,513
with no track record.

102
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,751
I've only been given chores
since I joined your office!

103
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,622
Mr. Kurokawa, I've asked you many times,

104
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,325
but will you tidy up your desk?

105
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,926
Sure, I'll do it later.

106
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,361
What are you looking for?

107
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,164
Documents of an arson case.
The client will be here soon.

108
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,899
What? Client?

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,602
Did you take a case?

110
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,103
Yes, some days ago.

111
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,638
Didn't I tell you?

112
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,908
You didn't tell us!
Why do you never do things properly?

113
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,476
Sorry, I was too forgetful.

114
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,544
Found it.

115
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,014
Gosh!

116
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,450
I am sorry.

117
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,559
LAWYERS CONFRONTING FALSE CHARGES
CAN THEY SOLVE THE ARSON?

118
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,660
Stop talking shit!

119
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,063
What do you know about me? Take it back!

120
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,764
Why would I have set the fire?

121
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,801
I will use all my power to investigate
and fight for you.

122
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>Can we win?</i>

123
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,912
<i>The case happened on October 13, 2018.</i>

124
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,781
<i>Mrs. Aso was out on that day</i>

125
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,984
<i>and the suspect, Shigeo Aso,</i>
<i>was home alone.</i>

126
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,221
SHIGEO ASO, THE ACCUSED

127
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,628
<i>A fire broke out at 12 a.m.</i>

128
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,664
Spray water on the house!

129
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,536
Spray water towards the upper floor
at the entrance!

130
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,240
<i>The fire was thought to be</i>
<i>an accident at first,</i>

131
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,976
<i>but further investigation</i>
<i>suggested the possibility of arson.</i>

132
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,944
ARSON ACCIDENTAL FIRE

133
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,913
<i>The police saw it as a crime</i>
<i>committed for insurance money</i>

134
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,515
<i>and arrested Shigeo Aso.</i>

135
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,585
<i>Aso confessed to the crime</i>
<i>after his arrest.</i>

136
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,519
ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS

137
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,922
Your husband turned himself in.

138
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,391
Yes.

139
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,895
You were not at home
on the day of the fire.

140
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,733
Well, I have a disease,

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,902
so I stayed at the hospital
for a check-up.

142
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,903
But…

143
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,804
EMIKO ASO, THE ACCUSED'S WIFE

144
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,675
…the police said I did that
because I knew about my husband's plan

145
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,210
and they doubted me.

146
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,780
So they questioned you too?

147
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,915
This is embarrassing…

148
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,152
but our family is in debt

149
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,255
and they said it was the motive.

150
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,191
Indeed, our life is tough.

151
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,092
SITE INSPECTION REPORT

152
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,393
RECORD OF OBJECTS IN THE VICINITY

153
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,696
But I just can't believe that

154
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,233
my husband would set our house on fire!

155
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,235
But…

156
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,808
Indeed, if your husband had admitted
he committed the crime…

157
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,409
Oh, this.

158
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,179
They are Enterprise Sentai Salareader's

159
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,247
Manager Black and Receptionist Pink?

160
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,017
-I like them too.
-What?

161
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,621
They belonged to our son,
who passed away five years ago.

162
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:42,728
They were the only ones my husband
rescued from the fire.

163
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,666
What a pity.

164
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,035
I love Overtime Red most.

165
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,536
He was burned.

166
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,339
Yes, all of them.

167
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,976
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

168
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,645
There you go.

169
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,515
Sorry. Thank you.

170
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,484
What are you going to do?

171
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,252
I don't know what I'll do yet.

172
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,255
I have to have an interview
with Mr. Aso first.

173
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,858
Tell me a rough plan, then.

174
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:16,496
I am your assistant.
Against my will, though.

175
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,467
I mean, the accused made
a self-confession. In that case--

176
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,937
The record was well-written, right?

177
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,541
Did you also imagine
what happened when you read it?

178
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,876
Imagine?

179
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,611
How the accused set the house on fire

180
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,881
and gloated
when gazing at the burning house.

181
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,048
And it's…

182
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,752
We don't know if Mr. Shigeo Aso
really did it or not yet,

183
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,054
so let's go and talk to him first.

184
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,793
I should've asked earlier,

185
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,062
but do you dress casually
when you do an interview?

186
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,332
I have only one suit.

187
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,901
What about your backpack?

188
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,803
It's convenient if anything happens.

189
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,305
-Convenient?
-Yes.

190
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,307
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

191
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,208
TAKU KUROKAWA - KAEDE WAKURA

192
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,976
Upon Mrs. Aso's request,

193
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,179
I will be the new lawyer
in charge of your case, Mr. Aso.

194
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:13,953
I have told the police
and the prosecutor everything.

195
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,358
You mean what you said
in your self-confession was everything?

196
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,699
Mr. Aso?

197
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,306
-Mr. Kurokawa.
-Your son's things…

198
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,275
Why didn't you take all of them with you?

199
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,879
His photo albums and clothes
were burned too.

200
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,417
The Sentai heroes figures too,
except Black and Pink,

201
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,453
Overtime Red, Deadwood Blue,
and Cafeteria Yellow were left behind.

202
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,788
That again?

203
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,157
If you had planned
to set the house on fire,

204
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,794
you should've been able to carry
everything important with you.

205
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,696
Am I right?

206
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:05,004
Mr. Aso, did you really set the room
on the first floor on fire…

207
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,975
as written in the statement?

208
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,413
Did you set your late son

209
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,549
Yukio's room on fire?

210
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,458
Of course I didn't.

211
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,997
The room was full of memories of our son.

212
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,033
Why would I set it on fire?

213
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,138
I told them that I didn't do it.

214
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,773
Again…

215
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,275
and again.

216
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,878
Only you were at the crime scene!

217
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,114
We know you did it!

218
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,617
Hey, Aso, if you won't be honest with us,

219
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,187
we'll arrest your wife too.

220
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,858
No! My wife's health is bad.
Please don't do this.

221
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,928
If you talk to us honestly,
we won't be unreasonable,

222
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,797
but…

223
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,901
if you still won't admit it,

224
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,803
I'll really…

225
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,677
I did it.

226
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,946
I…

227
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,616
I set my house on fire.

228
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,186
Great. You finally admit it.

229
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,321
I'll take your statement, then.

230
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,192
So, how did you set it on fire?

231
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,995
-How?
-You committed the crime,

232
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,630
so, of course, you can say what you did.

233
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,400
What did you do to help it burn,
and where did you do it?

234
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,202
Be specific.

235
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,639
I poured paraffin…

236
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,176
Where?

237
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,280
Well, after our investigation,

238
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,348
we found that setting fire
on the ground floor

239
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,417
wouldn't make it burn like that.

240
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,387
In that case,

241
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,622
it's the bedroom on the first floor.

242
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,026
But it's dangerous to set
your own bedroom on fire.

243
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,528
Isn't it the room next to it?

244
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,530
The room next to it? But it's…

245
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,232
Your son's room, right?

246
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:18,070
You poured paraffin there
and set it on fire.

247
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,038
I SET THE FIRE BY POURING
OIL AROUND MY SON'S ROOM

248
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,573
…for the insurance money.

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,708
<i>The police had decided</i>

250
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,778
what I should say at the very beginning,

251
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,683
then they just got me
to sign the statement.

252
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,018
That's awful!

253
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,888
He forced you to make
a false self-confession?

254
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,726
Mr. Aso.

255
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,998
Please let me ask two questions.

256
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,734
Sure.

257
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,537
One.

258
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,776
Can you say what happened
during the questioning in court?

259
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,178
Of course.

260
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,347
Two.

261
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,186
Did you set your house on fire?

262
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,090
I did not.

263
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,496
Okay, then.

264
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,535
I'll investigate it thoroughly
and defend you.

265
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,714
As I thought, it's pretty damaged.

266
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,650
It's been a long time since the fire.

267
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,586
We're lucky it's still here.

268
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,255
-Let's go, then.
-Okay.

269
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,390
ENTRY FORBIDDEN

270
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,193
What? Hang on…

271
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,196
-What?
-Are we going inside?

272
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,631
Wait here if you don't want to get dirty.

273
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,269
Fine, I'll go! It's my job.

274
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,484
The fire department thought

275
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,521
the fire broke out
on the ground floor at first, right?

276
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,922
So it seems.

277
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,859
A heater in
the Japanese-style room's cupboard

278
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,660
could've caught fire.

279
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,496
The son's room was…

280
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,764
FLOOR PLAN

281
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,900
…right above the Japanese-style room?

282
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,438
But why did the police suspect an arson?

283
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,740
They even made Mr. Aso
make a false self-confession.

284
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,743
Because they made an assumption
during the investigation.

285
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,981
The family was in debt, the house
was on fire when Mr. Aso was alone,

286
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,582
and they got the insurance money.

287
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,120
It's fishy, so they assumed it was arson
when they investigated it.

288
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,156
But this is absurd!

289
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,225
It's too nasty!

290
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,596
Nasty. But it's their job as well.

291
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,068
They're coming out!

292
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,505
What were you doing?

293
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,008
Did you come to take a photo of the ghost?

294
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,776
A photo of the ghost?

295
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,113
But nobody died in the house's fire.

296
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,316
-No, we mean Yukio!
-Yukio?

297
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:22,688
My big sister said the house
was burned because of Yukio's curse.

298
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,624
Yukio? Do you mean Yukio Aso,
who used to live here?

299
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,628
I don't know, but it really is cursed.

300
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,935
Boys, would you tell me that
in more detail?

301
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,370
Would you like some snacks?

302
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,906
Here is our Human Kiosk.

303
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,775
-What human kiosk?
-Okay, here you go.

304
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,576
It's Mr. Kurokawa's nickname.

305
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,079
His backpack is packed
with various things.

306
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,315
-The default items are snacks and drinks
-What's this?

307
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,183
and it has toothbrushes, a nail clipper,

308
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,484
-spare underwear.
-And this is…

309
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,452
Basically everything.

310
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,821
That doesn't make any sense.

311
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,591
What kind of curse is it?

312
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,128
Various things.
A few nights ago, our home--

313
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,432
Hey, what are you doing?

314
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,399
Mommy!

315
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,405
Excuse me. We're lawyers
investigating the fire here.

316
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,675
Lawyers? The Aso family's?

317
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,843
Yes, we are.

318
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,912
In that case, will you tell them

319
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,183
to tidy up here before they get
a lawyer for the criminal husband?

320
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,819
Our children try to go in
and it's dangerous.

321
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,722
Lately, this area has been
dangerous enough already.

322
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,889
Come on. Let's go.

323
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,958
Let's go.

324
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,330
It was reported in the news,
so we're criticized for it.

325
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,965
Yeah.

326
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,570
I wonder what the curse is.

327
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,543
I think it's here.

328
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,178
Okay.

329
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,681
PICTURE 23

330
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,518
Mr. Kurokawa, I did some digging
about Yukio Aso.

331
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,620
Oh, thank you.

332
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,323
Yukio? Why did you check him out?

333
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,059
Because I don't know
what the key to solving the case is.

334
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,294
Found it. This one too.

335
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,998
It's the video taken by a spectator
during the fire of Aso's house.

336
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,100
Wow, that's helpful!

337
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,636
It isn't for free, of course.

338
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,274
Let me interview you. It's give and take.

339
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:26,645
Kurokawa, using the press
can be one of the tactics.

340
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,579
Okay.

341
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,315
All right, then. Please.

342
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,518
-Yes!
-Yes!

343
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,656
Yukio Aso. Died aged ten
five years ago in 2014.

344
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,592
He had a congenital heart defect

345
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,629
and had had two surgeries when
he was two years and ten months old.

346
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,032
It was the reason
that the Aso couple was in debt.

347
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,436
So, Yukio died of the disease?

348
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,174
No, the reason was this.

349
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,508
CHILD KILLED IN A FIRE AT AN EMPTY FACTORY

350
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,943
"Empty factory"?

351
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,881
It's still at the place
200 meters away from Aso's house.

352
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,152
Some children played with fireworks
and caused the fire.

353
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,857
Only Yukio didn't escape in time
and suffocated in the smoke.

354
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,394
This is heartbreaking.

355
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,231
So the children said it was cursed

356
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,034
because Yukio died in a fire?

357
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,507
Hang on… This isn't right!

358
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,111
How can the fire five years ago
be related to this fire?

359
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,147
Well, you're right.

360
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,617
We can't use this information
to plead extenuating circumstances!

361
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,120
Aren't we going to argue
that the police forced him

362
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,354
to make a false confession?

363
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,289
It's one of the points, of course.

364
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,092
So, we should give a flat denial
when we defend, right?

365
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,361
If the confession isn't reliable,

366
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,196
then we only need circumstantial evidence.

367
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,231
If we use this approach--

368
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,899
We will certainly lose.

369
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,335
-What?
-Miss Wakura,

370
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,240
you can't tackle a criminal case
in such a straightforward way.

371
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,410
We don't have enough material
to defend him yet.

372
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,414
But we have to do the pre-trial
conference procedure soon.

373
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,416
You guys are working.

374
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,218
Oh, Mr. Beppu. Good afternoon.

375
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,953
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

376
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,291
Is it the arson case?

377
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,394
What's the chance of winning?

378
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,466
I don't know. I have to go
and inspect some more.

379
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,568
Don't be too hard on us.

380
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,638
Oh, Miss Wakura, do you have a minute?

381
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,240
Yes.

382
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,876
You want me to spy on Mr. Kurokawa?

383
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,014
Yes. This might be a false charge, right?

384
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,084
In that case, Kurokawa will surely
do something reckless to win.

385
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,355
And he'll spend lots of money
and effort to do so.

386
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,560
People in charge of criminal cases
don't care about profit,

387
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,830
so we want you to spy on him
and stop him from losing control.

388
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,900
But how can I stop him?

389
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,036
If you do your job successfully,

390
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,406
we might transfer you
to our corporate law division.

391
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,175
We can let you be
a large company's consultant too.

392
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,879
But I shouldn't obstruct
Mr. Kurokawa's work.

393
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,315
I didn't tell you to obstruct it.

394
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,352
I only want him to work sensibly
as a lawyer.

395
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,490
<i>Kurokawa and Mr. Yufuin</i>
<i>pay too much attention to false charges</i>

396
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,860
<i>and they criticize the police</i>
<i>and public prosecutors too much.</i>

397
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,763
Japan's police and prosecutors
are capable.

398
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,733
They don't get a nearly 100%
conviction rate for nothing.

399
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,269
Even if you fight against them,

400
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,906
as a result, it isn't going
to benefit the accused.

401
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,643
Perhaps that's the case, but…

402
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,247
Don't worry.

403
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,383
Your reputation
won't get worse even if you lose.

404
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,618
If it does get worse,

405
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,954
it would be because you can't stop
Mr. Kurokawa losing control.

406
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,728
RINTARO IBUSUKI, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

407
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,962
Ibusuki.

408
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,799
Good afternoon, sir.

409

COURTHOUSE

PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE PROCEDURE

411

PROCEDURE TO NARROW DOWN
THE NUMBER OF ISSUES

412

TO ENSURE A SMOOTH ADJUDICATION

413
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,784
-Oh gosh. I really can't do it.
-Can't do what?

414
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,321
I really hate how it makes me
feel like it's strangling me.

415
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,722
Endure it.

416
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,491
Anyway, is it okay?

417
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,326
I said it was torture to dress formally.

418
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,529
I'm not asking that.
I mean how you'll defend our client.

419
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,232
How likely will we win
when we confront the prosecutor?

420
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,067
I have no idea yet.

421
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,336
We're here already
but you still don't know?

422
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,938
Good afternoon, Mr. Kurokawa.

423
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,573
Hello.

424
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,077
You are a new lawyer, right?
I'm the public prosecutor, Ibusuki.

425
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,211
I am Wakura.

426
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,281
Please go easy on me, Mr. Kurokawa.

427
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,319
You've made me go through
many bitter experiences.

428
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,690
Right judgment is more important
than winning or losing.

429
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,693
You are right. Let's both do our best.

430
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,465
By the way, I just ran into
your father after some time.

431
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,668
Did you?

432
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,970
He's concerned about your future.

433
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,006
You'd better not make him too worried.

434
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,612
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

435
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,415
Let's start now.

436
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,254
Yukio.

437
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,259
I'm sorry.

COURTHOUSE

Please uncuff him.

440
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,822
"On October 13, 2018, at around midnight,

441
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:48,994
at 20-8, Nishimachi 2-chome, Edogawa City,

442
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,164
a wooden house with tile roofing
owned by the accused,

443
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,667
the accused poured paraffin
on the floor of a room on the first floor,

444
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,271
lit it with a match,
and set the house on fire.

445
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,542
As a result, the house
the accused and his family lived in

446
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,843
was burned down.

447
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,579
The charge and punitive article

448
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,783
is Arson of Inhabited Buildings,
Article 108."

449
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,352
Accused.

450
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,423
In the bill of indictment read by
the public prosecutor,

451
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,559
is there any mistake?

452
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,269
Everything was wrong.

453
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,905
-Really?
-Seriously?

454
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,509
I did not set my house on fire.

455
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,211
All of that is false.

456
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,385
WITNESS WAITING ROOM

457
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:53,892
Witness, please answer my questions
with "yes" or "no".

458
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,826
Yes.

459
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:55,894
DEFENSE'S QUESTIONING

460
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,030
This case was constructed
using only circumstantial evidence.

461
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,435
The police coerced my client into
giving a self-confession as evidence

462
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,705
according to my client's testimony.
Is that true?

463
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,341
This is not true at all.

464
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,143
-The accused himself--
-Excuse me.

465
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,412
I said this at the beginning.

466
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,714
Please answer "yes" or "no".

467
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,582
Yes.

468
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,720
Did you say to my client that if he
wouldn't make a confession honestly,

469
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,822
you would arrest his wife?

470
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,457
Is that true?

471
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,693
No.

472
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,029
You said that!

473
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,865
He definitely said it.
The look on his face told us.

474
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:41,306
At first, the oral statement stated
that he set fire with a lighter,

475
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,308
but it changed to a match later.

476
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,610
Don't you find it strange?

477
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:51,283
All suspects change their statement
out of guilt,

478
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,853
but I kept talking to him patiently.
As a result,

479
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,089
he told me that he felt a weight
was lifted off his shoulders

480
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,458
and even thanked me.

481
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,160
Please answer "yes" or "no".

482
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,695
Yes. I mean…

483
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,797
No.

484
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,733
My client was burned,

485
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,070
but he still carried his late son's things
out from the house.

486
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,541
Isn't this and setting
the house on fire contradictory?

487
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,909
It isn't.

488
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,345
Instead, he did this
to move people's hearts

489
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,414
and deceive us,
that he didn't commit a crime.

490
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,215
It is very nasty.

491
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,750
Witness, I repeat--

492
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,920
Well, five years have passed
since his son died,

493
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,890
so he must have wanted money
more than the memory of his son.

494
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,293
He just brought the rubbish out
for a show.

495
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,194
Don't be ridiculous!

496
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,563
Shigeo!

497
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,066
What do you know about me?

498
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,435
-Do you know how I felt at that time?
-Please stop.

499
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,103
-Take it back!
-Please calm down.

500
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,538
How dare you make a fool of me!

501
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,639
-Stop it.
-Be quiet!

502
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,542
-Take it back! Take it back!
-Be quiet!

503
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,910
Take it back!

504
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,345
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

505
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,180
Why did you do that?

506
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,949
He obviously provoked you.

507
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,486
He did it to make you angry and give
the lay judges a bad impression.

508
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,587
I am sorry.

509
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,490
But I couldn't keep quiet.

510
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,594
He made me feel that
my son's feelings were trampled on.

511
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,763
I know how you feel,

512
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,532
but calm down a little,
or in the trial, you'll--

513
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,668
I don't mind even if we lose.

514
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,836
Mr. Aso.

515
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,271
I was told during the questioning

516
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,342
that my lawyer can only
plead extenuating circumstances.

517
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,747
I have to go to prison anyway,
so I shouldn't fight back needlessly.

518
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,548
Gosh.

519
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,186
Mr. Aso, if you give up,
there is no way we can defend you.

520
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,858
If you're convicted guilty in the trial,

521
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:44,763
they will make you setting
Yukio's room on fire a fact.

522
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,432
In that case…

523
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,202
it must be God's punishment.

524
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,406
God's punishment?

525
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,808
Because in the end…

526
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,614
I couldn't protect Yukio.

527
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,457
My husband,

528
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,025
in these five years,

529
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:20,198
he always felt guilty about Yukio.

530
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,333
Even though he passed away in an accident?

531
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,372
Our son was born weak.

532
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,578
He couldn't make friends easily
because of that.

533
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:40,785
Our son was bullied at school.

534
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,855
Hang on a second.

535
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,357
That means only Yukio couldn't escape

536
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,093
from the empty factory's fire because…

537
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,532
I don't want to talk about that
again after all these years.

538
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,268
It's just…

539
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,004
My husband and I,

540
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:07,912
we were so angry at ourselves
that we didn't realize how Yukio felt!

541
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,493
<i>We couldn't</i>

542
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,396
protect our son.

543
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,967
Mrs. Aso.

544
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,512
Children don't want to make
their parents worry too,

545
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,413
so they endure it stubbornly.

546
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,550
It isn't because
you and Mr. Aso didn't realize,

547
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,453
it's because Yukio tried very hard

548
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,156
to hide it from you.

549
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,324
That's what I think.

550
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,195
I have a son too.

551
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,833
Mr. Kurokawa.

552
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,640
Can we win the case?

553
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,045
I don't know.

554
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,014
Mr. Kurokawa.

555
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,015
But…

556
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,419
We will do our best.

557
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,897
This is the burnt remains
of the beam between

558
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,066
the ground and first floor.

559
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,369
As you can see,

560
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,073
the edges of the upper side of the beam
were burned and rounded off

561
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,042
but the bottom side wasn't.

562
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,210
BEAM

563
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,949
The beam is usually attached closely
to the floor of the first floor,

564
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,752
so there is no gap for air to go in

565
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,889
and the beam's upper part
couldn't have been burned like that.

566
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,025
From this, we can see that the fire
broke out on the first floor,

567
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,728
and this is the truth, without a doubt.

568
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,096
Thank you, Professor Totsukawa.

569
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,834
As you have heard,
according to the expert's analysis,

570
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:14,606
the fire broke out from the child's
bedroom on the first floor.

571
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,107
ORIGIN OF FIRE, CHILD'S BEDROOM

572
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,478
The defense lawyer claims that

573
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,015
the heater in the ground floor's
Japanese-style room caused the fire.

574
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,352
Indeed, perhaps the fire broke out
on the first floor as well,

575
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,656
but it happened after the accused
set fire on the first floor

576
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,427
and he also set fire
on the ground floor as a deception.

577
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,495
Deception?

578
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,965
It happened in a residential area.

579
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,302
Fortunately, the fire didn't spread
to the surrounding area,

580
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,971
but it could have caused
a horrible tragedy too.

581
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,975
Committing such a vicious crime like this

582
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,478
for something as selfish
as an insurance scam

583
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,713
is definitely unacceptable.

584
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,483
I've finished.

585
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,936
ENTRY FORBIDDEN

586
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,646
Indeed. The upper side is burnt.

587
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,616
Did you come a long way to verify that?

588
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,851
You took many photos the other day.

589
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,821
Sorry, I thought checking the place
in its original state

590
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,423
would be more helpful.

591
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,793
I said original state, but it's burnt.

592
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,529
It isn't funny at all!

593
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,033
I was curious the other day too.

594
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,469
What on earth is this?

595
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,272
I don't know,
and I think it isn't going to help.

596
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,441
That reminds me.

597
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,377
Here you go.

598
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,680
Have some. You seem annoyed.

599
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,350
But you won't try not to annoy me?

600
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,754
Okay. Let's go to
the next destination, then.

601
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,822
Next?

602
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,926
The empty factory. The one that
Yukio died at five years ago.

603
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,528
Why are we going there?

604
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,532
PRIVATE PROPERTY - KEEP OUT

605
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Can we go inside?

606
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,503
It's against the law.

607
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,840
But someone had been inside.

608
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,341
Even so, it's still against the law!

609
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,511
Maybe it's got a secret path over there?

610
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,947
It is still against the law,
even if there is!

611
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,615
Gosh!

612
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,304
It's a magazine.

613
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,075
Some people probably played
airsoft nearby.

614
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,276
"Airsoft"?

615
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,546
Yes, airsoft. There are BBs on the ground.

616
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,482
That reminds me.

617
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,052
<i>In the video of the fire</i>
<i>that Miss Arima gave me,</i>

618
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,288
<i>people in military outfits</i>
<i>were among the spectators.</i>

619
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,958
So, they were playing airsoft here?

620
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,328
Is it a Colt Government?

621
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,764
What's the matter?

622
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,934
What does it have to do with the trial?

623
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,237
Nothing. Maybe--

624
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,605
Mr. Kurokawa.

625
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,475
Forget your pride and reputation.

626
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,677
Will you change to plead
extenuating circumstances?

627
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,746
What?

628
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,414
Mr. Aso was forced
to make a false confession,

629
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,317
but he lost control of himself
and gave the judge a bad impression.

630
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,687
The analysis of the fire given by
the prosecutor was hard to refute.

631
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,589
We'll surely lose at this rate!

632
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,024
We should try to reduce the sentence--

633
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,559
If we do that,

634
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,729
it means we admit that Mr. Aso
set the child's bedroom on fire.

635
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,366
Miss Wakura, I thought you believed
what Mr. Aso said.

636
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,702
I believe him!

637
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,772
I heard how he felt towards Yukio.

638
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,574
-But even so--
-I see.

639
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,477
Indeed. You must be annoyed
if you believe him.

640
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,581
What do you mean?

641
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,917
Mr. Kurokawa, do you not trust Mr. Aso?

642
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,454
I don't know because I didn't see
the scene of the fire.

643
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,622
What?

644
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,125
Why did you accept the case
and plead complete denial?

645
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,760
Because Mr. Aso said he didn't do it.

646
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,762
What you say doesn't make sense.

647
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,567
Why do you make assumptions?

648
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:37,902
What?

649
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:44,041
They are in debt, there was a fire,
and they got the insurance money,

650
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,578
so the police assumed
that Mr. Aso set his house on fire.

651
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,349
Mr. Aso loves his son
and he said he didn't do it,

652
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,519
so you assumed that he really didn't.

653
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,121
Aren't the two the same?

654
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,258
Well…

655
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,792
I don't know if it's true.

656
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,062
That's why I'm investigating it.

657
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,670
You won't go inside?

658
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,872
You shouldn't. It's against the law.

659
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,793
Did it really happen like that?

660
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,032
Good afternoon. You've got a parcel.

661
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,668
Thank you. Mr. Kurokawa, it's your parcel.

662
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,469
Oh, thanks.

663
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,643
What is that?

664
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,480
We asked Mrs. Aso to send us
Yukio's things that weren't burned.

665
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,317
I'm so glad they weren't seized.

666
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,452
What's the point of checking them?

667
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,757
What's the matter, Miss Wakura?

668
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,792
Nothing.

669
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:12,663
I just don't think Mr. Kurokawa
is serious about defending the client.

670
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,798
What the heck?!

671
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,334
Think whatever you want,
but Mr. Kurokawa--

672
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,069
Wait a second.

673
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,606
What's that smell?

674
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,875
-What do we do?
-Oh no!

675
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,445
-What should we do?
-What are you doing?

676
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,180
-The fire extinguisher!
-The fire extinguisher!

677
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,983
What… Hey…

678
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,751
-Oh no, oh no!
-Kurokawa!

679
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,855
Seriously?

680
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
-No…
-Hey!

681
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,425
-Fire extinguisher!
-Hey…

682
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,995
-Oh no…
-Don't mind that! Put out the fire!

683
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:44,996
-Found it!
-Get the fire extinguisher!

684
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,097
-Hurry up!
-The fire extinguisher!

685
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,999
-The fire extinguisher! Hurry up!
-Yes!

686
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,302
-Go…!
-Put it out!

687
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,337
Put it out!

688
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,247
He wanted to check whether the fire
really burned

689
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,549
in the way the public prosecutor claimed,

690
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,586
so he used a miniature to do it.

691
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,291
He had to do it indoors? This is crazy.

692
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,662
So, why isn't the culprit, Kurokawa, here?

693
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,064
The evidence can't get wet,

694
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,433
so he is checking for damage.

695
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,102
Blimey, he's giving me a headache!

696
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,205
He isn't likely to win
the trial too, right?

697
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,742
You can plead extenuating circumstances

698
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,079
or just back out totally.

699
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,716
What do you think, Miss Wakura?

700
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,419
I have no idea.

701
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,523
Anyway, you guys will clean up the mess.

702
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,458
-Okay.
-Okay.

703
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,262
I am counting on you to do
your job properly, Miss Wakura.

704
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,898
Okay.

705
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,937
Mr. Kurokawa is as reckless as always.

706
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,341
He can't see his surroundings
when he works on a case.

707
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,910
Does Mr. Kurokawa always do this?

708
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,613
"This"? What exactly do you want to ask?

709
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,084
He is always like this.

710
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,988
He isn't happy
until he checks everything himself.

711
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,491
Let's clean the place.

712
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,592
Okay.

713
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,230
In Japan,
if you're prosecuted for a crime,

714
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,333
there's a nearly 100% chance
that you'll be found guilty.

715
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,704
That's exactly why
pleading extenuating circumstances

716
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,040
is one of the strategies too.

717
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,845
But if the person
wasn't caught red-handed,

718
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:46,484
there must be a blank
that the lawyer has to investigate.

719
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,718
Blank?

720
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,890
If you assume you know what happened
without checking,

721
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:57,228
it's the same as taking part
in a false charge.

722
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,700
Mr. Kurokawa still hasn't returned?

723
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,037
It annoys me that the man who caused
the fire isn't cleaning the place.

724
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,105
Indeed.

725
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,907
I'll call him here.

726
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,977
CHRISTMAS 2013

727
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,460
Mr. Kurokawa, you should be
responsible for what you did--

728
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,761
Miss Wakura.

729
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,032
It's the curse.

730
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,967
Yes?

731
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,938
The curse… Probably. In other words…

732
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:41,839
-I see!
-Hey!

733
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,774
-Where are you going?
-See you!

734
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,875
Mr. Kurokawa?

735
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,981
Wait! Where are you going?

736
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,586
You should tell me now!

737
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,621
Huh?

738
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,590
Wait!

739
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,160
MIYAUCHI

740
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,061
<i>Yes?</i>

741
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,064
I'm Kurokawa, a lawyer.
We met the other day.

742
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,300
I'd like to check something with you.

743
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,170
-<i>Check something?</i>
-It's very important. Please.

744
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,908
Mr. Kurokawa! What do you want to check?

745
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,078
-Yes?
-Sorry to bother you.

746
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,947
-Your son--
-Mom, hurry up!

747
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,916
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

748
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,985
What are you doing? I'll call the police!

749
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,187
Please don't call the police!

750
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,156
-Sorry for coming suddenly.
-Who are you?

751
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,458
Lawyer. We met the other day.

752
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,829
Please tell me about Yukio's curse.

753
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,067
TOUO UNIVERSITY

754
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,637
-Excuse me. Where are we now?
-The university's corridor.

755
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:50,708
I know that,
but why are we at a university?

756
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,076
Follow me and you'll know.

757
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,417
-Zoom in a bit more.
-Okay.

758
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,553
Keep going.

759
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,156
-Okay.
-All right.

760
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,958
-Set up Camera B now.
-Okay.

761
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,160
Hello, Miss Arima.

762
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,296
-Hello.
-Hello.

763
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,732
-Where is Dr. Akiu?
-Working.

764
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,435
That guy is as unfriendly to me as always.

765
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,940
Dr. Akiu, thank you for today too.

766
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,542
It's ready. Let's start now.

767
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,576
Okay.

768
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,249
I haven't seen you before.

769
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,052
This is Miss Wakura. She just joined us.

770
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,923
This is Touo University's Physics
Department's associate professor,

771
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,925
Dr. Kyoichiro Akiu.

772
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,127
I'm Wakura. Nice to meet you.

773
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,164
You don't look like a lawyer.
I thought you were a student.

774
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,634
Yes? I am 26 years old already.

775
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,904
No, I mean you have the looks
and the mind of a student.

776
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,506
Let's begin.

777
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,175
What's wrong with him?

778
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,744
Don't worry about it.
He's always like that.

779
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,415
Anyway, what is he going
to start doing here?

780
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,520
TOUO UNIVERSITY

781
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,325
Kurokawa will surely
do something reckless to win.

782
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:18,729
So, we want you to spy on him
and stop him from losing control.

783
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,536
Is this what "lose control" means?

784
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,681
Experiment?

785
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,617
Why did that happen?

786
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,219
He did it himself and didn't tell me.

787
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,855
Stop him now!
Even if you have to risk your life!

788
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,059
Risk my life?

789
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,638
I can't possibly stop this!

790
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,760
COURTHOUSE

791
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,204
Defense lawyer,
please do your cross-examination.

792
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,539
Yes, Your Honor.

793
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,977
Regarding the testimony
you gave last time,

794
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,346
I would like to check it with you again.

795
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,620
The upper side of the beam
was burned and rounded off

796
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,121
but the bottom wasn't.

797
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,458
If the beam is attached closely
to the floor of the first floor,

798
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:59,163
this cannot happen because there is
no gap for air to go in.

799
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,598
-Is that right?
-It is.

800
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,768
If the fire doesn't break out
on the first floor,

801
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,603
the beam won't be in this condition.

802
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,138
Are you sure about that?

803
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,442
Yes, I'm sure about it.

804
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,745
Sorry, I would like to ask again.

805
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,782
Air can't go in because there isn't a gap.

806
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,419
-Is that what you say?
-You are very annoying.

807
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,489
Even an assistant
at my university knows that.

808
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,024
It's just common sense.

809
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:30,761
What if between the beam
and the floor of the first floor

810
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,496
there is a tiny gap?

811
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,597
What would happen, then?

812
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,631
A gap?

813
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,700
That's impossible.

814
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,036
I am asking what if there is?

815
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,106
If there really is one,

816
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:46,310
fire could go up through the gap
from the ground floor too.

817
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,280
But it's pointless
to make such an assumption.

818
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,584
Thank you.

819
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,819
Your Honor,

820
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,523
I would like to play
defense evidence number 32 now.

821
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,091
The image has been

822
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:05,395
accepted as a special additional
evidence due to unavoidable grounds.

823
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:11,568
This is the plan of Mr. Aso's house,
which was burned down in the fire.

824
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,906
It was kept in the architectural firm
that designed the house.

825
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,077
Please have a look at this part.

826
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,981
This construction material
is called a joist.

827
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,717
It was put between the beam and the floor

828
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,085
of the first floor as reinforcement.

829
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,153
Joist?

830
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,988
There was a gap.

831
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,823
Because there were joists,

832
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,126
there was a two-centimeter gap
between the beam and the floor.

833
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,996
I verified with the contractor
and at the scene.

834
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,732
I found the burnt remains
of what should've been a joist.

835
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:50,707
Next, this has been accepted
as special additional evidence too.

836
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,711
I would like to question Touo University
Physics Department's

837
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,246
assistant professor, Dr. Akiu.

838
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:06,089
First, please have a look
at defense evidence number 33.

839
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,494
In the experiment,

840
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,397
I've reconstructed a part
of the burnt two-story house

841
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,632
in as much detail as possible.

842
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,071
As you can see, fire enters the gap
resulting from the joists

843
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,073
and heated the upper part of the beam.

844
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,944
And this is the condition
of the beam after the experiment.

845
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,078
BEAM

846
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,080
FIRE DAMAGED SURFACE AREA - BEAM

847
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,289
In other words, even if the fire
only broke out on the ground floor,

848
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,292
the result would be the same
as what the prosecutor showed us?

849
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,594
As you have seen.

850
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,695
Objection.

851
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,198
-What's the point of that?
-You mean…

852
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,399
The defense only showed

853
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,336
that even if the fire broke out
on the ground floor,

854
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:53,437
the beam could burn in the same way

855
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,206
but didn't disprove that the fire
broke out on the first floor.

856
00:47:56,273 --> 00:48:01,178
It also didn't prove that the heater
on the ground floor caused the fire.

857
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,212
You are right.

858
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,282
Therefore, we did an experiment
to prove it.

859
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,332
The heater is the same model
as the one found at the scene of fire.

860
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,936
We'll now make it light up automatically.

861
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,911
Why?

862
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,316
When a strong electromagnetic wave
of a certain frequency

863
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,717
is picked up by a device nearby,

864
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:45,789
a heater in this case, it causes
the heater to turn on by mistake.

865
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,091
This heater isn't remote-controlled,

866
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,827
but if you press the button,
the electronic circuit inside

867
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:51,962
moves and lights the burner.

868
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,599
Therefore, interference
by unlicensed radio signals outside

869
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,800
can light it like this.

870
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,336
Unlicensed radio signals?
Was anything found near the scene?

871
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,206
The transceiver used in airsoft was found.

872
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,443
On the day of the accident,
at the empty factory nearby,

873
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,613
some young people were playing airsoft.

874
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:14,084
<i>It was unauthorized, that is,</i>
<i>the so-called "field airsoft".</i>

875
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:18,488
<i>Electromagnetic waves emitted</i>
<i>by the high output transceiver they used</i>

876
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,357
<i>lit the heater.</i>

877
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:24,528
Similar happenings were observed
in my client's neighborhood

878
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,733
but were treated
as an anomalous phenomenon.

879
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,202
Yukio's curse?

880
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,372
The house was burned
because of Yukio's curse.

881
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,575
Please tell me about Yukio's curse.

882
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,510
<i>It happens at night.</i>

883
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,514
<i>The TV switches on and off by itself.</i>

884
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,818
At the same time when the fire broke out,

885
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,988
some young people were playing
airsoft at the empty factory.

886
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:55,425
I have their testimonies and those
given by the witnesses there.

887
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,427
Kurokawa, can I go now?

888
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,463
Thank you, Professor.

889
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:03,467
Prosecution, would you like to do
any cross-examination?

890
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,907
You considered only the police's
and the prosecutor's investigation

891
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,610
and didn't take into account
all kinds of possibilities.

892
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,013
You used a poor experiment
done by an assistant

893
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,815
who is no better than a student
as evidence.

894
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,718
Someone like that

895
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,187
can't even call himself a scientist.

896
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:37,100
It seems the same thing happened
before your son died too.

897
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:39,836
What?

898
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,471
The empty factory that was burned

899
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,975
was still running
six months before Yukio passed away.

900
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,280
Lorries that went in and out there
also used unlicensed radio signals.

901
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,715
CHRISTMAS 2013

902
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,988
This is the video tape that Mr. Aso
managed to bring out from the fire.

903
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:59,656
Please have a look.

904
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,329
<i>Yes!</i>

905
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,633
<i>This is Yukio's Christmas present!</i>

906
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,102
<i>Do you like it? Are you happy?</i>

907
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,271
<i>Yes. Thank you, Dad!</i>

908
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,239
<i>It's lovely, isn't it?</i>

909
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,210
<i>Oh? The heater turned on by itself again.</i>

910
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,211
<i>Really?</i>

911
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,381
<i>Why? Is it broken?</i>

912
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:25,982
<i>All right.</i>

913
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,654
<i>My classmates say things at their homes</i>
<i>do that sometimes too.</i>

914
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,990
<i>They said the things</i>
<i>were haunted or cursed.</i>

915
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,659
<i>That's scary!</i>

916
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:39,629
<i>But I'm not scared</i>
<i>because you'll protect me, Dad.</i>

917
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,883
Mr. Aso.

918
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,590
Among the memories of you and Yukio,

919
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,659
that you forgot yourself…

920
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,663
and risked your life to protect…

921
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,170
there was the evidence
that could prove your innocence.

922
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,039
Yukio!

923
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,259
The inadequate investigation

924
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,794
and inspection…

925
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,964
done by the police
and the public prosecutor…

926
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,503
had caused my client and his wife
tremendous mental distress.

927
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:57,807
Also, it almost ruined the bond…

928
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,412
between my client and his late son Yukio.

929
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,882
This is unforgivable.

930
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,823
Therefore,

931
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,894
the defense lawyer insists
that the accused, Shigeo Aso…

932
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,298
is innocent.

933
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:44,054
Those guys did
whatever they pleased again.

934
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,991
If they lose, we'll have
good reason to get rid of him.

935
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,095
What are you reading, Isawa?

936
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,165
It's on the news that Mr. Kurokawa
reversed the false charge.

937
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,300
It's great advertisement for our office.

938
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,372
-Ouch.
-Shut up and work.

939
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,976
MAN IN ARSON CASE FOUND INNOCENT

940
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,210
DEFENSE'S EVIDENCE IS TRUSTWORTHY

941
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,245
FOUND INNOCENT

942
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,781
I cannot thank all of you enough.

943
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,950
Thank you so much for your help.

944
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:15,819
Don't mention it.

945
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,621
Where are you going to live?

946
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,524
We decided to sell the land
and move to the country.

947
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:26,096
We couldn't let go of the house
we lived in with our son,

948
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,430
but it's gone too.

949
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,765
I see.

950
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,601
-Take care.
-Thank you, everyone.

951
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,236
Thank you.

952
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,173
Goodbye.

953
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,515
What's the matter?

954
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,517
You seem to be in a bad mood.

955
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,087
If it had been on the news once,

956
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,156
even if he's proved innocent,

957
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,225
people will still criticize him.

958
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,194
That's also why
they'll move to another place.

959
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,730
I see.

960
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,904
It's my day off today.

961
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,105
Have a good rest.

962
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,241
-See you later.
-The loo…

963
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,146
TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

964
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,583
Come to think of it,

965
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,420
I've been left out of the loop
at the end of this.

966
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,990
Nobody told me about the experiment
beforehand too.

967
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,059
Because I asked them to.

968
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:32,028
-We can't let you get in the way.
-What do you mean?

969
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,631
Mr. Beppu said various things to you,
right?

970
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,367
I wasn't going to get in the way
of defending--

971
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,501
I doubt it.

972
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,670
All right, I'll go home now.

973
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,605
My beloved son is waiting.

974
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,641
-Ms. Kinosaki.
-Yes?

975
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,579
Is Mr. Kurokawa's father
a legal professional?

976
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:50,680
Why?

977
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,950
The public prosecutor Ibusuki
said he had met his father.

978
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,653
Did he?

979
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,892
Your son outwitted me again.

980
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,563
I've read the judicial record.

981
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,366
It's because you cut corners.

982
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,301
I didn't, sir.

983
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,403
DEPUTY PROSECUTOR-GENERAL
SUPREME PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

984
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,673
You insisted that the fire broke out
from the son's bedroom,

985
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,675
that's why you were defeated.

986
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,580
If you had claimed that he set fire
to the ground floor at the start,

987
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,615
judging by the judge's impression,

988
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,484
the man would've been found guilty.

989
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,819
Thank you for your advice.

990
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,289
But sooner or later,

991
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,692
he'll know what reality is.

992
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,995
Instead of proving someone's innocence,

993
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,433
it's much more horrible to let
someone go unpunished for his crime.

994
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,009
Mr. Kurokawa's father
is a public prosecutor?

995
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:53,943
Yes.

996
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,980
He's the Deputy Prosecutor-General
at the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office.

997
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,048
You're joking!

I bought it!

1005
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,052
THIS DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

1008
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,392
Please help Takeo!

1009
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,860
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend him.

1010
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,629
<i>Can he prove Takeo's innocence?</i>

1011

<i>Another shocking experiment is done.</i>

1012
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,000
There is no doubt he is innocent.
