00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,337
-I said I don't know anything!
-Wait.

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,839
-Don't touch me.
-Hold him down!

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,775
-Hey… Let go of me! Hey!
-Handcuff him!

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,344
I said I didn't do anything!

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,547
<i>A 21-year-old male was arrested</i>

7
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,351
a convenience store in Asahi City,
Tokyo, and stealing cash.

00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,252
CONVENIENCE STORE ROBBERY
MAN ARRESTED - STAFF MEMBER INJURED

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,289
<i>The man arrested for robbery</i>
<i>causing injury is Tokyo's--</i>

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,592
This is problematic, Arima.

11
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,862
This may be your personal
social media account, but this…

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,033
"'Suspect' is a media jargon
coined by the press.

13
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,836
They treat someone as a criminal
even before the trial

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,406
and the way the press reports
the news is questionable."

15
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,409
In other words, you're criticizing
your peers, right?

16
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,078
We should be careful
when we report any news.

17
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,679
As a matter of fact,

18
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,250
the police and public prosecutors
make wrong judgments sometimes.

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,920
-As the press, we--
-You always say things like this.

20
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,689
That's why you're banned
from the press club.

21
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,894
You only follow stories of false charges

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,229
and haven't gotten any scoop lately.

23
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,832
Think carefully about your situation.

24
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,901
That's all I have to say.

25
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,941
Director Senami still disagrees
with what you think.

26
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,613
Idiots like him are the reason
for reporting bias and trial by media.

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,150
<i>The suspect, Tokachi,</i>
<i>denies charges of robbery.</i>

00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,197
Of course they won't multiply.

30

SHIN KUROKAWA

31
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,637
<i>Mr. Kurokawa's father</i>
<i>is a public prosecutor?</i>

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,174
Yes, he's the Deputy Prosecutor-General
at the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office.

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,176
But if so, why…

34
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:55,648
Why is the elite prosecutor's son
such a weird, penniless lawyer?

35
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,684
Well, yeah.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,887
<i>If you're curious, why don't you ask him?</i>

37
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,624
-You're hungry, right?
-Yes?

38
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,193
It's almost time for lunch.

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,628
-I'll make some tea.
-Thanks.

40

COCOA PEAS

41
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,469
Oh? Kurokawa, you'll have those
for lunch today again?

42
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,104
It's before payday

43
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,441
and I have to check this regularly
and replace them with some new ones.

44
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,876
Sometimes they might expire.

45
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,880
You should spend the money on food
instead of wasting it on these.

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,651
All the rubbish on your desk
is useless too.

47
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,986
Calm down.

48
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,491
Your lunch today
looks delicious too, Miss Wakura.

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,960
You're so young
but always cook for yourself.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,028
I'm impressed.

51
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,831
I've been doing it just to save money.

52
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,966
As I thought, you aren't lovely.

53
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,434
What? I'm not lovely?

54
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,404
If you're a pretty female lawyer,

55
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,007
it's common sense that you shouldn't
be able to cook, right?

56
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,509
That obviously is a prejudice.

57
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,879
Your lunch today is modest too,

58
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,215
my colleagues
of the criminal affairs division.

59
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,852
Mr. Noboribetsu,
you seem to be in a good mood.

60
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,191
Well, the CEO of a client company
wants to express his gratitude,

61
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,493
so he treated every member
in the corporate law division

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,429
to an expensive lunchbox from Kittan!

63
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,298
That's excellent.

64
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,234
Excuse me. Do you have
any lunchboxes left?

65
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,703
No, and if there were,
I wouldn't give it to you.

66
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,172
-I guess so.
-Mr. Kurokawa,

67
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,174
-have mine if you want.
-May I?

68
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,843
Hey, don't waste it.
It's Kittan's lunchbox!

69
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,215
I used to have their lunchboxes
often before, but lately…

70
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,216
What?

71
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,919
It got worse after the son took over,
and I don't really like it.

72
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,923
So, Mr. Kurokawa, please have it.

73
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,024
Thank you.

74
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,263
Isawa was born to a pretty rich family.

75
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,766
That's why he doesn't hesitate
when he says something rude.

76
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,201
Seriously?

77
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,236
KITTAN

78
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,639
Wow, I have to thank Isawa!

79
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,108
I haven't had a proper meal
in a long time.

80
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,677
Do you have no dignity, Mr. Kurokawa?

81
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,613
No, and I'm hungry.

82
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,848
Don't say it so decisively.

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,017
I mean, you are, in fact…

84
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,787
-I am in fact what?
-No, I mean, you…

85
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,223
Mr. Kurokawa, you're asked to be
someone's duty solicitor.

86
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,358
Okay.

87
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,327
-Another job that won't earn us money?
-Oh no, no, no.

88
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,531
Thanks.

89
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,735
Hello. Kurokawa speaking. I'm the lawyer.

90
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,771
Yes. Okay, it's fine.

91
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,806
Please fax me the relevant documents.

92
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,575
Okay. Thank you.

93
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,644
Kurokawa.

94
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,046
It's robbery causing injury.
After I have lunch--

95
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,881
I'm not talking about that.

96
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,756
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry…

97
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,924
-Oh, it's my lunch--
-Thanks for lunch.

98
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,361
You're welcome.

99
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,672
Please… help Takeo!

100
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,074
I'll investigate it thoroughly
and defend him.

101
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,242
<i>I think that he is the culprit.</i>

102
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,177
I really wanted to turn over a new leaf.

103
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,212
Don't be such a baby!

104
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,980
PROVING INNOCENCE
IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE CASE!

105
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:14,814
ANOTHER SHOCKING EXPERIMENT!

106
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,516
-Roger.
-We might be able

107
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,918
<i>to get an alibi for Mr. Tokachi's now!</i>

108
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,553
<i>The crime scene</i>

109
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,724
<i>is a 24-hour convenience store</i>
<i>in Asahi City, Mitsuya.</i>

110
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,496
<i>The robbery happened on</i>
<i>January 16, 2019, at 7 a.m.</i>

111
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,732
JAPANESE SAKE

112
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,934
Hey. Who are you?

113
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,778
<i>Seventy thousand yen cash</i>
<i>in the staff room was stolen</i>

114
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,348
<i>and the staff's injury</i>
<i>will take two weeks to heal.</i>

115
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,817
<i>After that, Takeo Tokachi,</i>
<i>who lives nearby</i>

116
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,252
<i>and works as a part-time cook,</i>
<i>was arrested and put in custody.</i>

117
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,589
The news says that he denied the charges.

118
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,624
Watch your manners.

119
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,462
-I didn't get to have lunch.
-Serves you right.

120
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,332
The duty solicitor who is here
for an interview, I presume?

121
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,234
Yes, we are.

122
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,037
I'm CID's Matsumoto.
I'm in charge of this case.

123
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,308
I know it's the country system,
but hats off to you.

124
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,746
You have to make an effort
to come and talk to the loser.

125
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,980
"Loser"?

126
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,851
Tokachi is a notoriously bad guy.

127
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,519
Since his teens,

128
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,455
he's been taken into custody
many times for theft and fighting.

129
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,923
Is his behavior so bad?

130
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes, he was raised by his single mother,

131
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,262
so maybe his family is problematic.

132
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,498
-But--
-But you can't say for sure.

133
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,767
Well, just talk to him for a bit.

134
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,909
I'm your lawyer, Kurokawa.

135
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,945
-I'm Wakura. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

136
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,014
-When will they let me go?
-Yes?

137
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,616
SUSPECT, TAKEO TOKACHI

138
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,684
I'm innocent.

139
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,888
Hurry up and let me get out of here.
That's why you're here, right?

140
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,390
We can't do it immediately.

141
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,527
First, we have to talk to you
to see if you're the culprit--

142
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,329
I didn't rob anyone!

143
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,034
I kept saying I didn't do it,
but everyone just assumed I did.

144
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,737
We don't assume that you did--

145
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,706
I know you think I did it anyway!

146
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,875
-We don't know yet.
-What?

147
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,212
We have no idea,
so we have to investigate this.

148
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,247
What can you investigate?

149
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,650
I mean, lawyers are--

150
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,486
Did you cut your finger with a knife?

151
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,856
You work part-time at a restaurant, right?

152
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,627
I'm an apprentice chef.

153
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,833
I want to save some money
and go to a culinary school.

154
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,370
I am sorry.

155
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,041
I am stupid.

156
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,845
So, when the police kept telling me

157
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,515
to admit that I did it, I got worked up.

158
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,552
On January 16, at 7 a.m.,
when the robbery happened,

159
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,222
where were you?

160
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,991
I don't remember the time,

161
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,596
but I traveled to my friend's
by car the night before,

162
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,766
stopped by the petrol station
in Hijiridai,

163
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,971
and I probably got home a bit after 7 a.m.

164
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,872
Did you tell the police?

165
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,274
I told them, but they didn't believe me.

166
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,578
They said they'd investigate
thoroughly and told me not to lie.

167
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,315
The petrol station ran
on self-service at that time,

168
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,718
so I didn't see anyone.

169
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,322
That means there was no witness.

170
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,791
-Then…
-What do you mean?

171
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,727
Are you saying that I did it?

172
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,562
No…

173
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,198
Your attitude and the look
on your face tell me clearly that

174
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,533
you look down on me.

175
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,736
You really annoy me,
so don't come again, bitch!

176
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,172
Hey, it's over. Open the door.

177
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,782
What was that attitude?
I'm sure that he did it.

178
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,985
I don't mean I agree with the detective,
but he really is a loser.

179
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,622
I don't know if he did it or not,
but this is difficult.

180
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,792
I have to talk to him properly
before he's prosecuted.

181
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,628
It isn't necessary.
He told us not to come again.

182
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,565
Excuse me. When can I see Takeo?

183
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,067
Give me a break.

184
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,204
I've told you many times,
he's only allowed to see his lawyer.

185
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,707
-Excuse me.
-You're right where I want you.

186
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,510
They are the lawyers.

187
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,680
I am Takeo Tokachi's mother.

188
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,647
MUTSUMI TOKACHI
SUSPECT'S MOTHER

189
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,584
Sorry for causing you trouble.

190
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,885
It's okay.

191
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,786
TOKACHIYA

192
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,289
It often rains here lately,
but it'll stop very soon.

193
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,258
I'll make you some tea now.

194
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,759
No, it's okay.

195
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,295
We'd like to talk about your son.

196
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,432
I am sorry.

197
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,602
I heard he was rude to you.

198
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,570
No, it's fine.

199
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,872
He denies the charges,

200
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,442
so the period of detention
will probably be extended.

201
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,676
I see.

202
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,145
May we have a look at your son's room?

203
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,581
This way, please.

204
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,918
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

CHATEAU - CUT INTO 6CM PIECES

207
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,730
They're photos from the past?

208
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,231
Yes, they are.

209
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,100
Sorry for being rude,

210
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,802
but we heard that he'd been
put in custody many times.

211
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,939
He was a delinquent in high school.

212
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,642
I raised him as a single mother,

213
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,111
so I didn't fulfil my role perfectly.

214
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,647
I don't think it's your fault.

215
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,685
Does your son work part-time
at another restaurant?

216
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,920
It's a western restaurant
in the neighboring town.

217
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,490
He decided to be a cook.

218
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,859
I told him he could get trained at ours,

219
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,695
but he said he wouldn't be able
to be disciplined here.

220
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,730
He's been working hard and seriously.

221
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,134
I don't think he's a loser, Miss Wakura.

222
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,738
My son is really trying
to turn over a new leaf,

223
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,607
so he will never commit any robbery!

224
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,909
He denied it strongly too.

225
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,513
But if he didn't, we need to prove it.

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,984
-But Mr. Kurokawa--
-I will make a request formally.

227
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,188
Please… help Takeo!

228
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,490
I beg you, Mr. Kurokawa!

229
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,301
All right, then.

230
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,372
I'll investigate it thoroughly
and defend him.

231
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,807
I am counting on you.

232
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,577
Good evening.

233
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,246
-Good evening.
-Welcome back.

234
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,416
Miss Arima sent us some information
about the case.

235
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,617
That's helpful.

236
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,886
I'm impressed by the power of the press.

237
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,490
Although she wanted
another interview in exchange.

238
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,861
I've read them and he seems guilty.

239
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,897
He was caught on the security camera
and he left his fingerprints.

240
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,999
On top of that, he has no alibi.

241
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,335
But Tokachi said he didn't do it.

242
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,137
What was your first impression of him?

243
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,139
Honestly, I think he did it.

244
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,475
He got angry easily
and his attitude was bad.

245
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,844
But it doesn't mean that
he committed the robbery.

246
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,814
Well, you'll defend him
before the prosecution,

247
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,750
just break whatever reason

248
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,285
that makes them find him guilty,
thoroughly.

249
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,821
Rather than winning the trial,

250
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,291
successfully making them
drop the prosecution is much better.

251
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,526
Good evening.

252
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,529
Mr. Kurokawa and Miss Wakura,
Mr. Beppu would like to see you.

253
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,730
Mr. Beppu?

254
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,034
Excuse me.

255
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,170
Are you having supper?

256
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,772
Sorry.

257
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,341
I heard that the corporate law
colleagues had it for lunch.

258
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,742
I just wanted it for no reason.

259
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,577
Well, do sit down.

260
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,981
Well, Kittan's lunchbox is the best.

261
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,884
The taste of tradition never changes.

262
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,286
-I think it has changed.
-What has?

263
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,389
Please forget it.
What would you like us to do?

264
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,323
Yes…

265
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,294
You're in charge
of a robbery-causing-injury case?

266
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,665
Yes. I hope I can do something
before the prosecution.

267
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,534
About that.

268
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,271
I would like Miss Wakura
to be in charge of the case.

269
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,973
-What?
-What? I'll be in charge?

270
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,845
You helped Mr. Kurokawa last time
and learned how to do criminal defense.

271
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,346
This will let you gain experience.

272
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,714
What do you think, Mr. Kurokawa?

273
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,884
I don't mind.

274
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,621
Okay, Miss Wakura will decide
how to defend the client

275
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,124
and how to investigate the case.

276
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,893
I'm counting on you, Miss Wakura.

277
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,895
Don't let what happened last time
happen again.

278
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,997
Yes, Mr. Beppu.

279
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,900
MITSUYA

280
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,217
He had worked part-time at our store.

281
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,553
He should know that there is
only one staff member at that time too,

282
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,689
that's why he did it.

283
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,659
His face isn't shown clearly on the video.

284
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,928
How do you know that it was Mr. Tokachi?

285
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,398
It was just for a second,
but I saw his masked face.

286
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,801
The eyes and the build looked like his.

287
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,538
-That means you didn't see it clearly?
-I didn't,

288
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,108
but the police said
they found his fingerprints.

289
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,344
His fingerprints were found at two places,

290
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,082
on the staff room's entrance door
and at the store entrance.

291
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,886
But he left no fingerprint
in the staff room, where cash was stolen.

292
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,254
Don't you think it's strange?

293
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,154
MITSUYA

294
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,425
He wore gloves in the staff room
and took them off when he left.

295
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,526
That's what the police thinks.

296
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,231
-But that sounds far-fetched.
-Of course it is.

297
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,636
-Wow, they look delicious!
-What are you doing?

298
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,638
What will Ms. Tokachi do now?

299
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,506
Close the restaurant and move, of course.

300
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,608
Her son committed robbery.

301
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,444
-Nothing's gone right for the lady.
-Right.

302
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,482
I mean, the son she raised herself
became a criminal.

303
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,383
Exactly.

304
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,251
Everything just makes me angry.

305
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,188
The detective we met
and the people at the store

306
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,425
say it like the son commits crimes
because Mrs. Tokachi is a single mom.

307
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,527
Well, it can't be helped.

308
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,664
But assuming that
he committed robbery is prejudice.

309
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,565
He's a delinquent and committed robbery

310
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,468
because he has a single mom. It's obvious.

311
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,372
I never know what people say
about us because of my son,

312
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,274
so I'm on edge very often.

313
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,743
Ms. Kinosaki, you're--

314
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,079
A single mother. It's a long story.

315
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,213
Did I let you down?

316
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,582
No, of course not.

317
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,755
This is the petrol station
where Mr. Tokachi stopped by.

318
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,657
<i>I stopped by</i>
<i>the petrol station at Hijiridai</i>

319
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,261
and I probably got home a bit after 7 a.m.

320
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,697
If they've kept
the security camera's video

321
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,732
and gives him an alibi,
that would be great.

322
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,169
Wait. What is Mr. Kurokawa
doing over there?

323
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,372
Mr. Kurokawa!

324
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,774
Please don't do anything suspicious!

325
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,745
No, this! I'm just curious about it.

326
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,880
I wonder what it is used for.

327
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,749
I don't know!

328
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,818
Anyway, let's go and interview…

329
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,829
SELF-SERVICE
NIRAYAMA OIL

330
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,098
Oh? Mr. Kurokawa, fancy seeing you here.

331
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,499
Hello.

332
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,703
Mr. Ibusuki, are you investigating
the robbery too?

333
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,971
Yes, I am.

334
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,474
Are you the prosecutor who called?

335
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,608
I'm Ibusuki.

336
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,510
And the people there too?

337
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,279
-We are lawyers.
-Lawyer? Takeo's?

338
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,649
What…

339
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,351
-It is you!
-What?

340
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,755
You're Mr. Tokachi's friend, right?
I saw your photo in his room.

341
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,990
-I used to hang out with him.
-Oh, right.

342
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,091
Excuse me.

343
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,094
I'd like to finish my job.

344
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,899
That's right. Sorry, please go ahead.

345
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,804
Anyway, it's unusual

346
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,273
for a prosecutor to go out
to investigate a case.

347
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,176
We also conduct investigations
if necessary.

348
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,114
In other words, the police's
investigation alone wasn't enough?

349
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,850
Like Tokachi has an alibi?

350
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,252
Well, who knows?

351
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,522
The police came here too, right?

352
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,459
Yeah, they told me to show them
the security camera footage.

353
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,796
They had a glance, took some photos,
and left in a short time.

354
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,730
Photos?

355
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,599
They didn't take any video tape

356
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,836
and only gave me
this material for investigation.

357
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,838
Just two photos?

358
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,808
Their investigation was quite careless.

359
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,544
So you're here
to properly check the video?

360
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,013
-Can you find it?
-It almost got deleted.

361
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,249
Our security camera's video

362
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,152
is automatically updated every 150 hours.

363
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,489
This was taken at 6:42 a.m.
on the day of the robbery.

364
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,724
Here he is.

365
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,176
He came at 6:45 a.m. and left at 6:49 a.m.

366
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,080
It takes five minutes to go to
the convenience store by car.

367
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,016
So, it's very possible for him
to commit the robbery at 7 a.m.

368
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,653
But he ran away from the crime scene
on foot, not by car.

369
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,788
He must've parked it nearby.

370
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:47,192
But would someone who's going to rob
refuel his car ten minutes before?

371
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,160
He might.

372
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,231
Why? You think Takeo didn't do it,
Mr. Lawyer?

373
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,801
I don't know.
That's why I'm investigating.

374
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,670
I know him very well.

375
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,906
He's my friend,
so I don't want to say this,

376
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,307
but I think he's the culprit.

377
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,243
He always says he wants money.

378
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,948
Mr. Ibusuki, are you going
to prosecute my client?

379
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,650
No comment.

380
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,751
This time, the police

381
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,687
obviously made an assumption
when they arrested my client.

382
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,456
You can't identify the person on the video

383
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,324
taken at the convenience store.

384
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,492
Mr. Kurokawa,

385
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,263
innocent until proven guilty
is only a principle.

386
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,101
Your father taught me that all suspects
are suspected for a reason.

387
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,872
It's your job to consider the interests
of the suspect or accused.

388
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,241
If you want me to drop the prosecution,

389
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,010
get enough material for me to do so.

390
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:48,153
-Mr. Kurokawa.
-I am really curious about that.

391
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,289
But that rubbish
isn't related to the case.

392
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,160
<i>This is Mr. Todoroki,</i>
<i>who created this Sunrise Tower.</i>

393
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,128
MASTER AT WORK IN WEST TAMA
SUNRISE TOWER

394
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,098
<i>Excuse me. Why did you make this tower?</i>

395
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,202
<i>The sun rises from</i>
<i>where my house faces every morning,</i>

396
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,571
<i>then an idea flashed</i>
<i>across my mind one day…</i>

397
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,972
What a man.

398
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>It'd be great to have a tower</i>
<i>that shines when the sun rises.</i>

399
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,744
<i>The place of sunrise changes,</i>

400
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,114
<i>so I adjust it every day to make it</i>
<i>reflect the light beautifully.</i>

401
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,584
Sunrise Tower?

402
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,220
I'm happy that I got an answer.

403
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,124
It's a story reported by
our breakfast show three years ago.

404
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,426
What's wrong with it?

405
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,062
It's just Mr. Kurokawa's
personal interest.

406
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,331
It has nothing to do with the case.

407
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,766
Somehow she's worked up.

408
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,769
Is the convenience store robbery
not going well?

409
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,137
It's only a quick investigation,

410
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,174
but we haven't found any fact
that could be used for defense.

411
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,178
The public prosecutor is likely
to prosecute our client.

412
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,148
We haven't got much time left
to get him to drop the prosecution.

413
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,850
Exactly!

414
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,721
So, we don't have time for you
to fool around, Mr. Kurokawa.

415
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,924
But I'm not fooling around.

416
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,294
Oh… It is shining over here too.

417
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,795
You totally are fooling around.

418
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,337
I've reserved a lot of time
for you today too.

419
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,475
Be prepared for it.

420
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:31,990
TOKACHIYA

421
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,594
MASTER AT WORK IN WEST TAMA - AT HOME

422
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,766
Mr. Kurokawa, I'd like to talk to you
about our plan for the case.

423
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,868
Miss Wakura, have a look at this.

424
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,806
It's reflecting
the rising sun's light. So?

425
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,642
The sun rose at 6:45 a.m. on January 16,

426
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,277
when the robbery happened.

427
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,745
It's right at this time,

428
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,150
but don't you think the light
is weaker than the one in the show?

429
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,751
So what?

430
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,356
Also, the light here seems to be moving.

431
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,058
I just find it strange.

432
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,928
You're wasting my time. Come at once.

433
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,134
Mr. Tokachi's mother just called.

434
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,504
She would like you to go to
the convenience store at once.

435
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,405
The crime scene?

436
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,876
The police have conducted
an investigation.

437
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,144
-Just once…
-We can't…

438
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,647
Oh, lawyers! Do something about her!

439
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,548
What's the matter?

440
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,318
I've been looking for the receipt
my son got at the petrol station,

441
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,720
then I found these.

442
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,289
-Receipts issued by this store?
-Yes.

443
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,624
My son buys things here from time to time.

444
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,395
So, the fingerprints lifted might be left
when he came as a customer?

445
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:48,033
So, I would like to check the videos
taken by the security camera.

446
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,768
But we…

447
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,737
We won't interrupt your work.

448
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,140
Please let us check them
in the presence of a lawyer.

449
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,541
Please let us check them!

450
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,915
Oh! This is Takeo!

451
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,523
The video was taken
two days before the robbery.

452
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,668
Whether the fingerprints lifted here
is relevant or not is now dubious.

453
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,239
Excuse me. I have to go now.

454
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,040
Tell our staff if you need anything.

455
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,108
Thank you, sir.

456
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,144
It must be tough for you, ma'am,

457
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,645
to be pushed around by what your son did.

458
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,948
I am sorry for bringing you
so much trouble.

459
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:42,154
I guess it really doesn't work out
if you aren't related by blood.

460
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,193
Actually…

461
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,596
the boy is the son of my distant relative.

462
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,469
He was abused by his biological parents,

463
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,741
so I adopted him
when he was three years old.

464
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,782
When Takeo first came to live with me,

465
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,718
I was really happy.

466
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,190
<i>When I saw him enjoying</i>

467
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,027
<i>the meal I cooked for him,</i>

468
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:25,130
<i>I was really happy.</i>

469
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,133
<i>It is true that…</i>

470
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,838
<i>Takeo became a delinquent</i>
<i>and caused many people trouble</i>

471
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,476
<i>and maybe the way I raised him was wrong,</i>

472
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:43,281
<i>but the boy really tried</i>
<i>to turn over a new leaf!</i>

473
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,883
On the day of the robbery,

474
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,853
I saw him when he got home in the morning.

475
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,555
If he was guilty of something,

476
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,290
I'd have been able to tell
just by looking at him!

477
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:58,997
We have been mother and son for 18 years.

478
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,837
You've done so many evil deeds,
do you think you can start again?

479
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,274
The restaurant you work part-time at
has fired you.

480
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,844
-What?
-Even your mother doesn't trust you.

481
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,447
You're ruining your mother's life!

482
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,496
Hey! Stop it!

483
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,167
What are you doing? Hey! Stop it!

484
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,704
-Stop it! What are you doing?
-Stop it now!

485
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,410
Found it!

486
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,246
We can prove that the fingerprints
weren't left during the robbery!

487
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,215
Thank you! So, Takeo--

488
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,585
No, I don't think this alone
can clear him of suspicion.

489
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,255
Mr. Tokachi hasn't got an alibi himself.

490
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,356
No.

491
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,830
Wakura speaking.

492
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,532
Not yet.

493
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,000
What?

494
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,503
NISHI TAMA POLICE STATION

495
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,071
Why were you so reckless?

496
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,240
I am just…

497
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,976
not sure anymore.

498
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,979
The detective accused me of it every day…

499
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,684
and I heard that the restaurant fired me.

500
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,821
I just…

501
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,658
I wanted to free myself from the torture.

502
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,394
Free yourself from the torture?

503
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,665
I really wanted to turn over a new leaf

504
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,570
because it would make my mom happy.

505
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,874
But now…

506
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,847
Is it already too late?

507
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,484
Your mother believes that
you are innocent.

508
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,121
Does she really?

509
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,190
Why do you say that?

510
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,825
Because…

511
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,961
she is…

512
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,498
You think she won't trust you
because you aren't related by blood?

513
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,538
Don't be such a baby!

514
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,775
Saying you have a single mom
or used to be a delinquent

515
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,178
or not related by blood really annoys me!

516
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,615
The important thing is if
you're a decent person now!

517
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,852
Your mother trusts you.

518
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,888
Don't doubt her feelings
just because this is trying!

519
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,631
I'm sorry I shouted at him.

520
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,568
It's okay. What you said was right.

521
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,272
My mom is a single mother too.

522
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,842
I didn't want people to look down on us,

523
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,445
so I studied very hard to be a lawyer.

524
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,447
So, it got me worked up.

525
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,884
I think it's brilliant.

526
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,120
But I think you're contradicting
yourself a bit.

527
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,121
Contradicting?

528
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,325
You don't want people to look down
on you because of your mom.

529
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,195
That means you accept people's views

530
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,230
that single parent families
should be looked down on.

531
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,100
It is only a prejudice.

532
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,303
You are a decent person now.

533
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,573
That's all that matters.

534
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,015
Thanks for coming at such a late hour.

535
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,318
He brought us much trouble
for causing chaos in his cell.

536
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,121
He was pretty cornered
during the questioning.

537
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,923
This is our job.

538
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,760
Moreover, the prosecutor
decided to charge him.

539
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,330
But everything
is just circumstantial evidence!

540
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,432
Say it to the public prosecutor.

541
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,642
He'll be prosecuted?

542
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,146
We have to take action!

543
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,681
It might not work,

544
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,317
but we should try using what we have,
including the fingerprints,

545
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,618
and ask him to drop the charges.

546
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,453
Gosh!

547
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,459
-Please let me borrow this.
-Who are you?

548
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,374
I heard the corporate law colleagues
had it for lunch,

549
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,542
and I wanted it for no reason.

550
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,711
<i>It's been raining often lately,</i>

551
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,613
<i>but it usually stops very soon.</i>

552
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,521
What are you doing, Mr. Kurokawa?

553
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,990
What time is it?

554
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,293
It's 6:25 p.m.

555
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,828
Maybe I'll make it in time.

556
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,097
Thank you.

557
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,933
Wait! Where are you going?

558
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,069
Mr. Kurokawa!

559
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,472
What…

560
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,042
Please tell me what you are doing.

561
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,014
The solar azimuth angle
is minus 63 degrees.

562
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,882
The mirror faces two degrees to the east.

563
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:18,783
Okay.

564
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,185
Dr. Akiu!

565
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,586
-Like this?
-Yes.

566
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,788
Oh, you're here too?

567
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,592
What are you doing here
at such a late hour?

568
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,196
I asked Dr. Akiu to analyze
the video taken by

569
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,931
the petrol station's security camera.

570
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,333
Analyze it? But why?

571
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,135
Oh, it's coming.

572
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,304
All right.

573
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,250
This is art.

574
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,718
Wow, you have a sharp mind.

575
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,553
I'll make you some tea. Wait here.

576
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,390
Dr. Akiu, about the light in the video…

577
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,794
You've realized too?

578
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,662
Probably…

579
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,698
that's what caused it.

580
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,267
I knew it!

581
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,771
Mr. Kurokawa! I don't get
what you're talking about at all!

582
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,375
Dr. Akiu, please explain it to me!

583
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,746
Hey! I've made some tea.
Come in and warm yourself up!

584
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,516
I won't explain it.
First, I'll go and have tea.

585
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,119
Gosh!

586
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,089
Really? Are you sure?

587
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,093
I am sure, but who on earth are you?

588
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,495
Mr. Kurokawa, what is going on?

589
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,966
Miss Wakura, we might be able
to get Mr. Tokachi's alibi now!

590
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,604
Yes, one vehicle each.
Please make the arrangement.

591
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,107
Is this okay?

592
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,943
Mr. Senami is keeping an eye on us.
If we don't tell him…

593
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,311
It's okay.

594
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,481
I have to follow as many cases
Kurokawa handles as I can.

595
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,029
SUN'S POSITION, SUNRISE TOWER
PETROL STATION, PLASTIC TENT

596
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,337
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

597
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,672
You are here again?

598
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,174
He doesn't even say hello.

599
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,744
I'll interview him, but I got him
what he needs in return.

600
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,514
-Where?
-The light is in the car.

601
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,249
The vehicles will arrive soon.

602
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,018
You can at least say thank you.

603
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:36,888
Good.

604
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,756
The vehicles are here.

605
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:47,131
He'll do a large-scale experiment
this time too?

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,101
Is this okay?

607
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,438
It's 0.5 degrees too low.
Raise it one meter higher.

608
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:58,142
Listen, sunrise isn't what we'll re-enact.

609
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,043
Okay.

610
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,346
Please raise it one meter higher!

611
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,458
It's now at the same angle
as it was on January 16.

612
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,359
<i>Good.</i>

613
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,061
Turn on the valve when I tell you.

614
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:17,996
Okay.

615
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,065
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

616
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,069
Will it really go smoothly?

617
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,838
It will. Let's go and stand by.

618
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,539
Okay.

619
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,608
All right.

620
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,480
Wakura, turn on the valve.

621
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,142
<i>Turn off the valve.</i>

622
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,108
The experiment is done.

623
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,613
-It's the same.
-Yes, it's the same.

624
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,061
We took the video when we did
the experiment last night.

625
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,997
If you compare it with the video
taken at the petrol station

626
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,399
on the day of the robbery,

627
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,635
you can see that the light flickers
in both videos.

628
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,638
So, what's your point?

629
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,309
I don't know what you want to prove
by showing me this.

630
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,979
We'll say our conclusion.

631
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,016
The video gives Mr. Tokachi a valid alibi.

632
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:25,423
The time here shows that Mr. Tokachi
was caught on camera at 6:45 a.m.,

633
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,658
but the actual time was 7 a.m.

634
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,229
It was the exact same time
when the convenience store was robbed.

635
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,466
He was definitely
at the petrol station at that time.

636
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,303
The time shown on the video
taken by the petrol station's camera

637
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,105
was 15 minutes behind the actual time.

638
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,042
The camera is old
and isn't well maintained.

639
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,444
If you don't check it regularly,

640
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,514
it might do the recording
with the wrong time shown.

641
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,948
I can't believe this.

642
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,717
You have to show me some clear evidence.

643
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,586
The flickering of the light
you saw is the evidence.

644
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,755
The phenomenon is caused by

645
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,625
the rain water collected on

646
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,027
the plastic tent next to
the petrol station.

647
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,700
Sunlight was focused by the rain water

648
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,470
reflected by the mirror
and shone on the tower.

649
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,538
HEIGHT OF THE SUN

650
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,772
On the day of the robbery,

651
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,208
there was a localized
torrential downpour in the morning.

652
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:23,681
This video was taken by the security
camera at the plastic tent that day.

653
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,384
As you can see, the time shown is 7 a.m.

654
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,487
You mean when the man did this,
it caused the flickering of light

655
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,255
observed in the petrol station's video?

656
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,928
It isn't enough to convince me
to accept your claim that the time

657
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,096
of the petrol station's video is wrong.

658
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,231
Why is that?

659
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,100
You say water caused the light to flicker.

660
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,036
Fine, I'll accept it.

661
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:49,373
But wind or other things could've
caused the light to flicker too.

662
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,110
Maybe the time of the petrol station's
security camera is right

663
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,380
and it's also possible that
the light flickered at 6:45 a.m.--

664
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,348
It isn't possible.

665
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:58,816
Definitely.

666
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:00,952
You'll say for sure?

667
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:06,357
If you play the videos taken at
both places at 6:45 a.m. together,

668
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,792
then it'll be obvious.

669
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,369
It started to rain
in the plastic tent's video,

670
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,572
but it wasn't
at the petrol station next to it.

671
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:27,278
This is the data of the local weather
on the day of the robbery.

672
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,180
There was localized torrential downpour

673
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,849
from 6:50 a.m. to 6:55 a.m.

674
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,119
But it isn't raining
in the petrol station's video

675
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,022
because the rain had stopped.

676
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:47,999
Without a doubt, Mr. Tokachi
was at the petrol station at 7 a.m.

677
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,603
It wasn't possible for him
to rob the convenience store.

678
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,407
The witness' testimony wasn't clear.

679
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,110
We've also checked the video
of the store's camera

680
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,378
and can prove that

681
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,547
Mr. Tokachi left his fingerprints
there before the robbery.

682
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,784
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

PHOTO 1 - NEAR STAFF ROOM
ENTRANCE DOOR

684
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,595
-Check this.
-Yes, sir.

685
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,503
Based on the suspect's family background

686
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,106
and his bad behavior before,
the police were biased

687
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,310
and they arrested my client wrongly.

688
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,015
In this robbery-causing-injury case,

689
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,685
Mr. Takeo Tokachi…

690
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,121
is innocent, without a doubt.

691
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,191
Who is the robber, then?

692
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,028
The police or you
have to investigate this.

693
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,031
This isn't our job.

694
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,552
Well…

695
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,121
NISHI TAMA POLICE STATION

696
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,622
Thank you for helping me.

697
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,227
Don't mention it. We're glad
your innocence is proven.

698
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,665
What's the matter?

699
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,066
Well…

700
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,571
I'm just wondering if I can still
work at a restaurant.

701
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,942
It's my fault that
I've done many stupid things.

702
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:43,114
People's opinion about me
must've gotten worse after this too.

703
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,385
-Well…
-Frankly, I think it'll be tough.

704
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,988
If people had been dubious about you once,

705
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,457
they'll be prejudiced,
and you can't do anything about it.

706
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,895
Mr. Tokachi, although you're innocent
this time,

707
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,897
your behavior was bad.

708
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,032
That's why you were suspected.

709
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,801
-Mr. Kurokawa!
-But…

710
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,937
I believe that people can change.

711
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,274
If you want to change people's prejudice,

712
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,577
please prove that
you have changed yourself.

713
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,514
You're right.

714
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,151
Your mother is waiting for you.

715
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,627
Welcome.

716
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,398
I'm home.

717
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,067
Welcome home.

718
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,439
There aren't many customers today.

719
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,943
-Mom, I--
-Sit down.

720
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,077
You must be starving.

721
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,118
Dig in.

722
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,288
Come on.

723
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,590
Here you go.

724
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,396
Just think about

725
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,699
what you're going to do later.

726
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,092
It's tasty.

727
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,571
Oh, I'm hungry.

728
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,907
I've got lunch
when we return to the office.

729
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,808
I can't walk.

730
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,212
Isn't it a lot of bother
to cook every time?

731
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,183
My family is poor,
so I don't like to eat out.

732
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,185
Eat out.

733
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,287
I haven't eaten out lately.

734
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,857
But you chose to be poor yourself,
didn't you?

735
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,559
You come from a rich family.

736
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,162
Your father is a high official
at the prosecutors' office, right?

737
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,168
But we don't really stay in touch.

738
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,206
Why did you become a lawyer?

739
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,174
And you specialize in criminal defense,

740
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,943
which doesn't earn you money.

741
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,347
Both your clothes and lifestyle
are so casual and sloppy.

742
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,118
Thinking an elite prosecutor's son
has to be decent

743
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,452
is probably your prejudice.

744
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,022
Please don't avoid my question.

745
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,823
Are you just being rebellious?

746
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,526
Rebellious?

747
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,863
If you say so, maybe I am.

748
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:51,101
Because he thinks that
people can never change.

749
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,274
<i>On January 18,</i>

750
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,778
<i>in the robbery that happened in</i>
<i>a convenient story in Asahi City,</i>

751
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,014
<i>the MPD arrested the suspect,</i>
<i>21-year-old Yuji Nirayama,</i>

752
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,784
<i>who works at a petrol station</i>
<i>in Asahi City,</i>

753
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,119
<i>for robbery resulting in bodily injury.</i>

754
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,222
He had intended to frame Tokachi
for it right from the start.

755
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,060
He knew Tokachi had been out that day

756
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,294
and he dressed like Tokachi.

757
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,130
But they were friends, right?

758
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,465
Then, why…

759
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,602
It was because he was jealous.

760
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,504
He and Tokachi used to be delinquents.

761
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,540
Tokachi had a dream
and has turned over a new leaf,

762
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,210
but he is still living without a goal.

763
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,814
How selfish of him!

764
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,686
By the way, where are Kurokawa
and Mr. Yufuin today?

765
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,522
Mr. Kurokawa is looking for food
in his room

766
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,724
and Mr. Yufuin is--

767
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,059
Summoned by Mr. Beppu
and is at his office.

768
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,863
Although the defense went well,

769
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,265
frankly, I can't be happy…

770
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,903
if he does whatever he pleases
every single time.

771
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,239
I am sorry.

772
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:07,144
But he needed to do the experiment to win.

773
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,714
Mr. Yufuin.

774
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,784
I'll make it clear to you.

775
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,819
You're a pain in the neck to me.

776
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,025
And your successor, Kurokawa, too.

777
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,027
KITTY DINER

778
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,096
This is impossible, even for me.

779
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,633
Okay.

780
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,610
I know it's done for evidence,
but isn't the scale too big?

781
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,045
It can't be helped.

782
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,747
This is what happens
when Dr. Akiu is involved.

783
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,583
Who is Dr. Akiu actually?

784
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,353
<i>He's been bossy and taking the lead.</i>

785
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,021
<i>I didn't tell you?</i>

786
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,592
<i>Dr. Akiu was Mr. Kurokawa's senior</i>
<i>at Touo University.</i>

787
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:58,896
His senior?

788
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,532
Kurokawa did science
and technology at first,

789
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,469
but he went to study law in his third year
and became a lawyer.

790
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,872
From science and technology to law.

791
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,877
Mr. Kurokawa has been weird
since he was in college.

792
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,281
Not exactly weird.

793
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:21,952
His personality just changed at that time.

794
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,821
MURDER BY TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT

795
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,888
SUSPECT SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT

796
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:28,892
LEGAL DOCUMENTS

797
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,396
Yes!

798
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,999
THIS DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

799
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,068
<i>A medical accident happened at a hospital.</i>

800
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,405
Our daughter's life was taken suddenly.

801
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,006
Can you understand how we feel?

802
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,710
Proving someone's innocence
can't bring a dead person back to life.

803
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,713
<i>But the lawyers still use the power</i>
<i>of science to find out the truth.</i>

804
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,014
We claim his innocence.

805
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,883
<i>Have you reported this?</i>

806
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,485
<i>It's total nonsense.</i>

807
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,986
This is to change the hospital.

808
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,988
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

809
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,291
-<i>Don't take this case.</i>
-Aren't you going to go to someone?

810
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,993
<i>It can't operate itself.</i>

811
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,462
A problem has occurred,
so it has to be changed.
