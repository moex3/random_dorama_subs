1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,804
Misa, can you hear me?

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,507
Can you hear me, Misa?

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,377
-DC.
-Yes.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,446
Defibrillator charged.

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,584
Dr. Unzen.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,522
MENU, TRENDLIST, TRANSPORT,
ASYSTOLE, ALARM

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,792
13-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT
DIES OF CARDIAC ARREST

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,865
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

9
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,443
What's wrong, Mr. Kurokawa?

10
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,413
Sorry, I was looking for the pills.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,182
Pills? Are you not feeling well?

12
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,650
Since this morning…

13
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,287
-Hang in there!
-Good morning.

14
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,089
-I just heard a loud noise…
-Mr. Kurokawa!

15
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,626
You finally did it, Miss Wakura.

16
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,894
What did I do?

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,262
He made a mess of your desk again,

18
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,931
-so you snapped and beat him.
-My stomach…

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,933
Did Miss Wakura punch you?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,135
Or did she stab you?

21
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,304
I didn't punch or stab him!

22
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,440
He just fell down himself!

23
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,508
What?

24
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,577
Anyway, we have to take him
to the hospital.

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,878
Hospital?

26
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,281
I don't like hospitals
and I'd have to pay.

27
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,882
You can't afford to say that!

28
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,684
I know why I've got a stomachache.

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,022
I got my salary yesterday,
so I got carried away.

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,156
What?

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,026
He got carried away

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,429
and ate pizza, curry, sushi,
ice-cream, pudding, and cake?

33
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,131
Is he an idiot?

34
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:43,403
Kurokawa needs to improve
his lifestyle a little.

35
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,972
<i>He's enthusiastic about his work,</i>

36
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,708
<i>but he doesn't pay enough attention</i>
<i>to everything else.</i>

37
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,679
Before he aimed to be a lawyer,
he used to be

38
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,449
an organized young man, the exact
opposite of what he's like now.

39
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:00,553
You mean when he was still a student
and doing science and engineering?

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,690
Oh? You know that too, Miss Wakura?

41
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,658
Miss Arima told me the other day.

42
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,461
Kurokawa did science
and engineering, originally.

43
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,630
He wasn't weird.

44
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,067
Rather, his personality changed
at that time, I think.

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,870
It sounded like
there was a story behind it.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,875
Did Mr. Kurokawa do something bad
when he was a student

47
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,843
and you defended him?

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,813
No, it isn't like that.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,649
We just happened to meet.

50
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,450
FIRST-AID KIT

51
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,951
Here it is.

52
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,722
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

53
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,190
Good morning.

54
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,925
Oh, good morning, Mr. Yufuin.

55
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,894
Miss Arima?

56
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,962
What are you here for so early?

57
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,430
I've brought a client here.

58
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,567
To be precise, she's the go-between.

59
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,435
The client's go-between?

60
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,739
MIKI SHIRAYAMA
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL'S NURSE

61
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,876
Are you okay, Mr. Kurokawa?

62
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,512
Will you go to the hospital now?

63
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,415
I just digested it.

64
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,184
-So quick!
-So quick!

65
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,493
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,762
Do you know how it feels as a parent
to have your child's life

67
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,597
<i>taken in an instant?</i>

68
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,766
It is true that
I couldn't save the patient.

69
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,834
<i>I'll investigate thoroughly</i>
<i>and defend you.</i>

70
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,169
<i>Pull back from this point.</i>

71
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,971
<i>It won't do to say that you'll change it</i>
<i>sometime in the future.</i>

72
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,941
<i>Now, a problem has occurred,</i>
<i>you have to change it.</i>

73
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,975
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL
CAR PARK ENTRANCE

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,079
<i>The case happened on November 2, 2018.</i>

75
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>On that day, Aogashima Hospital's</i>
<i>pediatric cardiovascular surgeon,</i>

76
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:42,989
<i>Dr. Kazuhiko Unzen, performed</i>
<i>a mitral valve replacement surgery.</i>

77
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,890
-Suction!
-Yes.

78
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,592
Doctor, her BP is dropping!

79
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,293
-Raise the blood flow rate!
-Yes.

80
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,329
-Gauze.
-Yes.

81
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,230
-Doctor.
-What?

82
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,399
The CPB pump! The machine stopped!

83
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,135
<i>But during the surgery,</i>

84
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,472
<i>the heart-lung machine</i>
<i>stopped for a few minutes.</i>

85
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,275
<i>The patient remained unconscious.</i>

86
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,043
<i>Her condition became critical the next day</i>

87
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,311
<i>and she died of cardiac arrest.</i>

88
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,015
This case was an unfortunate accident.

89
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,685
An accident? You killed my daughter!

90
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,621
Why isn't Dr. Unzen here?

91
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,824
<i>The patient's parents didn't accept</i>
<i>what the hospital said</i>

92
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,692
<i>and the negotiation broke off.</i>

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,795
"The police arrested
the surgeon, Kazuhiko Unzen,

94
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,764
for professional negligence
resulting in death."

95
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,501
It isn't common that someone
gets arrested for a medical error.

96
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,137
The police thought he was uncooperative

97
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,040
and could've destroyed evidence.

98
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,945
The hospital didn't even want to
admit the mistake at first.

99
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,249
But I thought the press would make
a bigger fuss of such an incident,

100
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,717
like holding a press conference.

101
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,619
But the girl's parents didn't want that.

102
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,422
I went to meet them once,

103
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,124
but they said they didn't want money.

104
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,726
They only wanted to know
why their daughter died.

105
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,195
But the doctor who made the medical error

106
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,464
didn't explain anything and just ran away?

107
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,533
-It's just too horrible.
-That's not true.

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,669
Dr. Unzen isn't like that.

109
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:08,341
If he had really made a mistake,
he would've said it honestly.

110
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,744
I know because I've been working
with him for a long time.

111
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,316
Miss Shirayama,
could you and Dr. Unzen be…

112
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,118
It is unrequited.

113
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,489
I had told him my feelings once,
but he said we have a large age gap

114
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,727
and he isn't confident about having
a family because he's a workaholic.

115
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,364
In other words, he rejected you.

116
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,102
-Do you need to say it?
-Oh. Sorry.

117
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,470
Anyway,

118
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:42,175
she can't accept that the hospital
blames Dr. Unzen for the mistake,

119
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,712
so she sought my advice secretly
when I went there for an interview.

120
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,281
On the day the patient passed away, I saw

121
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,085
Dr. Unzen talking to
the medical intern, Dr. Akagi.

122
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,020
It was my fault. I made a mistake.

123
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,556
No, it wasn't your fault.

124
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,026
The medical intern made a mistake?

125
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,629
Dr. Akagi participated in the surgery too.

126
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,735
Dr. Unzen could've covered up
the mistake Dr. Akagi made.

127
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,104
But isn't this unnatural?

128
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,638
Hospitals usually protect

129
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,441
the experienced doctor
instead of the intern.

130
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,311
I thought it was strange too.

131
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,581
It seems that someone blew the whistle,

132
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,649
and that was what made
the police arrest Dr. Unzen.

133
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,184
Blow the whistle?

134
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,922
"The mistake made by the surgeon,
Unzen, was the cause of the result."

135
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,891
Someone called the police and said that.

136
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,792
THE CAUSE WAS GROSS NEGLIGENCE
ON THE PART OF THE SURGEON

137
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,728
Everything could be a false charge.

138
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,500
That's why we would like you
to meet Dr. Unzen himself once.

139
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,302
Will you, Kurokawa?

140
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,538
Please.

141
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,745
Okay, I'll interview him once.

142
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,113
KOKUBUNJI POLICE STATION

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,450
I heard that one of the hospital
staff members asked you to come.

144
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,451
Who was that?

145
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,721
Sorry, we have to keep
the information confidential.

146
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,926
But the person is very worried about you.

147
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,361
Could it be Bandai?

148
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,095
KAZUHIKO UNZEN
SURGEON, AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

149
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,229
The Deputy Head Surgeon.

150
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,398
<i>He's my classmate and he's successful.</i>

151
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,002
<i>He's friendly to me, even though</i>
<i>I'm just a workaholic.</i>

152
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:16,602
TERUNORI BANDAI, DEPUTY HEAD
SURGEON, AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

153
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,338
But if Bandai asked you,
you have to turn him down.

154
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,107
Why is that?

155
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,543
Because it might affect his position.

156
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,911
Moreover,

157
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,248
I don't think there is anything
a lawyer can defend in this case.

158
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,786
You mean you admit that a mistake
you made caused the patient's death?

159
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,223
It's a fact
that I couldn't save the patient.

160
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,693
I told the hospital and police

161
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,395
about everything that happened
in the surgery.

162
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,399
All the facts will be revealed
in the trial.

163
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,270
But there are cases
where all facts don't get revealed.

164
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:57,343
You didn't tell the patient's parents
anything yourself, right?

165
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,579
I requested to talk to them directly
many times,

166
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,913
but the hospital stopped me.

167
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,750
The parents only wanted to know
the real reason

168
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,253
why their daughter passed away.

169
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,625
Would you let us help you do so?

170
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,167
MINAMI
DO YOUR BEST

171
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,842
Sorry for visiting so suddenly. Today…

172
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,080
It's the result of the hospital's
internal investigation.

173
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,283
The mistake Unzen made

174
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,520
and why our daughter died
are written on it clearly.

175
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,390
Excuse me.

176
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,959
It was submitted to the police too.

177
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,732
It'll be over if Unzen admits
the charge and gets punished.

178
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,768
What do you want by poking
your noses into this after so long?

179
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,272
Do you do this for money?

180
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,444
Is that why you can defend
a murderer indifferently?

181
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,447
No, we…

182
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,619
Our daughter was only 13 years old.

183
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:22,528
We believed that Unzen
was a trustworthy, good doctor.

184
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,402
Do you know how it feels
as a parent to have

185
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,170
your child's life taken in an instant?

186
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,041
We don't.

187
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,076
Mr. Kurokawa.

188
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,845
Don't be ridiculous! What the heck?!

189
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,846
I'm sorry…

190
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,618
but we don't know if what is
written in the report is true.

191
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,688
That Dr. Unzen really made a mistake…

192
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,490
and took your daughter's life.

193
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,227
At least not yet.

194
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,268
Leave.

195
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,004
Leave here now!

196
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,307
Give me a break.

197
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,782
Hoshundo Law Office?

198
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,850
Yes.

199
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,253
We will defend Dr. Kazuhiko Unzen.

200
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,257
Unzen and I were classmates,
so I'm worried too.

201
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,961
This incident must have
driven him into a corner.

202
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,032
He said he hoped
the facts would be revealed.

203
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,302
He must hate me now.

204
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,238
I'm his boss, but I couldn't protect him.

205
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,506
I don't think he does.

206
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,242
We'd like to check something about

207
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,678
the hospital's
internal investigation report.

208
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,713
Okay. I'll show you the way.

209
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,083
-This is the heart-lung machine?
-Yes.

210
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,185
It was reported that during the surgery,

211
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,390
the pump that circulates blood
in the body stopped.

212
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,226
It says the wrong instruction given
by Dr. Unzen

213
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,827
was what caused the accident.

214
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,931
If the blood-flow volume
in the machine is suddenly raised,

215
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,068
it gets caught in the pump
and the machine might stop.

216
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,771
That happened after the pump was used

217
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,139
according to his instruction.

218
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,574
Who actually operated the pump?

219
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,077
There are
biomedical equipment technicians.

220
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,980
The experts handle the machines
used in surgeries.

221
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,849
It's possible the technician
made a mistake,

222
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,052
but the surgeon's instructions
are absolute.

223
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,591
We'd like to talk directly
to staff members other than Dr. Unzen

224
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,194
who were present at the surgery.

225
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,798
I'm sorry,
but would you do so another day?

226
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,299
We have many emergency cases.

227
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,468
May we at least talk to
the medical intern, Dr. Akagi?

228
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,271
Akagi is out for an academic meeting.

229
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,373
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

230
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,342
I don't know where
the washing machines are.

231
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,912
Turn left there
and you'll see the laundry room.

232
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:57,016
I see. Many things in this hospital
are so complicated.

233
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,517
I am sorry.

234
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,888
LAUNDRY ROOM

235
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,958
I heard that some lawyers are here
for Dr. Unzen's case.

236
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,561
The problem hasn't been solved?

237
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,098
Indeed, I can't imagine
Dr. Unzen making any mistake.

238
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,033
Exactly. There's trouble between them.

239
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,375
Is anything written in the internal
investigation report not true?

240
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,844
The whole report is a lie.

241
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,380
What is, in particular?

242
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,418
There was no biomedical engineering
technician present at the surgery.

243
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,754
Who operated the pump, then?

244
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,657
The medical intern, Akagi.

245
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,360
<i>He had to because we were short of staff.</i>

246
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,063
<i>Of course, I taught him the basics</i>
<i>of how to operate it.</i>

247
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,966
<i>Also, I didn't specify the value</i>
<i>of the blood flow rate he should raise.</i>

248
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,834
-Raise the blood flow rate!
-Yes.

249
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,271
It says here that

250
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,375
I suddenly raised the blood flow rate
to five liters per minute,

251
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,344
but I would never give such instruction!

252
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,946
That means the medical intern
made a mistake

253
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,282
and caused the pump to stop?

254
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,719
No. I checked
the operation record afterwards.

255
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,657
The heart-lung machine turned off
by itself, without warning.

256
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,893
Why do you operate it like that?
Out of my way!

257
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,094
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,162
-Its power is off!
-I'm sorry.

259
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,565
<i>The technician hurried there,</i>
<i>re-plugged in the pump and it was on,</i>

260
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,234
<i>but the patient had already…</i>

261
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,637
I reported this to my boss

262
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,106
and I said this during the questioning.

263
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:32,111
The problem is the hospital
submitted this report as evidence.

264
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,713
If a trial is held,

265
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,951
based on this, you'll be convicted
for making a medical error.

266
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,587
No doubt, the hospital wants to

267
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,824
settle the case
as your personal medical error.

268
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,594
In that case, not only did you
not save the patient

269
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,230
but even the truth of her death
won't be revealed.

270
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:56,202
But the hospital is covering it up
so comprehensively.

271
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,871
How can we reveal the truth now?

272
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,674
I don't know.

273
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,480
But for you and the patient's parents,

274
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,884
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

275
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,555
You said you'd defend him,
but this is quite tough.

276
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,391
The heart-lung machine's
operation record was altered

277
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,293
to match the investigation report.

278
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,196
This is what is difficult
about medical cases.

279
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,931
We're dealing with experts.

280
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:31,003
They have control over the evidence
and situation before we start.

281
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,308
If we can get the testimonies
of the nurses, anesthesiologist,

282
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,844
and the technician
who checked the trouble…

283
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,414
Impossible. They must've
taken preventive measures.

284
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,950
In that case,

285
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,320
we'll investigate why
the heart-lung machine stopped first.

286
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,422
It wasn't an operation error,

287
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,058
so let's check with the manufacturer
why the power was off.

288
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:53,959
No!

289
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,761
Mr. Noboribetsu?

290
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,931
-What shouldn't we do?
-Don't check with the manufacturer.

291
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,567
Kurokawa, Mr. Yufuin, come with me.

292
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,706
The heart-lung machines used by
Aogashima Hospital

293
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,176
are manufactured and sold by
Medicarement Corporation.

294
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,712
This is our important client.

295
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,982
They are angry and called this morning

296
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,219
to ask if our lawyers
are really involved in this case.

297
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:25,124
In other words, the hospital
can't let us investigate this,

298
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,492
so they put pressure on them.

299
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,227
Be careful about what you say.

300
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:33,465
I'm the one putting pressure on you!
Stop doing something uncalled for!

301
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,969
The suspect said
the heart-lung machine stopped suddenly.

302
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,338
If the patient died because
the machine malfunctioned--

303
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,173
The manufacturer will suffer a great loss

304
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,843
and we, Hoshundo, will as well
because we are their consultant.

305
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,946
I cannot let this happen!

306
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,150
It's my order as Head of Office.
Withdraw from the case.

307
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,054
I cannot.

308
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,021
What?

309
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,458
We haven't found out why this happened.

310
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,926
I have to fire you, then.

311
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,529
-Wait a minute, Mr. Beppu.
-I won't.

312
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,198
I can't keep a lawyer

313
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,435
who makes the law firm
he belongs to suffer a loss!

314
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,037
It's okay if he doesn't
inflict any loss, right?

315
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,439
What do you mean?

316
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:19,912
If the heart-lung machine is faulty,
the same problem will occur again.

317
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,914
If after we investigate,

318
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:27,553
we can prove that another reason
caused the pump to stop,

319
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,421
then it shouldn't be a problem.

320
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,690
What if after you investigate,
you find that

321
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,525
the pump stopped because it's faulty?

322
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,694
I'll submit it as evidence.

323
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,231
You…

324
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,069
Fine. Do whatever you want.

325
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,971
Mr. Beppu!

326
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,776
But before the trial,
I'll check all the evidence you submit.

327
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,079
If your conclusion will inflict
a loss to our office…

328
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,548
I've prepared myself for it.

329
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,658
Kurokawa, that was really--

330
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,926
I won't compromise.

331
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,129
I decided that when I became a lawyer.

332
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,866
But if they really fire you…

333
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,800
Fire him?

334
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,569
Mr. Kurokawa, they'll fire you?

335
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,538
They haven't made the decision.

336
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,173
It depends on how the defense goes.

337
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,975
It depends on this case?

338
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,743
Anyway, we have to start
our investigation.

339
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,013
Wait, Miss Arima just called.

340
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,284
She said Dr. Unzen will be prosecuted.

341
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,453
I knew it.

342
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,288
It finally comes to this.

343
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,790
We have to hurry, then.

344
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,760
<i>It's what the report says.</i>

345
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,029
After Dr. Unzen gave the instruction,

346
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,198
the heart-lung machine stopped.

347
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,100
You read the report, right?

348
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,136
I've talked to the superior doctors
and the police many times.

349
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,472
There is nothing I can tell you.

350
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,708
I'm just a medical intern
and I didn't do anything important.

351
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,545
But that's not what Dr. Unzen said.

352
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,149
Sorry, I have to work.

353
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,985
-Wait a minute--
-I'm sorry.

354
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,122
This incident has made
all our staff nervous.

355
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:11,924
Please.

356
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,699
As we thought,
they all told the same story.

357
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,570
Well, the Deputy Head Surgeon,
Bandai, was present too.

358
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,907
How can you two be so calm?
We haven't found any clue at all!

359
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,377
What's the matter, Miss Wakura?
Why did you get worked up suddenly?

360
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,881
We'll surely lose at this rate!

361
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,550
It might get you fired, Mr. Kurokawa!

362
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,687
It won't affect whether
I get fired or not.

363
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,690
Will we just go to the medical
equipment manufacturer now, then?

364
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,959
They might refuse to see us, though.

365
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,928
We will force our way in, of course!

366
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,530
Just calm down a bit.

367
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,499
-We will go there.
-No, we shouldn't.

368
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,634
-Why?
-The nurse, Shirayama, is calling.

369
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,505
Hello. Kinosaki speaking.

370
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,039
We've just left the hospital…

371
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,512
-What? He'll testify at trial?
-What?

372
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,517
So, the hospital investigation report
isn't true. Am I right?

373
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,587
Yes. There was no technician present

374
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,924
and Dr. Unzen didn't specify any value.

375
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,894
But why would you tell the truth?

376
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,795
Miss Shirayama convinced me.

377
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,233
When I thought that a mistake I made
caused the patient's death,

378
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,102
I get very scared…

379
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,838
but making Dr. Unzen take the blame…

380
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,541
But if you stand as a witness,

381
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,912
it will make your situation
at the hospital worse.

382
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,081
Miss Shirayama, you too,
for persuading him to testify.

383
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,485
Both Dr. Akagi and I will go to work
at another hospital.

384
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,889
If I keep quiet,
the same thing might happen again,

385
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,226
so I'll say everything at the trial.

386
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,095
Thank you.

387
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,598
Are you sure?

388
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,800
Okay. Goodbye.

389
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,937
Bandai.

390
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,540
About Unzen's trial.

391
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,044
COURTHOUSE

392
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,447
-Found him?
-No, he didn't answer my call.

393
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,549
Okay. Goodbye.

394
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,552
I asked the hospital.
They said Dr. Akagi wasn't there.

395
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,254
But the trial will start soon.

396
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,289
Hello, Mr. Kurokawa.

397
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,325
Hello.

398
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,628
It's the first time we compete
in a medical case.

399
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,432
And one that involves death too.

400
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,936
You'd better not think you can win easily.

401
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,973
The judge is pretty strict.

402
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,877
After all, he has not found anyone
innocent in these few years.

403
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,383
I'll go to the hospital now.

404
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,685
You won't make it in time. I'm sure.

405
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,365
Please stand.

406
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,338
ROKURO HIRUGAMI, CHIEF JUDGE

407
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,244
Hello, Dr. Akagi?

408
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,580
It's Kinosaki from Hoshundo Law Office.

409
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,415
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>
-What?

410
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,884
I cannot give my testimony.

411
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>You cannot? Why?</i>

412
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,458
Forget everything about this case.

413
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:40,098
Let's start the examination
of the defense's witness.

414
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,867
Witness, please come forward.

415
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,171
Where is the witness?

416
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,507
Your Highness, he'll be here soon.

417
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,686
I am very sorry.

418
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,990
We can't get hold of the witness
who is supposed to testify today.

419
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,327
Please let us cancel the examination.

420
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,429
Well, this often happens,

421
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,599
but be careful not to impede
the progress of the trial.

422
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,068
Yes, Your Honor.

423
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,872
What happened to Dr. Akagi?
Why did he suddenly say no?

424
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,342
The hospital probably found out.

425
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,145
Well, that must be tough.

426
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,647
Mr. Hirugami.

427
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,185
Mr. Kurokawa,
I've heard a lot about your work.

428
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,421
You're still young.

429
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,757
How commendable of you to aim to wipe out

430
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,225
false charges in criminal cases.

431
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,394
Thank you.

432
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,597
A 13-year-old girl died in this incident.

433
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:50,135
It must be tough for you to defend
the suspect of this tragic case.

434
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,204
Do try your best.

435
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,611
He has already reached a conclusion.

436
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,151
Shirayama was the one
who requested you to defend me?

437
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,422
She convinced Dr. Akagi
to give his testimony as well.

438
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,091
I had no idea that this would happen.

439
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,326
He must've been told

440
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,661
that he could not be a doctor
if he stood as a witness.

441
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,264
It isn't Akagi's fault.

442
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,201
I caused Shirayama trouble too.

443
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,538
Dr. Unzen, regarding this case--

444
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,907
I knew when I read
the investigation report.

445
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,279
Bandai was ordered to cover
the truth of the incident.

446
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,384
Nobody besides him could manipulate
the report as perfectly as that.

447
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,952
But you were friends--

448
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,421
He's climbing the career ladder.

449
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,727
I work as a surgeon.
Our situations are different.

450
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,097
Actually…

451
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,401
I would like to ask you two for a favor.

452
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,973
Unzen realized that too?

453
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,081
As you said, I manipulated
everything to cover the fact.

454
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,818
Did you do it to protect the hospital?

455
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,454
No, I did it to change this hospital.

456
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:22,427
Aogashima Hospital is the only
general hospital in this region.

457
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,964
It has many patients
and many problems too.

458
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,633
So, I decided

459
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,403
to climb the career ladder
and change it someday.

460
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,408
Then you shouldn't make Dr. Unzen
the scapegoat and end it like this!

461
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,443
I agreed to cover it up

462
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,113
because my superior promised
to give me a budget

463
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,782
for new employees and equipment.

464
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,652
Even if I have to sacrifice my classmate,

465
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:52,891
I think it was the best decision
to make to achieve my goal.

466
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,096
I think it's going to rain.

467
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,532
May I go now?

468
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,001
I have to go back to work.

469
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,204
Excuse me.

470
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,573
It's for you.

471
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,175
What is it?

472
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,846
It's the password of Dr. Unzen's
personal laptop on his desk.

473
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,315
He thinks it will help you.

474
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,452
The staff the hospital needs,

475
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,155
new equipment that you should buy,
how to take care of patients.

476
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,359
He wrote down what he realized
should be improved.

477
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,027
Why are you giving this to me?

478
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,296
When you were young,

479
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,334
you used to talk to each other about
improving the hospital's old system.

480
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,336
That's his reason.

481
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,008
Lastly, he would like us
to pass on his message to you.

482
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,711
Promise him you will become the leader

483
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,315
and carry out a reform of the hospital.

484
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,426
What should we do now?

485
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,996
We can't get Akagi's testimony.

486
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,599
The reason of the heart-lung
machine's problem remains a mystery.

487
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,466
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

488
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,769
You are really going to be fired.

489
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:15,006
Well, I think you got the wrong idea.

490
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,143
I'll be fired if I inflict a loss
on the office.

491
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,045
It's the office's loss if you lose too.

492
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,147
I mean, to Mr. Beppu,

493
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,983
hiring you alone
had inflicted a loss on the office.

494
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,788
Even my feelings are hurt
if you say it so bluntly.

495
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,656
But…

496
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,592
What is it?

497
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,195
Miss Wakura, are you worried about me?

498
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,233
-Just drop it. Let's hurry.
-Okay…

499
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,169
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

500
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,838
-This… Yes…
-Laundry… The laundry room?

501
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,008
It's on another floor.
You have to go to the first floor.

502
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,309
Where on the first floor?

503
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,713
I think after you exit the lift,
turn right, and…

504
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,416
-I'll take you there.
-Okay.

505
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,286
LAUNDRY ROOM

506
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,688
-Over here.
-Thank you. How kind of you.

507
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,825
-Don't worry about it. There you go.
-Thank you.

508
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,494
But all the machines are in use.

509
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,031
It's always busy at this time of the day.

510
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,767
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

511
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,373
What? Oh no! I've run out of detergent!

512
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,341
Laundry detergent?

513
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:24,743
There you go.

514
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,812
Wow! Thanks for your help, young man.

515
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,280
Why has he got that too?

516
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,485
Anyway, this hospital is so stingy.

517
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,387
The washing machine over there

518
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,456
has been broken
since I started staying here.

519
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,959
Our room's television
suddenly stopped functioning

520
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,960
the other day too.

521
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,195
That was three months ago, right?

522
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,565
It was fixed after I told a nurse
and it was re-plugged.

523
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,336
<i>The heart-lung machine turned off</i>
<i>suddenly without warning.</i>

524
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,239
Many things in this hospital
are so complicated.

525
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:58,977
Excuse me.

526
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,079
When did that happen?

527
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,447
What do you mean?

528
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,548
The television was broken,

529
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,417
but it was fixed
after you re-plugged it in, right?

530
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,919
Please tell me the date that it happened.

531
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,289
It was the day I was admitted,
so it was November 2.

532
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,291
November 2?

533
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,993
-That's--
-What time was it?

534
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,396
I went to my room at 11 a.m.

535
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,300
It was right before supper time,
so I think it was around 4 p.m.

536
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,336
Oh, it was raining like this
at that time too.

537
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,404
Thank you, ma'am!

538
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,174
Mr. Kurokawa?

539
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,875
Thank you, ma'am.

540
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,713
Mr. Kurokawa!

541
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,127
Just as I thought!

542
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,162
Mr. Kurokawa!

543
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,099
That's right. Sorry.

544
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,470
There you go.

545
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,506
Not this! Tell me what's going on!

546
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,744
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL - OPERATING THEATER

547
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,247
This experiment's scale is large too.

548
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,149
Isn't it always?

549
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,318
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

550
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,189
Here you go.

551
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,793
So, what did you find?

552
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,730
I checked the area
within a one-kilometer radius,

553
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,198
and it's what you expected.

554
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,734
Many residents there are elderly people.

555
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,770
Thank goodness they were helpful.

556
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,906
It's convenient to have someone
who works at a TV station.

557
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,208
They don't hesitate
to go to people's homes uninvited.

558
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,577
Do you have to be so sarcastic
about everything?

559
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,781
Would you like to see the equipment
before we do the experiment?

560
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,048
Is it okay, Mr. Akiu?

561
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,852
Don't let her touch anything.

562
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,157
-This way, please.
-Come on.

563
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,529
You want to ask something?

564
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:58,897
RADIO TOWER

565
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,766
I was told the other day that you were

566
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,903
Mr. Kurokawa's senior when he did
science and engineering here.

567
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,870
So?

568
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,505
Well…

569
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,509
I just thought there must be
another reason why Mr. Kurokawa

570
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:16,047
insists on doing experiments
for evidence and you helping him.

571
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,082
-Really…
-Over here. Over here.

572
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,785
He is an idiot.

573
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,021
Well, I won't deny it.

574
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:27,125
Kurokawa is cut out to be
a scientist, not a lawyer.

575
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,461
So he sticks to something unnecessarily
and worries over it.

576
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,030
What do you mean?

577
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,300
Someone died in this accident, right?

578
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,035
Well, yeah.

579
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:41,906
If the facts are revealed
after a scientific experiment…

580
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,376
will it make you happy?

581
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,681
I don't think I will be happy,

582
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,617
but it can prevent someone innocent
from being falsely charged.

583
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,520
-A scientist would be happy.
-Yes?

584
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,622
The experiment is done and it's over.

585
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,124
But that's not how a trial goes.

586
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,728
Even if you've done an experiment
to prove someone's innocence,

587
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,064
the dead can't be brought back to life.

588
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,167
The family they left behind
won't be delighted either.

589
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,404
Let's start the experiment.

590
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,606
-Stand back.
-Okay.

591
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,643
Don't touch the things!

592
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,826
RADIO TOWER

EVIDENCE REPORT

594
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,735
What you were worried about
won't happen in this case.

595
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,771
So, about Mr. Kurokawa's job here--

596
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:52,176
Well, I don't care whether
he can settle the case or not,

597
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,646
but can he win the trial with this?

598
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,547
We will see.

599

COURTHOUSE

600
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,886
Please have a look at the photo
of defense evidence number 52.

601
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,054
EXAMINATION OF DEFENSE'S EVIDENCE

602
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,691
This is a washing machine
in the laundry room at Aogashima Hospital

603
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,092
where the accident happened.

604
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,362
A witness told us that
on November 2 at around 4 p.m.,

605
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,232
that is, the same day
as the surgery was performed,

606
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,401
the machine was broken.

607
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,970
Next, please have a look at
defense evidence number 53,

608
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,139
a list of electrical devices.

609
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,641
They are the electrical devices
used in Aogashima Hospital

610
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,745
that were broken
on the same day at the same time.

611
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,083
Some of them were fixed
after they were re-plugged…

612
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:39,290
Why did this phenomenon occur
at the same time?

613
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,494
We have special permission
to play and use this as evidence.

614
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,664
Please watch defense evidence number 54,
the video of an experiment.

615
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,335
<i>The phenomenon that caused</i>
<i>the accident to happen</i>

616
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,303
<i>was what we call</i>
<i>back-flow lightning surge.</i>

617
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,471
RADIO TOWER - REVERSE LIGHTING

618
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,574
<i>When lightning strikes a tall building,</i>

619
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,510
<i>the electric potential</i>
<i>on the ground rises rapidly.</i>

620
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,445
INCREASE IN ELECTRICAL PRESSURE

621
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,713
<i>Current flows from</i>

622
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,783
higher electric potential
to lower electric potential,

623
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,586
so it flows through the earth wire
and back to the power cable.

624
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,754
EARTH

625
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,189
<i>As a result,</i>

626
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,925
<i>it causes a malfunction</i>
<i>in electrical devices in the building</i>

627
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,860
<i>that are connected to the power cable.</i>

628
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,028
HOSPITAL

629
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:21,232
Usually, in a hospital, to prevent
it from being struck by lightning,

630
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,601
there is a device called
a lightning arrester.

631
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,771
But the one at Aogashima Hospital
was not functioning,

632
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,540
so the lightning affected

633
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,710
the electrical system
at various places in the hospital…

634
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,545
LIGHTNING ARRESTER - OPERATING THEATER

635
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,514
RADIO TOWER

636
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,282
…and caused a power cut
in parts of the building.

637
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,917
As a result,

638
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,688
it caused the heart-lung machine
at the operating theater to stop.

639
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
In the statement given by the accused…

640
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,663
it stated that the machine
worked again after re-plugging.

641
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,799
It shows that the machine wasn't faulty

642
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,001
and it was the problem
of the electrical system.

643
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,303
<i>That's all for the experiment.</i>

644
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,906
As you have just seen,

645
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:06,310
the cause of this accident
was the lightning that struck

646
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,847
the radio tower one kilometer
to the southwest of the hospital

647
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,082
on the November 2 at 4:02 p.m.

648
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,519
This is how areas
within a one-kilometer radius

649
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,187
were affected by the lightning
at the same time.

650
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,889
We confirmed that many buildings

651
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,058
and houses were affected in the same way.

652
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,225
Your Honor,

653
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,595
both the video
and the defense lawyer's explanation

654
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:30,134
can't prove that the hospital
is negligent in dealing with lightning.

655
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,102
Defense lawyer,

656
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:36,007
can you prove that the hospital's
lightning arrester is defective?

657
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,943
Please have a look at
defense evidence number 55.

658
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,713
This is the document from
Komori Maintenance, the company

659
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,582
that manages
the hospital's electric devices.

660
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,118
The lightning arrester
in Aogashima Hospital

661
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,188
failed to function due to
a lightning strike in the past.

662
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,757
The company advised them to change it,

663
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,992
but they ignored that
because of the high cost

664
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,661
and did nothing about it.

665
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,698
The hospital's management system
caused the accident to happen.

666
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,533
To cover the fact,

667
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,503
they made the surgeon there
take full responsibility.

668
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:10,241
The deceased's parents
wanted to know the truth,

669
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,176
but the hospital
trampled on their feelings.

670
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,884
My client couldn't save the patient
and he feels responsible for it.

671
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,322
This time, the hospital's problem
became obvious,

672
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,991
and if this will improve the situation,

673
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,527
my client says he won't mind
the outcome of the trial.

674
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,366
But if my client has to take
the responsibility alone,

675
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:40,104
the day the hospital will improve
the situation will never come.

676
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:48,579
It won't do to say that you'll change it
sometime in the future.

677
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,417
Now, a problem has occurred,
you have to change it.

678
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,998
For the above reasons,
as the defense lawyer,

679
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,435
I insist that my client,
Kazuhiko Unzen, is innocent.

680
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,545
<i>There aren't enough doctors.</i>

681
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,815
<i>By cutting entertainment expenses</i>
<i>and the directors' remuneration,</i>

682
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,984
<i>shortage of staff can be improved</i>

683
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,986
<i>without lowering the quality of personnel.</i>

684
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,755
<i>Paperwork for doctors is too much</i>

685
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,124
<i>and consultation time is shortened.</i>

686
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,659
<i>Improve work environment.</i>

687
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,127
<i>Set clear guidelines</i>

688
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,864
<i>for the work environment of doctors,</i>
<i>nurses, and hospital staff</i>

689
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,834
<i>to avoid irregular shifts</i>
<i>that make them work long hours.</i>

690
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,973
NIGHT ENTRANCE

691
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,646
PRONOUNCEMENT OF JUDGMENT

692
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,949
I shall deliver the verdict.

693
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,318
Text.

694
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,353
The accused…

695
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,923
is sentenced to one year in prison.

696
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,461
-The sentence is suspended
-No way!

697
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,397
from the date of the final court decision
to three years after.

698
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,501
The following
is the reason for the verdict.

699
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,036
The defense lawyer claims that

700
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:22,273
the hospital's lightning arrester
was defective

701
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,042
and the electrical system was cut off,

702
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,846
causing the heart-lung machine
to stop working,

703
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,450
which caused the victim's death.

704
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,789
However, the claim is conjectural.

705
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,625
It cannot be proven that

706
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:45,196
the deficiency of the lightning arrester
caused the victim's death.

707
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,702
That's all.

708
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,240
Accused, if you disagree with the verdict,

709
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,809
you may make an appeal.

710
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,380
I won't make an appeal.

711
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,118
It is true that
I couldn't save the patient.

712
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,589
As the lawyer said…

713
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,625
no matter what the verdict is,

714
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,328
I believe that the accident

715
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,700
will teach the hospital a lesson
and they will make a change.

716
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:36,814
The chief judge didn't watch
the experiment properly, did he?

717
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,084
There's nothing we can do.
He has delivered the verdict.

718
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,955
Mr. Kurokawa.

719
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,223
Mr. Kurokawa.

720
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,930
In the end,
what caused our daughter's death?

721
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,370
Is it Dr. Unzen's fault?

722
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,872
Is it the hospital's fault?

723
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,111
Who should we hate?

724
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,482
Answer me! Please!

725
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,684
Answer me!

726
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,656
Let's go.

727
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,764
Didn't I tell you

728
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:31,335
not to think that you could win
a case that involves death easily?

729
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,239
What you did was uncalled for.

730
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,242
You shifted the target
of the parents' anger

731
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,745
and only made them sad again.

732
00:39:55,926 --> 00:40:02,433
Everyone, Dr. Unzen was found guilty.

733
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:09,273
We have caused you a lot of trouble
in this case.

734
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,542
Also…

735
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,979
I think many of you have doubts

736
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,015
and are worried about
the hospital's future.

737
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,953
But we will not repeat the same mistake.

738
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,256
I'll change it,
so that it won't happen again.

739
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,758
Not just someday.

740
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,294
We'll start now.

741
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,800
When I was young…

742
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,137
I found a mistake made by a senior
and reported it to my superior.

743
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,273
He told me that if
I wanted to be a doctor…

744
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,775
I had to turn a blind eye to it.

745
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,478
At that time,

746
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,815
it didn't occur to me that I'd say
the same thing in the future.

747
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,422
I am very sorry.

748
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,364
SURGEON FOUND GUILTY

749
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,435
Some media have taken an interest
in Unzen's trial

750
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,172
and some people are starting
to blame the hospital.

751
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,340
It's annoying.

752
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
Is that so?

753
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,846
Well, Unzen has been found guilty.

754
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,082
If we just deny all knowledge of it,

755
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,685
the matter will be settled soon.

756
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,987
We cannot let you do that.

757
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,092
Because you have to handle
more annoying things in the future.

758
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,060
What do you mean?

759
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,697
Besides looking into
the hospital's problems,

760
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,799
Unzen also collected some information.

761
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,734
For example,

762
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,704
the bribe you accepted from…

763
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,474
pharmaceutical companies
and the affiliated companies.

764

PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVEMENTS
AT AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

765
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,412
Hey. Why did you do this out of the blue?

766
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,848
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

767
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,917
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

768
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,152
What are you doing here?

769
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,988
PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVEMENTS
AT AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL

770
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,123
To change the hospital,

771
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,792
it's time to squeeze the pus out.

772
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,629
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

773
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,932
You'll go to a medically underserved area?

774
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,469
Yes, a friend wants me to go there.

775
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,971
I can't treat any patient for a while,

776
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,673
but I'll help the locals there for now.

777
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,642
Glad to hear that.

778
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,245
We weren't capable enough
and lost the case,

779
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,914
but you've found a new job.

780
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,883
It suits me more than
a cold, major hospital.

781
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,185
Miss Shirayama, will you go with him?

782
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,789
Yeah, I'll follow him there,
even if he says no.

783
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,492
You're a couple with a huge age gap.

784
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,395
Why not? It's passionate!

785
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,730
By the way,

786
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,768
I would like to say thank you
to Mr. Kurokawa too.

787
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,004
I am sorry, but today, Kurokawa…

788
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,707
Yes?

789
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,679
Mr. Kurokawa,

790
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,149
Dr. Unzen and Miss Shirayama have left.

791
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,352
They would like to thank you too.

792
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,654
FAULTY

00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,689
I see.

794
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,160
I think you should've at least shown up.

795
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,462
I'm too ashamed to see them.

796
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,568
Dr. Akiu helped me,
so I have to say sorry.

797
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,473
Should I go there for you?

798
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,079
Sorry.

799
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,384
TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

800
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,225
AOGASHIMA HOSPITAL'S DOCTOR
SENTENCED TO ONE YEAR IN PRISON

801
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,026
LIGHTNING, LIGHTNING FLOW, EARTHING

802
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,261
How is Kurokawa?

803
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,465
He is obviously feeling down.

804
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,901
He's been reading the case's
judicial record again and again.

805
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,104
Lawyers sometimes lose a case too.

806
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,006
It's stupid to worry about it every time.

807
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,309
Whatever. There's nothing more
to talk about. Just leave.

808
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:12,349
Did something happen
when Mr. Kurokawa was a student?

809
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,550
Why do you think so?

810
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:17,154
He did science at first but changed
to study law to become a lawyer.

811
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,756
People don't usually do that.

812
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,691
So, there must be a reason.

813
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,995
I think I'd better know the reason

814
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,498
why Mr. Kurokawa went so far
to be a lawyer.

815
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,500
I have to help him in the future too.

816
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,202
Do you know about his father?

817
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:33,971
Yes.

818
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,940
<i>He's the Supreme Public Prosecutors</i>
<i>Office's Deputy Prosecutor-General.</i>

819
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,144
If you know, start from checking him out.

820
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,514
Dr. Akiu, you don't know the reason?

821
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,450
I do, but I don't want to talk.

822
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:47,985
Why?

823
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,854
Because it's troublesome.

824
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,001
LEGAL PAPERS

825
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,103
More…

826
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,644
If I had found a more indisputable proof…

827
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,558
SHIN KUROKAWA

828
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,999
THIS DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

829
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,569
Kurokawa finally confronts
his father, a prosecutor.

830
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,238
Criminals lie and hide the facts.

831
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,774
<i>A murder of a female office worker</i>
<i>happened on a beach.</i>

832
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,576
<i>The darkness of the murderer's heart</i>
<i>is revealed.</i>

833
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,344
<i>I just hate her so much!</i>

834
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:51,014
Even if you hate her a lot,
you might not have actually killed her.

835
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,051
<i>I'll investigate thoroughly</i>
<i>and defend you.</i>

836
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,219
Someone related?

837
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:59,356
Our positions are different,
but we share an unpleasant event.

838
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,359
I was the victim of a malicious stalker.

839
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,963
<i>I insist that my client,</i>
<i>Nami Ogasawara, is innocent.</i>
