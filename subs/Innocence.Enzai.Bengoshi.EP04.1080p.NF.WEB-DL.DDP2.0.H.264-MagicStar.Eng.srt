1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,705
-Is it really okay?
-Of course.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,841
But won't it trouble you?

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,210
This is no trouble at all!

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,348
I'm going to save you!

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,820
Look! Isn't it nice? It's called Wasamyo.

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:21,821
Wasamyo?

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,257
A combination of wasabi
and myoga ginger. Wasamyo.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,092
It comes with a pack
of instant fried noodles.

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,794
There are 38 variations,

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,796
so it's really hard to collect them all.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:31,531
Would you like a pack, Miss Arima?

12
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,799
You would, right?

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,200
THE WEIRD WASAMYO FIGURES
38 IN TOTAL

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,436
You'd better not. It tastes super awful.

15
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,639
The wasabi myoga ginger mayonnaise
is especially gross.

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,410
It's offensive
to call it instant fried noodles.

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,146
It's another number four.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,848
I heard that he felt down
after he lost the other day,

19
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,383
so I came to check on him.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,087
He is actually more excited
than usual these few days.

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,058
CERTAIN VICTORY

22
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,325
Okay!

23
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,130
What are you doing, Noboribetsu?

24
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,299
Why are you wearing
the "victory" headband?

25
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,270
Marron Circle Company Limited?

26
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,839
It's involved in
a criminal case lately, right?

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,740
Case?

28
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,175
-Kurokawa!
-Yes?

29
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,144
I'll give you a job.
Defense of a murder case!

30
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,514
-These are the documents.
-Oh. Thanks.

31
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,351
-Hey!
-I'm sorry!

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,288
This is new.

33
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,125
You've brought him a defense job
for a criminal case, Mr. Beppu?

34
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,760
It's against my will too.

35
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:38,631
Noboribetsu's been doing it himself
secretly, without my permission.

36
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,067
Mr. Noboribetsu does criminal defense?

37
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,169
There's a good reason--

38
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,804
I don't care about your reason.

39
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,341
You usually only do corporate law cases,
so obviously, you'll lose.

40
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,844
But we don't know
if we can win or not either.

41
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,613
The press is interested in this case too.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,014
Do it properly, Kurokawa.

43
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,485
Noboribetsu, your fee will be cut
as a penalty.

44
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,787
Also, depending on the result
of the trial,

45
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,389
you could be transferred to
the criminal division as punishment,

46
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,557
so be prepared for it!

47
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,361
No, Mr. Beppu! Wait a minute, Mr. Beppu!

48
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,463
Being transferred to
the criminal division is a punishment?

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,000
"The Amane Island
female employee murder case."

50
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,668
Yes! That's the case.

51
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,172
An employee of the company
that makes this toy was murdered.

52
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,976
Her colleague was arrested,
but she denies the charge completely.

53
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,878
She denies it completely?

54
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,147
That will make things pretty difficult.

55
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,816
A murder.

56
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,092
<i>How could I kill her?</i>

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
It's not possible.

58
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,795
<i>I'll investigate thoroughly</i>

59
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,696
and defend you.

60
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,166
Criminals lie and hide facts.

61
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,668
<i>I just hate her to the bone.</i>

62
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,103
<i>No matter how much you hated her,</i>

63
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,972
we still don't know
if you really killed her or not.

64
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,477
<i>The incident happened on October 21, 2018.</i>

65
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,647
<i>Eighty-two kilometers away from</i>
<i>Tokyo Bay's coast, on Amane Island,</i>

66
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,950
<i>a drowned female tourist's body</i>
<i>was found on the coast.</i>

67
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,118
<i>The deceased was</i>

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,388
<i>Marron Circle Company Limited's</i>
<i>contracted designer,</i>

69
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>31-year-old Risa Himeshima.</i>

70
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,293
<i>Right before Himeshima went missing,</i>

71
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,695
<i>she was with her friend, Nami Ogasawara,</i>

72
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,931
<i>who traveled together with her.</i>

73
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,667
We went snorkeling in the sea together,

74
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,937
then I couldn't find her halfway through.

75
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,839
I had no idea that she had an accident.

76
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,641
<i>In the autopsy,</i>

77
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,579
<i>sea water and a large amount of sand</i>
<i>were found in her lungs.</i>

78
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,648
<i>The condition was clearly different</i>
<i>from usual drowned bodies,</i>

79
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,084
<i>so Ogasawara was arrested for murder.</i>

80
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,187
What was the relationship
between you and Ms. Himeshima?

81
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,057
She was my junior at my company.

82
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,726
We were close friends too.

83
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,728
The statement states that

84
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,364
Ms. Himeshima was a contracted designer.

85
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,901
She planned to quit when
she got married three years ago,

86
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,404
but the company stopped her,
so she worked from home.

87
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,843
After all, she had designed
many popular pieces of merchandise.

88
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,948
<i>Risa was blessed</i>
<i>with talent and friendship.</i>

89
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,251
<i>All our colleagues loved her.</i>

90
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,455
I thought of her as my younger sister too.

91
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,860
How could I kill her?

92
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,762
It's totally impossible.

93
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,598
Definitely.

94
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,167
We don't know yet.

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,103
Pardon?

96
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,273
Even if you feel affection for someone,

97
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,943
it doesn't necessarily mean
that you wouldn't kill them.

98
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,978
Do you suspect me?

99
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,547
That's not what he means, he just…

100
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,585
Miss Ogasawara.
Please let me ask two questions.

101
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,287
Okay.

102
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,888
First.

103
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,091
Are you hiding anything?

104
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,997
It's a murder case and we have to win
by proving your innocence.

105
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,769
Will you tell us everything
without hiding anything from us?

106
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,938
I am not hiding anything.

107
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,373
I see.

108
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,243
Second question.

109
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,847
Did you really not kill the victim?

110
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,985
I did not kill her.

111
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,257
All right, then.

112
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,528
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

113
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,398
I'm counting on you.

114
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,908
By the way, why did you ask
Noboribetsu to defend you?

115
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,647
Mr. Noboribetsu offered to defend me
when he learnt about the case.

116
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,951
He said I could count on him
to prove my innocence.

117
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,354
Did you know each other before this?

118
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,724
Yes, we met half a year ago.

119
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,029
-Matchmaking party?
-Yes.

120
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,998
One that was held
by the dating club I registered at.

121
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,534
We got along the first time we met

122
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,572
and we've already gone
on about four dates.

123
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,473
Have a look at this!

124
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,677
Even so, you shouldn't have said
something irresponsible,

125
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,748
like you'd definitely prove her innocence.

126
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,684
She isn't someone
who would commit a crime.

127
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,886
I'm confident
in my ability to judge a person.

128
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,621
That's not the point.

129
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,090
You offered to defend her to impress her,

130
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,492
but we have to do the job.

131
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,027
It isn't my fault! Mr. Beppu found out!

132
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,898
Anyway, our happiness
is in your hands, Kurokawa!

133
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,401
Miss Arima, about
Miss Ogasawara's information…

134
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,970
I gathered it right away.

135
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,239
Nami Ogasawara, 36 years old.

136
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,673
After she finished college,

137
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,209
she joined Marron Circle Company Limited

138
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,078
and worked at the Product Planning
and Development Division.

139
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,515
She has a 70-year-old mother
who needs to be cared for.

140
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,750
She lived with Ogasawara
before the incident,

141
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,519
but she stays with a relative now.

142
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,021
Her dad died two years ago and she'd been

143
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,056
caring for him for a few years too.

144
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,292
She's a serious person.

145
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,097
Everyone who knows her
can't believe that she killed someone.

146
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,465
You see?

147
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,801
I was right about her!

148
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,104
Kurokawa, do everything you can
to prove her innocence!

149
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,607
Anyway, I'll read the documents
thoroughly again tonight.

150
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,079
Mr. Kurokawa isn't like his usual self.

151
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:31,517
He just lost a case to prove
someone's innocence,

152
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,520
of course, he'd be nervous.

153
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,990
I've talked about Himeshima

154
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,893
and Ogasawara many times
to the police and the prosecutor.

155
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,897
We're wondering if you remember
or notice anything new.

156
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,933
I would've called the police if I had.

157
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:47,867
KEISUKE TSURUMI

158
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,436
I'm too busy to sleep because of the case.

159
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,005
We'll finish as quickly as we can.

160
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,641
Talk to our division's colleagues
if you want to.

161
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,610
I'm the only man in the team.

162
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,180
The two of them got along.

163
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:06,152
Miss Ogasawara was the one
who helped Risa become a designer.

164
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,753
Miss Ogasawara helped her?

165
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,357
Miss Ogasawara wanted to be
a designer too,

166
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,726
but she realized that Risa was gifted,

167
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,861
so she recommended Risa.

168
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:19,432
To Miss Ogasawara and Risa,
this is a token.

169
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,900
Kurimaru?

170
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,869
It's the first character Risa designed

171
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,904
under Miss Ogasawara's guidance.

172
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,373
It was rejected right before production

173
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,142
and wasn't commercialized in the end.

174
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,945
Risa felt down because of this,

175
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,482
so Miss Ogasawara used the design
to make pendants as a memento.

176
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,253
She made only three for themselves
and for the company's record.

177
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,023
We didn't gain any useful information.

178
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,994
We only confirmed again that
Miss Ogasawara is really nice.

179
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,099
Yeah, but frankly, she is so nice
that I find it fishy.

180
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,467
Why do you find it fishy?

181
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,538
She's a nice senior at work,
she looks after her parents.

182
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,041
On top of that, her junior became
a designer, which was her goal,

183
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,876
and even got married before her.

184
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,512
If I were her,
I'd get so stressed out, I'd explode!

185
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,949
I'm sure you would explode before that.

186
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,620
Mr. Kurokawa, where are you going?

187
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,189
-The scene of the crime.
-What? To Amane Island now?

188
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,492
Yeah, it takes two hours by fast ferry.

189
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,861
But it'll be dark when you come back.

190
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,629
You might have to spend a night there.

191
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,232
-You can't go too, right?
-I can't.

192
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,701
I have to pick up my son
from nursery school.

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,603
It's okay. I'll go alone.

194
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,104
But going there on your own…

195
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,275
I can't go, but how about you,
Miss Wakura?

196
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,085
This is where the two ladies
came for snorkeling.

197
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,322
Yeah, the police thinks that
this is where Himeshima was killed.

198
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,125
Her body was found on the beach
a bit further away, though.

199
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,001
The suspect pressed the victim's face
into shallow water

200
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,269
and drowned her.

201
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,574
The theory is based on
the large amount of sand in her lungs.

202
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:13,179
I can't imagine Miss Ogasawara
doing that at all.

203
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,484
Mr. Kurokawa?

204
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,389
Wait!

205
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,129
What?

206
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,750
Mr. Kurokawa, stop it!

207
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,219
What are you thinking?
It's the sea in mid-winter!

208
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,121
-Miss Wakura…
-What?

209
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,392
-I brought a change of clothes.
-What?

210
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,997
Gosh! This is horrible!

211
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:09,869
It's good!

212
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,472
Thanks for waiting.

213
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,679
That's great.
You could change your clothes.

214
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,848
The only haberdasher on the island
got it sent here.

215
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,084
I didn't expect to spend money on this.

216
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,487
Would you like some
golden eye snapper? It's tasty.

217
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,122
No, thanks.

218
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,993
Anyway, after doing so much,
what did you get?

219
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,196
I didn't get anything,

220
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,098
but Miss Wakura,

221
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,234
what do you think about the wound
on the victim's palm?

222
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,270
I keep thinking about it.

223
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,139
I don't think you should
look at it when you're eating.

224
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,644
Maybe her body hit a rock in the sea?

225
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,145
But if it had,

226
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,550
there should be wounds like that
on other parts of her body too.

227
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,852
But there are none at all.

228
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,288
I told you not to put them out here!

229
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,825
She was grabbing something tightly.

230
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,561
She must have grabbed it pretty tightly

231
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,830
or it wouldn't form a wound like this.

232
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,803
Are you more impatient than usual,
Mr. Kurokawa?

233
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,605
Why?

234
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,210
Mr. Yufuin said maybe the case
you lost the other day made you nervous.

235
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,146
During Miss Ogasawara's interview too.

236
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,483
Even if you feel affection for someone,

237
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,053
it doesn't necessarily mean
that you wouldn't kill them.

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,756
Are you hiding anything?

239
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,059
Somehow, I feel that you
were harsher than usual.

240
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,263
Did Miss Ogasawara say or do
something to make you doubt her?

241
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,569
That wasn't why. It's just…

242
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,207
Nobody knows
what another person really thinks.

243
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,518
Excuse me.

244
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,525
I don't understand how someone
can eat when looking at these.

245
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:17,263
What would you like, Mrs. Kurokawa?
We recommend our broiled snapper.

246
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,466
No, thanks. And I'm not his wife.

247
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,234
Is that so?

248
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,410
I don't have any kinky interest…

249
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,886
You're leaving the restaurant?
My golden eye snapper--

250
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,355
It's your fault that I can't stay there.

251
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,256
SET MEALS &amp; SPECIALS

252
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,726
Anyway, we have to leave now
or we'll miss the last ferry.

253
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,962
You're right. Let's go.

254
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,265
But will you go somewhere with me
before that?

255
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,633
Go somewhere?

256
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,437
Excuse me. This is…

257
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,939
My home.

258
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,140
KUROKAWA

259
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,141
You mean…

260
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,743
the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office's

261
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,146
Deputy Prosecutor-General
Mr. Kurokawa's home?

262
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,316
Yeah, he kept calling me
to tell me to show up at home.

263
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,086
-But why am I here with you?
-Because it'll be easier for me.

264
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,422
No. You don't make sense to me.

265
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,991
It's absurd to come so late anyway!

266
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,593
I didn't bring a souvenir either.

267
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,729
But you aren't here
to tell them we'll get married.

268
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,764
It's absurd even so!

269
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,235
-Let's go.
-No.

270
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,487
Here you go!

271
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,191
Miss Wakura, keep eating.

272
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,893
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Okay.

273
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,897
You said you missed your son,
so I told him to come.

274
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,064
Why don't you sit down?

275
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,101
But our son is home after so long

276
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,104
and brought such a lovely lady
with him too!

277
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,072
I'll have to cook a gorgeous feast.

278
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,676
The rack of lamb will be ready soon too.

279
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,318
-She hasn't changed, right?
-She hasn't changed.

280
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,357
Mrs. Kurokawa is lovely.

281
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,659
Thank you.

282
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,163
But it must be a disaster for you.

283
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,866
It's tough being his girlfriend, isn't it?

284
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,767
Yes?

285
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:40,072
As I've explained,
I am just his colleague.

286
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,143
Of course, I don't usually
dress like this at work.

287
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,210
Of course.

288
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,347
My son probably
caused you trouble, didn't he?

289
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,515
What?

290
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,686
He made you go to Amane Island
to do some absurd reconstruction

291
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,956
and you had to get changed
as a result. Am I right?

292
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,058
How do you know?

293
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,194
I heard that you will be defending
the case's suspect.

294
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,732
You got informed quickly
even though you aren't involved.

295
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,667
But it worries me

296
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,170
when I think that
my son might embarrass me again.

297
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,775
In the end, you lost the medical
error case the other day also.

298
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,547
Are you going to defend the suspect
according to her claim as usual?

299
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,683
Yes, I am planning to do so.

300
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,753
Criminals lie and hide facts.

301
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
Bear that in mind
or you'll be pushed around.

302
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,158
The police and prosecutors assume that,

303
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,961
that's why they still falsely charge
some people.

304
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,500
The rack of lamb will be ready
in three minutes.

305
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,036
-Do you have enough drinks?
-Yes, we do.

306
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,505
I haven't had your cooking
in a long time. It's tasty.

307
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,406
Is it?

308
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,776
Miss Wakura, do you enjoy the food?

309
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,378
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,015
I especially like the stewed seafood.

311
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,716
-The acqua pazza?
-Yes.

312
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,185
There's a simple trick to make it.

313
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,221
Your rack of lamb will burn.

314
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,491
That's right. I'll…

315
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,166
I will gather evidence in my own way.

316
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,103
Law enforcement agencies will conduct
an investigation with science.

317
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,204
It isn't a lawyer's job.

318
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,574
But the problem is
they don't do their job well.

319
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,544
If they had investigated
properly at that time…

320
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,881
That case still bothers you?

321
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,682
You haven't changed.

322
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,128
Taku, watch your manners.

323
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,966
It's ready!

324
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,703
This is the best one I've made in years!

325
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,806
They do look delicious.

326
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:59,144
I'm sorry, I just remembered that
I have to check some documents.

327
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:04,283
-Oh, but you can do that later--
-The case is urgent.

328
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,418
Miss Wakura, enjoy your dinner.

329
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,667
Well, I think there's something
that you should say to me.

330
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,070
Did you enjoy the food?

331
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,171
Not that.

332
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,577
I mean you suddenly dragged me
into your serious family gathering.

333
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,845
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,615
But my mom was happy because you came.

335
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:42,688
Somehow, I feel that she had
the wrong idea until the very end.

336
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,089
Wrong idea?

337
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,593
Forget it!

338
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,663
Anyway, you and your father…

339
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,334
We aren't on bad terms, we just…

340
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,236
think differently.

341
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,405
Many things happened when I was a student.

342
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,808
When you were a student?

343
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,944
We rarely see each other
after I left home,

344
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,579
but that's what happens
every time we meet.

345
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,983
Both of us haven't changed.

346
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,721
Let's hurry back to prepare for
the pre-trial conference procedure.

347
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,529
Defense lawyer, you'll debate
whether it's a murder or not?

348
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,730
Yes.

349
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,733
We don't see any trouble between
the suspect and the victim,

350
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,968
so my client has no motive
to kill the victim.

351
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,206
Mr. Kurokawa.

352
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,044
I had no idea that you would claim
the suspect's innocence this time.

353
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,779
That's what my client wants to do.

354
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,181
But in this case,

355
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,617
it's important to know if she really
has no motive for murder.

356
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,019
Do you know something?

357
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,189
Well, who knows? Excuse me.

358
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,164
NO MOTIVE

359
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,499
Hey.

360
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,068
You'll only defend her
based on the lack of motive

361
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,003
and circumstantial evidence?

362
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,972
Can you really win the case?

363
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,474
In the case of a lay judge trial,

364
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,511
letting them see the suspect's personality

365
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,314
works to a certain extent.

366
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,648
-Noboribetsu.
-Yes!

367
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,951
You want to be transferred
to the criminal case division now?

368
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,786
-No, I don't.
-Go to work, then.

369
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,288
-How is the MA case going?
-I'll do it right now!

370
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,126
Kurokawa, can you win this time?

371
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,028
I don't know yet.

372
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,332
If you insist that she's innocent
and lose the second time in a row,

373
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,268
your job will be at risk too.
Do you get it?

374
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,369
Yes.

375
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,273
I've always thought so,

376
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,244
but doesn't Mr. Beppu make it obvious
that he hates Mr. Kurokawa?

377
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,348
Because he wants to make this
a corporate law office someday.

378
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,249
Really?

379
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,251
Don't worry.

380
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,689
Even if he does, I won't let him
do so as long as I live.

381
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,193
Now, go and do the preparation.

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,094
Okay.

383
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,684
COURTHOUSE

384
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,252
As I have just said,

385
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,421
my client had a good relationship
with the victim.

386
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,858
There was no clear reason for her
to plan and execute a murder.

387
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,795
Therefore, we have enough reasons
to suspect the prosecutor's claim

388
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,865
is constructed on the basis
of circumstantial evidence only.

389
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,300
I've finished.

390
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,236
Next, we'll proceed with
the examination of a witness

391
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,004
-requested by the prosecutor.
-Yes.

392
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,015
Miss Ogasawara?

393
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,318
Please tell us your name

394
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,287
and the relationship between you
and the suspect or the victim.

395
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,188
EXAMINATION OF WITNESS

396
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,189
Keisuke Tsurumi.

397
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,358
I'm the victim Risa Himeshima's

398
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,327
and the suspect Nami Ogasawara's
supervisor.

399
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,531
You offered to testify
against the suspect in court

400
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,233
about an important fact.

401
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,868
What is it?

402
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,539
I was maliciously stalked

403
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,042
by the suspect there.

404
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,613
No way.

405
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,384
Why did she stalk you?

406
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,686
Because she didn't want to break up.

407
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,723
The suspect and I
had been in a relationship.

408
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,860
We had been dating on and off
for seven to eight years.

409
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:47,332
Your Honor, what the witness says
has nothing to do with the case.

410
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,436
If you listen until the end,
you will know why this is relevant.

411
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,805
Lawyer's objection is dismissed.

412
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,642
The reason we had trouble breaking up

413
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,112
<i>was the victim, Risa Himeshima.</i>

414
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:05,417
The suspect suspected that
I was in love with Himeshima.

415
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,354
In love? But the victim was married.

416
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,524
Yes, she got married three years ago.

417
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,093
That's why it is impossible.

418
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,661
You made a move on her.

419
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,065
So she began to stalk you?

420
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,768
It started when we broke up
half a year ago.

421
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,869
Half a year ago?

422
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,571
Her harassment got worse and worse.

423
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,246
<i>She would come unannounced</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

424
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,751
<i>and go to matchmaking parties</i>
<i>to try to get my attention.</i>

425
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,726
In the end, she started saying that
she'd kill me, then kill herself.

426
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,361
This obviously is a threat.

427
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,998
She was too annoying,
so I said to her one day

428
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,967
that I envied Himeshima's husband

429
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,204
and that I wished I had dated
a lady like Himeshima.

430
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,808
Her harassment stopped completely
after that.

431
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,210
That means,

432
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,980
it's likely that she directed
her grudge towards the victim.

433
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,250
What did you think when you were informed

434
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,919
about Risa Himeshima's death?

435
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,190
I was sure that the suspect murdered her.

436
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,562
And part of it was my fault too.

437
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,500
Thank you.

438
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,369
My examination with Mr. Tsurumi is over.

439
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,907
Why didn't you tell us?

440
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,243
When we first met,

441
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,613
Mr. Kurokawa asked if you were
hiding anything. Why--

442
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,119
Why didn't I tell you?

443
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,288
Are you serious?

444
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,193
Why? How can I tell you?

445
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,329
You'd definitely think
that I killed her if I had!

446
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,531
Yes,

447
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,767
I hated Risa.

448
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,371
I couldn't get what I want and be happy,

449
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,741
but she got everything and I'm so jealous.

450
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,577
I just hate her to the bone.

451
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,449
I don't have the talent
to be a designer, but she had.

452
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,888
I'd been at the mercy of a man
who kept cheating on me for eight years,

453
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,557
but she was happily married.

454
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,862
While I cared for my mom
and work exhausted my energy,

455
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:36,368
she was enjoying
her wonderful life to the fullest.

456
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,937
How could I not be frustrated?

457
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,973
But she looked up to you, Miss Ogasawara.

458
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,343
-If you hate her so much--
-I should've bullied her?

459
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,812
We worked together in a small company.

460
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,714
I should've kept a distance?

461
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,083
That's totally impossible!

462
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,286
It'd only make me feel more miserable.

463
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,296
Risa was a really lovely girl.

464
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,832
There was nothing bad about her.

465
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,969
I only got jealous of her myself.

466
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,274
If she had really been a horrible person,

467
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,810
it would've been easier for me too.

468
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,320
I am sorry.

469
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,023
We'll lose the case anyway.

470
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,860
You don't have to do
anything for me anymore.

471
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,869
You hated Ms. Himeshima, didn't you?

472
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,305
Yes.

473
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,407
You wished she were gone--

474
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,810
-Didn't I tell you so?
-But…

475
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,212
You didn't kill her, right?

476
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,984
You've revealed
many of your real thoughts,

477
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,520
but you didn't say you killed her at all.

478
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,626
No matter how much you hated her,

479
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,329
even if you hated her so much
that you wanted to kill her…

480
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,968
we still don't know
if you really killed her or not.

481
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,941
You trust me?

482
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,144
So, please…

483
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,749
what happened at the beach that day?

484
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,685
Please tell us the truth.

485
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,157
I…

486
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,230
I realized that my relationship
with Tsurumi was beyond repair,

487
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,401
so I decided to resign from my job.

488
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:51,970
Also…

489
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,142
I decided not to see Risa again.

490
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:02,480
<i>That's why I wanted to tell her</i>
<i>what I really thought.</i>

491
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,186
Miss Nami, why did you wear it here?

492
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,188
I just wanted to.

493
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,159
I would've worn mine if you had told me.

494
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,730
<i>But in the end, I couldn't tell her</i>
<i>what I really thought.</i>

495
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,599
<i>I wanted to pretend to be nice</i>
<i>until the very end.</i>

496
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,803
<i>I only told her that I would resign</i>

497
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,372
<i>and that I would never see her again.</i>

498
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,407
<i>Then, lastly,</i>

499
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,675
<i>I threw the necklace,</i>

500
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,245
<i>which was the token</i>
<i>of our friendship, into the sea.</i>

501
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,882
Miss Nami! Why?

502
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,419
I told you that I'd never see you again.

503
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,655
So I don't need it anymore.

504
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,257
Get rid of your necklace too.

505
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:51,196
I don't want you to remember me anymore.

506
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:53,965
I am sorry.

507
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:01,072
And that was the last conversation
I had with Risa.

508
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,174
I see.

509
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,521
IMAGE OF THE VICTIM'S RIGHT HAND

510
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,193
Mr. Kurokawa?

511
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,831
NAMI OGASAWARA

512
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,933
"Murder out of unjustified grudge."

513
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,802
"Crime committed by a female stalker."

514
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,472
"The dark side
of a respectable career woman."

515
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,075
All the headlines are so harsh.

516
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,977
The content is even worse.

517
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,212
They all attack her personality.

518
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,781
The verdict isn't even declared!

519
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,683
It isn't. That's why they can
write what they want.

520
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,488
My boss told me to ask Tsurumi
to comment on this too.

521
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,756
Will you go, then?

522
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,358
I won't.

523
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,663
I mean, if Miss Ogasawara
didn't kill the victim,

524
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,098
it'll expose their trouble,

525
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,700
which has nothing to do with the case.

526
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,804
But he successfully gave the judges
the impression

527
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,773
that the suspect had a motive to kill.

528
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,777
And Kurokawa has come to a dead end too.

529
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,114
Sand…

530
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,249
Yes, he's come to a dead end.

531
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,052
That guy hasn't moved since he came back.

532
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:27,358
Mr. Noboribetsu, I know you're upset
about Miss Ogasawara,

533
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,160
but you have to go back to work.

534
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,562
She deceived me.

535
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,265
My romance failed. We lost the case.

536
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,201
I'll be transferred to
the criminal case division.

537
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,070
My life plummets to rock bottom,
like this.

538
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,941
How rude of you to say our division
is rock bottom.

539
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,749
Dr. Akiu!

540
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,451
Why did you come?

541
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,554
I had to do something near here

542
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,123
and Kurokawa's going to lose the case,

543
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,125
so I dropped by to see his funny face.

544
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,661
He came to check on him
because he got worried.

545
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,496
Amane Island?

546
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,899
I think golden eye snapper
is the specialty there.

547
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,436
Yes, I tried it when I went there
to investigate.

548
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,439
Golden eye snapper is a snapper,
but it lives in deep sea.

549
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,274
That's why its eyes are big.

550
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,775
Yes, and?

551
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:21,112
Something that doesn't happen
in a tank like this

552
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,413
happens sometimes.

553
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,723
What… Mr. Kurokawa!

554
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,191
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,826
Found it.

556
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,397
Are you trying to kill me?
What are you doing suddenly?

557
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,535
<i>Maybe her body hit a rock?</i>

558
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,572
<i>I threw the necklace into the sea.</i>

559
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,344
I see.

560
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,547
That's what happened.

561
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:57,949
I'll get the things ready.

562
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,317
Thank you.

563
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,086
-And I need…
-Wait, Mr. Kurokawa!

564
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,656
I say this every time,
but tell me what's going on!

565
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,424
CONTROL BRIGHTNESS

566
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,762
Dr. Akiu, thank you
for helping us this time too.

567
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,197
We brought the object
for your experiment too.

568
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,634
He seems unreliable as a guinea pig.

569
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,805
Here you are.

570
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,273
-Thank you.
-Okay.

571
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,477
Miss Arima, he'll check with
the fishery cooperative for us.

572
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,512
-Yeah?
-Yes.

573
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:31,149
I've just cast the net too.

574
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:32,750
The net?

575
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,954
Looking for something in the sea

576
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,357
is like finding one speck
of gold dust in a desert.

577
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,859
We have to increase the probability
as much as possible.

578
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,698
SATOKO ARIMA
PLEASE RETWEET

579
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,702
I'M LOOKING FOR A NECKLACE I LOST
ON AMANE ISLAND LAST OCTOBER

580
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,503
We're ready.

581
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,405
Okay, let's begin.

582
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,509
Please go into the swimming pool there.

583
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,778
Please tell me what's going on.

584
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,849
Mr. Noboribetsu, this is to prove
Miss Ogasawara's innocence.

585
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,784
Prove her innocence?

586
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,387
I've gotten over the nasty woman!

587
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,189
You're cold-hearted!

588
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,392
This is the job
that you took on yourself, right?

589
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,600
Just so you know, I might not look it,
but I'm good at swimming.

590
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,937
If you want to investigate
why the victim drowned,

591
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,271
I'm not the right man!

592
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,439
That isn't a problem.

593
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,876
Even a swimmer who can swim
in the Olympic Games

594
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,412
will certainly drown in this experiment.

595
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,748
-He might die in the worst case.
-What?

596
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,983
It's a big problem, then!

597
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,559
What?

598
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,461
Excuse me.

599
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,497
-I'm looking for something.
-Yes?

600
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,333
A necklace? I haven't seen it.

601
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,771
If it's so small, it's likely
to have washed up the shore.

602
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,247
Mr. Noboribetsu, are you okay?

603
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,216
How can I be okay? I almost died!

604
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,886
I want to repeat
the experiment at least twice.

605
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,321
But I don't think it's possible.

606
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,357
Should I do it for him?

607
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,491
No, it's fine.

608
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,226
I'll do it.

609
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,194
But…

610
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,363
I am a lawyer too.

611
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,999
I'll do anything to clear
someone of false charges.

612
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,235
You have some guts.
We'll resume five minutes later.

613
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,136
What?

614
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,509
Dr. Akiu.

615
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,680
I met Mr. Kurokawa's father the other day.

616
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,916
Mr. Kurokawa brought me to his home.

617
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,685
-Did he tell you anything?
-No.

618
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:53,191
But as I thought, something happened
when Mr. Kurokawa was a student.

619
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,493
It was the reason that

620
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,463
he aimed to be a lawyer
and their relationship got worse.

621
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,066
Ask Kurokawa himself if you're curious.

622
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,971
Is it okay to ask?
The matter seems serious.

623
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,607
If you can't ask Kurokawa,

624
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,443
you can ask Mr. Yufuin or Mr. Beppu.

625
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,379
Or you can ask Arima.

626
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
They are all involved.

627
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,382
Involved?

628
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,518
Our positions were different,

629
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,121
but we all share something
unpleasant together.

630
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,923
Does that include you, Dr. Akiu?

631
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,709
Kurokawa!

632
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,844
-I got it!
-Yes?

633
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,313
I got the information!

634
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,848
Wow!

635
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,683
This is bad.

636
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,155
Mr. Kurokawa is calling.

637
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,025
-Hello?
-<i>Miss Wakura, I found it.</i>

638
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,326
Really?

639
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,530
-Yes, a girl found it on the beach.
-Look at this!

640
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,898
It's pretty, right?

641
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,801
<i>Glad to hear that! So…</i>

642
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,103
How did the experiment go?

643
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,973
The experiment is done.

644
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,808
We are ready.

645
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,711
Okay. We'll be back at once.

646
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,826
COURTHOUSE

647
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,728
You threw the necklace

648
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,765
that was a token of the victim's
and your friendship into the sea

649
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,166
and left after that.

650
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,902
You didn't harm the victim at all.

651
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,337
Is that true?

652
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,707
-Yes.
-Thank you.

653
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,944
I still have questions for my client,

654
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,745
but please have a look at

655
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,015
defense evidence number 46, a video
that was granted special permission.

656
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,485
The coast of Amane Island,
that is, the scene of crime,

657
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,255
has the same shape
as I've reconstructed in this tank.

658
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,758
The distance between the beach
and shallow water is short

659
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,127
and it gets very deep suddenly.

660
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:15,066
Waves move in a special way
over a geographical feature like this.

661
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,769
The phenomenon is called a rip current.

662
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,239
RIP CURRENT

663
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,079
The rip currents formed here

664
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,649
go towards the bottom of the sea
at ten meters per second.

665
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,853
If a person is attacked
by rip currents like this,

666
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,588
what will happen?

667
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,131
<i>As you see,</i>

668
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,767
no matter how good a swimmer someone is,

669
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,502
he cannot fight against it.

670
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,873
<i>The victim was dragged in by it,</i>
<i>which caused her death.</i>

671
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,941
<i>That's all.</i>

672
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,478
In the autopsy,

673
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,347
blood was found
in the victim's paranasal sinuses.

674
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,417
It was because she was dragged
into the rip current

675
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,653
and pressure on her body
suddenly increased.

676
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,588
Your Honor, judges,

677
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,691
the video of the experiment
and the result of the autopsy

678
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:18,029
aren't enough to be the evidence
of this case and they mean nothing.

679
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,997
They mean nothing? Why do you say so?

680
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,267
This case is concluded as murder

681
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,935
because the amount of sand

682
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,939
found in the victim's lungs
was more than in usual drowning victims.

683
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,442
There was sand in the water.

684
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,680
When the victim went
to pick up this necklace.

685
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,819
This is the necklace that my client
threw away on the beach.

686
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,122
It was washed ashore
ten days after the accident

687
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,325
and a girl who lives nearby picked it up.

688
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,592
Next,

689
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,329
there are wounds
on the victim's right palm.

690
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,132
She injured herself
when she grabbed the pendant.

691
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,133
ANALYSED BY EXPERTS IN FORENSIC MEDICINE

692
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,270
This was verified
by a forensic pathologist.

693
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,439
In other words, the victim

694
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,874
tried to take back
the token of their friendship,

695
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,176
the necklace that my client threw away.

696
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,782
Everyone, the lawyer's claim
is no more than a theory.

697
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,953
How would you explain the wounds
on the victim's right palm, then?

698
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,655
It's simple.

699
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,924
When the accused tried to kill her,

700
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,161
the victim struggled and grabbed
the necklace the accused was wearing.

701
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,731
Would this be what you mean?

702
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,469
This chain and pendant have
the same shape the accused had.

703
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,281
This chain broke, right?

704
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,518
But Kurimaru's did not.

705
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,425
Also, if that was what happened,

706
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,660
Miss Ogasawara would've
taken the necklace back

707
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,262
to destroy evidence.

708
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,598
-But that's--
-Prosecutor.

709
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:05,069
The victim picked up the necklace
from the sea voluntarily.

710
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,141
Why did Risa do that?

711
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,247
Because she looked up to you.

712
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,218
She didn't want to lose you as a friend.

713
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,421
That's the only reason.

714
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,120
<i>Then, at that time, a rip current</i>
<i>dragged her into the sea.</i>

715
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,297
Then, in that case…

716
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,667
In that case…

717
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,937
it's my fault that Risa…

718
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,139
It was an accident.

719
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,209
It isn't murder.

720
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,847
Maybe you hated her…

721
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:29,353
and maybe you were the one
who caused the accident to happen,

722
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,989
but this is still an accident…

723
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,826
and you did not kill her.

724
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,806
Your Honor.

725
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,477
For the above reasons, the defense lawyer…

726
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:59,283
claims that the accused,
Nami Ogasawara, is innocent.

727
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,495
MURDER ON AMANE ISLAND
FOUND TO BE AN ACCIDENT

728
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,764
THE ACCUSED IS FOUND INNOCENT

729
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,543
Thank you very much for your help.

730
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,512
It's been reported excessively
by the press,

731
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,481
so life will be tough for you.

732
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,916
I've braced myself for it.

733
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,852
Though I didn't kill her,

734
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,789
it's still true that
I caused Risa's death.

735
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,193
I compared myself to Risa.

736
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,298
I got jealous and hated her
for unjustifiable reasons.

737
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,302
I totally realized how ugly I am.

738
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:58,509
Is it really okay
that I'm not found guilty?

739
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,711
Nobody can punish you for what you think.

740
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,482
No matter what you really thought,

741
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,720
you pretended to be
a good senior and a good friend.

742
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:15,059
So, in other words, as far as
Ms. Himeshima was concerned,

743
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,029
you were a really nice person.

744
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,301
I shouldn't have pretended, then.

745
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,170
If I hadn't,

746
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:31,542
maybe Risa would still be alive.

747
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,713
No need to blame yourself so much.

748
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:43,787
I did something very disrespectful
to you, Mr. Noboribetsu.

749
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,956
It doesn't bother me.

750
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,661
Just one thing.

751
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,032
If that wasn't why we met…

752
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,103
would you have… well…

753
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,407
considered marrying me?

754
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,481
It's okay.

755
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,849
Please tell him what you really think.

756
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,654
I am sorry.

757
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,723
I knew it.

758
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,604
Noboribetsu, the MA case--

759
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,639
I've gotten everything done.

760
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,940
There you go.

761
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,008
You have?

762
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,276
Mr. Beppu!

763
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,247
I'm more cut out
to do corporate law cases,

764
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,549
therefore…

765
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,450
What?

766
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,787
I will continue to do my best!

767
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,688
PROFIT

768
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:51,755
What's that headband? Profit?

769
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,856
Yes?

770
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,092
-Yes?
-Yes!

771
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,461
You said you'd treat me to lunch,

772
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,696
but not here, right?

773
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,899
It is. The broiled golden eye snapper
will be ready soon.

774
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,637
You didn't try it on Amane Island,
did you?

775
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,439
No, I didn't,

776
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,374
but if you're cooking me something,

777
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,943
you should tidy up the place a bit.

778
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,078
Oh. Sorry.

779
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,148
TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT MURDER CASE

780
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,453
Touo University…

781
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,822
TOUO UNIVERSITY MURDER CASE
PRISONER COMMITTED SUICIDE

782
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,999
THE DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

783
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,702
Because I want to know about you.

784
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,804
<i>The past of the lawyers is revealed.</i>

785
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,241
<i>A student at a prestigious</i>
<i>fencing team had a heart attack.</i>

786
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,043
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

787
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,412
<i>Is it because the teacher abused</i>
<i>his power when he taught?</i>

788
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,014
-<i>Or…</i>
-There is no reason for you to do it!

789
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,716
<i>When you do science,</i>

790
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,586
it always puts
your moral sensibility to the test.

791
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,723
<i>All the reporters here,</i>
<i>please reveal this to the public!</i>

792
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,493
<i>Punishing someone is totally</i>
<i>different from exposing secrets.</i>

793
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,963
Live, make up for what you did,
and turn over a new leaf.
