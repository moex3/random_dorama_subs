"Touo University…"

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,509
It is mine.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,547
The case happened ten years ago,
didn't it?

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,318
You were still a student
at that time, right?

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,519
I was.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,590
Is the case the reason
that you became a lawyer?

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,358
Why do you ask?

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,031
-Because I want to know about you.
-Yes?

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:36,336
No, I mean, we're colleagues,
so I think it's better if I know more.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,274
Moreover, Dr. Akiu has told me
a little about it.

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,578
I know that something happened
when Mr. Kurokawa was a student.

12
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,083
It was why he aimed to be a lawyer
and isn't close to his father now.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,285
Ask Kurokawa himself if you're curious.

14
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,321
I see.

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,257
Dr. Akiu said that.

16
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,692
-There you go.
-Why?

17
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,796
So, may I read it?

18
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,198
Well, I don't feel comfortable.

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,134
-Then you should refuse until the end--
-Oh no!

20
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,474
There are several related documents.

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,710
No, I'll only take this. Excuse me.

22
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,479
What… Wait, the fish…

23
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,516
Is it okay to read this?

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,425
What's the matter?

25
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,528
Oh, Miss Wakura?

26
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,331
-It's a scandal…
-Scandal?

27
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,867
It's the law firm you worked at before.

28
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,105
Miss Arima, I heard that you had
a fight with the director again.

29
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,540
I gave him the proposal of

30
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,544
a special news program about
the false charge cases Kurokawa handled,

31
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,414
but he rejected it.
He said it was dull and not eye-catching,

32
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,349
and that's why I'm useless.

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,422
I said I'd fix and submit it
as many times as he wants,

34
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,359
but he gave me a story
before I could do that.

35
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,496
Gossip magazines
have been exposing harassment

36
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,199
-in various industries lately, right?
-Yes.

37
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,237
But he wants me to do this topic
on TV after they've all done it.

38
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,038
JAPAN - THE KINGDOM OF HARASSMENT

39
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,707
I have no motivation to work.

40
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,442
I see.

41
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,146
Speaking of harassment,
I have a new story.

42
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,747
Someone at a law firm blew the whistle.

43
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,450
Huh?

44
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,152
Wait, this…

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,487
"Big law firm J. Y."

46
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,823
It's clearly James Yuri Law Office.

47
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,792
This is a huge scandal.

48
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,029
Are you curious about
what the voice recording is like?

49
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,064
-May we play it?
-Okay.

50
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,065

<i>I'm going to scream!</i>

<i>Shout if you want,</i>
<i>but your situation will get worse.</i>

53
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,610
<i>I am… with… and I am… as well.</i>

54
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,415
<i>Please stop… Stop… No!</i>

55
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,750
Are you okay?

56
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,521
I am. It just disgusts me.

57
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,791
But I'm glad that the problem is exposed.

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,793
Yeah, true.

59
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,799
Isawa! I told you to do a summary
on investment law violation cases.

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,734
-Why are you chatting here?
-What?

61
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,870
But it's lunch break in five.

62
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,406
I don't care. I need it
right after lunch, so do it now.

63
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,309
Mr. Noboribetsu,
you're totally abusing your power.

64
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,478
Abusing my power? That's an exaggeration.

65
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,847
More people are seeking
advice on harassment

66
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,182
in your division too, right?

67
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,619
Maybe I'll get a voice recorder
and accuse you too.

68
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,688
Why do you all accuse me together?

69
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,192
I'm not abusing my power,
I'm educating him.

70
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,829
Only people who have
a twisted personality abuse their power.

71
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,865
Excuse me. I'm Takamatsu.
I'm here to talk to the lawyer.

72
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,935
We've been expecting you.
Please come with me.

73
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,173
You want to talk about an incident
at a high school?

74
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,574
Yes.

75
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,477
I'm the instructor of a club, and…

76
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,778
YOSUKE TAKAMATSU, SUSPECT

<i>We have been suffering this</i>

84
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,373
<i>the fencing teacher's life</i>
<i>won't be what it used to be.</i>

85
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,943
It isn't a reason for you
to do something wrong!

86
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:43,349
<i>The incident happened on</i>
<i>November 22, 2018, at 4 p.m.</i>

87
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,218
<i>In Kainan High School's gym,</i>

88
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>the fencing club was practicing</i>
<i>under the teacher</i>

89
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,989
<i>Yosuke Takamatsu's supervision.</i>

90
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,624
-Okay, enough.
-Wait.

91
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,027
-We'll spar next. Go to the piste.
-Wait…

92
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,062
-Tashiro, referee!
-Yes, sir.

93
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,965
Step forward. Don't step back!

94
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,501
I said, don't step back!

95
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,639
What are you doing? Get up!

96
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,044
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't want to practice?

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,880
-Fujisato!
-Fujisato?

98
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,416
Hey, Fujisato!

99
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,787
Sir, he isn't breathing!

100
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,856
<i>During practice, the ace</i>
<i>and club president, second-year student,</i>

101
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,193
<i>Shun Fujisato, had a cardiac arrest</i>
<i>due to irregular heartbeat.</i>

102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,762
<i>He passed out there</i>
<i>and was sent to hospital.</i>

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,433
<i>His life was saved,</i>
<i>but he lost consciousness temporarily</i>

104
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,302
<i>and is resting at home after</i>
<i>being discharged from the hospital.</i>

105
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,904
A house arrest was made three days ago

106
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,840
for professional negligence
resulting in injury.

107
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,811
It's unusual that someone
is charged in a case like this.

108
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,881
The boy's parents were very angry
and sued him.

109
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:53,152
Some magazines exaggerated
various things in their articles too.

110
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,320
Physical punishment?

111
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,289
Kainan High School is famous

112
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,626
for having many interschool
fencing competition champions, right?

113
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,496
The previous Olympic Games
bronze medalist too.

114
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,032
Yes, he was my student.

115
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,204
I've brought various people trouble
after this happened.

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,340
Fujisato had a cardiac arrest.

117
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,978
Could it be because your thrust
was stronger than necessary?

118
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,179
It's impossible.

119
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,715
If it really was my fault,

120
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,784
I'd be a man and pay for what I did.

121
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,819
Mr. Takamatsu,

122
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,390
please let me verify two things with you.

123
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,064
First, was there anything wrong
with Fujisato during practice that day?

124
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,900
I don't think there was
anything wrong with him.

125
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,535
Okay, the second question.

126
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:49,075
Has there been any problem
or trouble between you and Fujisato?

127
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,847
I've been teaching Fujisato with
more enthusiasm than the other students.

128
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,919
He's a talented player who might
become Japan's leader in fencing,

129
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,024
and I think he understands
my thoughts very well too.

130
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,794
All right, then.

131
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,063
I'll investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

132
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,200
<i>Please leave.</i>

133
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,736
<i>I have nothing to talk to you about.</i>

134
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,106
We would like to ask Fujisato
to tell us himself

135
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,242
what happened at that time.

136
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,679
<i>My son still hasn't recovered emotionally.</i>

137
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,816
<i>I'm not going to let you see him.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

138
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,886
She didn't let us in.

139
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,691
We have to give up, then.
Let's go to the school next.

140
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,892
Mr. Kurokawa?

141
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,527
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

142
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,964
It won't take long.
Would you let us talk to him for a bit?

143
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,368
Fujisato is the person involved.
His testimony can mean--

144
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,305
No! Mr. Kurokawa,
you shouldn't be too persistent.

145
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,539
But…

146
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:58,978
Huh?

147
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,347
I told you to leave!

148
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,984
I'll sue you if you still don't leave!

149
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,721
Didn't I tell you
not to be too persistent?

150
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,256
No, I… Sorry.

151
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,033
Was someone here?

152
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,436
He said he was a lawyer.

153
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,373
I kicked him out.
Go and rest in your room.

154
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,210
I will take care of everything.

155
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,485
His parents are overprotective.

156
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:44,590
Our school is trying our best
not to stir up any trouble.

157
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,925
The school thinks that

158
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,294
there is no problem
with the supervisor's teaching?

159
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,664
Yes, our fencing team gets good results

160
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,734
because of Mr. Takamatsu's help.

161
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,005
Then, when Mr. Takamatsu thrust,

162
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,974
Fujisato collapsed over there.

163
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,210
But there was
nothing different than usual,

164
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,913
and the situation wasn't unnatural, right?

165
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,215
Yeah, we were practicing like usual.

166
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,919
This weapon is for foil fencing, isn't it?

167
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,589
If it hits you,
will the number be shown here?

168
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,723
Yes.

169
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,228
The lame is made of metal
and it reacts if the weapon touches it.

170
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,965
What do you wear beneath it?

171
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,401
When we have a practice match,

172
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,971
we wear a protector on a T-shirt
and our uniform too.

173
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,940
We also wear the lame.

174
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,542
Wow, it looks very tough.

175
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,544
Actually…

176
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,847
If you don't mind,

177
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,784
will you let me give my testimony
during the hearing?

178
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,786
Testimony?

179
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,855
Other people say various things,

180
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,660
but as team members, we know how
Mr. Takamatsu teaches the best.

181
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,963
-That's reassuring.
-Yeah.

182
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,638
-Why are you here?
-Tashiro.

183
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,109
Are they the police?

184
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,178
We're lawyers. What's the matter?

185
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,114
-Lawyers.
-Moriyoshi,

186
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,116
if you want anything, talk to me later.

187
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,954
Is he your friend?

188
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,590
He's just a classmate.

189
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,299
This is the video taken
by the volleyball team

190
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,301
to check their postures.

191
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,503
It's at a distance, but…

192
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,038
<i>Your legs.</i>

193
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,072
<i>Your legs!</i>

194
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,808
<i>What's the matter? Concentrate!</i>

195
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,579
<i>Don't step back.</i>

196
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,582
<i>Don't step back!</i>

197
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,486
The noise is getting in the way.

198
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,022
I'll bring a copy that is easier to watch.

199
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,391
-Okay.
-But looking at this,

200
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,926
I know why people suspect that he
physically punishes students.

201
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,529
We can hear him shouting at this distance.

202
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,864
<i>Fujisato!</i>

203
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,501
He's well-known
for being strict in the first place.

204
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,972
He used to be one of Japan's
top five players in the past too.

205
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,939
CHAMPION

206
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,576
<i>One of his lungs was removed</i>
<i>because of a disease.</i>

207
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:22,648
<i>After that, he has been putting</i>
<i>his efforts into training young players.</i>

208
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,017
Daddy, dinner is ready.

209
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,322
But he gives too much attention
to the talented members,

210
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,626
which makes the others unhappy,
so many of them quit.

211
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,330
But he has gotten some results,
so the school tolerates it.

212
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,966
The deputy headmaster said so too.

213
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,402
His expectation for Fujisato
is especially high

214
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,738
and he even talks big
about him getting a gold medal.

215
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,408
However, this incident happened.

216
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,978
So, do you think you can win the case?

217
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,481
I think it probably isn't a problem.

218
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,516
You're unusually confident.

219
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,119
The medical expert's opinion
is that fencing's thrust

220
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,922
won't cause a wound shock
leading to cardiac arrest

221
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,091
due to irregular heartbeat.

222
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,094
A team member promised to give
his testimony as a witness too.

223
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,963
The parents seem to have gotten emotional,

224
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,266
but there seems to be no trouble
between the supervisor and Fujisato.

225
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,303
But we don't know yet, actually.

226
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,339
Why do you say we don't know?

227
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,509
We couldn't hear the story
from Fujisato himself.

228
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,411
The opinion of the victim

229
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,913
of bullying and harassment is important.

230
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,582
See you.

231
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,819
Guys, you didn't talk to the boy?

232
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,422
No, his mother splashed water at us.

233
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,525
REJECT CALL
VOICE MESSAGE

234
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,426
VOICE MESSAGE

235
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,829
What is it? An interview request again?

236
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:44,730
Yeah…

237
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,299
Could it be about your last law firm?

238
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,504
A gossip magazine's reporter
wants to talk to me,

239
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,038
and he is very pushy.

240
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,508
I haven't replied to him yet.

241
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,944
Maybe you can talk to me
if you don't mind.

242
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,384
Please don't do that!

243
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,620
If you want to climb
the career ladder at our firm,

244
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,322
being my girlfriend won't hurt.

245
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,458
What this means…

246
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,663
You get it, right? Now, come here.

247
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,034
<i>He was the law firm's senior member</i>

248
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,869
<i>and he was the head's friend.</i>

249
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,438
In the end, his sexual harassment
was covered up,

250
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,074
but my punch was treated as a problem,

251
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,377
so I had to resign from the law firm.

252
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,981
The guy is more disgusting than I thought.

253
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,319
Because of this accusation,

254
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,522
even the law firm can't
turn a blind eye to it.

255
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,697
If I agree to be interviewed
and tell people everything,

256
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,499
will it make my heart feel lighter?

257
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,504
I think it's different for everyone.

258
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,042
I can't forgive my former boss, of course.

259
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,779
As a lawyer, I want him
to be punished too.

260
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,049
-But…
-If you are not sure,

261
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,017
I think you can reply later.

262
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,752
Indeed,

263
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,623
punishment and revealing
something are totally different.

264
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,359
Punishment and revealing something?

265
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,396
It's easy to reveal something,

266
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,200
but people are going to say
whatever they want about it too.

267
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,036
Like this.

268
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,539
-<i>Die, old pervert!</i>
-<i>Identify the guy!</i>

269
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,441
<i>I'll post the list of</i>
<i>James Yuri Law Office's lawyers.</i>

270
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,510
<i>It's not funny that</i>
<i>lawyers sexually harass someone.</i>

271
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,045
<i>The guy is innocent if the woman is ugly.</i>

272
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,780
<i>Hold a press conference!</i>

273
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,518
COURTHOUSE

274
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,088
Be quiet.

275
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,522
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE DEFENSE'S WITNESS

276
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,327
Witness, please say that again.

277
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,364
What did you just say?

278
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,167
Mr. Takamatsu is always
oppressive towards our team members.

279
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,069
He had physically punished us too.

280
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,742
Mr. Takamatsu is always
oppressive towards our team members.

281
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,310
He had physically punished us too.

282
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,614
I, other team members,
and Fujisato had been victims.

283
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,318
Tashiro, why are you lying?

284
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,121
Mr. Takamatsu, please calm down.

285
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,859
So…

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,666
Are you saying that this is
what caused this accident to happen?

287
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:39,038
Yes. On that day, Fujisato had been
looking very ill before practice.

288
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:44,009
I told Mr. Takamatsu and asked him
to let Fujisato have a rest,

289
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,544
but he didn't listen to me.

290
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,315
You mean Fujisato wasn't feeling well,
but he forced him to practice?

291
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,649
Yes.

292
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,153
Mr. Takamatsu has a special
practice menu for Fujisato

293
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,256
and the practice he makes
Fujisato do is like bullying.

294
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,125
That's why I've always thought that
this would happen someday.

295
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,629
Witness, when the school talked to you,

296
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,332
you did not mention
anything like that at all.

297
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,400
Why do you give such testimony now?

298
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,871
If this is a lie,

299
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,708
you could be accused of perjury.

300
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,978
Your Honor, the lawyer's remark
was intimidating.

301
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,112
Sustain.

302
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,983
Lawyer, please be careful of your remarks.

303
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,554
I am sorry.

304
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,158
Because of the results
Mr. Takamatsu has achieved,

305
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,295
I thought if I told the school
the truth, they might cover it up.

306
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,064
It's the reason
why I didn't tell the lawyer too.

307
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:44,069
Do you have anything solid to prove
what you have just said?

308
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,173
Yes, I do.

309
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,779
This is the video taken when
Fujisato was punished physically.

310
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,381
<i>Don't be ridiculous!</i>

311
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,549
<i>It hurts.</i>

312
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,218
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

313
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,086
-Wait!
-Witness,

314
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,389
-please don't play the video.
-Reporters!

315
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,657
Please reveal this to the public!

316
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,395
We have been suffering this
the whole time.

317
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,963
Be quiet!

318
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,631
Be quiet!

319
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,100
The court will adjourn.

320
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,407
This is an unexpected turn of events.

321
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,743
He offered to be your witness, didn't he?

322
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,246
This is what he's been after
from the beginning.

323
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,182
Hello, Mr. Kurokawa.

324
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,186
Sorry for causing trouble.

325
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,957
High school students nowadays
are quite clever.

326
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,693
Who'd have thought he would
use the trial to accuse the teacher.

327
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,831
It must be extremely unexpected
to you as the defense lawyers.

328
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,866
We don't know
if his testimony is true or not.

329
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,669
Maybe you need to check the video,

330
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,972
but it must be true that
the supervisor slapped Fujisato.

331
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,609
I can't accept it if you deny
what the child had to

332
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,977
pluck up his courage to say.

333
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,648
TAKAMATSU

334
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,018
-Isn't it cruel to slap a boy?
-It is!

335
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,486
-Stop screwing around.
-This guy is horrible.

336
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,620
<i>It was only once.</i>

337
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,789
I had slapped Fujisato once.

338
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,425
The video was taken at that time.

339
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,627
When did it happen?

340
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,932
About two weeks before
the accident happened,

341
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,601
I thought Fujisato
had lost his motivation.

342
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,936
FENCING CLUB

343
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,606
<i>So I wanted to talk to him</i>
<i>before the other members came.</i>

344
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,011
Fujisato.

345
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,247
What are these?

346
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,517
I shoplifted at a convenience store.

347
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,053
-The cigarettes are my dad's.
-What?

348
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,256
I want to quit fencing.

349
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,726
Even if you stop me,
I'll be suspended from school

350
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,828
if I take them to see
the student counselor.

351
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,666
Be honest with me.

352
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,668
You must be at a loss for what to do.

353
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,105
As the ace, if I quit, it will
harm your reputation.

354
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,307
Don't be ridiculous!

355
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,444
-It hurts.
-What are you talking about?

356
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,085
Listen, I have high hopes for you.

357
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,524
If something is bothering you,
I'll support you as much as you want.

358
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,029
So don't be so stupid
and do something to ruin your future!

359
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,967
And then, Fujisato promised me
to continue practicing.

360
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,570
I apologized for slapping him too.

361
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,740
If that was the only time
that you punished him physically,

362
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,678
that means the testimony
given by Tashiro was false.

363
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,548
This is only an excuse,

364
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,185
but I was demanded to achieve results.

365
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,856
No matter how nicely you put it,
in sports,

366
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,624
you still need to be gifted.

367
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,461
In the midst of it,

368
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,731
treating all members fairly…

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,502
was what I couldn't do.

370
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,375
There they come.

371
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,212
Lawyers, please talk to us
about today's hearing!

372
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,347
Will you continue to defend
the supervisor?

373
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,383
-Sorry, no comment. Sorry.
-Please let us through.

374
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,585
-Sorry.
-Please let us through.

375
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,987
-Excuse me.
-Please tell us about Takamatsu!

376
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,188
-Let me through.
-A comment, please.

377
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,923
Go there! There!

378
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,127
-Mr. Takamatsu! Please talk to us!
-Mr. Takamatsu!

379
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,064
Mr. Takamatsu, what did you say
to the lawyers?

380
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,131
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

381
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,133
You finally messed it up.

382
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,602
CONFESSING TO PHYSICAL ABUSE

383
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,238
"Defense's witness acknowledged
physical punishment."

384
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,940
"The brave accusation
caused confusion in court."

385
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,712
You have damaged our office's
reputation tremendously.

386
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,214
-We are sorry, Mr. Beppu.
-Kurokawa.

387
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,151
Persuade the accused to admit
his mistake and put an end to this

388
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,553
at an early stage.

389
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,021
Professional negligence
resulting in injury

390
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,656
will surely be granted
a stay of execution.

391
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,093
But we haven't inspected
everything thoroughly.

392
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,996
I'm telling you to consider
the accused's benefit.

393
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,099
People will criticize him more.

394
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,269
It'll be more difficult for him
to return to his normal life.

395
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,605
It's my order as the office's head.

396
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,476
It's for the office's,
the accused's, and your own sake!

397
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,646
Stop this pointless fight.

398
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,887
I heard that Mr. Beppu
hates to do criminal case defense,

399
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,723
but he's totally abusing his power
if he goes this far!

400
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,626
Do you want to accuse him?
It'll only drag on, though.

401
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,263
When Mr. Beppu said
it was for Kurokawa's sake,

402
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,533
I think it was what he really thought.

403
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,073
This is you and…
Who's standing next to you?

404
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,444
That was my former partner,
Mr. Beppu's elder brother.

405
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,680
Mr. Beppu's brother?

406
00:21:54,746 --> 00:22:01,720
Originally, my partner and I
opened this law firm.

407
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:08,527
He was an excellent lawyer who was
enthusiastic about criminal cases.

408
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,732
At that time, I was the one
who specialized in corporate law.

409
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,501
However…

410
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,406
when he lost a case defending a suspect,

411
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,043
people criticized him a lot too.

412
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:32,451
Because of that, he succumbed
to disease and passed away.

413
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,456
<i>Mr. Beppu was working at another</i>
<i>law firm, but after that,</i>

414
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,691
<i>he took over this office.</i>

415
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:45,664
A lawyer is the third party
that is the closest to a case.

416
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,632
Because of that,

417
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:54,272
<i>we are very likely to be under</i>
<i>public scrutiny as well.</i>

418
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,575
<i>The useless lawyer</i>
<i>was betrayed by the witness.</i>

419
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,510
<i>He just wants attention. Serves you right!</i>

420
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,279
<i>The lawyer is guilty</i>
<i>for defending a guy like that too!</i>

421
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,781
<i>He isn't human.</i>

422
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,117
<i>Kurokawa is useless.</i>

423
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,929
FAULTY

424
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,365
He's not coming out.

425
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,834
Give us your comment!

426
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,337
Let's go to his parents' home
for comments.

427
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,073
Miss Arima, we should go closer too.

428
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,608
He won't come out.

429
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,110
His daughter took a day off school too.

430
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,913
Well, I do feel sorry for him.

431
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,452
Yosuke Takamatsu, 51 years old.

432
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,621
He came from Miyagi Prefecture.

433
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,925
Champion of Asia foil fencing
tournament at 17 years old.

434
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,727
When he was 21,

435
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,196
a tumor was detected
and his right lung was removed.

436
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,498
His life as a sports player was over.

437
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,002
He married his junior in university
when he was 28 years old.

438
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,105
His only daughter is now nine years old.

439
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,141
Why say that out of the blue?

440
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,010
People who think that

441
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,779
they can ruin someone's life
because they did something bad

442
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,148
must have forgotten something.

443
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,052
That person is also human.

444
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,657
The law firm's sexual harassment case too.

445
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,226
Data of the guy's family
got exposed and it's tough for them.

446
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,896
The man's daughter,
a university student, attempted suicide.

447
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,797
DAUGHTER OF J. Y. LAW OFFICE'S LAWYER
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE

448
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:37,976
Yosuke?

449
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,911
Sorry.

450
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,915
How's Chika?

451
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,819
She shut herself in her room.

452
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,121
I see.

453
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,290
HIS DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL IS NERIMA
PUBLIC SCHOOL, THE NAME IS CHIKA

454
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,993
DIVORCE REGISTRATION FORM

455
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,200
I shouldn't bring you any more trouble.

456
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,973
For Chika's future too…

457
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,210
you had better cut ties with me.

It's this place.

00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,366
CERTAIN VICTORY

463
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,601
Who put the camera here?

464
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,303
NAKADA - YOSHIDA - KIMOTO

465
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,643
It's no use investigating anything now.

466
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,145
Our supervisor can't come back, anyway.

467
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,813
Hey, Tashiro!

468
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,416
Please don't worry about
what happened the other day.

469
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,887
By the way, please have this
with your fellow members.

470
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,188
It's a sports drink.

471
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,829
Fencing equipment are pretty expensive.

472
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,166
It costs about 150,000 yen
to get a full set.

473
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,536
But I went ahead and bought it.

474
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:16,775
I have to find new clues
before the next hearing too.

475
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,479
Well, good luck.

476
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,185
Did you really buy the fencing equipment?

477
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,689
Yes. I bought them at a second-hand
website and it cost 100,000 yen.

478
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,425
-So you really…
-Yes.

479
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,328
I think it has something to do with
why he had a cardiac arrest.

480
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,765
-Sorry to have kept you waiting.
-Thank you.

481
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,000
Well done, Moriyoshi.

482
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,803
-You want it for your club, right?
-Right?

483
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,105
Oh, it's the boy from before.

484
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,808
Are they the police?

485
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,876
Science club.

486
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,614
His name is Moriyoshi, right?

487
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,118
-What's the matter with him?
-Well…

488
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,990
REJECT CALL
VOICE MESSAGE

489
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:05,890
VOICE MESSAGE

490
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,829
A call for an interview?

491
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,497
Yes.

492
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,801
It's tough to be someone
involved in a case.

493
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,104
Both the victim and the one responsible

494
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,807
have their wounds touched
by total strangers.

495
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,277
You can talk to me if you don't mind.

496
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,982
Mr. Kurokawa, are you worried about me?

497
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,851
What?

498
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,920
Yes. I am very worried about you.

499
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,493
Rather than me, worry about whether
we can win the case or not.

500
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,495
Come on. Hurry up.

501
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,950
THE MURDERER IS HOPELESS

502
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,152
HIS DAUGHTER'S PHOTO IS HORRIBLE

503
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,354
It's a storm of fierce criticism.

504
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,624
Public opinions like these
will work against us at trial too.

505
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:18,063
The police summoned Fujisato
as a witness for the next trial.

506
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,634
Mr. Kurokawa, what have you been doing?

507
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,502
I've been thinking.

508
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,707
Why did Fujisato have a cardiac arrest
at such a perfect timing?

509
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,710
-Perfect timing?
-Ouch!

510
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,380
Including the video taken without consent,

511
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,317
it obviously was a series of events
to set Mr. Takamatsu up.

512
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,420
But it's impossible to cause
a cardiac arrest intentionally.

513
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,063
Excuse me. Miss Arima
just sent us a new video.

514
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,598
Oh, please show us.

515
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,867
<i>Don't step back.</i>

516
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,235
<i>Don't step back!</i>

517
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,105
The noise is still there.

518
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,507
It seems that it's there
in the original data.

519
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,242
Maybe the camera was out of order?

520
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,610
<i>What are you doing? Get up!</i>

521
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,113
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>You don't want to practice?</i>

522
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,182
Do you know what it is?

523
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,353
That looks like folding chairs.
Maybe they forgot to put them back?

524
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,122
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

525
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,823
-I'll put them here.
-Thank you.

526
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,724
That reminds me.

527
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,960
I bought one of these too.

528
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,797
Wait. Did you take our conversation
the other day seriously?

529
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,033
Well, I think I'd better have one
for self-defense.

530
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,703
It's high-performance
and is sensitive to sound.

531
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,873
I put it in my basement, but it
picks up sound on the ground floor.

532
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,875
Isawa, what did you just say?

533
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,842
Yes?

534
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,612
It's high-performance--

535
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,247
-Did you say basement?
-Yes.

536
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,316
Our house has three stories
above the ground and two under.

537
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,937
-I'll go to check something.
-Mr. Kurokawa?

538
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,073
Again… What? Again?

539
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,341
Come on!

540
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,210
Wait.

541
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,948
What do you want to check suddenly?

542
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,983
-Sorry.
-Wait…

543
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,987
The headmaster will shout at me
if he finds out!

544
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,222
I'm sorry!

545
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:31,963
Okay!

546
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,236
Mr. Kurokawa, tell me what's going on.

547
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,804
-Thank you.
-What?

548
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:49,881
The position should be somewhere here?

549
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,892
Just as I thought.

550
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,493
TOUO UNIVERSITY

551
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:04,963
I see.

552
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,933
-Indeed, it's possible in this case.
-Yes.

553
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,103
This can explain
the noise in the video too.

554
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,773
That means someone else set this up?

555
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,543
We think we know who it was.

556
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,112
Kainan High School's
science club is excellent too.

557
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,681
It had been the champion
of the Science Tournament.

558
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,417
The accomplice
is a high school student too?

559
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,854
Kurokawa, I'll check something with you.

560
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,522
Okay.

561
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,491
Even if you win the case,

562
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,394
the fencing teacher's life
won't be what it used to be.

563
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,230
On top of that, only more people will be

564
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,200
accused of a crime
and be stared at by curious eyes.

565
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,671
Do you still want to do
the experiment to verify this?

566
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,808
I am a lawyer.

567
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,613
All right, then. But on one condition.

568
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,816
SCIENCE CLUB

569
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,784
THE 28TH ROBOT CONTEST

570
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,223
Moriyoshi, these people
want to talk to you.

571
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,227
-Talk to me?
-About what happened in the fencing club.

572
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:16,768
Moriyoshi, will you tell us what you know?

573
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,640
You seem to be quite eager to study.
I look forward to your future.

574
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,744
This is Touo University Science
and Engineering Department's Dr. Akiu.

575
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,014
Touo University's
Science and Engineering Department.

576
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,985
I heard that you are very talented.

577
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,888
But don't forget this.

578
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,258
When you deal with science,

579
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,493
it always puts
your sense of ethics to the test.

580
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,501
COURTHOUSE

581
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:57,175
This is a Tesla coil, which can
generate electromagnetic waves.

582
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,044
ANTENNA ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
ELECTRIC FIELD MAGNETIC FIELD TESLA COIL

583
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,880
It changes electricity into
electromagnetic waves, sends it,

584
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,983
and the receiver changes the waves
back to electricity.

585
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,252
It can do the so-called
wireless power transmission.

586
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,736
This is a reel,
a piece of equipment used in fencing…

587
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,873
and it has been modified to be
an electromagnetic wave receiver.

588
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,878
In foil fencing,
when the thrust touches the body,

589
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:34,779
in other words,

590
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,384
when the tip of the foil
contacts the lame,

591
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,519
a weak current will flow,

592
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,690
causing the electronic scoreboard
to respond.

593
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:50,361
However, on the day of the incident,
the foil that the accused took

594
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,765
was connected to a reel
that was modified as a receiver.

595
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,600
The Tesla coil was placed

596
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,836
right beneath the stage,
where the incident happened.

597
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,104
PHOTOS OF THE RECONSTRUCTED SCENE

598
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:08,346
There is a noise in the video taken
when the incident happened

599
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,214
because it was affected
by the electromagnetic waves.

600
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,385
Electromagnetic waves
generated by the Tesla coil

601
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,588
turned into current at the receiver
and flew through the foil.

602
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,292
When it contacted the victim's body,
50 milliampere,

603
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,226
an amount of current

604
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,097
that can easily cause
a cardiac arrest, flew through.

605
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,974
If someone has some science knowledge,

606
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,845
he will surely expect the setup
to be able to take someone's life.

607
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,581
Depending on one's ethics,

608
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,584
science can easily become a weapon
that hurts people.

609
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,687
So I urge its maker
to deeply reflect on his fault.

610
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,523
That's the end of the experiment.

611
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,659
Mr. Naoya Moriyoshi.

612
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:00,731
You used this device to cause
Fujisato's cardiac arrest.

613
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,601
Is this true?

614
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,803
Yes.

615
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,340
On that day, I set up the device

616
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,175
and used the Tesla coil.

617
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,112
Why did you do so?

618
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,114
I'm bullied by Tashiro and his friends.

619
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,850
They ordered me to do so.

620
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:25,690
Fujisato might die if you use this.

621
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,459
Were you aware of that?

622
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,728
Yes.

623
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,833
That's why I tried to say no many times.

624
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,302
But…

625
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,439
he asked me to do it himself.

626
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,175
He?

627
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,944
Fujisato asked me himself.

628
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,947
-Fujisato? What do you mean?
-It is true.

629
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,153
This is what Fujisato said to me.

630
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,757
<i>He said he wanted to kill himself</i>

631
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,759
Kill himself?

632
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,097
To make it easier for the current to flow,

633
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,299
it was necessary

634
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,502
to attach a cord to the lame
to pass the current to the body.

635
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,071
But…

636
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,743
without Fujisato's help…

637
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,112
this is impossible.

638
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,683
I wanted to save Fujisato.

639
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,296
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF PROSECUTOR'S WITNESS

640
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,566
The weight of Mr. Takamatsu's hopes
is too heavy.

641
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,671
I wasn't interested in participating
at the Olympic Games.

642
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,708
I only wanted to enjoy fencing as a sport.

643
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:56,113
But Mr. Takamatsu kept telling me
to work harder and aim higher.

644
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,415
Fujisato.

645
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,017
Your supervisor's expectation
was a burden.

646
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,454
Is that why you tried to kill yourself?

647
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,856
I was isolated in the club.

648
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,861
I do a special training course,
so Tashiro and the others hated me.

649
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:18,135
But Mr. Takamatsu and my parents
didn't let me quit the club.

650
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,739
Mr. Takamatsu said participating
in the Olympic Games wasn't a dream,

651
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,841
so my parents got carried away.

652
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:29,580
I couldn't talk to anyone,
so I thought dying was the only way.

653
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,217
Was it necessary to set up
a device like that for this?

654
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,320
It was Tashiro's idea.

655
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,625
Unlike me, Tashiro
was really dedicated to fencing.

656
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,563
Mr. Takamatsu didn't appreciate him,
so he couldn't forgive Mr. Takamatsu.

657
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,801
So he suggested a plan to take
fencing away from Mr. Takamatsu.

658
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,572
A plan that I would be killed

659
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,541
by Mr. Takamatsu's thrust.

660
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,344
Why?

661
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,514
Why did you have to go so far?

662
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,218
-I thought you…
-Mr. Takamatsu.

663
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,654
-If it's you…
-Mr. Takamatsu.

664
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,094
Your expectations are annoying.

665
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,601
I have no motivation,
but you made me do it.

666
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,604
I was isolated by people around me.

667
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,174
I said I wanted to quit,
but you punched me.

668
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,643
In the end, I couldn't even quit.

669
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:35,746
Then…

670
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,283
What should I have done?

671
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,019
Mr. Lawyer, will you tell me?

672
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,055
What should I have done?

673
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:48,959
I don't know.

674
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,598
-What?
-Even if I were you…

675
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,502
maybe I would be at a loss of what to do.

676
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,639
But…

677
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,412
it isn't a reason for you
to do something wrong!

678
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,954
There are only two things
that I can say for sure here.

679
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,358
One.

680
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,295
What you did was wrong.

681
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,667
Whatever your reason is,
making light of your life,

682
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,336
choosing death,

683
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,539
and using that as a way
to frame your teacher, is wrong.

684
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,777
What's the other one?

685
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,154
I'm glad that you didn't end up
killing yourself.

686
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,293
I am glad that you're still alive.

687
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,203
There's nothing to be happy about.

688
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,540
Everything is revealed,

689
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,176
reported,

690
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,945
and I'll be criticized on the Internet.

691
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,083
Either way, in the future…

692
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,687
I'm going to go through something
so bad that I'll want to die.

693
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,192
I know I deserve it, but…

694
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,830
Indeed, I think you deserve it.

695
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,868
So, even if it is tough…

696
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,807
you have to make up
for what you did yourself.

697
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,445
Live, make up for it…

698
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,183
and turn over a new leaf.

JOURNALIST SEATING

700
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,033
Reporters, please do me a favor.

701
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,971
If you will report this case,

702
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,308
don't write something
that fans the flames of criticism.

703
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,045
Please write what
the people involved think

704
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,214
and why an incident like this happened.

705
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,952
Please report it accurately as it is.

706
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,122
Unlike a hearing…

707
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,227
nothing can stop social sanction.

708
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,530
Please be considerate

709
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:45,936
and don't let everyone involved
in this case be cornered

710
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,141
by the third party's biased views
and speculations.

711
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,185
For the above reasons,

712
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:05,756
the defense lawyer insists that
the accused, Yosuke Takamatsu…

713
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,093
is innocent.

714
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,069
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

715
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,771
COURTHOUSE

716
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,840
Thank you for your help.

717
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,260
You won and proved
someone's innocence again.

718
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,931
It isn't about winning or losing.

719
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,733
We only revealed the truth.

720
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,704
This time, more people are hurt
as a result.

721
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,007
You warned the reporters,

722
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,643
but many articles
fanned the flames of criticism.

723
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,613
Mr. Kurokawa,

724
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,550
there's only one reason
why social sanction is so extreme.

725
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:12,256
All citizens think that the sentence
by law is too light.

726
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,192
They want severe punishment for evil.

727
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,727
But the severe punishment…

728
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,730
should only be given
if it isn't a false charge.

729
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,636
Reports about workplace bullying
and physical punishment

730
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,806
tend to go too far and this case
is said to have raised a question.

731
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,542
Well, this just happens to be the result.

732
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,178
The lawyer in charge of it
has a strong belief

733
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,113
and has proved the teacher's innocence.

734
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,648
To me, it's enough.

735
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,517
-I'll give him the documents.
-Thank you.

736
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,620
This is impressive.

737
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,655
Mr. Beppu is in a good mood.

738
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,992
He usually hates criminal cases,
but it's good advertisement.

739
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,230
Oh, Miss Wakura, I presume?

740
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:59,703
I have called you many times
for an interview.

741
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,840
I am sorry, but I will not be interviewed.

742
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,242
I heard that he did
something horrible to you.

743
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,411
It's important for the victim
to raise their voice.

744
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,982
I will sue the man myself
when I want to do so.

745
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,286
Moreover, I had already punched him once.

746
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,755
But…

747
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,123
You over there!

748
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,225
You don't want to listen to me anymore?

749
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,193
No, well…

750
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,496
Miss Wakura, you can go back to work.

751
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,631
Excuse me.

00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,003
I'll give this back to you.

754
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,675
I'm just a third party
that isn't involved in this,

755
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,310
so I shouldn't read it.

756
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,446
I think it isn't a problem,

757
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,483
-if Dr. Akiu doesn't mind if you know.
-What?

758
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,286
Mr. Kurokawa, I smell something
burning in your room.

759
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,355
What? That's right!

760
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,491
I was cooking the fish! Oh no! Sorry…

761
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,764
Don't read it when you're having lunch.

762
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,034
Ms. Kinosaki,
you know about this case too?

763
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,602
I am just a third party.

764
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:10,140
Among those we know, Dr. Akiu
was the only person involved.

Haruto.

775
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,906
I'll investigate thoroughly and fight.

<i>Haruto! Haruto!</i>

782
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,690
Isn't it your job to find that someone?

783
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,293
The pain of losing a family member
isn't what you want to experience.

784

Even so, I can't say that
you aren't guilty.
