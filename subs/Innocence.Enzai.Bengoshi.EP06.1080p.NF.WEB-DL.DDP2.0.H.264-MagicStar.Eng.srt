<i>"Touo University Student Murder Case.</i>

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:09,142
<i>A student in Touo University's</i>
<i>Science and Engineering Department</i>

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,312
<i>murdered his girlfriend, a student</i>
<i>in the Literature Department.</i>

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,115
<i>He was arrested and charged by</i>
<i>Yokohama Public Prosecutors' Office.</i>

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>The prosecutor in charge</i>
<i>was Shin Kurokawa."</i>

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,520
That case from back then
still bothers you?

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,888
You haven't changed at all.

9
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,558
<i>"The defense lawyer</i>
<i>was Hoshundo Law Office's lawyer,</i>

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>Hideharu Beppu."</i>

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>He was Mr. Beppu's elder brother.</i>

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,365
He received much criticism
from the public,

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,068
and he passed away because of that.

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,470
VICTIM, AYAKA AKIU

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Involved?</i>

16
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,407
Our positions were different,

17
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,143
but we all share something unpleasant.

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>"The prisoner committed suicide</i>
<i>after he was found guilty."</i>

19
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>Ask Kurokawa if you are curious.</i>

20
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,187
Kurokawa, see you tomorrow.

21
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,289
-See you.
-See you.

22
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,330
Ms. Wakura, will you come with me
after work?

23
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,734
You've been absorbed
in reading the file, right?

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,071
You look like you desperately
want to talk to someone about it.

25
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,972
But Ms. Kinosaki, your son…

26
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,274
So we'll go to my home.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,409
I have to pick my son up
at the nursery school.

28
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,111
Please do the shopping.

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,187
Yes?

30
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,355
-I'm Wakura.
-Come in!

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,057
HONOKA AND HARUTO

32
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,826
Hello. I'm here.

33
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,128
Oh, good evening.

34
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,463
-Come in!
-Okay.

35
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,531
Look, Haruto,

36
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,634
meet Ms. Wakura.
I just told you about her.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,072
Nice to meet you. I'm Kaede Wakura.

38
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,174
Haruto, four years old.

39
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,176
HARUTO KINOSAKI, HONOKA'S SON

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,613
My son is always like this
in front of ladies he likes.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,849
He is adorable.

42
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,953
But I'm telling you,
if you toy with my Haruto,

43
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,954
I won't forgive you.

44
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,723
Toy with him?

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,757
Thanks.

46
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,764
Wow, you love to read? I'm surprised.

47
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,067
"Surprised"? How rude of you.

48
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,170
Well, I read all of them because I had to.

49
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,105
You had to?

50
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,041
My parents succumbed to a disease
when I was in college.

51
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,978
I needed money,
so I started to work as a hostess.

52
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,912
PSYCHOLOGY, CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY

53
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,047
Then I worked
as a manga artist's assistant

54
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,250
and was in charge of managing expenses.

55
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,951
It made me want to be a tax accountant.

56
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,954
Then I married the eldest son
of a farm owner

57
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,823
and took over the family business.

58
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,491
When I gave birth to Haruto,

59
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,595
I found my husband cheating on me
and my mother-in-law bullied me,

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,596
so I got divorced.

61
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,998
I asked Hoshundo Law Office

62
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,867
to help me fight
for the custody of my son.

63
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,069
They said they had a vacancy for a clerk,

64
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,338
so I started working there.

65
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,141
Wow, there have been
so many ups and downs in your life.

66
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,844
Well, everyone has their own past.

67
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,481
In some cases, they don't want
others to mention it.

68
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,351
-Mommy, I'm hungry.
-Okay.

69
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,363
I will tidy up the place later.

70
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,334
We haven't talked
about today's main topic.

71
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,872
Honestly, reading the file
only made me confused.

72
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,308
But the content is simple, right?

73
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,712
The victim of that murder in the past
was Dr. Akiu's younger sister.

74
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,515
Mr. Kurokawa's father
and Mr. Yufuin's partner,

75
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,719
Mr. Beppu's brother,
were involved in the case.

76
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,121
Yeah, that's true, but…

77
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,891
The prisoner killed himself
after he was found guilty.

78
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,629
But he could have been wrongly convicted,

79
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,264
so it still affects everyone involved.

80
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,434
I know Mr. Kurokawa's father
was the prosecutor,

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,370
but isn't it weird
that Mr. Kurokawa insists

82
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,571
on defending falsely charged people?

83
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,907
And Dr. Akiu's sister was the victim,

84
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,376
but he's still helping us.

85
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,912
I don't know what Dr. Akiu really thinks.

86
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,114
We can't be thoughtless
in questioning him either.

87
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,585
But the reason that Mr. Kurokawa
insists on doing this…

88
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,387
is something else.

89
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,556
What is the other reason?

90
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,260
This is ridiculous!

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,307
-Coffee.
-Thank you.

92
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,611
His dad is famous.
No wonder there are so many reporters.

93
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,314
-Someone's coming out.
-Okay.

94
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,286
Hey. Why are you taking photos, jerks?

95
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,621
Hey! Who is letting you take photos?

96
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,390
Don't pull me!

97
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,291
YUYA TARUMAE
SELF-DESCRIBED MUSICIAN

98
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,626
Hey, I didn't do anything!

99
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,095
Let's go.

100
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,563
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

101
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,098
TARUMAE

102
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,300
Hello.

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,636
YOSHINOBU USUTA, TARUMAE'S HOUSEKEEPER

104
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,772
Good morning.

105
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,008
I told you I don't know him at all!

106
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,110
We did different subjects
and we've never met!

107
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,446
Universities for rich boys
are good for nothing.

108
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,281
That's a correct opinion!

109
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,417
-What's going on?
-You are good for nothing too!

110
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,287
The suspect of the fatal shooting
in Shinagawa two months ago

111
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,855
was caught this morning.

112
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,891
He's the son of the owner
of a big company,

113
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,292
Tarumae Property Agency,

114
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,495
and he graduated
from Keishin University, like Isawa.

115
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,598
Ms. Wakura, listen to me.
Mr. Noboribetsu is horrible!

116
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,701
See? You rely on other people right away.

117
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,369
That's why you're good for nothing!

118
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,738
Sorry, I'm not interested.

119
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,409
THE TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT MURDER CASE

120
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,351
Kaede!

121
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,087
What? Haruto?

122
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,390
Come on, Haru. You shouldn't do that.

123
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,959
I'm sorry, I looked away for a bit.

124
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,327
What is going on here?

125
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,397
He got a fever this morning
and took the day off nursery school.

126
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,666
I'm here because I miss you, Kaede!

127
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,767
Yes?

128
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,235
I just heard.

129
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,171
Haru fell in love with you
when he saw you yesterday

130
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,073
and he wants to marry you.

131
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,944
He proposed to me in the morning?

132
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,580
But you have to start
from being friends with her.

133
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,748
-Friends?
-Yes.

134
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,319
Use your cuteness to make
a rigid girl fall in love with you.

135
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,987
All right, then.

136
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,523
I will let Kurokawa be in charge
of the case.

137
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,259
Okay. Goodbye.

138
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,662
Blimey!

139
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,867
Sorry for the trouble.

140
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,669
It's no trouble at all. There you go.

141
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,873
-Get well soon, Haru.
-Okay.

142
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,110
Kurokawa and Ms. Wakura, come with me.

143
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,612
-Okay.
-Okay.

144
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,483
I just got a call and it was
a request for criminal defense.

145
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,686
Yes? You accepted a request
for criminal defense?

146
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,123
It was made by the CEO
of one of our client companies.

147
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,794
Cases you were in charge of
were reported in the news lately, right?

148
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,431
He wants you to prove his son's innocence
and I couldn't say no.

149
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,532
What case is it?

150
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,801
It's the fatal shooting in Shinagawa.

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,910
MAIN TITLE

152
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,412
It's your job to make me innocent, idiot.

153
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,681
I will investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

154
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,082
Is it true Haru was kidnapped?

155
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,417
-Hey…
-Haruto! Where are you?

156
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,053
The pain of losing a family member is
something you'd never want to experience.

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,755
Can you hear my voice?

158
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,657
This is what he is!

159
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,925
Defendant!

160
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:39,826
KEEP OUT

161
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,763
<i>The incident happened</i>
<i>on December 19, 2018.</i>

162
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,200
<i>In an empty warehouse in Shinagawa</i>
<i>owned by Tarumae Property Agency,</i>

163
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,502
<i>the body of someone shot dead</i>
<i>by a gun was found.</i>

164
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,770
<i>From his belongings,</i>

165
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,007
<i>he was identified as 26-year-old</i>
<i>Akira Niijima, a part-time worker.</i>

166
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,977
<i>The estimated time of death was between</i>
<i>two to three p.m. on the same day.</i>

167
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,847
<i>The police thinks the suspect</i>
<i>was Yuya Tarumae,</i>

168
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,615
<i>Akira's university friend</i>

169
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,518
<i>and the only son</i>
<i>of Tarumae Property Agency's CEO.</i>

170
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,420
<i>In the suspect's bedroom,</i>

171
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,690
<i>a lethal weapon,</i>
<i>an illegally modified airgun, was found.</i>

172
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,526
You currently deny the charges,
am I right?

173
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,096
Of course, because I didn't kill him.

174
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,365
But the modified airgun--

175
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,101
Hey, go on a date with me.

176
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,103
You are exactly my type.

177
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,941
Another man just proposed to me
the other day.

178
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,182
Anyway, regarding this case--

179
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,316
I told you.

180
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,987
I have no reason to kill Akira.

181
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,723
Where were you on the 19th of December,
when the murder happened?

182
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,791
I was in my room the whole day.

183
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,794
I had been drinking, sleeping on and off.

184
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,531
Oh, and that too.

185
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,233
I had an urge to write something.

186
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,234
Write something?

187
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,036
I'm a musician.

188
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,239
Around two to three p.m.,
when Akira was killed,

189
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,009
I'm sure that I was playing the bass
in my room.

190
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,446
Is there anybody who can prove that?

191
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,586
Isn't it your job to find that "someone"?

192
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,989
My dad told me.

193
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,227
You can prove any bad guy innocent
by saying it's a false charge

194
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,429
and you're a skillful lawyer.

195
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,332
I doubt it.

196
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,505
Someone innocent is arrested here…

197
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,608
so just solve the problem quickly.

198
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,282
Mr. Tarumae, I'll ask you one last time.

199
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,421
Did you really not kill Akira Niijima?

200
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,058
I already told you that I didn't kill him.

201
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,494
Well, even if I had killed him,

202
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,398
it's your job to make me innocent, idiot.

203
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,434
-You--
-All right, then.

204
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,138
I will investigate thoroughly
and defend you.

205
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,889
Excuse me.

206
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,692
This is Mr. Yuya's bedroom.

207
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,328
Wow, it's the Mason model!

208
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,064
It costs about 500,000 yen, right?

209
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,667
I'd like to ask something
about the day of the murder.

210
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,802
Were you here on that day too?

211
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,905
Yes, I'm a live-in housekeeper.

212
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,576
Between two to three p.m.,
when Niijima was murdered,

213
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,511
did you see Mr. Yuya?

214
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,382
No, Mr. Yuya shut himself
in his room the whole day.

215
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,385
But was the sound of his bass noisy?

216
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,454
The room doesn't seem to be soundproof.

217
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,456
I think it must be pretty loud.

218
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,627
<i>Yes, we get complaints from</i>
<i>the neighbors from time to time.</i>

219
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,299
We asked to talk
to President Tarumae as well.

220
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,902
President Tarumae is busy
because of this case.

221
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,805
He told me to be in charge of this.

222
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,941
I will go make you some tea.

223
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,181
Maybe even his father has given up on him.

224
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,716
Yes, maybe.

225
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,319
I asked my college friends about Tarumae.

226
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,388
They said he had caused problems
back then too.

227
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,524
-Problems?
-It's a rumor,

228
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,959
but he assaulted many girls
in the club he joined.

229
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,134
You are the mother of the victim,
Akira Niijima?

230
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,035
Yes.

231
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,207
I heard that your firm's lawyer
is the case's defense lawyer.

232
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,475
Here you go.

233
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,380
So, how can we help you?

234
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,552
Please do not defend Yuya Tarumae.

235
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,923
There's no doubt that
that guy murdered my son.

236
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,625
Do you have any proof?

237
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:10,296
My son had been hanging out
and causing trouble

238
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,832
with Tarumae since they were in college.

239
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,403
It seems that he had been using this
to demand money from Tarumae.

240
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,874
Tarumae's father covered this up,
so it won't cause any stir.

241
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,709
"Sexual assault"?

242
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,746
He used this to blackmail Tarumae,

243
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,548
so Tarumae killed him for revenge?

244
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,985
But according to what you said,

245
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,388
your son was his accomplice.

246
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,291
In that case,
he couldn't blackmail Tarumae--

247
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:44,029
It's true that it caused trouble,
and no doubt Tarumae killed my son!

248
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,398
Is it necessary to defend that murderer?

249
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,903
We're back.

250
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,438
Mr. Kurokawa.

251
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,373
A visitor?

252
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,310
She is this case's…

253
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,912
Welcome back, Taku!

254
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,447
Oh, Haru, I'm back.

255
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,949
Haru, we are working now.

256
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,317
The boy is adorable.

257
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,319
How old is he?

258
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,590
Haruto Kinosaki, four years old.

259
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,325
Yeah?

260
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,830
Sorry for coming without an appointment.
I'll go now.

261
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,067
Taku, play with me!

262
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,503
Okay, let's play. What should we do?

263
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,871
Sorry…

264
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,448
<i>October 2.</i>
<i>The idiot is making noise today too.</i>

265
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,119
As I thought, it is pretty loud.

266
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,954
But all the neighbors said

267
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,758
they did not hear the bass
on the day of the murder.

268
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,828
The housekeeper, Mr. Usuta,
said he heard it.

269
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:49,962
Did he lie to us?

270
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,699
Anyway, the guy's reputation is horrible.

271
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,768
Not only does he make noises

272
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,370
but someone even saw him
shooting animals with his airgun.

273
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,605
He abuses animals?

274
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,241
His mother died
when he was in middle school

275
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,077
and his father
has been ignoring him as well.

276
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,647
I'm not surprised
that he became a delinquent.

277
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,516
He's free to be a delinquent,

278
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,085
but that's not an excuse to kill someone.

279
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,553
And what he did in university too.

280
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,822
You mean what he did in the club?

281
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,625
I've heard something here and there.

282
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,996
The victim's mother said that
it was the motive to kill the victim.

283
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,764
You met the victim's mother?

284
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,967
She came to our office.

285
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,635
I see.

286
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,540
She totally refused
to be interviewed by the press.

287
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,777
She said they had nothing to do
with the case.

288
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,617
-Hello.
-Hello.

289
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,385
Hello, Yuki.

290
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,354
Has Haruto recovered from his cold?

291
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,223
Yeah, he's too energetic now. Right?

292
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,793
I'll race you there!

293
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,930
Do you know the supermarket there
holds a bargain sale today?

294
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,866
-I had no idea.
-The eggs are cheap.

295
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,102
Wait, I just bought some yesterday.

296
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,640
COURTHOUSE

297
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,410
The first hearing will be
three days later. Is that okay?

298
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,113
-Yes.
-All right.

299
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,282
FIRST WITNESS, YOSHINOBU USUTA

300
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,453
Mr. Kurokawa.

301
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:22,955
Yes?

302
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,259
I had no idea that you were going to prove
that he wasn't the murderer.

303
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,630
And your witness
is the suspect's housekeeper?

304
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,531
What do you mean?

305
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,899
That man, Usuta,

306
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,835
claimed that he was in the house
on the day of the murder,

307
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,504
but he actually went out.

308
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,040
The suspect told him to do some shopping.

309
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,177
<i>When he returned by taxi with items</i>
<i>he bought from many shops,</i>

310
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,613
<i>he was seen by the neighbors.</i>

311
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,450
He went out around one to four p.m.

312
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,586
In other words, there was enough time

313
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,723
for the suspect to go out
and kill the victim.

314
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,860
It's safer to plead
extenuating circumstances instead.

315
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,030
I have to respect my client's will

316
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,366
and I haven't found out everything yet.

317
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,703
Excuse me.

318
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,839
Mr. Kurokawa.

319
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,578
This case wasn't an accident
caused by natural phenomena

320
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,180
and it wasn't suicide.

321
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,582
It obviously was a murder.

322
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,050
There must be a murderer.

323
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,586
Looking at the evidence,

324
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,955
it's obvious that Yuya Tarumae
was the murderer.

325
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,359
Yet, do you still think that
claiming his innocence is justice?

326
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,097
I do not defend
for the suspect or justice.

327
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,566
I only want to know the truth.

328
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,535
I'll check everything I can

329
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,905
to judge whether it really is
the truth of the case or not.

330
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,477
The way you think is dangerous.

331
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,645
Excuse me.

332
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,688
Oh, I have to go now.

333
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,056
Haru!

334
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,594
Yuki, where is Haruto?

335
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,029
I don't know.

336
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,830
Haru!

337
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,199
Haruto!

338
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,301
Where are you?

339
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,304
Haruto!

340
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,276
Haruto?

341
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,579
Is it true Haru was kidnapped?

342
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,348
Someone sent a threatening letter?

343
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,549
We just received it.

344
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,686
"If the man who deserves punishment
isn't punished,

345
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,221
the boy will die."

346
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,456
Oh no.

347
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,625
I just called the police.

348
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,195
But why is Kinosaki's son kidnapped
because of this case?

349
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,396
Could it be…

350
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:45,964
What's the matter?

351
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,133
The address of the victim, Akira Niijima!

352
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,402
His mother came here
to tell us not to defend Tarumae.

353
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,970
Haru was at the office.

354
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,006
Please let me check inside!

355
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,641
Cut it out! Or I'll call the police!

356
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,809
Haruto!

357
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,578
Ms. Kinosaki? Please calm down.

358
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,914
We're from Toshima Police Station.
We'd like to talk to you.

359
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,849
What the heck?

360
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,750
Haruto!

361
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,086
-Hey…
-Haruto! Where are you?

362
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,988
Haruto! Haruto!

363
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,761
My wife has been lying in bed
since our son was killed.

364
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,596
Don't do something inappropriate!

365
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,732
No doubt my son was killed by that guy.

366
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,635
Who is it?

367
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,105
It isn't her.

368
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,615
THE BOY WILL DIE

369
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,990
Who'd have thought
that it was someone else?

370
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,495
It's the second email
sent by the kidnapper.

371
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,429
I WON'T ALLOW KUROKAWA TO DEFEND ANYONE

372
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,330
THE BOY WILL DIE IF YOU DISOBEY ME

373
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,967
The police said that it could also
be harassment

374
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,369
towards Kurokawa himself.

375
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,671
What should we do about the defense?

376
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,674
What else can we do?
We have to drop the case.

377
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,645
Exactly. Even if we defend Tarumae,
the chance we'll win is very small.

378
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,482
That's true. I'll tell Mr. Tarumae
that we'll drop the case.

379
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,818
Please do it a bit later.

380
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,819
Mr. Kurokawa?

381
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,088
The first hearing is three days later.

382
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,323
I'll do something before that.

383
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,425
-Do something?
-Anyway.

384
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,961
Let me stick to it until we can't.

385
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,364
Please.

386
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,135
Mr. Kurokawa!

387
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,405
The kidnapper told us not to do anything!

388
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,574
Haruto is in danger!

389
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,342
Why do you insist on doing this?

390
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,513
I don't understand.

391
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,663
We're looking for witness information
about a woman and a boy in Tokyo.

392
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,266
Please rest so you can take action
when necessary.

393
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,302
Thank you, sir.

394
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,741
You know…

395
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,680
I was going to run away…

396
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,849
from being Haruto's mother.

397
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,518
Yes?

398
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,020
At that time,

399
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:28,594
I had been irritated
by Haruto's naughty behavior.

400
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,098
It was so tough to be a single mother

401
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,869
and my ex-husband told me
that he wanted to live with Haruto.

402
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,406
When I started working at Hoshundo

403
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,209
and aimed to be a lawyer…

404
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,348
Haruto's classmates said something to him.

405
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,454
They said lawyers
were the bad guys' friends.

406
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,025
And Haruto said he hated me.

407
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,895
<i>At that time, Haruto had a fever.</i>

408
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,133
Aren't lawyers the bad guys' friends?

409
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,235
Gosh, Haru.

410
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,073
We aren't the bad guys' friends.

411
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,645
A lawyer's job is to check
whether the guy is really bad or not.

412
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,580
So, you're a hero?

413
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,617
We take the side of the truth, I think?

414
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,821
For example, you whine
to your mommy sometimes,

415
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,525
but it doesn't make you a bad boy,
and you love your mommy, right?

416
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,295
Yeah.

417
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,764
And that's the truth.

418
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,901
After listening to Mr. Kurokawa,

419
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,837
I understood something too.

420
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,045
I want to stay with Haruto.

421
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,548
I don't want to leave him.

422
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,583
And that…

423
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,488
was the truth about me.

424
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,595
Yet, I…

425
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,948
Haruto.

426
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,690
What should I do?

427
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,551
Two more people.

428
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,686
Hirayama.

429
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,422
I'm Hoshundo Law Office's lawyer.

430
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,790
My name is Noboribetsu.

431
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,626
Ms. Wakura.

432
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,396
The whole office
will look for Haruto today.

433
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,964
-Look for Haruto?
-Yes.

434
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,867
Isawa is looking
for the members of the club

435
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,836
Tarumae and Niijima joined.

436
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,939
We're using the magazine that
the woman brought here as our clue.

437
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,474
Because of the murder,

438
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,912
many on the Internet are talking
about what they did back in college.

439
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,249
Their names had not been reported
in the past,

440
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,584
but the woman knew their names.

441
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,586
That means she was involved?

442
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,056
Judging by her age, she's probably
related to one of the victims.

443
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,360
This is what Kurokawa realized.

444
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,729
Besides the case,

445
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,732
he surely hasn't given up
on looking for Haruto.

446
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,202
Excuse me. Would someone go see Dr. Akiu?

447
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,005
-He has the result of the analysis I want.
-Analysis?

448
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,442
Yes. I think I'd better not step
out of the office.

449
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,410
I'll go for you, then.

450
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,213
Thank you.

451
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:14,019
<i>October 2. The idiot</i>
<i>is making noise today too.</i>

452
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,490
The home of the person
who took the video is here

453
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,593
and the police went to interview
people who live in this area.

454
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,229
All the residents said
that they didn't hear the bass

455
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,564
on the day of the murder.

456
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,333
But they only said what they remembered.

457
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,936
If the volume was the same as the tape's,

458
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,539
the sound would at least
travel to as far as this area.

459
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,677
Okay.

460
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,513
I'll look in this area
to see if there's anyone

461
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,182
who recorded video or sound
on the day of the murder.

462
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,618
Have you found Ms. Kinosaki's son?

463
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,120
We're looking for clues now.

464
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,924
The pain of losing a family member
in a case

465
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,860
is something
you'd never want to experience.

466
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,364
I read the document about that case.

467
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,001
Your sister was a student
in Touo University?

468
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,138
We have no time
to talk about the past now.

469
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,041
Thanks for waiting.

470
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,109
ONE DAY BEFORE FIRST HEARING

471
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,478
I'd like to ask
about this article you wrote.

472
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,815
Oh, this is pretty horrible.

473
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,416
I had collected some materials,

474
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,186
but the gang rapist's dad pressured me.

475
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,656
This is the part
I would like to check with you.

476
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,891
A STUDENT KILLED HERSELF
BECAUSE OF THE SHOCK

477
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,560
Do you know the name
of the student who killed herself?

478
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,132
Excuse me.

479
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,135
What are you filming with the camera?

480
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,737
It's my hobby.

481
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,606
Wild birds fly to this area,

482
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:45,510
so I keep the camera on
the whole day every day.

483
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,080
Mr. Kurokawa, I found it!

484
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,416
-Haruto?
-Oh, not him.

485
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,819
It's a video with the sound
of the bass on the day of the murder.

486
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,720
Oh, that.

487
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,156
-What? Really?
-Yes.

488
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,792
The camera at this house caught it.

489
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,596
If it was heard here,
no doubt the neighbors heard it too.

490
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,567
But I don't get why they all said
they didn't hear it.

491
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,535
There must be a reason.

492
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,870
We'll find out if we do some more digging.

493
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,542
Why did you not deny the possibility
of it being a false charge?

494
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,177
Tarumae is clearly suspicious.

495
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,981
It was strange that
the circumstantial evidence was perfect.

496
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,083
If he really was the murderer,

497
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,919
he would have done something to hide it.

498
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,189
He didn't get rid of the gun
and the shoes he wore to the warehouse.

499
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,425
They were found at his home,
and that's unnatural.

500
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,260
Who killed Niijima then?

501
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,134
-Hello. Kurokawa speaking.
-<i>It's Arima.</i>

502
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,536
I found out a lot of things

503
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,539
about the people who bear a grudge
towards Tarumae and Niijima.

504
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,608
Really? Even where Haru is?

505
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,846
Sorry, there's construction work
and I can't hear you.

506
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,047
Construction?

507
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,952
<i>Mr. Yuya shut himself</i>
<i>in his room the whole day.</i>

508
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,823
<i>But all the neighbors said</i>
<i>they didn't hear the bass.</i>

509
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,361
Mr. Kurokawa? What's the matter?

510
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,331
TARUMAE'S HOUSE

511
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,066
I see.

512
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,737
Could it be…

513
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,108
-Mr. Kurokawa, don't go out!
-That's right!

514
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,044
Anyway, I'll call Dr. Akiu first.

515
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,646
-No…
-Wait…

516
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,748
-And Haru…
-Calm down!

517
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,282
-And…
-Calm down!

518
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,917
Okay.

519
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,119
Thank you.

520
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,488
The hostage's life is at risk.

521
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,056
Goodbye.

522
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,827
The police is going there now
with Kinosaki.

523
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,498
They will definitely make it in time.

524
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,806
Your Honor,
it's time to start the hearing.

525
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,778
Well, we cannot get hold
of the defense lawyer.

526
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,816
Sorry, we're late.

527
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,952
Please start the hearing as scheduled.

528
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,855
<i>December 26.</i>

529
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,425
<i>Today it's the construction work</i>
<i>and the bass together!</i>

530
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,062
<i>I really wish the stupid boy were dead!</i>

531
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,765
<i>Idiot! You suck at it!</i>

532
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,702
Hey, how dare you say I'm an idiot,
you jerk!

533
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,570
Defendant, please don't speak.

534
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,107
You live opposite the defendant's house

535
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,077
and you film it every time
you hear him play the bass?

536
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:36,715
Yes, I keep all of them
as evidence of the noise he makes.

537
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,284
On the day of the murder,

538
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,053
December 19, around two to three p.m.…

539
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,757
I didn't film anything that day.

540
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,526
Because I didn't hear
the sound of his bass.

541
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,361
I see.

542
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,531
In the video just now, we heard
the sound of the construction work.

543
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,202
Was it also carried out
on the day of the murder?

544
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,474
Yes. I think I heard the sound
of the construction work.

545
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,476
Did it sound like this?

546
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,385
Yes, indeed. That's the sound.

547
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,255
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

548
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,824
I've finished my questions.

549
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,041
Police.

550
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,480
I see.

551
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,017
You found me.

552
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,358
Haruto!

553
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,592
Mommy!

554
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,097
Haruto.

555
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,266
Mommy.

556
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,735
Haruto.

557
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,944
Mrs. Yoriko Maruyama?

558
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,179
You are caught red-handed

559
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,981
and you're under arrest
for kidnapping of minors.

560
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,954
Please…

561
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,257
Do me a favor.

562
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,629
Okay, I'll tell them at once.

563
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,809
Great!

564
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,544
What's the matter, defendant?

565
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,580
Nothing.

566
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,615
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,719
Now, please have a look at this.

568
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,656
DEFENSE EVIDENCE NUMBER 48

569
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,960
The house is 30 meter away
from the defendant's

570
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,163
and the video was taken by a camera
set to observe wild birds.

571
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,732
As you've heard, it's faint,

572
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,134
but you can hear the sound
of the bass the defendant plays.

573
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,673
And this… was taken at the same time
the murder was committed.

574
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,141
This is absurd.

575
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,446
The home of the witness just now
is ten meters away from the defendant's.

576
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,147
It wasn't heard there. Why--

577
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,784
We're granted special permission
to re-enact the video,

578
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,419
defense evidence number 48.

579
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,257
The expert witness, Dr. Akiu,
will explain this.

580
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,525
Dr. Akiu,

581
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,396
what is the reason
that something like this happens?

582
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,532
This can be explained
by a certain phenomenon.

583
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,668
It's possible to re-enact it here.

584
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,071
I would like Your Honor,
lay judges, and the public prosecutor

585
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,307
to experience this.

586
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,342
Experience? Experience what?

587
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,610
Please stand there.

588
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,523
Okay.

589
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,226
Everyone, can you hear my voice?

590
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,728
If you can, please raise your hand.

591
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,897
Can you hear my voice?

592
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,266
If you can, please raise your hand.

593
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,736
Okay, let's continue.

594
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,105
I'll ask again.

595
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,309
Everyone, can you hear my voice?

596
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,212
Can you hear my voice?

597
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,315
If you can…

598
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,869
Public Prosecutor,
could you hear my voice?

599
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,073
I couldn't after some time.

600
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,446
This phenomenon is caused
by human auditory characteristics.

601
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,916
The human ear picks up sounds
of higher frequencies

602
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,119
more easily than lower frequencies.

603
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,355
<i>The lawyer was wearing a mask.</i>

604
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,458
<i>This lowered the frequency</i>
<i>of the sound of his voice</i>

605
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,995
<i>and we played a higher frequency sound</i>
<i>with the speaker behind.</i>

606
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,331
<i>The sound from the speaker</i>
<i>couldn't reach the panel of judges,</i>

607
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,899
<i>so they could hear the lawyer,</i>

608
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,102
<i>but the sound could reach</i>
<i>the public prosecutor,</i>

609
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,371
<i>so it made him unable to hear</i>
<i>the lawyer's voice.</i>

610
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:31,209
This phenomenon also occurred around
the area of the defendant's house.

611
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,044
On the day of the murder,

612
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,380
construction work was carried out here.

613
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,015
An asphalt cutter was used

614
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,218
and the machine emits
a high-frequency sound.

615
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,688
This is the area
that the sound could travel.

616
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,693
And the sound of the bass
played by the defendant

617
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,927
could travel in this area.

618
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,399
In the overlapping area,
due to our auditory perception,

619
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,968
people would hear the high-frequency sound
of the machine.

620
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,472
Therefore, they couldn't hear
the low-frequency sound of the bass.

621
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,841
This is the reason

622
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,811
that the sound of the bass
reached a house 30 meters away

623
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,915
but residents of the houses nearer
didn't hear it on the day of the murder.

624
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,085
That's the end of the experiment.

625
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,589
CROSS EXAMINATION OF DEFENSE WITNESS

626
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,490
Mr. Usuta.

627
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,493
As shown in the experiment,

628
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,365
we can prove that the defendant
was home at the time of the murder.

629
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,434
However,

630
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,936
this raises another problem.

631
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,472
Yes?

632
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,974
The airgun used to kill the victim

633
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,576
and the shoes worn at the crime scene

634
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,947
must have been taken out
by someone other than the defendant.

635
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:49,320
And only very few people could do that.

636
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,289
Hey.

637
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:53,991
Don't tell me…

638
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,629
Mr. Usuta, you started working
at the defendant's home

639
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,031
five years ago.

640
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,233
Eight years ago,

641
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,369
you had a wife, whom you had divorced,

642
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,605
and a daughter as well, right?

643
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,143
Your daughter, Ms. Yuki Maruyama…

644
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,514
ended her own life for some reason,
while still in college.

645
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:22,320
Your Honor, the lawyer's question
is not related to this case.

646
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,715
I confess.

647
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,286
I killed Akira Niijima.

648
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,790
What?

649
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,828
Hey, Usuta. Why did you do that, jerk?

650
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,865
You should remember
what you did back in college.

651
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,204
Mr. Usuta is the father
of one of the victims.

652
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,673
What?

653
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,476
I…

654
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,380
When my daughter was in middle school,

655
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,283
my business failed and I got divorced.

656
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,021
I was told that…

657
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:35,793
my daughter suddenly killed herself
in her second year in university.

658
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,398
My ex-wife, Yoriko, told me

659
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,867
<i>that two students at her university,</i>

660
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,472
<i>Akira Niijima and Yuya Tarumae,</i>
<i>assaulted her.</i>

661
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,778
<i>She was in agony because of that</i>
<i>and killed herself.</i>

662
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,885
I couldn't forgive them, no matter what.

663
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,889
That's why I…

664
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,058
You went to work at Tarumae's house…

665
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,628
and waited for a chance?

666
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,431
Then, on that day…

667
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,170
<i>you used shopping as an excuse</i>
<i>to go out to kill Niijima</i>

668
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,373
<i>and asked your ex-wife,</i>
<i>your accomplice, to buy the things.</i>

669
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,309
<i>Then you arranged everything</i>

670
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,778
<i>to put the blame on the defendant.</i>

671
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,683
You chose Tarumae Property Agency's
empty warehouse to kill him

672
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,487
because it was where the club
gathered at that time.

673
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,122
Am I right?

674
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,860
Yes, you're right.

675
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,864
The place where my daughter was assaulted…

676
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,567
was also in that warehouse.

677
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,841
But in that case,
why did you only kill Niijima

678
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,543
and put the blame on the defendant?

679
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,446
I found this out after I started working
at Tarumae's house.

680
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,851
The main culprit was Niijima,

681
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,552
and Yuya…

682
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,892
he obeyed everything Niijima said

683
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,927
and was only his cash cow, so I--

684
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,996
Don't be ridiculous.

685
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,767
Your daughter decided to die herself
and she brought me trouble!

686
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,934
You scum!

687
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,202
Defendant!

688
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,671
Defendant.

689
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,739
-Be quiet.
-What?

690
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,451
This is what he is!

691
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,256
Mr. Kurokawa…

692
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,897
did you become a lawyer
to help scums like him?

693
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,736
The neighbors couldn't hear
the sound of the bass.

694
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,306
It was really just a coincidence.

695
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:05,976
I thought…

696
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:14,819
Yuki was helping us
avenge her death in Heaven.

697
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,889
And yet you…

698
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,469
I am very sorry.

699
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,046
It is not hard to imagine…

700
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,649
the resentment you both feel.

701
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,691
If they had been properly punished by law…

702
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,264
for what they did to your daughter…

703
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:12,743
maybe it wouldn't have driven you
to a breaking point.

704
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,818
But even so…

705
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,491
he did not kill the victim.

706
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,128
And…

707
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,265
this is the truth of the murder.

708
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,501
Exactly.

709
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,937
I didn't kill him!

710
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,138
Defendant!

711
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,676
But I can't say that you aren't guilty.

712
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,024
Your Honor.

713
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,295
Lay judges.

714
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,834
For the above reasons…

715
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:15,606
the defense lawyer claims
that the defendant, Yuya Tarumae…

716
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,015
on the charge of murder only…

717
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,255
is innocent.

718
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,672
Haruto! Thank goodness you're okay!

719
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:01,452
Mommy, the lady was very nice to me.

720
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,419
Was she?

721
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,222
She kept saying sorry.

722
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,060
She said her daughter died
because of some bad guys

723
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,296
and she did it to get rid of them.

724
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,239
Wait a minute!

725
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:32,016
We have brought you all a lot of trouble.

726
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,419
We are really sorry.

727
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,088
I cannot forgive you…

728
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,558
for getting my son involved.

729
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,193
But…

730
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,897
as a parent…

731
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,267
how you feel…

732
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,604
No, you don't have to know.

733
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,041
You don't need to know how a parent feels

734
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,377
when someone killed their child.

735
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,016
Please…

736
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,620
give him a lot of love.

737
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:16,794
Give him the love that
we couldn't give our daughter.

738
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,002
Sure.

739
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,739
I will.

740
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,244
Goodbye, ma'am.

741
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,402
SUSPECT OF FATAL SHOOTING
WAS FOUND INNOCENT

742
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,339
Thank goodness we found Haruto unharmed.

743
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,075
The guy was falsely charged of murder,

744
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,646
but he doesn't feel guilty at all,
and I'm not happy about it.

745
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,514
He violated
the Firearm and Sword Control Law.

746
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:14,518
Also, the ladies he assaulted
are going to sue him.

747
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,455
Of course, Mr. Beppu
can't agree to defend him too.

748
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,091
I'm afraid I have to say no.

749
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,693
Why?

750
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,129
Because he isn't falsely charged.

751
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,534
Blimey!

752
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,003
Why did you take the effort to come?

753
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,706
I'd like to listen
to the rest of the past.

754
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,343
What was he like?

755
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,845
The person that your sister…

756
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,416
The murderer that she was seeing?

757
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,655
The reason that Mr. Kurokawa insists
on doing this…

758
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,357
is something else.

759
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,160
What is the other reason?

760
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,430
The murderer was…

761
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,033
Mr. Kurokawa's childhood friend.

762
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,410
His body build is very much
like Kurokawa's current one.

763
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,312
CRIMINAL LAW JOURNAL

764
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,850
I can't really remember this guy's face.

765
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,999
THE DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

766
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,569
<i>It's the commonly-called</i>
<i>Oume Casanova Murder Case.</i>

767
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,204
I didn't do it.

768
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,506
<i>As a lawyer, he is branded as a failure.</i>

769
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,874
You should take off the badge.

770
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,410
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

771
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,446
<i>He risks his life to do</i>
<i>an experiment to find out the truth.</i>

772
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,014
<i>Mr. Kurokawa!</i>

773
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,683
I'll investigate thoroughly…

774
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,886
If you think you can't win,
I'll look for someone more skillful.

775
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:56,820
His will?

776
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,789
<i>She killed him for his money?</i>

777
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,791
<i>I wonder what I'm trying to investigate.</i>

778
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,660
Your life as a lawyer is really over.

779
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,963
Marina, I want you to be saved!
