1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,338
What was he like?
The person who your sister…

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,042
The murderer that she was seeing?

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,645
<i>There's another reason why</i>
<i>Mr. Kurokawa insists on doing this.</i>

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,481
The murderer was…

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,051
Mr. Kurokawa's childhood friend.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,355
Daisuke Asama.

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,323
That's the only photo

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,528
that I took with him
and my late sister, Ayaka, together.

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,498
This is Mr. Kurokawa's…

10
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,468
Kurokawa said to me,

11
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,039
"The murderer should be someone else.

12
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:44,177
I think Asama
was wrongly convicted of murder."

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,647
What did you do then?

14
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,918
-I punched him.
-Yes?

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,521
He said "should be" and "I think".

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,756
The groundless, optimistic
observation made me angry.

17
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,928
I'm a scientist and the victim's family.

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,598
Why do you help Mr. Kurokawa, then?

19
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,867
Isn't it because you also think

20
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,072
that Asama was wrongly convicted in
your sister's case?

21
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,176
I didn't want to see his face,
so I blacked it out.

22
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,981
I should've thrown away the photo,
but I still have it.

23
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,918
I don't know why myself.

24
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:33,726
It's groundless slander to say that
I killed my husband.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,895
Why would I do that?

26
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:39,766
So this was, as you claimed,

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,802
the result of a murder-suicide
committed by your late husband?

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,204
Yes.

29
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,307
I tried to run away,

30
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,743
but my husband forced me
to take the sleeping pills and he…

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,081
Excuse me.

32
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,088
What? You're being interviewed?

33
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,658
-What are you doing suddenly?
-Anyway, stop recording.

34
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,929
We got a warrant to arrest you,
Mrs. Marina Norikura.

35
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,231
MURDER

36
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,036
What?

37
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,506
Did you find any evidence?

38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,042
We'll take our time to talk
when we question you.

39
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,512
Hey! Stop the camera!

40
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,414
Sir, can I smoke when you question me?

41
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,483
Of course you can't.

42
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,086
I'll smoke just one, then.

43
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,622
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

44
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,157
Mr. Yufuin, she asked you to defend her?

45
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,126
-The wife of Oume's Casanova?
-Yes.

46
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,795
He was Oume's rich man
who died last year, right?

47
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,665
Yeah, but why was he called Casanova?

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,269
He owned a local company
and was well known for being a womanizer.

49
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,705
His wife was arrested
and everyone is talking about it.

50
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,607
Look at her cocky attitude.

51
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,977
<i>What? Did you find any evidence?</i>

52
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,045
THE MOMENT THE WIFE
OF OUME'S CASANOVA WAS ARRESTED

53
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,581
<i>We'll take our time to talk</i>
<i>when we question you.</i>

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,217
<i>Hey! Stop the camera!</i>

55
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,319
<i>Sir, can I smoke when you question me?</i>

56
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,123
Well, she married him for money
and they had a huge age gap,

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
so she must've killed him.

58
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,333
Casanova died at 70 years old
and his wife is 24 years old.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,868
Twenty-four years old.

60
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,872
It's like Mr. Yufuin and Miss Wakura
getting married.

61
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,806
What?

62
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,611
But why does she want you to defend her?

63
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,346
Mr. Yufuin, do you know her?

64
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,115
No, I don't know her at all.

65
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,183
What?

66
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,088
But I had worked on a case that
her late husband was involved in.

67
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,124
-You mean the victim, Casanova?
-Yes.

68
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,028
Come on. Stop wasting time and go to work!

69
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,363
-Hirayama!
-Yes!

70
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,133
Although she asked for you,
don't overwork yourself.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,469
Mr. Yufuin, you aren't young anymore.

72
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,173
Kurokawa will give me his assistance.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,442
I will go to have an interview
with her now.

74
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,278
Strength matters when you
work on a criminal defense case.

75
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,647
Miss Wakura, if necessary,
you'll take over--

76
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,082
Ouch! Ow…

77
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,850
Mr. Yufuin! What's wrong?

78
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,654
I was trying to get myself fired up,

79
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,690
then I hurt my back.

80
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,627
-Strained back?
-At a time like this?

81
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,694
-Are you okay?
-Ow…

82
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,565
Sorry! Oh no… Mr. Yufuin,
put your arm around my shoulders.

83
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,001
-Ow…
-Oh, I'm sorry…

84
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,174
I didn't do it.

85
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,577
<i>Even if you're sure</i>
<i>the defendant is lying,</i>

86
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,013
<i>you still claim they're innocent.</i>

87
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,014
If you cannot do that,

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,715
<i>you'd better take the badge off.</i>

89
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,318
<i>I wonder what I am</i>
<i>trying to investigate now.</i>

90
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,686
<i>Mr. Kurokawa!</i>

91
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,955
I want you to be saved!

92
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,092
<i>This incident happened on</i>
<i>the 22nd of December 2018,</i>

93
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,827
<i>at 3:45 a.m.,</i>

94
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,830
<i>in the home of the wealthy</i>
<i>Gonzaburo Norikura.</i>

95
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,769
<i>Housekeeper Nobue Towada came out of her</i>
<i>bedroom and came upon Norikura's wife,</i>

96
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,203
-What happened?
-<i>Marina, who collapsed.</i>

97
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,538
What's the matter?

98
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,539
MARINA NORIKURA, SUSPECT

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,775
He…

100
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,979
He burned some briquettes…

101
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,549
Is Master Norikura still inside?

102
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,251
No! If you go in now…

103
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,886
Master Norikura?

104
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,189
Master Norikura? Master Norikura…

105
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,859
<i>Norikura</i>

106
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,028
<i>died of carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

107
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,797
I'm from the Tokyo Fire Department.

108
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,967
<i>Marina and Nobue had mild poisoning</i>
<i>symptoms and were sent to hospital.</i>

109
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,304
Are you okay? Are you okay?

110
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,272
GONZABURO NORIKURA
VICTIM

111
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,075
<i>Marina claims that her husband</i>
<i>tried to commit a murder-suicide,</i>

112
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,277
<i>but the police suspect</i>
<i>that it was a murder</i>

113
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,280
<i>and arrested Marina</i>
<i>two months after the incident.</i>

114
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,886
So, about the reason
the police had suspected you--

115
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,289
-I want to smoke!
-Pardon?

116
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,227
Will you ask the detective?
Tell him to let me smoke.

117
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,895
We can't do that.

118
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,497
Anyway, Mrs. Norikura.

119
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,431
Call me Marina.

120
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:09,502
Anyway, when will the lawyer,
Yufuin, get better?

121
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,772
I can't believe he sent a substitute.

122
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,040
Well…

123
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,778
Is there a reason
you asked Yufuin to defend you?

124
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,316
No. I just saw him when he was on TV
and I remembered him.

125
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,517
TV?

126
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,087
More importantly,
can you do your work properly?

127
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,224
Of course, we have to
confirm a few things--

128
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,426
Why the police suspects me?

129
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:38,531
Because the sleeping pills detected
in my husband's body were mine.

130
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,401
The one who bought the briquettes
online was me.

131
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,802
Two days before it happened,

132
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,405
I brought the documents
of the properties away from home

133
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,641
and put them in a safe-deposit box. And…

134
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,880
my husband died, but I survived?

135
00:06:55,982 --> 00:07:00,052
I take sleeping pills regularly,
so it had no effect and I woke up.

136
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,723
Why?

137
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,993
You both just thought
that I did it, right?

138
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,495
We don't know yet.

139
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,667
You were poisoned by carbon monoxide
and were hospitalized,

140
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,637
so I think it was too risky
as a method of murder.

141
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,373
Oh. I think I can rely on you.

142
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,913
I will ask you again.

143
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,183
Your husband tried
to commit a murder-suicide.

144
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,719
In other words,
you did not kill your husband.

145
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,655
Is that right?

146
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,523
I did not do it.

147
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,196
All right, I'll investigate thoroughly--

148
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,898
Tell me at once
if you think you can't win.

149
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,733
I'll look for a better lawyer.

150
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,172
Sure…

151
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,811
I see. She had seen me on TV?

152
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,046
Yes.

153
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,749
In that case, it has to be that program.

154
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,951
Which one?

155
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,553
The show that followed that case.

156
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,323
It talked about the possibility
of a wrong conviction.

157
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,326
I made the documentary when I was a rookie

158
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,061
and I asked Mr. Yufuin to appear in it.

159
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,465
Anyway, fate is incredible.

160
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,501
I happened to be present

161
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,536
-when Mrs. Norikura was arrested
-I have some souvenirs.

162
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,538
and she asked Mr. Yufuin to defend her

163
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,807
because she watched a program I made.

164
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,444
But this happened
right from the beginning.

165
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
You can count on us, Mr. Yufuin.

166
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,947
The circumstantial evidence
is against her,

167
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,582
but we have to investigate properly first.

168
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,284
Yeah.

169
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,620
-Miss Arima, what's this?
-Yeah?

170
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,522
Oh, Mrs. Norikura gave me that.

171
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,891
It's the video taken by
the security camera.

172
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,760
It shows their house's corridor
on the day of the murder.

173
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,264
The bedroom, where he died,
is at the back.

174
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,303
He entered the bedroom at around 2 a.m.

175
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:10,416
3:45 a.m., the wife came out
of the bedroom and met the maid.

176
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,487
It matches the circumstances
reported by the press.

177
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,459
The estimated time of death
of the victim is between 3 a.m. to 4 a.m.

178
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,862
So the suspect also stayed

179
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,666
in the bedroom filled with
carbon monoxide for over an hour.

180
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,577
For now,

181
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,379
it's in the same condition
as on the day of the murder.

182
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,949
The weather strip,
briquettes, and curtains

183
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,817
were taken away by the police.

184
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,520
The curtains were pulled off that night

185
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
when she tried to run
and fought with the victim.

186
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,825
There were five briquettes
next to the fireplace.

187
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,494
Which bed was Mr. Norikura's?

188
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,129
The window side one.

189
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,433
He had already passed away when I came.

190
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,203
What?

191
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,442
Mr. Kurokawa, someone passed away.
How can you do that so calmly?

192
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,845
Miss Wakura, go and lie down on that bed.

193
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,980
Why?

194
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,049
I want to imagine the state
of the room during the murder.

195
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,151
Mrs. Marina took some sleeping pills too.

196
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,921
-What?
-I'll do it if you don't want to.

197
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,690
It's fine.

198
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,341
So, did you get anything?

199
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,047
The skylight is bright, but…

200
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,850
The bed is soft.

201
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,754
Miss Towada, you came here
in the middle of the night

202
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,391
because Mrs. Norikura called you
to come the day before?

203
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,894
Yes, she said Master Norikura
wanted to go fishing early morning,

204
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,296
so she suddenly asked me to come at 4 a.m.

205
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,367
But Mrs. Norikura came out
of the bedroom at that time.

206
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,336
The timing is perfect.

207
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,140
Of course, because the woman
planned everything.

208
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,941
-Young master!
-I'm the son

209
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,643
of Gonzaburo Norikura's ex-wife.

210
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,049
You made yourselves quite at home.

211
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,951
Are you the woman's lawyers?

212
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,019
Mr. Kurokawa!

213
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,789
Oh no!

214
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:31,791
I am sorry.

215
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,795
This is the motive
that the woman killed my dad.

216
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,329
FORMAL WILL - COPY

217
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,598
-His will?
-Excuse me.

218
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,102
It states that the woman will inherit

219
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,838
all the company's shares and properties.

220
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,941
I didn't see it coming at all.

221
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,445
You're saying that
she murdered him for his money?

222
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,314
My dad was an aggressive businessman

223
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,384
and a womanizer,
so maybe his reputation was bad,

224
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,954
but he worked his way up
the career ladder.

225
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,391
He couldn't have left the company
in this young, former hostess' hands.

226
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,926
He must've been deceived!

227
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,328
Just so you know,

228
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,833
there was no weather strip put on
the bedroom's windows that night.

229
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,502
The woman was free to go in and out.

230
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,571
What? Then…

231
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,073
She burned the briquettes
and went outside,

232
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,175
then waited until my dad was dead
and came back.

233
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,379
The police is conducting
the investigation along that line.

234
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,449
It'll only embarrass you if you
continue to defend the woman.

235
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,953
The police found a witness too.

236
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,921
Witness?

237
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,159
If she could go in and out
from the window freely,

238
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,462
the security camera in the corridor
is totally pointless.

239
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,365
The reason that only the husband died
and the wife was saved

240
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,100
can be easily explained too.

241
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,636
-Witness…
-Okay!

242
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,438
This is bad.

243
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,100
Miss Wakura, Miss Kinosaki!

244
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,868
Let's check that out!

245
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,937
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

246
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,006
The trial will finally begin.

247
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,376
I think the turn of events
is in favor of us this time.

248
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,280
<i>The prosecutor's trump card</i>
<i>seems to be the witness's statement,</i>

249
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,782
<i>but we've got something</i>
<i>to prove it invalid.</i>

250
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,624
So their remaining card is only
the circumstantial evidence?

251
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,929
Mr. Kurokawa can prove her innocence
as usual, then.

252
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,032
The public is paying attention
to the case too.

253
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,234
Whoa!

254
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,137
-You startled me!
-What's the matter, Mr. Yufuin?

255
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,475
SHE WAS IN THE SAME ORPHANAGE AS ME

256
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,479
SHE CAME IN 2004 AFTER HER PARENTS DIED
REALLY GLOOMY AND ANNOYING

257
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,387
Witness, your statement states
that on 22nd December, at 3 a.m.,

258
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,224
you saw the defendant at a place

259
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,359
200 meters away from the crime scene.

260
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,294
Is that true?

261
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,531
Yes, I think it is correct.

262
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,166
What do you base it on?

263
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:31,337
"Base on"? I saw her, so I said I did.

264
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:36,609
When the police interviewed you,
did they first ask you,

265
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,980
"Did you see a female
in a beige coat at that time?"

266
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,983
Yeah, I think they did.

267
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,851
You answered you did,

268
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,320
so they confirmed it with you
at the police station again, right?

269
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,692
They asked, "Is this the female
in this coat that you saw?"

270
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,429
Yes. I thought it looked like her
and answered them.

271
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,135
This is Exhibit No. 29, the photo
testimony taken after the murder.

272
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,104
On that day,

273
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,641
the street clothes in the bedroom
was this beige coat only.

274
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,511
In other words, the defendant
had to wear this to go outside.

275
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,914
That's why the police

276
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,617
searched for witnesses
that saw a female in this coat

277
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,920
and got them to think
that it was the defendant.

278
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,187
Objection.

279
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,455
The defense lawyer's question

280
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,791
unjustly discredited
the police's investigation.

281
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,826
I asked this to verify whether

282
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,597
the police arbitrarily led
the witness to give this statement.

283
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,666
Objection overruled.

284
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,834
Thank you.

285
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,670
Witness, please sit down.

286
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,704
Yes, Your Honor.

287
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:40,940
First of all…

288
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,977
it was impossible for anyone
to see the defendant.

289
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,679
Why did you say that?

290
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,480
This is Defense Exhibit No. 36,

291
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,882
a video taken by the security camera.

292
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,423
The security camera shows the garden
of the victim's house.

293
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:06,298
The light is the security
sensor light at the victim's garden.

294
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,669
If you open the door,
it triggers the sensor light.

295
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,805
And this is the video taken

296
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,275
between 2 a.m. to 3:45 a.m.
on the day of the incident,

297
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,744
and the sensor light did not light up.

298
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,745
In other words,

299
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,415
it proves that the defendant did not
go in and out from the window.

300
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,383
I see!

301
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,954
Also, we deny the possibility
that the defendant

302
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,556
switched the sensor light off.

303
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,293
At around 4 a.m., when the ambulance crew
came and opened the window,

304
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,661
the light was on.

305
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,303
For the above reasons,

306
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,005
the prosecutor's claim that

307
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,609
the defendant went out of the window
and so didn't get poisoned

308
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,510
does not hold.

309
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,948
As the defendant claims,

310
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,617
between 2 a.m. to 3:45 a.m.,

311
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,387
she was in the bedroom, that is, where…

312
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
Mr. Kurokawa?

313
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,960
Defense lawyer?

314
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,964
Sorry, Your Honor.

315
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:18,103
The defendant was in the bedroom,
that is, where the victim died.

316
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,642
They used a witness to frame her!

317
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,344
Kurokawa will prove her innocence again.

318
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,079
We are going to win.

319
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,783
The prosecutor only relied on
an outsider's witness report.

320
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,017
We can win at this rate.

321
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,457
Are you okay, Mr. Kurokawa?
You suddenly froze just now.

322
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,660
We only proved
the prosecutor's claim invalid.

323
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,663
But something more confusing
came up because of that.

324
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,498
What do you mean?

325
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,566
Mr. Kurokawa.

326
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,270
Do you have a minute?

327
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,709
Why did you call me here out of the blue?

328
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,380
I want to praise you
for the efforts you make.

329
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,650
There is only
circumstantial evidence this time.

330
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,352
I admit that the investigation
organization got impatient.

331
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,691
Getting impatient isn't an excuse.

332
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,993
If we hadn't checked,

333
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,329
the statement the witness was led to give

334
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,198
would've ruined the defendant's life.

335
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,069
We can't let it pass if she has
the tiniest possibility of being guilty.

336
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,971
This is our job.

337
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,609
It's the same for you lawyers
in the opposite sense too.

338
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,246
-The same?
-To protect the defendant's benefit,

339
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,415
you do what they want you to.

340
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,184
If they claim they're innocent,
you defend them for that.

341
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:44,690
Sometimes, even if you're sure
that the defendant is lying,

342
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,958
you still claim they're innocent.

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,961
I do not do that.

344
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,931
If you cannot do that,
you'd better take the badge off.

345
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,002
I defend a client to pursue the truth.

346
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,904
Isn't it the reasonable thing to do?

347
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,372
Mr. Kurokawa.

348
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,509
You had said this to me before.

349
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,815
You said you didn't defend someone
for their sake or for justice.

350
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,987
I don't defend someone
for their sake or for justice.

351
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,189
I only want to know the truth.

352
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,958
If that is what you really think,

353
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,228
in the case that the defendant lies,

354
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,564
as a lawyer, what will you do?

355
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,332
Wait a minute.

356
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,137
You're talking like you assume
that this defendant is lying.

357
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,505
What proof do you have--

358
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,275
The room was filled with carbon monoxide.

359
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,844
Why did only the defendant survive?

360
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,813
You think it's suspicious, right?

361
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,050
I'll give you advice.

362
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,787
If your motive to defend someone
is to find out the truth,

363
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,989
you'll never be able to do it.

364
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,299
Good afternoon.

365
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,268
Come… ow… and have a look at this.

366
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,237
Investment scam?

367
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,176
It happened in 2004,
which means it was 15 years ago?

368
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,980
It's a case my partner and I
worked on at that time.

369
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,751
A small company fell victim
and the business went bankrupt.

370
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,353
Charcoal-burning suicide?

371
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,789
We had been preparing for the hearing,

372
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,090
but we were too late.

373
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:30,963
The victim's family made
the decision to end their own lives.

374
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,965
About the investment scam…

375
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,601
Norikura was involved.

376
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:41,039
The victims were a family of four.
The parents, a daughter, and a son.

377
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,941
The children were saved.

378
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,110
The younger brother's brain was damaged

379
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,578
and a relative looks after him.

380
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,047
HUSBAND, DEAD
WIFE, DEAD

381
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,749
"Marin Suwa".

382
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,518
You can see the resemblance.

383
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,756
<i>Both her name and age</i>
<i>match the defendant's.</i>

384
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,169
<i>That means Marina has a motive</i>
<i>to kill Mr. Norikura?</i>

385
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,105
Kurokawa.

386
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,309
I could not save the family,

387
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,746
so, maybe you…

388
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,954
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

389
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,157
Why do you two look so serious?

390
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,060
Do you want to charge more legal fees?

391
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,697
You'll probably win at this rate,
so I can think about it.

392
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,066
Marina.

393
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,936
We found the connection
between you and Mr. Norikura

394
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,305
before you got married.

395
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,444
Yufuin remembered it and your family too.

396
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,714
So what?

397
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,618
You want to say that I killed Norikura
because I have a motive?

398
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,420
No, that's not what we mean.

399
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,356
So, where is your brother?

400
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,426
We heard that he was saved too.

401
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,762
Who knows? I haven't seen him
since I went to the orphanage.

402
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,799
Marina,

403
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,070
you didn't leave the bedroom
on that night, did you?

404
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,274
I told you he made me take
the sleeping pills and I fell asleep.

405
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,411
You proved that I didn't go out
of the window during the hearing.

406
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,779
In that case,

407
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,516
if you stayed for over an hour
in the room where your husband died,

408
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,418
it's a miracle that you were unharmed.

409
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,124
This time, and when you were little,

410
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,295
you escaped death
from carbon monoxide poisoning twice.

411
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,032
Is this just a coincidence?

412
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,969
I have always been lucky.

413
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,274
I could be married to Norikura
because I was lucky too.

414
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,878
Also,

415
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,248
I'm lucky that he died so early.

416
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,222
Why do you look at me like that?

417
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,958
I said I didn't do it.

418
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:18,163
It's your job to believe what I say
and prove that I'm innocent.

419
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,231
Right, lawyers?

420
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,906
Yes, we had been looking after him
until two years ago

421
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,542
because nobody else would.

422
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,044
Where is he now?

423
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,948
No idea. His sister suddenly came
and brought him with her.

424
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,386
She got quite rich
working at a night club.

425
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,522
Maybe she admitted him to a hospital.

426
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,895
This is where Marina
and her family were living.

427
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,198
Nothing is left here.

428
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,679
Mr. Kurokawa?

429
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,283
Miss Wakura.

430
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,253
I wonder what I am trying
to investigate now.

431
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,154
What?

432
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,558
The room was filled with carbon monoxide.

433
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,394
Why was Marina unharmed?

434
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,931
If we know how she did it…

435
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,437
Miss Arima is calling.

436
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:34,973
Hello?

437
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,610
She found Marina's brother.

438
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,414
KANTO MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

439
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,949
TAKASHI SUWA

440
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:51,089
Marina had paid five years' worth of fees
needed for him to stay here.

441
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,061
But he is in
a pretty serious condition now.

442
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,465
Marina gave them
some false contact details,

443
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,400
so the hospital can't get hold of her.

444
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,169
They're at a loss of what to do.

445
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,607
I knew she was lying.

446
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,575
Yes?

447
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,013
She told us she hadn't seen her brother.

448
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,320
TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

449
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,826
Mr. Kurokawa hasn't come out.

450
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,662
CRIME SCENE PHOTO
FIRST FLOOR BEDROOM

MANGANESE - IV - OXIDE
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE

452
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,201
In the case the defendant lies,

453
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,537
as a lawyer, what would you do?

454
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:50,041
It's your job to believe what I say
and prove that I'm innocent.

455
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,012
If you cannot do that,
you'd better take the badge off.

456
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,901
You haven't had lunch, right?
There you go.

457
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:35,587
Why did Marina first ask
Mr. Yufuin to be her defense lawyer?

458
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,557
He could have realized who she was.

459
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,995
What can we do for Marina?

460
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,220
It's a wonder
that they let us borrow the house.

461
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,158
It isn't unfavorable to the son too.

462
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,732
I don't know what Kurokawa thinks
about this, though.

463
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,371
Mr. Kurokawa,
I think you'd better not do this.

464
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,977
Miss Wakura, stop him with me.
If anything happens…

465
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,379
Thank you.

466
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,081
Everything is ready.

467
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,618
Are you really sure, Kurokawa?

468
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,891
-I'm counting on you.
-Good.

469
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,260
Put this on and go to the bedroom.

470
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:51,896
Okay.

471
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,575
Seal the door's gaps.

472
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,793
When you've done that, hang the curtain.

473
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,571
<i>Done.</i>

474
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,974
Good. Light up the briquettes.

475
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,408
The experiment starts now.

476
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,058
In a room with burning briquettes,

477
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,629
there are three reasons why
the victim died but the suspect was saved.

478
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,166
The first one is the shape of the room.

479
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,435
<i>When briquettes burn,</i>

480
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,071
<i>the carbon monoxide produced is heated</i>

481
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,374
<i>and stays at the room's ceiling.</i>

482
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,642
BRIQUETTE CARBON MONOXIDE
CURTAIN

483
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,578
<i>The carbon monoxide is cooled</i>
<i>at the skylight,</i>

484
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,847
<i>its density increases and starts to sink.</i>

485
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,017
The second reason is the curtain
that divides the room.

486
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,087
<i>The sinking carbon monoxide</i>
<i>is blocked by the curtain</i>

487
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,656
<i>and gathers on the window side.</i>

488
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,591
CARBON MONOXIDE, SKYLIGHT

CO CONCENTRATION - PERCENT
DOOR: 0.02 - WINDOW: 0.31

490
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,665
The bed on the window side is filled
with a high concentration

491
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,967
of carbon monoxide
that can cause death in 30 minutes.

492
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,101
CONCENTRATION OF CO IN AIR
AND SYMPTOMS OF CO POISONING

493
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,837

DEATH IN 30 MINUTES

494
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,574
CRIME SCENE PHOTO NO. 1

495
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,044
But, of course, as time goes by,

496
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,779
its concentration on the door side
increases too.

497
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,882
DOOR: 0.32 - WINDOW: 1.22

498
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,484
Now, the third reason.

499
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,287
Kurokawa, now.

500
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,857
MANGANESE - IV - OXIDE CRYSTALS
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE

501
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,298
<i>She added manganese dioxide</i>
<i>to hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen.</i>

502
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,201
Why now?

503
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,337
You can't produce oxygen beforehand.

504
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,807
After the victim was dead
and before the maid came,

505
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,043
this is how the defendant
managed to stay alive.

506

CO CONCENTRATION DOOR - 0.82

507
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,091
Mr. Kurokawa!

508
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,293
Wakura! Open the windows for ventilation.

509
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,176
Mr. Kurokawa!

510
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,178
Mr. Kurokawa!

511
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,748
I thought I would die.

512
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,085
Gosh!

513
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,458
The experiment is done.

514
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,663
This is a well-prepared
and planned murder.

515
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,366
I think…

516
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,171
maybe I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

517
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:32,176
I knew that when you were
aiming to be a lawyer.

518
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,885
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

519
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,857
We did an experiment to see
why you survived in that room.

520
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,198
These.

521
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,236
We found the manganese dioxide
at the bottom of the bedroom's tank.

522
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,008
The state of the room
when your parents passed away

523
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,678
gave you the idea to use the curtain
as a screen, right?

524
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:14,585
Your life and your brother's life
were saved because of that.

525
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,425
You saw my brother?

526
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,493
We did.

527
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,798
Then,

528
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:32,703
will you not say that he was saved
after seeing his condition?

529
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,712
My father put a partition screen
there just by chance.

530
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,314
<i>I'm sure that</i>

531
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,584
<i>he just didn't want to see</i>
<i>the children he was going to kill.</i>

532
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,389
<i>But only I survived because he did that.</i>

533
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,434
Didn't I tell you last time
that I am lucky?

534
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,805
It was my luck that I met Norikura
at the club I worked at.

535
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,109
It was my luck that I became his wife too.

536
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,514
I could admit my brother into
a hospital, thanks to him too.

537
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,750
Why did you kill Mr. Norikura, then?

538
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,153
Because he found out.

539
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,590
That jerk said this to me.

540
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,527
He told me to forsake my brother.

541
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,828
MARINA NORIKURA
COMING OUT FROM HOSPITAL

542
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,029
MARINA'S BROTHER IN HOSPITAL

543
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:36,834
I have no obligation
to support your brother too.

544
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,405
Please! My brother can only rely on me!

545
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,541
Listen, Marina.

546
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,776
I've been using dirty methods,

547
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,779
as dirty as sipping muddy water,
to survive until now.

548
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:54,085
I like you because you tried to
crawl your way up from the bottom.

549
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,587
That's why I made you my wife.

550
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,493
If you want to stay with me,
ignore the weak, like I do!

551
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,632
Forget your worthless and useless brother!
Do you hear me?

552
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,600
<i>At that time…</i>

553
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,936
<i>I made up my mind.</i>

554
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,939
For my brother…

555
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,376
for my parents, who died because of him,

556
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,511
I would kill him.

557
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,583
I decided to kill him
and take everything away from him.

558
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:39,497
If you confess your crime, I can
plead extenuating circumstances.

559
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,568
-What are you saying?
-We'll appeal to the judge

560
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,769
why you did that…

561
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,206
and I'll do my best to
reduce the sentence--

562
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,740
Don't be ridiculous!

563
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,845
If you'll do your best,
do it to prove that I'm innocent!

564
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,585
If you realized what I did,
you should know how to deceive them!

565
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,353
Get rid of the evidence and everything!

566
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,188
We cannot do that.

567
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,157
Are you stupid?

568
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,062
Do you know how many deaths
Norikura's scams caused?

569
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,499
That jerk laughed and said this
when he got drunk.

570
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,003
Fourteen people he'd swindled had died

571
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,771
the same way my parents did.

572
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,676
But that jerk wasn't punished.

573
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,880
He got some good lawyers and ran away
because of la ack of evidence.

574
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,818
You can get away with crime
because there's no evidence.

575
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,786
Isn't that the world of law?

576
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,890
You're a lawyer. Why did you do
something uncalled-for?

577
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,397
Because you asked Mr. Yufuin
to defend you.

578
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,138
You actually wanted someone
to realize, didn't you,

579
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,876
the pain of having your family
taken away and this is your revenge.

580
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,779
-So you asked Mr. Yufuin--
-Go!

581
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,015
You don't have to come again.

582
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,783
Marina.

583
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,585
You are fired.

584
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,321
I want you to be saved!

585
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,594
The job of a lawyer…

586
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,333
is to protect the client's benefit,
indeed.

587
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,535
But…

588
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,308
Is turning your back to a crime
you committed and running away…

589
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,113
something that benefits you?

590
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,385
Even if we win the case…

591
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,890
if you still bear the sin…

592
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,094
you will never be saved.

593
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,337
Wait!

594
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,447
Mr. Kurokawa is removed
from his post? Why?

595
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,050
I see.

596
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,594
GONZABURO NORIKURA'S MURDER
DEFENDANT, MARINA NORIKURA

597
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,229
Are they all the documents?

598
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,732
Please take over the case for us.

599
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,935
I'm surprised, though.

600
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,705
I knew that you've been
in charge of this case,

601
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,375
but I never expected her
to dismiss you halfway.

602
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,545
Our plan of defense disagrees
with our client's.

603
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,984
You could almost prove her innocence
due to lack of evidence.

604
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,753
Why did you disagree?

605
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,957
Could it be because Mr. Kurokawa
messed it up again?

606
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,959
-There you go.
-Oh, thanks.

607
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,762
It's hot!

608
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,666
WRITTEN STATEMENT OF EXPERT OPINION

609
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,805
Shred the document.

610
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,076
Don't leak it to the police
or the prosecutor.

611
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,012
If you do that, your life
as a lawyer will really be over.

612
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,783
Why do you look at me like that?

613
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,652
Are you surprised that I worry about you?

614
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,621
No.

615
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,557
It comes with criminal defense cases.

616
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,896
Sometimes the defendant lies to you,
sometimes the result is hopeless.

617
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,434
Corporate law is nice.

618
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,670
You can work for honest workers
and organizations

619
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,505
and the office gains profits too.

620
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,141
I like to do this more.

621
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,294
No, I am not worried about you.

622
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,130
I thought you would really be fired
and I looked forward to it.

623
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,932
But you said you were very worried.

624
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:08,933
Idiot!

625
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,835
Mr. Kurokawa,

626
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,538
the hospital that Marina's brother
stays at just called.

627
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,740
Yes?

628
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,643
<i>His condition got a lot worse</i>
<i>this morning and…</i>

629
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,851
<i>I contacted Marina's new lawyer</i>
<i>and asked him to tell her.</i>

630
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,134
COURTHOUSE

631
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:49,039
CLOSING ARGUMENT

632
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,511
Please un-cuff the suspect.

633
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:05,122
As shown, all the prosecutor's claims
are mere guesses.

634
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,826
Someone is innocent until proven guilty,

635
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,762
which is against
the presumption of innocence.

636
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,331
You actually wanted someone
to realize, didn't you?

637
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,467
<i>I want you to be saved!</i>

638
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,004
<i>If you still bear the sin,</i>
<i>you will never be saved.</i>

639
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,873
For the above reasons,

640
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,309
I claim the defendant, Marina Norikura--

641
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,577
Wait.

642
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,846
What is it?

643
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,415
I want to say something.

644
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,285
There will be time for you to talk later.

645
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,787
Do you call it
a self-confession in this case too?

646
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,490
I want to say what I did.

647
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,492
Self-confession?

648
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,430
I killed my husband.

649
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,631
Hey…

650
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,666
Be quiet!

651
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,767
Be quiet!

652
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,734
What's going on?

653
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,936
What did you say?

654
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,907
Defendant, do you know
what you are talking about?

655
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,342
Yes.

656
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,781
I can explain everything, including
why and how I killed my husband.

657
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,816
Defendant, be quiet!

658
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,318
Your Honor, please adjourn--

659
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,120
-You are fired.
-What?

660
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,025
Will you defend me again?

661
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,737
I thought I needed no salvation.

662
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,108
But…

663
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,991
What made her confess
her crime in court?

664
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,726
It must be Kurokawa again.

665
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,795
Let's do our best to plead
extenuating circumstances.

666
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,666
Mr. Kurokawa.

667
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,938
Did I do the right thing as a lawyer?

668
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,174
Marina made the decision.

669
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,343
Moreover,

670
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,046
if you don't know
whether it was right or not,

671
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,015
that means it could be right.

672
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:16,587
You're right.

673
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,491
What's the matter?

674
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,861
You haven't had them?

675
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,763
I suddenly want to eat.

676
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,500
Mind your manners.

677
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:34,772
KAZUTO YUFUIN

678
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,875
I will be in charge of your case
with Yufuin from now on.

679
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,881
I couldn't fulfil my duty 15 years ago,

680
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,150
so, this time,

681
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,086
I hope I can help you.

682
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,625
I am counting on you.

683
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,905
Miss Wakura,

684
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,307
don't be unhappy because
you aren't in charge of her case.

685
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,875
We have other jobs to do.

686
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,343
I know.

687
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,846
And you asked Miss Arima for this, right?

688
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,051
DOCUMENTARY 24, TOUO UNIVERSITY
STUDENT MURDER CASE

689
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,021
THE DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS.

690
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,989
BURNING CHARCOAL IN A CLOSED SPACE
IS DANGEROUS

691
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,827
<i>A death-row inmate imprisoned</i>
<i>for murder 24 years ago</i>

692
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,794
<i>and his daughter.</i>

693
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,496
Don't mess up my life!

694
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,631
<i>You want to file an appeal for a retrial?</i>

695
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,568
<i>Can they save the victims</i>
<i>of the false conviction?</i>

696
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,004
It's unforgivable to take away
their future too.
