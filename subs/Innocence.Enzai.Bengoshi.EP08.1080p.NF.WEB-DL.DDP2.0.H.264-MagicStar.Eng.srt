HIROMITSU SHIKINE, DEATH ROW INMATE

3
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,183
TO TV NIPPON, MISS SATOKO ARIMA

4
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,954
See you.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
-See you.
-See you.

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,058
Mr. Kurokawa, I'll go home too.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,226
See you.

00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,629
DOCUMENTARY 24, TOUO UNIVERSITY
STUDENT MURDER CASE

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,135
I am sorry!

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,136
It's hot…

11
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,005
Oh? Miss Wakura, this…

12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,409
I asked Miss Arima to lend me that.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,379
If you don't mind,
may I borrow it for a while?

14
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,148
Yes?

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,950
Sorry, I'll give it back
right after I make a copy.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,222
The documentary was produced
two years after the incident, right?

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,191
Mr. Kurokawa, did you not watch it?

18
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,093
I did when I was in university.

19
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,663
Dr. Akiu told me.

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,099
"The murderer was someone else.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,969
Asama was wrongly convicted."
That's what you said.

22
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,972
Why do you think he was wrongly convicted?

23
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,873
Oh?

24
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,377
It's not moving.
I can't get the DVD out either.

25
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,779
What? You said you would
give it back at once!

26
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,182
I'm sorry… Okay, the manual…

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,250
-It's hot!
-Ouch!

28
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,020
Sorry…

29
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,056
Hello, Kurokawa? Is it okay to talk?

30
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,026
It's not exactly okay
if you ask if it's okay.

31
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>I'll get to the point, then.</i>

32
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,697
I would like you to meet someone tomorrow.

33
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,634
HIROMITSU SHIKINE

34
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,171
"Support Group
of the Innocent Hiromitsu Shikine"?

35
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,241
Yes. Mr. Shikine was sentenced to death

36
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,844
in the Itoe Electric Company
House Murder Case.

37
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,415
Itoe Electric Company House Murder Case.

38
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,684
The murder happened 24 years ago.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,856
Mr. Tamatsukuri has been working
to clear Shikine, his ex-colleague,

40
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,390
of the false charge.

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:09,262
She said working, but the support group
isn't really functioning now.

42
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,868
People have forgotten the case
and there are fewer supporters.

43
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:21,207
Mr. Shiobara, the lawyer who has been
helping us, passed away last month.

44
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,712
He's been working hard investigating
this case for over 20 years.

45
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,717
Mr. Shikine was arrested at 38 years old,

46
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,919
and he is 62 now.

47
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,257
-What are they?
-Me and Mr. Shikine, who is in prison,

48
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,626
have been exchanging letters
since nine years ago.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,596
I tried to send him a letter
and he replied.

50
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,399
The more we investigate,

51
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,502
the more we found how sloppy
the police's investigation was,

52
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,238
so I want to help in some way.

53
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,439
That's a lot of letters.

54
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,244
And this is the latest letter
that I got yesterday.

55
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,717
He said he found that he had cancer
in a regular body check

56
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,253
and he wouldn't spend the 25th year there,

57
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,823
whether he'll be executed or not.

58
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,526
He has cancer.

59
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,862
I want your help.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,332
If Mr. Shikine was wrongly convicted,

61
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,669
I hope you can help him
when he's still alive.

62
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,537
Help him?

63
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,774
In other words, you want to
file an appeal for a retrial?

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,741
Yes!

65
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,647
The late Mr. Shiobara had filed appeal
four times in the past,

66
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,116
but they were all dismissed.

67
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,219
I am not surprised.

68
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,588
Being granted a retrial

69
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,358
is so difficult that it's called
the locked door.

70
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,538
<i>Now, to me, hope is like poison.</i>

71
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,973
<i>This case's nature</i>
<i>is different from others so far.</i>

72
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,608
Don't use your half-baked sense of justice

73
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,043
to mess around with my life!

74
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,645
<i>If he were still alive…</i>

75
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>"The ghost at the swamp?"</i>

76
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,616
<i>…taking away the future he has</i>

77
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>would be unforgivable.</i>

78
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:17,257
<i>The murder happened on</i>
<i>December 23, 1995, at 5:08 p.m.</i>

79
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:21,828
<i>The annual Christmas party was held</i>
<i>at Itoe Electric's company house</i>

80
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,364
<i>and the tragedy happened.</i>

81
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,569
<i>Eight people suddenly started</i>
<i>feeling unwell and six of them died.</i>

82
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,138
<i>Analysis showed that the champagne</i>
<i>they drank during the toast</i>

83
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,441
<i>had a lethal amount</i>
<i>of potassium cyanide added.</i>

84
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>Judging by the fact that he brought</i>
<i>the champagne</i>

85
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,245
<i>and other circumstantial evidence,</i>

86
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,382
<i>the police arrested one of</i>
<i>the guests, Hiromitsu Shikine.</i>

87
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,984
<i>After being mercilessly questioned</i>
<i>and persistently interrogated,</i>

88
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,886
<i>Shikine confessed to murder.</i>

89
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>The confession became conclusive</i>
<i>due to lack of direct evidence.</i>

90
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,693
The accused is sentenced to death.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,229
<i>Shikine was sentenced to death</i>
<i>in the first trial.</i>

92
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,898
<i>He claimed that the police</i>
<i>forced him to make the confession.</i>

93
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,266
<i>Although he appealed twice,</i>

94
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,770
<i>the Supreme Court confirmed</i>
<i>his death sentence in 2004,</i>

95
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,271
<i>nine years after the murder.</i>

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,589
I am Hoshundo Law Office's lawyer,
Kurokawa.

97
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,657
I'm Wakura.

98
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm Shikine.

99
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,306
Miss Arima and the support group's
Mr. Tamatsukuri asked me to come.

100
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,176
We'd like to investigate the case again

101
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,445
and see if we can request a retrial.

102
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,281
We know it must be painful for you,

103
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,018
but would you tell us what happened
in the case again?

104
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,192
It happened in the distant past,
so it isn't painful.

105
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,263
But I don't think
I have anything new to tell you.

106
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,634
I have already accepted everything.

107
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,172
But you were forced to make
the self-confession, right?

108
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,742
-If we investigate again--
-In the murder,

109
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:21,080
my wife was one of the six people
who passed away.

110
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,417
She was reliable

111
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,588
and gave lots of support
to a useless man like me.

112
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,091
Six people, including my wife,
passed away.

113
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,529
In the trial, the judge concluded
that it was my fault.

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,201
Since that day,
I felt that I'm already dead.

115
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,839
You have a daughter, don't you?

116
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,309
She had been staying with
your wife's parents after the incident…

117
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,079
Mr. Shikine? Mr. Shikine?

118
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,784
Excuse me. Can anyone help?

119
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,919
-Excuse me!
-Mr. Shikine! Mr. Shikine!

120
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,822
What's the matter?
Sorry, but the interview has to end now.

121
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,892
Are you okay? Can you stand?

122
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,168
-Mr. Kurokawa.
-Yes?

123
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,440
Now, to me…

124
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,342
hope is poison.

125
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,877
Poison?

126
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,948
Maybe I can get out and see my daughter.

127
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,851
A hope like that

128
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,590
will rip my heart apart instead

129
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,459
and makes it hurt more.

130
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,565
Please just leave me alone now.

131
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,347
These are all the documents sent here.

132
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,684
Mr. Shiobara had been pretty enthusiastic
in investigating this.

133
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,987
Isn't it going to take a month
just to read all of them?

134
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,890
But if the man himself
doesn't want a retrial,

135
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,124
there's nothing we can do.

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,795
Please grand Mr. Kurokawa
and Miss Wakura permission

137
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,996
to reinvestigate the case.

138
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,268
But it's almost impossible

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,372
for the two of them to win
the chance of a retrial on their own.

140
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,941
Originally, you should form
a large defense team

141
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,377
and it only works
if you have many supporters.

142
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,513
The support group is still working.

143
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,983
But his only daughter,
the blood relative, didn't join it, right?

144
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,619
So far, their appeal have been
dismissed four times.

145
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,357
Kurokawa, this case's nature
is different from others so far.

146
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:49,495
I know, but I want to do everything I can

147
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,466
because Mr. Shikine is still alive.

148
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,804
ITOE ELECTRIC RECREATION ROOM

149
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,374
The place hasn't been used
since the murder.

150
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,879
Mr. Shiobara checked what
the party guests had been doing.

151
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>The party started at 5 p.m.</i>
<i>Many guests had been</i>

152
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,353
<i>going in and out to take</i>
<i>food and drinks from home.</i>

153
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,758
Mr. Shikine was suspected
because he brought the champagne

154
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,662
and he stayed at the venue
the longest to do the preparation.

155
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,097
But many people
were going in and out, right?

156
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,833
There's no doubt other residents
and outsiders

157
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,770
had a chance to poison the drinks.

158
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,406
This is where the empty bottle

159
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,309
of the potassium cyanide used
was disposed of.

160
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,643
There was a swamp at that time

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,046
and rubbish was illegally disposed of
on a daily basis.

162
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,381
The poison used

163
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,451
was the potassium cyanide
Itoe Electric produced for plating.

164
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,453
Mr. Shikine was the head
of General Affairs Section,

165
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,422
so he could get it easily.

166
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,725
But the management of chemicals
was careless at that time,

167
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,295
so everyone could've taken it out
if they worked at the factory.

168
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,198
The factory is a ten-minute walk away
from the house.

169
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,669
Nobody witnessed Mr. Shikine
disposing of the bottle, right?

170
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,440
Mr. Shikine said that he had been
in the residential area the whole time.

171
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,743
But have a look at this.

172
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,944
MR. SHIKINE WAS SEEN CARRYING FOOD

173
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,080
What the other residents said

174
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:18,384
before and after Mr. Shikine
made the confession was very different.

175
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,619
DOES NOT REMEMBER IT

176
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,355
It's like they were
putting the blame on Mr. Shikine.

177
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,559
<i>Mr. Toba, at first,</i>

178
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,664
you said you witnessed Mr. Shikine
carrying dishes of food at 4:15 p.m.,

179
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,399
but after Mr. Shikine's confession,

180
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,901
you changed your testimony
and said you saw it wrong.

181
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,237
I don't remember it.
It was a long time ago.

182
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,338
KEN TOBA, WIFE DIED IN THE MURDER

183
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,641
The case had been solved anyway.

184
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,043
I was confused when it happened!

185
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,911
Of course, I would make mistakes!

186
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,846
MICHIYO IIZAKA, HUSBAND DIED IN THE MURDER

187
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,782
My husband was killed
and it was tough for me.

188
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,051
I was still in primary school.

189
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,419
YUMI HARUNA, FATHER DIED IN THE MURDER

190
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,622
I was upset after
what happened to my father.

191
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,924
I don't remember giving a statement.

192
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,428
But what you said in the interview
was recorded here.

193
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,599
Maybe my mother answered it for me.

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,037
Anyway, I just want to
forget about the case.

195
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,010
Nobody would talk to us properly.

196
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,913
Maybe the victims' family
do not want to talk

197
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,349
but even former residents
who didn't lose anyone too.

198
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,917
Maybe they feel guilty.

199
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,854
They changed their statements
after Mr. Shikine made the confession

200
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,257
because they all wanted a sense of relief.

201
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,324
Relief?

202
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,960
They didn't lie intentionally,

203
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,962
they just wanted the case
to be settled soon.

204
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,167
They wanted to know clearly
who the murderer was and feel relieved.

205
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,702
I think it's the result of such mentality.

206
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,873
And Mr. Shikine's self-confession
was the perfect escape route.

207
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,975
What should we do next?

208
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,345
Let's meet up with Miss Arima
and go to meet Mr. Shikine's daughter.

209
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,852
Hello.

210
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,921
It's you again?

211
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,527
Mr. Tamatsukuri had told me
about my father's disease,

212
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,233
but I don't want anything
to do with my father

213
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,702
and I won't go to see him.

214
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:23,743
But Miss Matsugashita, if you
help us, maybe we'll find new facts.

215
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,279
Reiko.

216
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:35,721
The next appeal for retrial
could be Mr. Shikine's last chance.

217
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,258
Are you telling me…

218
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,198
to continue to sacrifice my own life
for my father?

219
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,438
As the daughter of a death row inmate,

220
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,707
do you know
what life has been like for me?

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,847
Please leave.

222
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,922
To me, my father died on the day
his death sentence was confirmed.

223
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,292
I beg you.

224
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,563
Please stop putting me in agony.

225
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,536
Even after she started living
with her grandparents,

226
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,704
life had been tough for her.

227
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,209
It was a serious incident,
so the press followed her around.

228
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,114
At times like this,

229
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:40,653
if makes me feel guilty and helpless
that I am part of the press.

230
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,725
By the way, have you watched the DVD?

231
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,196
Not yet, because of what Mr. Kurokawa did.

232
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:51,864
Sorry.

233
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,305
When I produced the program,
Dr. Akiu said to me,

234
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,710
"Don't say the conviction
is possibly false without evidence.

235
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,949
Saying this is trampling on
the feelings of the victim's family."

236
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,387
Dr. Akiu said that?

237
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,294
He's always unfriendly to me, right?
That's why.

238
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,929
-Let's go!
-Wait for me!

239
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,365
Then try to catch me.

240
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,516
<i>It's really difficult to win</i>
<i>the chance for a retrial.</i>

241
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,417
Oh no…

242
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,587
Mr. Shiobara spent 24 years
working on the case,

243
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,090
but he has never won an appeal.

244
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,392
The prosecutors and court
have their honor.

245
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,095
If you don't find decisive new facts,

246
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,763
the locked door won't open.

247
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,666
Even if you find decisive evidence,

248
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,502
they don't accept it in some cases too.

249
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,038
"The north of the company house."

250
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,973
"A crying girl?"

251
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,443
"A short while before the party began,

252
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,915
<i>the boy in Room 302 saw</i>
<i>Mr. Shikine's daughter, Reiko,</i>

253
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,617
<i>comforting a crying girl."</i>

254
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,586
So, I am going to die soon!

255
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,087
"A disturbing conversation."

256
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,989
"Die soon?"

257
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,227
-Guys, have a look at this.
-Did you find something?

258
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,829
It's from the house to where
the bottle was disposed of.

259
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,133
Mr. Shikine showed them the way
and the photos were taken there.

260
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,634
THE SUSPECT TELLS
HOW HE COMMITTED THE CRIME.

261
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,304
Do you feel something is wrong?

262
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,005
-Wrong?
-Yeah.

263
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,045
-I got the results.
-What did you find?

264
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,414
The environment at the time of the murder,

265
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,115
the weather on that day,

266
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,984
the time of sunrise and sunset.

267
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,286
When I input all these data,

268
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,324
I found 16 among the 17 photos
were unnatural.

269
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,527
Photo number six, for example,

270
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,463
it says the photo was taken
at this location

271
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,699
on January 29, at 3:05 p.m.,

272
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,534
but the shadow is too long
for a photo taken at that time.

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,573
It couldn't be so long if the sun
didn't shine from the west at 4 p.m.

274
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,474
THE SUN

275
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,843
That means it was an hour earlier?

276
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,612
It isn't too early,
it's in the reversed order.

277
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,882
Except the very first photo.

278
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,952
Looking at the sunlight and the angle,

279
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,622
no doubt the photos were taken
in this order.

280
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,359
What does this fact mean?

281
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,497
Mr. Shikine didn't know where
the poison's bottle was disposed of,

282
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,167
so the police first took him to
the swamp, that is, the destination,

283
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,970
and took photos when they
walked back to the house.

284
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,141
Then they reversed the order
in the crime reconstruction report,

285
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,678
so that it looks like Mr. Shikine
was taking them to the swamp.

286
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,980
The evidence was obviously fabricated.

287
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,549
This is a new fact!

288
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,218
Miss Arima,

289
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,855
this could be the decisive evidence
to win an appeal!

290
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,361
Thank you.

291
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,499
There is no reason for you,
a reporter, to thank me.

292
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,502
Great!

293
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,838
Next, I'll report this case
to make an appeal

294
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,974
about the necessity of having a retrial.

295
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,009
We'll go to meet Mr. Shikine again.

296
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,945
Thanks. Kurokawa, please continue
to help on this.

297
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,180
Okay.

298
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,649
Dr. Akiu, we'll go as well.

299
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,319
I have to throw a wet blanket,
but it's hard to win with only this.

300
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,654
Why do you say so?

301
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,991
The prosecution office and the court
work for the government.

302
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,193
They are extremely stubborn.

303
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,897
Moreover, if you want to
clear someone of false charges,

304
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,133
you might have to do it from scratch.

305
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,871
Not everyone is happy about
bringing up a closed case again.

306
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,044
TOKYO DETENTION HOUSE

307
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,412
We found evidence that

308
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,748
the police falsified something
in the investigation.

309
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,984
It's a new fact
that hasn't been found until now.

310
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,519
I see.

311
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,222
You must have put lots of efforts in it.

312
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,058
So, we want to file an appeal
for a retrial.

313
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,793
A retrial?

314
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,330
Mr. Shikine?

315
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,099
Yes?

316
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,003
May we start the preparation?

317
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,273
Yeah. I think it's great.

318
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,175
Thank you.

319
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,948
<i>In a murder 24 years ago,</i>

320
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>a man who was 38 years old</i>
<i>at that time was sentenced to death.</i>

321
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,690
<i>New facts were found in the Itoe</i>
<i>Electric Company House Murder.</i>

322
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:50,095
<i>Death row inmate, Hiromitsu Shikine,</i>
<i>currently has cancer…</i>

323
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,132
I hope it will get everybody
talking about the case.

324
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,768
I think it will appeal
to the prosecutor's office and the court.

325
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,937
Mr. Kurokawa,

326
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,708
you are exactly like
what I heard in the rumors.

327
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,612
Miss Wakura,
I am very grateful to you too.

328
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,848
But we still have to continue
to investigate this.

329
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,917
<i>Whether the sentence was fair or not…</i>

330
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,485
Mr. Kurokawa?

331
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,288
<i>The lawyer for Mr. Shikine…</i>

332
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,189
Sorry.

333
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,525
<i>…is Hoshundo Lawyer Office's…</i>

334
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,759
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

335
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,161
So…

336
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,266
What is the matter
that you called us here for today?

337
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,970
The Itoe Electric Company House
Murder Case 24 years ago.

338
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,543
I wasn't involved in the case myself,

339
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,545
but the prosecutor in charge

340
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,947
is a Chief Public Prosecutor
and my superior.

341
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,849
What about that?

342
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,386
What Mr. Kurokawa is doing is very bold.

343
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,988
The Supreme Court had concluded the case,

344
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,390
but he says no to it.

345
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,629
I think the act itself might affect
the court's impression of him.

346
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,200
Is that a threat?

347
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,503
Saying it's a threat makes me
uncomfortable, Mr. Beppu.

348
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,972
Mr. Ibusuki.

349
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,176
I've never found Kurokawa pleasant.

350
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,447
He keeps pushing me around
and I'm sick of it.

351
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,987
However, even so,
he is one of our lawyers.

352
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,362
Whatever they'll do to defend Mr. Shikine,

353
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,831
I will take the responsibility.

354
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,100
Excuse me.

355
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,171
Excuse me.

356
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:47,646
Mr. Beppu, is this okay to have
a fight with him for Kurokawa?

357
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,548
It isn't okay!

358
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,784
We have to abandon Kurokawa if necessary!

359
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,288
What?

360
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,757
<i>I'm</i> Bonshu Weekly's <i>reporter, Nose.</i>

361
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,325
<i>Mr. Shikine's daughter,</i>

362
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,693
<i>please say a word about the case.</i>

363
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,763
I'm not involved in it. Excuse me.

364
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,765
I'm TV Maicho's reporter.

365
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:11,136
May I interview you about the Itoe
Electric Company House Murder Case?

366
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,338
We got lots of reactions.

367
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,109
Everyone is concerned about
the forgotten case.

368
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,679
Mr. Shikine agreed to let us file
an appeal for a retrial

369
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,214
and we'll process it at once.

370
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,283
Mr. Kurokawa?

371
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,419
You are pulling a long face.

372
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,289
Oh, I'm just a bit…

373
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,626
That reminds me. Should we tell
his daughter about the appeal?

374
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,363
I'll go to see Reiko myself
and tell her about it.

375
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,799
Reiko?

376
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,069
I was going to visit you--

377
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,342
Who do you think you are?

378
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,880
You did something uncalled-for…

379
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,651
so the press has started
to follow me around again!

380
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:06,491
Rumors are spreading
in my neighborhood and at my office!

381
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,660
Just cut it out!

382
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,462
Don't…

383
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,799
Don't use your half-baked sense of justice

384
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,736
to mess around with my life!

385
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,620
-Welcome.
-There you go.

386
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,160
Hey.

387
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,498
-You're here!
-You called me out.

388
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,433
-Oolong tea, please.
-Sure.

389
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,535
You won't have alcohol?

390
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,939
Be grateful that I'm sitting
next to someone who will pester me

391
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,108
-when she's drunk.
-All right.

392
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:57,776
What do you want?

393
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,882
When I produced the documentary
of the case 11 years ago,

394
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,785
you shouted at me, didn't you?

395
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,156
You said I was trampling on
other people's feelings.

396
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:19,431
Mr. Shikine's daughter said
the same thing to me today.

397
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,335
She told me not to wield
the sword of my half-baked justice.

398
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,670
Did she?

399
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,638
There you go, sir.

400
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,107
When I joined the television station,

401
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,777
I had quite some passion about my dream.

402
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,181
I was enthusiastic and thought
the press existed for society.

403
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,084
But my boss…

404
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,921
he told me to follow stories
that get high ratings

405
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,956
and give the customers what they like.

406
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,092
He kept saying it is what the press is.

407
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,028
But…

408
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,031
I hated it.

409
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,502
I thought solving a case to get the truth

410
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,238
was how to help the victims get revenge,

411
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,908
and it was my mission to do so.

412
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,212
The truth, the press,

413
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,714
justice, family of the victim.

414
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,959
In the end…

415
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:27,532
maybe I haven't changed at all
the whole time.

416
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,070
No, you haven't changed at all.

417
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,274
But what's wrong with that?

418
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,750
You seem to have mistaken something,
so I'll say a word.

419
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,555
The documentary you produced
was simply of bad quality.

420
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:55,026
There was no scientific evidence
and it only relied on guesses.

421
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,795
You didn't verify the facts enough either.

422
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,364
It's crap.

423
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,502
But I don't deny that
you have enthusiasm and passion.

424
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,440
That's exactly why

425
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,042
I still help Kurokawa
with his unreasonable requests.

426
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,982
In that case, be nicer to me.

427
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,085
Don't be such a baby.
Emotion and reason are different.

428
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,689
Hey!

429
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,393
Shikine, are you okay? Hey!

430
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,663
Mr. Shikine.

431
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,534
Mr. Kurokawa and Miss Wakura.

432
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,935
Are you okay?

433
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:42,307
Well, my body doesn't do
what I want it to now.

434
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,112
I can't be lying in bed. It will be
my daughter's birthday soon.

435
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,480
Yes?

436
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,984
I'm thinking about buying her
the bicycle that she wants,

437
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,354
but my wife says it's expensive
and told me to buy something else.

438
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,324
That's right!

439
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,327
I have to buy her a cake too.

440
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,797
Our neighbors' children will come
to her birthday party.

441
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,533
I hope she'll celebrate it
with lots of friends.

442
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,003
Mr. Shikine, actually…

443
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,741
Mr. Shikine,

444
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,344
how old will your daughter be?

445
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,947
Ten years old.

446
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,184
She started to become
a little rebellious lately

447
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,119
and she doesn't talk to me a lot.

448
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,988
Is that so?

449
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,859
But I'm sure she'll be happy
if you buy her a bicycle.

450
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,194
You think she will?

451
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,364
I have to convince my wife, then.

452
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,534
A bicycle will make her happy, right?

453
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,039
Since the interview the other day…

454
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,543
I've been thinking
that he wasn't all right.

455
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,680
I think he has Ganser syndrome.

456
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,183
Ganser syndrome?

457
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,820
He's been living in prison for a long time

458
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,322
and lost contact with the outside world…

459
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,392
so he is mentally exhausted…

460
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,196
and is trapped in his fantasy
and his past memories.

461
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,132
Especially for death row inmates,

462
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,337
they're facing the fear of not
knowing when they will be executed.

463
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,257
Mr. Kurokawa.

464
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,561
Eleven years ago…

465
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,869
my childhood friend killed himself
after he was found guilty.

466
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,546
"If he were still alive…"

467
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,584
It's what I always think.

468
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,824
We would find a way if he were alive.

469
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,702
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

470
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:29,374
I received this today after all these.

471
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,943
The written appointment
of defense counsel is attached.

472
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,111
Thanks.

473
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,414
I wrote a letter to tell him
that I'd ask you to reinvestigate it

474
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,317
and asked him to agree to have
a retrial. This is his reply.

475
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,186
Looking at the date,

476
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,421
it seems that he wrote it
before you went to see him.

477
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,091
He wrote it before he had Ganser syndrome.

478
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,195
THANK YOU, MISS ARIMA

479
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,464
I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE

480
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,766
FEBRUARY 27, 2019, HIROMITSU SHIKINE

481
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,305
Miss Arima, Mr. Shikine did feel
your enthusiasm.

482
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,575
Should we start filing
an appeal for retrial?

483
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,043
No.

484
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,346
Only the photos of the crime
reconstruction aren't enough.

485
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,583
We have to find some new facts
that are more important.

486
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,284
Let's inspect the documents again.

487
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,054
Mr. Kurokawa, get all the documents
in your room here too.

488
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,056
Okay, I'll do it now. Excuse me.

489
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,158
-I'll help you.
-Thank you.

490
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,695
Miss Wakura is working towards

491
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,464
the same direction as Mr. Kurokawa
without us realizing it.

492
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,599
Yeah.

493
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,435
I'll go to see the people involved again.

494
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,037
Miss Wakura.

495
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,374
-Mr. Kurokawa, cool down a bit.
-Oh, thank you.

496
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,913
Have some tea, Mr. Yufuin.

497
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,684
"The ghost at the swamp?"

498
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,685
What?

499
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,688
Miss Arima got this letter in June
eight years ago,

500
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:55,026
when a park was built on the swamp
where the bottle was disposed of.

501
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,128
Did you find something curious?

502
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:02,100
"I read a news article that says
a park will be built on the swamp."

503
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,703
<i>That reminds me. My daughter</i>
<i>had told me something in the past.</i>

504
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,973
<i>Rumor has it that</i>
<i>there was a ghost at the swamp.</i>

505
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,342
<i>A large shadow floated on the swamp</i>

506
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,711
<i>and you would die if you saw it.</i>

507
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,848
"My daughter was very frightened.

508
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,150
The ghost story is an innocent one,

509
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:23,154
but I think it will disappear
along with the swamp."

510
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,590
"You die if you see it?"

511
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,198
What's the matter, Miss Wakura?

512
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,000
Mr. Shiobara wrote some notes
when he interviewed the children.

513
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,435
Where are they?

514
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,171
Oh, I think the notebook is on my desk.

515
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,509
Miss Wakura!

516
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,944
Found it!

517
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,379
Have a look at this.

518
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,217
"A crying girl."

519
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,085
Has it got anything to do with that?

520
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:15,540
Miss Wakura, this could be
important evidence!

521
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,546
If rubbish had been disposed of
around this area…

522
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,248
The swamp is ahead.

523
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,551
I knew it!

524
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,520
The girl saw a ghost because she was here.

525
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,556
The problem is who saw it.

526
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,025
Let's check with Miss Matsugashita.

527
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,865
-Sorry for coming so late.
-Sorry.

528
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,800
What's the matter? I'm busy.

529
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,838
Please tell us about the ghost
at the swamp near the company houses.

530
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,606
-A ghost?
-Well…

531
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,375
When you were in primary school
and the murder happened,

532
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,510
there was a rumor that there was
a ghost at the swamp, right?

533
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,780
It was too long ago and I don't remember.

534
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,015
Wait…

535
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,150
Do you remember the day of the murder?

536
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,087
Didn't a girl who lived in
the same neighborhood tell you that

537
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,956
she saw a ghost at the swamp?

538
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,995
If we know who she is, maybe we can
clear your father's false charges.

539
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,498
What?

540
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,036
Excuse me. Why are we here?

541
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,171
You'll know if you come.

542
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,708
Yumi Haruna?

543
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,476
Reiko?

544
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,046
Why?

545
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,048
They asked me to come here.

546
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,917
We will tell you the details inside.

547
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,299
-The things are ready.
-Okay.

548
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,308
I am sorry about the other day.

549
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,980
Will you explain everything to me now?

550
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,083
What are you going to do here?

551
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,787
What do you think this is?

552
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:10,888
What?

553
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,759
-Water?
-We reconstructed the swamp.

554
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:21,833
The swamp one kilometer away,
which is a park now.

555
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,135
What do you do this for?

556
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,170
You'll know when you see it.

557
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,405
Please come with me.

558
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,179
Miss Haruna, please stand here.

559
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,149
Look in front of you.

560
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,397
On the day of the murder,

561
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,601
you saw the same thing as this
at the swamp, didn't you,

562
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,537
Miss Haruna?

563
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,905
What was that?

564
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:37,675
It is called a Brocken specter.

565
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,211
Brocken specter?

566
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,548
When there is fog on top of a mountain

567
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,751
and strong light is shone from
behind the observer,

568
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,487
<i>water droplets in the air</i>
<i>refracts the light</i>

569
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:54,892
<i>and forms a rainbow-colored halo</i>
<i>around the observer's shadow.</i>

570
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,262
The phenomenon frightened people
and it was called Brocken-Gespenst,

571
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,433
but actually,
it also occurs on level ground

572
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,901
under specific conditions.

573
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,840
For example, in the evening,
when temperature drops rapidly

574
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,243
<i>and a dense fog forms</i>
<i>on waters like a swamp.</i>

575
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,179
<i>If there is no wind,</i>
<i>other conditions are met</i>

576
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,014
<i>and the light</i>
<i>of the setting sun is strong,</i>

577
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,183
<i>the same phenomenon can be observed.</i>

578
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,285
I'm not surprised that

579
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,489
children would think that
it really was a monster.

580
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:26,924
The experiment is done.

581
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,265
This is the data of the weather
of the day of the murder.

582
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,369
Temperature dropped rapidly after 4 p.m.

583
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:44,041
There was only half an hour
after that with no fog and no wind.

584
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,246
The setting sun was shining
on the swamp at that time.

585
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,282
If you had seen the ghost,

586
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,586
it shows that you were at
the rubbish dump at the swamp

587
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,890
from 4 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
when all conditions were met.

588
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,426
Wait a minute. Why did you go there?

589
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,895
Miss Haruna.

590
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,499
The report says that
on the day of the murder,

591
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,070
you were at home with your mother
until the party started.

592
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,742
But you actually went to the swamp.

593
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,213
You went there to dispose of the bottle

594
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,682
that contained potassium cyanide.

595
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,088
Yumi?

596
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,925
Is that true?

597
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,532
I am sorry.

598
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,237
Reiko.

599
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,140
I am sorry.

600
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,044
I am sorry.

601
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,954
My mother told me to go there
and dispose of the bottle.

602
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,389
My father was laid off,

603
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,593
<i>then my mother started to work at</i>
<i>Itoe Electric's factory</i>

604
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,261
<i>and we moved to the company's house.</i>

605
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:15,933
<i>But our family became a mess</i>
<i>because of my violent father.</i>

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,739
<i>That day, my mother didn't allow me</i>
<i>to join the Christmas party,</i>

607
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,907
<i>but in the evening…</i>

608
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:27,745
Go and throw this away
at the rubbish dump at the swamp.

609
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:32,116
After you do this job for me,
you can go to the Christmas party.

610
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,151
Wear gloves.

611
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,154
Make sure you don't touch it directly.

612
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:42,226
I went to the swamp as I was told
and disposed of the bottle.

613
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,898
It was when I saw the ghost at the swamp.

614
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,037
<i>Then, when I came back,</i>
<i>the murder happened.</i>

615
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,074
<i>My mother probably wanted to kill</i>
<i>my father so much that she did that.</i>

616
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:03,614
I didn't realize that
I helped her destroy evidence

617
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,551
until after a very long time.

618
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,389
What the heck?

619
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,094
What was the last 24 years
of my life, then?

620
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:24,302
I wrongly assumed
that my father was a murderer…

621
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,608
and I spent all the time hating him,
until now.

622
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,820
CLOSED HEARING OF APPEAL FOR RETRIAL

623
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,891
My mother worked part-time
for Itoe Electric,

624
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:50,628
at General Affairs Section,
like Mr. Shikine.

625
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,901
It should be very easy for her…

626
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,871
to get the potassium cyanide.

627
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,643
In other words, you're saying that
your mother, Azusa Haruna,

628
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,712
was the culprit
who poisoned the champagne?

629
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,182
Why did you keep quiet about this?

630
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,017
I…

631
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,756
I felt guilty about this…

632
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,960
but I swept it under the carpet.

633
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:29,166
My mother passed away
ten years after the murder.

634
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,168
And…

635
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:39,243
I tried to convince myself that
the case was over.

636
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,146
Also…

637
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,283
I thought it would be okay
if I kept quiet.

638
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,855
For my mother's sake,

639
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:57,561
I thought I shouldn't let anyone know
about the crime we committed.

640
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,465
We know your story clearly now.

641
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,202
We will have a careful discussion
about this case again

642
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,471
and inform you our decision later.

643
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,443
We hope you would give this
a very serious consideration.

644
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,847
Because the witness statement
is very clear.

645
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,851
The court will decide whether
the statement is clear or not.

646
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,324
Your Honor.

647
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,396
May I say a few words before we finish?

648
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,931
Go ahead.

649
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,141
The reason that…

650
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,712
Miss Yumi Haruna came today
to make this painful statement

651
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,115
is because…

652
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,820
she cares about Mr. Shikine
and his daughter.

653
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,026
She can't let them remain
a death row inmate

654
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,263
and the daughter of a death row inmate.

655
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,603
The incident happened 24 years ago.

656
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:20,478
Maybe many people in the world
have already forgotten about the case,

657
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,446
<i>but Mr. Shikine</i>

658
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,950
<i>and his daughter Reiko</i>
<i>have never forgotten about it.</i>

659
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,353
Mr. Shikine wants help now.

660
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,760
Reiko is suffering because of
the false charges against her father.

661
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,669
Mr. Hiromitsu Shikine is innocent.

662
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,975
Even though he cannot take back
the 24 years he lost,

663
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,278
taking away the future he has…

664
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,948
would be unforgivable.

665
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,384
Please don't be biased by
the wrong conviction in the past

666
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,389
and make a decision based on the truth.

667
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,460
We strongly hope you would do so.

668
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,965
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

669
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,267
I took it out!

670
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,236
<i>The next story.</i>

671
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,272
<i>An appeal for a retrial</i>

672
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,742
<i>of the Itoe Electric Company House</i>
<i>Murder Case 24 years ago</i>

673
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,611
<i>was dismissed by the court.</i>

674
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,879
Dismissed?

675
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,814
The locked door

676
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,552
didn't open this time too.

677
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,387
This is what happened.

678
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,556
It's disappointing.

679
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,628
"The appeal for a retrial is dismissed."

680
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,497
The reason is,

681
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,667
"No new evidence found
has been clear enough

682
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,837
to declare appellant innocent."

683
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,250
It's so bitter!

684
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,938
Reiko.

685
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,824
Reiko?

686
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:54,865
Are you Reiko?

687
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,067
Dad.

688
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,169
I…

689
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,773
I am sorry!

690
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,346
It must have been tough for you.

691
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,617
Dad!

692
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,855
I am sorry!

693
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:24,628
I'm sorry that I couldn't trust you.

694
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,699
I am sorry.

695
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,479
You have grown up.

696
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,484
Reiko.

697
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,055
Reiko.

698
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,628
Reiko.

699
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,943
COURTHOUSE

700
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,999
THE DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

701
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,501
THE FINAL CHAPTER

702
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,870
<i>A murder that is very similar</i>
<i>to the one 11 years ago.</i>

703
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,472
<i>I want to investigate thoroughly</i>
<i>and defend you.</i>

704
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,440
<i>The two separations that came.</i>

705
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,575
Maybe it can be settled.

706
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,376
Who killed her, then?

707
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,579
<i>I think I can share your pain.</i>

708
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,014
-<i>Mr. Kurokawa!</i>
-<i>Miss Wakura!</i>

709
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,417
I never wanted to kill anyone!

710
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,587
<i>The murderer is another person</i>
<i>and they incriminated someone.</i>

711
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,089
<i>Maybe probatio diabolica is possible.</i>

712
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,657
<i>If he really was innocent,</i>

713
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,860
I wish he hadn't killed himself
and stayed alive.

714
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,462
You don't know how cold a dead body is.
