<i>Eleven years ago,</i>

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,538
<i>on December 16, 2007,</i>

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>in a ruin in Kanagawa Prefecture,</i>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,478
<i>the dead body of a young woman</i>
<i>covered in stab wounds was found.</i>

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,481
<i>She was identified as 20-year-old</i>
<i>Ayaka Akiu from her belongings.</i>

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,217
<i>Ayaka was stabbed in her chest</i>
<i>and stomach six times</i>

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,387
<i>and a hole was dug deep into her throat.</i>

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,822
<i>The police arrested her boyfriend,</i>

<i>Touo University second-year</i>
<i>science and engineering student</i>

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,793
<i>Daisuke Asama.</i>

11
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,597
<i>After he was arrested, Asama</i>
<i>denied the charges until the end,</i>

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,333
<i>but the victim's blood was detected</i>
<i>on the shoes and clothes</i>

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,068
<i>in his locker at the university.</i>

14
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,904
<i>Asama is obsessed with ruins,</i>
<i>and from his laptop,</i>

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,140
<i>photos of the crime scene were found.</i>

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,675
<i>Asama was prosecuted</i>
<i>due to the many physical</i>

17
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,676
<i>and circumstantial pieces of evidence.</i>

18
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,914
<i>He was sentenced to life in prison</i>
<i>in Yokohama District Court's trial.</i>

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,683
<i>He did not make an appeal and…</i>

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,862
I AM INNOCENT

21
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,499
<i>…it had been reported that</i>

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,335
<i>the victim was being stalked at that time.</i>

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,637
WE HAVE INFO THAT SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT STALKING AT THE TIME

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,774
<i>Was the court's decision</i>
<i>to find her boyfriend, Asama, guilty</i>

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,544
<i>actually the correct one?</i>

HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

27
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,909
-Let's have lunch now.
-I'll make some tea.

28
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,346
-Mr. Kurokawa, actually…
-Yes?

29
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,484
I bought too much food,
so I packed one extra lunch box.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,286
Would you like to have it?
It is the day before payday.

31
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,189
Thank you.

32
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,959
Let's have lunch together, then.

33
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,328
Sorry, I'd like to do some studying alone.

34
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,104
I guess not today either.

35
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,307
What is it? Kurokawa shut himself
in his room again?

36
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,577
I was going to treat him
to grilled meat for lunch.

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,747
Wait. That's my idea.
And I would've been the one to pay.

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,782
I want kalbi.

39
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,153
It seems the dismissal of the appeal
for a retrial the other day

40
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,854
is still affecting him.

41
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,858
<i>It made him realize</i>

42
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,929
<i>how difficult it is to reinspect</i>
<i>a case from the past.</i>

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,502
So, Mr. Kurokawa wants to inspect
the case from 11 years ago again?

44
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,505
He should be thinking about
a posthumous retrial.

45
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,876
But isn't that more difficult
than a regular retrial?

46
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,981
-Oh, Ms. Arima.
-Hello.

47
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:02,949
What's the matter?

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,785
-Where's Kurokawa?
-He's in his room.

49

TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

50
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,863
Oh, Ms. Arima. Good afternoon.

51
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,135
Do you know that February murder
in a riverbed in Ota City?

52
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,007
I think a young woman was killed
and her body was found?

53
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:32,212
I saw on the news that
the suspect was arrested already.

54
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,047
The victim was stalked, right?

55
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,951
Yes, the guy confessed to his crime
and has been prosecuted.

56
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,955
But there is a problem.

57
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,457
I can't tell you where I got this,

58
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,794
but it's a photo
of the wound on the victim.

59
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,096
She was stabbed in her throat.

60
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,065
Don't you think it looks like

61
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,435
the stab wound on Ayaka Akiu
from the case 11 years ago?

62
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,482
That's…

63
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,118
TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT MURDER CASE

64
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,597
I want to investigate the case
thoroughly and fight.

65
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,133
<i>When my son is in agony…</i>

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,302
<i>Please be there for him.</i>

67
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,770
It may not necessarily be the same.

68
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,406
<i>Maybe we can clear Senior Asama's</i>
<i>false charges and avenge Ayaka!</i>

69
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,540
Who killed her, then?

70
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,943
<i>You and I are fundamentally different.</i>

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,282
<i>The murder happened on</i>
<i>February 6, 2019, around 1 p.m.</i>

72
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,684
<i>Under an overhead railway</i>
<i>in Tamagawa, Ota City,</i>

73
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>21-year-old Kyoka Hanamaki,</i>
<i>student of an arts university in Tokyo,</i>

74
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,522
<i>was found stabbed to death.</i>

75
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,758
<i>Before the murder,</i>

76
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,494
<i>the victim had been stalked by someone,</i>

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,297
<i>and she had reported it</i>
<i>to the police several times.</i>

78
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,197
<i>After the investigation,</i>

79
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,434
<i>a worker at an auto parts factory</i>
<i>near the victim's home,</i>

80
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,504
<i>33-year-old Junpei Fujita,</i>
<i>was deemed the suspect.</i>

81
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,440
<i>The victim's student ID card</i>
<i>was found in Fujita's home.</i>

82

KYOKA HANAMAKI

83
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>A sketchbook stained with blood was found</i>

84
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,513
<i>at a rubbish dump</i>
<i>near the auto parts factory.</i>

85
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,181
<i>I did not do it.</i>

86
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,751
But we heard that you confessed to murder.

87
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
During questioning,

88
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,090
the detective kept torturing me,
so I had to.

89
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,594
But you admit that you
had been stalking the victim, right?

90
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,832
I only watched her from far away.

91
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,271
<i>I fell in love with her when I first</i>
<i>saw her sketching in the park.</i>

92
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,107
Since then, I started taking photos of her

93
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,277
and wandered around near her home.

94
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,745
But I wasn't a stalker.

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,615
Hundreds of photos of her

96
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,019
that you took secretly were found
on the laptop at your home, right?

97
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,789
Also, her student ID card
and a sketchbook stained with blood.

98
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,126
I picked up her student ID card
in the park.

99
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,562
I wanted to give it back to her,

100
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,464
but I wasn't brave enough to talk to her.

101
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,168
But I really don't know anything
about the sketchbook.

102
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,177
Mr. Fujita,

103
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,980
you're from Ibaraki Prefecture, right?

104
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,849
Yes.

105
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,153
My parents had passed away,
so I don't really go back.

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,988
After finishing high school,

107
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,557
you left your hometown
and started working part-time.

108
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,159
When you were 22 years old,

109
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,262
that is, 11 years ago,
you lived in Kanagawa.

110
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,565
Yes, I did.

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,536
Eleven years ago,

112
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,140
there was also a female university student
murdered in Kanagawa.

113
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,845
This case is similar to the one
11 years ago in many ways.

114
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,980
What?

115
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,853
Mr. Fujita.

116
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,257
Eleven years ago,

117
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,427
on December 15, 2007…

118
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,030
where were you, and what were you doing?

119
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,065
Mr. Kurokawa.

120
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,534
What the heck?

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,003
Do you suspect me?

122
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,304
Please calm down.

123
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,741
Don't be ridiculous!

124
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,545
I was told that a lawyer
who isn't court-appointed would come,

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,712
and I expected better!

126
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,414
This is very important.

127
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,217
Please answer my question.

128
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,721
How would I remember
something from so long ago?

129
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,326
I did not kill anyone!

130
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,095
Not 11 years ago and not now!

131
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,203
All right, then.

132
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,906
Mr. Fujita.

133
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,643
Please let me defend you

134
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,113
as your defense lawyer.

135
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,915
Yes?

136
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,350
I personally…

137
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,255
want to investigate the case
thoroughly and fight.

138
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,494
Mr. Kurokawa.

139
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,429
You never know.

140
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,101
We won't know whether it's related
to the case 11 years ago or not

141
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,936
if we don't investigate it.

142
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,039
For now, there are three…

143
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,842
no, there are four possibilities.

144
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,178
Four possibilities?

145
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,181
One, it's just a coincidence.

146
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,051
Whether Fujita was the murderer
this time or not,

147
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,920
the victim's neck wound and the case

148
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,355
just happened to be similar.

149
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,491
The second possibility is a copycat.

150
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,228
But the wound wasn't revealed
to the public in the case 11 years ago.

151
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,731
Everyone involved knew about it.

152
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,267
The people in the investigation
organizations, the press,

153
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,602
and, of course, the victim's family too.

154
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,406
And…

155
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,676
Fujita could be involved in this murder

156
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,445
and the one 11 years ago.

157
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,180
The fourth and last one

158
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:12,151
is the real murderer is another person
and they deflected blame.

159
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,354
This time, on the man Fujita…

160
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,758
and on Daisuke Asama 11 years ago.

161
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,196
But the probability of that
is significantly low.

162
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,499
Even if the same person
committed both murders,

163
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,035
they have no reason to wait for 11 years.

164
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,272
Go now if you've finished
what you want to say.

165
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,713
Kurokawa will be in charge of this case.

166
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,517
If the probability isn't zero,

167
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,754
I'll investigate it thoroughly too.

168
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,812
<i>Kyoichiro.</i>

169
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,148
It's the photo we took the other day.

170
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,918
Please put it in your lab.

171
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,486
It's stupid. I don't want it.

172
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,423
You made me go and hang out
with you and I didn't want to.

173
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,992
That's a pack of lies.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,160
You had quite a lot of fun.

175
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,430
Mr. Akiu, you've been
shutting yourself in your lab.

176
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,099
Isn't it nice to go out for a change?

177
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,935
And you two go out too often.

178
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,570
A student's duty is to study.

179
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,405
Okay, we know that.

180
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,907
We'll go have lunch now. Take it.

181
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,310
-Let's go, Daisuke!
-Sorry, Mr. Akiu!

182
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,825
Hello?

183
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,529
<i>Dr. Kyoichiro Akiu, I presume?</i>

184
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,497
Speaking.

185
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,699
I am the Public Prosecutors Office's
Kurokawa.

186
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,069
Sorry about calling suddenly.

187
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,774
Actually, I would like to meet you
personally and talk about something.

188
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,813
It's somewhere around here?

189
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:22,948
On that security camera,

190
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,952
the victim who came here to sketch
and the suspect who was watching her

191
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,156
were caught eight times in a month.

192
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,995
He said that he found her
student ID card in this park too.

193
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,130
Two weeks before the murder,

194
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,001
they wrote these on their respective
social media accounts.

195
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,202
This is the victim's.

196
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,604
KYOKA: OH, NO. I LOST
MY STUDENT ID CARD… HOW AWFUL

197
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,907
This is the suspect's.

198
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,508
FUJITA: I FOUND SOMETHING AMAZING

199
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,243
SHOULD I KEEP IT OR MAKE IT MY TREASURE?

200
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,445
Excuse me.

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,784
FUJITA: THE SETTING SUN

202
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,292
It's here.

203
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,128
Besides the photos of the victims
Fujita secretly took, this photo

204
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,697
caught the prosecutor's attention too.

205
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,500
He thought Fujita came to check out
where he'd commit murder.

206
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,503
-It's unnatural.
-Yes?

207
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,873
If he really was the murderer,

208
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,044
would he upload a photo that might
make people suspect him on purpose?

209
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,884
You mean the prosecutor prosecuted
Fujita without a proper reason?

210
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,056
The same thing happened
in the case 11 years ago.

211
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,826
At that time,

212
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,231
just because Asama had been
to the ruin where Ayaka was killed,

213
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,933
the prosecutor concluded
that he went to check out the place.

214
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:57,209
I'm sorry, but please return
to the office without me.

215
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,410
What are you going to do?

216
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,981
I want to think alone. I'm sorry.

217
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,752
Is Mr. Kurokawa all right?

218
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,427
He always does things his own way.
I do wonder who he is like!

219
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,663
-Yes, exactly!
-Oh!

220
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,834
Oh, Ms. Wakura! It's been a while
since we last saw each other!

221
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,102
Your friend?

222
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,070
This is Mr. Kurokawa's mother.

223
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,872
This is the first time we've met, right?

224
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,774
I am Taku's mother.

225
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,810
Thank you for helping my son.

226
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,211
I am Kinosaki.

227
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,780
Mr. Kurokawa is the one
who helps me a lot.

228
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,517
What's the matter?

229
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,756
You look like the ducklings
that float in a bathtub!

230
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,357
You're so adorable!

231
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,095
Thank you… I think?

232
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,032
What are you here for today?

233
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,603
I'm here because I haven't been here
to say hello so far,

234
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,739
but Taku is out, so I thought
I would leave at once,

235
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,141
but our conversation got lively!

236
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,577
Yeah, it's been an hour.

237
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,147
Well, two hours already.

238
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,015
-Two hours…
-Two hours…

239
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:10,916
Yes?

240
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,985
Ms. Wakura, do you have a minute?

241
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,890
Ms. Wakura, where is Kurokawa?

242
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,226
He wants to think alone,
so we came back first.

243
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,362
In that case, we'll count on you
to entertain his mom until she leaves.

244
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,363
What?

245
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,732
She is nice and cheerful,

246
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,201
but she keeps going on and on.

247
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,269
We can't even work,

248
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,340
but we can't be rude to the wife
of the SPO's Deputy Prosecutor-General.

249
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,243
I think she likes you pretty much.

250
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,510
She likes me?

251
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,280
Mr. Kurokawa just brought me
to his home against my will

252
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,848
and I only had supper there once.

253
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,784
But from what we've heard,
that isn't the case.

254
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,287
-She mentioned engagement gifts.
-Engagement?

255
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,024
She also talked about the colors
of dresses you'd wear for the wedding.

256
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,192
Dresses? Wedding?

257
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,294
And she wants to have grandchildren soon.

258
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,962
Grandchildren!

259
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,163
Ms. Wakura,

260
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,670
I would like to have a brief look
at the room Taku lives in.

261
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,804
Do you mind?

262
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,441
But I'm not the person
that you should ask.

263
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,311
It's not a problem at all! I give you
the right as the head of the office.

264
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,013
Ms. Wakura, please take Mrs.…

265
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,749
I mean, Kurokawa's mother there!

266
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,550
-Please take her there.
-Please take her there.

267
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,290
-Well then, please follow me.
-Okay.

268
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,693
That's right. Show her the way…

269
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,499
Wow!

270
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,534
My, my…

271
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,104
I think he should tidy up
the place a little, though.

272
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,072
Yeah.

273
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,777
Oh, this…

274
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:45,778
TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT MURDER CASE

275
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,615
It's Dai's case 11 years ago.

276
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,849
Dai?

277
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,055
You know Mr. Daisuke Asama?

278
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,359
He was Taku's best friend.

279
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,862
His mother was my friend too.

280
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,868
This case was what shaped
Taku's current way of life

281
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,771
and his relationship with his father too.

282
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,315
ASAMA FAMILY GRAVE

283
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,396
Dai was two years older than Taku.

284
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,735
<i>Taku was a shy boy and Dai was like</i>
<i>his reliable elder brother.</i>

285
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,936
Let's do it!

286
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:49,775
<i>I think Dai had a great influence</i>
<i>on Taku's current way of life.</i>

287
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,985
I AM INNOCENT.

288
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:04,323
Taku was serious to a fault to begin with

289
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,992
and he didn't like to do things
differently than others.

290
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,261
Until the murder happened,

291
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,365
he aimed to be a public prosecutor,
like his father.

292
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,137
Is that why
Deputy Prosecutor-General Kurokawa

293
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,509
is not happy about Mr. Kurokawa
defending criminal case suspects?

294
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,247
My husband complains about various things,

295
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,384
but it doesn't mean he thinks
that Taku's way of life is wrong.

296
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:39,291
Instead, he worries about Taku
more than anyone else.

297
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,994
And he cheers for Taku.

298
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,232
They are in different positions,

299
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,868
but the enthusiasm
they both have for their work

300
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,238
must be the same.

301
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,276
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

302
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,878
It's the first time
we're meeting like this,

303
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,014
Dr. Akiu.

304
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,217
How can I help you?

305
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,985
Please have a look at this.
It's the confidential document

306
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,457
we have and it hasn't been revealed.

307
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,926
Directly under the Prosecutors Office?

308
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,761
As you know, currently,

309
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,164
we decide whether we prosecute
someone or not based on

310
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,366
the evidence provided by the police.

311
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,168
But there are many problems too.

312
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,436
Their investigation relies

313
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,905
on circumstantial evidence and confessions

314
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,074
or their inspection is careless
and lacks scientific proof.

315
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,643
To improve these,

316
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,047
Mr. Kurokawa plans to set up
this investigation organization.

317
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,084
We would like you to join it
as one of the leading members.

318
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,954
Why me?

319
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:47,059
The reason that Taku Kurokawa
has been able to win these cases so far

320
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,927
is because you've been helping him.

321
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,230
Dr. Akiu,

322
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,999
since the case from 11 years ago,

323
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,636
you've been having doubts about
how investigations are conducted,

324
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,338
and I understand that.

325
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,408
But the feelings you and my son have

326
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,578
may not necessarily be the same.

327
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,480
Am I right?

328
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,191
KILL ME TOO

329
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,726
MURDERER

330
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,397
Thank you for coming.

331
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,870
-Sorry, I stayed too long.
-Don't worry about it.

332
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,240
But you really aren't going to see
Mr. Kurokawa?

333
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,508
Ms. Wakura.

334
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,978
Please continue to help Taku.

335
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,185
When my son is in agony,

336
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,154
please be there for him.

337
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,891
I'm counting on you.

338
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,994
I will.

339
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,999
See you! I will come again!

340
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,378
Welcome back.

341
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,048
Have you been waiting for me?

342
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,382
Yeah.

343
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,689
My mother texted just now.

344
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,090
Seems that she had been bothering you.

345
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,792
No.

346
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,703
So?

347
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,505
Yes?

348
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,978
You said you wanted to think alone,
so I've been waiting.

349
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,214
I thought you wanted a listener
after organizing your thoughts.

350
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,087
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,492
Sorry that I kept you waiting,
but I haven't organized my thoughts.

352
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,162
It doesn't have to be organized.

353
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,867
Maybe you'll feel relieved
after you tell me.

354
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,403
Moreover…

355
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,541
I don't know whether I can give you
support when you're in agony,

356
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,212
but I think I can share your pain.

357
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,885
By investigating this case,

358
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,023
you want to grasp some clues
about the case 11 years ago, right?

359
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,903
I think we only have to find
the real murderer.

360
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,906
But…

361
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,977
this idea has a problem, right?

362
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,413
Why do you say that?

363
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,884
Because I wanted to believe…

364
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,554
that Senior Asama was innocent.

365
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,528
After I became a lawyer…

366
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,465
no matter who the suspect
or the accused was…

367
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,636
I've always thought that we had to
find out the truth by investigating.

368
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,207
That's why I know it in my head.

369
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,979
Whether Senior Asama is innocent or not…

370
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,316
is actually unknown.

371
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,189
But if he really was innocent…

372
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,428
I wish he hadn't killed himself
and stayed alive.

373
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:54,473
Sorry, my thoughts are a mess
and they're unorganized.

374
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,146
What's wrong with that?

375
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,615
Yes?

376
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,292
You want to trust him,
but you don't know the truth.

377
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,962
That's why we'll investigate.

378
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,565
What's wrong with that?

379
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,903
That's what you've been doing so far.

380
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,978
Let's first handle the murder
that happened recently.

381
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,981
If Mr. Fujita is falsely charged,

382
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,449
that means the murderer is someone else

383
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,920
and that person could be the real culprit
of the murder 11 years ago.

384
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,190
And then

385
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,426
you'll be able…

386
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,830
to clear Mr. Asama
of the false charges 11 years ago.

387
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,939
You are right.

388
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,610
We have no time to stop here.

389
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,213
We'll do the pretrial conference
procedure soon.

390
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,226
What's the matter?

391
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:30,869
Nothing.

392
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,014
The phone is ringing.

393
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,018
Okay.

394
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,657
Hello. Hoshundo Law Office.

395
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,927
Oh, Ms. Arima?

396
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,129
What?

397
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,399
A second dead body?

398
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,405
<i>A young woman was found dead</i>
<i>on a mountain in Ibaraki Prefecture.</i>

399
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:11,009
<i>The MPD arrested the suspect</i>
<i>Junpei Fujita again,</i>

400
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,711
-<i>who was charged with another murder…</i>
-See you.

401
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,745
-Goodbye.
-See you.

402
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,716
<i>18-year-old Nana Yamashiro's body</i>
<i>was found a month after she died.</i>

403
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,585
Nana Yamashiro was killed first.

404
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,786
NANA YAMASHIRO: DIED ON 4 FEB
KYOKA HANAMAKI: DIED ON 6 FEB

405
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,890
The case suddenly drew attention
as a serial murder.

406
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,160
But Fujita denies killing both of them.

407
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,497
The shape of the weapon matches
the wound on their necks

408
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,232
and what Fujita did at that time too.

409
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,471
Yamashiro's estimated time of death

410
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,773
was between 3 and 5 February,

411
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,508
and he suddenly returned to Ibaraki.

412
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,280
But would he kill someone while
on a trip to visit his parents' grave?

413
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,883
Maybe he went to visit their grave
while he was there to murder?

414
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:01,693
Nana Yamashiro was a runaway girl
from Ibaraki.

415
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,763
After she left high school
half a year ago,

416
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,166
she left home and lived in Tokyo.

417
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,802
You don't know her, do you?

418
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,338
I don't know her at all.

419
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,843
You went back to Ibaraki around
the period of time she was murdered.

420
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,612
Did you come into contact with her?

421
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,784
Will things be easier for me
if I admit to the crime?

422
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,821
I've been telling him
that I didn't kill her,

423
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,657
but the detective shouts at me every day.

424
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,694
My sleeping hours are cut down.

425
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,563
If I say that I did it,

426
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,401
will I be relieved from this situation?

427
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,506
Please don't give up, Mr. Fujita.

428
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:55,547
In addition to Kyoka Hanamaki's murder,

429
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,250
the prosecutor will charge you
with Nana Yamashiro's murder too.

430
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,222
But I think we can still fight.

431
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,159
The police and the prosecutor

432
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,462
think your motive
for murdering Kyoka Hanamaki

433
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,398
had something to do with
you being her stalker.

434
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,500
In that case,

435
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,070
you would have no motive for killing
Nana Yamashiro, who you didn't know.

436
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,707
But you can't prove it, can you?

437
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,012
You can't prove that

438
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,781
I really don't know the girl at all.

439
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,750
We will look for clues.

440
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,888
So, Mr. Fujita, please don't give up.

441
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,031
Okay, we have come as far as Ibaraki.

442
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,099
It's freezing here.

443
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,102
It must be even colder at the crime scene.

444
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,739
It's impossible to find clues to prove
that he didn't know Yamashiro.

445
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,841
It's the so-called probatio diabolica.

446
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,176
Probatio diabolica?

447
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,478
It's easy to prove something that exists.

448
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,783
For example, if we want to prove
Mr. Fujita had seen the victim,

449
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,852
we only have to look for witnesses
or security camera videos.

450
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,290
But if we want to prove
that he had never seen the victim…

451
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,827
There is no evidence, right?
They'd never met in the first place.

452
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,829
That's why, basically, it's impossible.

453
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,900
Maybe we'll notice something
when we go to the scene of the murder.

454
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,370
IBARAKI MOUNT KEIYA MOUNTAIN TRAIL

455
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,178
-Oh…
-Watch your steps, Mr. Kurokawa!

456
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,079
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,048
Excuse me. There aren't any bears
around here, are there?

458
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,253
I think there are Asian black bears,
but they should be hibernating.

459
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,723
-What?
-What?

460
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,130
There's a lemon field nearby.

461
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,766
Let's go and ask
if anyone had seen anything.

462
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,634
Okay.

463
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,769
Thank you.

464
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,138
-Thank you.
-Wait, young man. It's for you.

465
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,139
Thank you, ma'am.

466
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,841
We didn't gain anything.

467
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,442
But I've gained a lot.

468
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,710
Look!

469
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,980
We aren't here for fun.

470
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,617
But it's really amazing

471
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,520
that lemons can grow
in the cold weather on the mountain.

472
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,457
No, the farmer told me just now
that this area is special.

473
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,093
The temperature
doesn't drop much at night.

474
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,529
Not even at night?

475
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>It's impossible to find clues to prove</i>
<i>that he didn't know Yamashiro.</i>

476
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,668
<i>It's the so-called probatio diabolica.</i>

477
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,906
<i>Would he kill someone while</i>
<i>on a trip to visit his parents' grave?</i>

478
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,377
Mr. Kurokawa!

479
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,780
What's the matter?

480
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,161
Mr. Isawa, you did an excellent job.

481
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,266
Maybe probatio diabolica is possible.

482
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,639
FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

483
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,041
-Pan it.
-Okay.

484
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,544
TOUO UNIVERSITY

485
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,848
Dr. Akiu, thanks for helping us today.

486
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,790
It's the base station. Launch the balloon.

487
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,891
Roger that.

488
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,060
IBARAKI MOUNT KEIYA MOUNTAIN TRAIL

489
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,873
We launched the balloon
to measure the temperature.

490
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,877
The temperature is minus one degrees C
at 50 meters above ground,

491
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,379
but at 300 meters above ground,
where the body was found,

492
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,881
it's five degrees Celsius higher.

493
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,250
Just as I thought.

494
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,852
Why does that happen?

495
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:57,522
It's a natural phenomenon
called a thermal belt.

496
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,590
THERMAL BELT

497
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,657
On a clear night,

498
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,660
<i>cold air flows down the mountain slope</i>

499
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,029
<i>and the air on the ground cooled</i>
<i>by radiative cooling</i>

500
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,497
<i>stays on the ground.</i>

501
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,634
<i>The layer of cool air stops</i>
<i>after it reaches a certain level</i>

502
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,336
<i>and doesn't go farther up.</i>

503
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,738
<i>As a result, the temperature</i>
<i>halfway up the mountain</i>

504
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,141
<i>is higher than the mountain's base.</i>
<i>It's the reverse of the usual case.</i>

505
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,943
<i>When the body was dumped,</i>

506
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,413
<i>the mountain's climate could have</i>
<i>caused such a phenomenon.</i>

507
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,017
But the police
should've taken that into account.

508
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,719
When doing the autopsy,

509
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,421
the coroner deduces the temperature
on the mountain based on that at the foot.

510
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,324
<i>It's common practice.</i>

511
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,728
<i>On average, the temperature</i>
<i>on a mountain drops 0.65 degrees Celsius</i>

512
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,663
<i>every 100 meters up.</i>

513
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,499
<i>But in this case,</i>
<i>because of the thermal belt,</i>

514
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>the temperature at the crime scene</i>
<i>was much higher than they deduced.</i>

515
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,905
<i>If the temperature was higher,</i>

516
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,140
<i>of course, the dead body</i>
<i>decayed faster too.</i>

517
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,276
In other words,

518
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,645
the estimated date of death
was much earlier.

519
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:58,016
That means the day that
Nana Yamashiro was killed

520
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,619
is later than
the current deduced date, right?

521
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,323
This temperature difference
should give it a one-week difference.

522
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:13,231
Kyoka Hanamaki's body
was found on 6 February.

523
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,902
Two days later, on 8 February,

524
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,538
Mr. Fujita was arrested.

525
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,443
The date the police estimated
Nana Yamashiro died

526
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,278
was around 4 February.

527
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,816
If we move it a week later…

528
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:38,189
Yamashiro's estimated date of death
is 11 February.

529
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,557
2/4 NANA YAMASHIRO, 2/6 KYOKA HANAMAKI
2/8 FUJITA ARRESTED

530
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,127
Then Mr. Fujita couldn't have killed her
because he was arrested.

531
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,230
The real culprit is another person.

532
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,800
The experiment is done.

533
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,169
It isn't related to the case.

534
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,038
It's only about the environment
on the mountain.

535
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:57,742
Huh?

536
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,012
Dr. Akiu?

537
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,285
There's something wrong with him today.

538
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,859
Wait a minute, Dr. Akiu.

539
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,665
What did you mean by that?

540
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,066
It's literally what I said.

541
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,535
It was only a theory.

542
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,007
If you don't actually inspect
the dead body,

543
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,010
you can't say that you can prove
Fujita's innocence.

544
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:39,117
But if Nana Yamashiro
was possibly alive after 4 February,

545
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,219
we can look for witnesses
that had seen her--

546
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,154
You'll lose if you can't find anyone.

547
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,324
Even if you can, there's
no guarantee that you'll win.

548
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,533
Kurokawa, this is the limit
of what you can do as a lawyer

549
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,336
and what I can do to help you.

550
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,373
Compared to the evidence
and first-hand data

551
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,042
the investigation organizations have,

552
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,277
it's significantly less accurate.

553
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:13,084
But so far, we've been able to prove
our point thanks to you.

554
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,120
You were just lucky.

555
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,091
But this is the last time.

556
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,460
Huh?

557
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,997
Very soon, the Public Prosecutors Office
will set up

558
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,466
a specialized agency
to conduct forensic investigations

559
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,234
that's independent from the police.

560
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,438
I was invited to join it.

561
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,074
By your own father.

562
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,246
The Prosecutors Office
is a government organization.

563
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,384
I can conduct experiments that are
much more accurate than before.

564
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,888
But the culprit behind
the murder 11 years ago

565
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,092
and the culprit behind this murder
could be the same person.

566
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,899
We can almost do it. Very soon…

567
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,237
maybe we can clear Senior Asama's
false charges and avenge Ayaka!

568
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,472
Kurokawa.

569
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:13,244
You don't know how cold a dead body is.

570
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,852
To us, her family,
nobody can replace Ayaka.

571
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,290
<i>She was cheerful, lively,</i>
<i>and she laughed a lot.</i>

572
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,925
<i>The exact opposite of me.</i>

573
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:35,133
But Ayaka was suddenly taken from us.

574
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,970
She was killed!

575
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,341
Suddenly. In an unreasonable way.

576
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:08,132
<i>Her body got cold,</i>
<i>and she couldn't smile anymore.</i>

577
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,281
Do you know how trying it is
for us, her family?

578
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,651
Do you know how much we hate
the murderer who killed Ayaka?

579
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,157
But maybe Senior Asama didn't kill her.

580
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,525
Who killed her, then?

581
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,264
Find the murderer right now
and prove that they killed her!

582
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,035
The investigation was careless.

583
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,170
The forensic inspection was imperfect.

584
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,306
That's why we've been unhappy.

585
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:54,779
But there's a definite difference
between you and me.

586
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:02,019
You want to believe
that Daisuke Asama was innocent,

587
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,688
but I…

588
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,491
the victim's family,

589
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,394
doesn't mind that Asama
was the murderer as a result.

590
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,096
Instead of the truth,

591
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,732
having a ready answer can stop our agony.

592
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,744
I'm not good enough to be a scientist.

593
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,082
Feel free to be disappointed in me.

594
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,831
COURTHOUSE

595
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,046
Ms. Arisa Nasu.

596
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,447
DEFENDANT WITNESS CROSS-EXAMINATION

597
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,049
On 10 February,

598
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,785
you met the victim, Nana Yamashiro,
in Tokyo.

599
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,454
-Am I right?
-Yes.

600
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,355
ARISU NASA
AQUAINTANCE OF NANA YAMASHIRO

601
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,591
I hung out with Nana from time to time.

602
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,061
Was there anything wrong with her
at that time?

603
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,399
She said she would get a sum of money
and treat me to a meal.

604
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,036
I thought she could've been
doing something risky.

605
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,672
Thank you.

606
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,010
As the video of the experiment about
the thermal belt had shown just now,

607
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,213
Nana Yamashiro was alive
after 3 to 5 February,

608
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,849
the date of death estimated by the police,

609
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,686
and the witness has proved that.

610
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,256
Like Nana Yamashiro, you've left home

611
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,993
and kept moving from one place
to another in Tokyo, right?

612
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,797
Yeah. At my friends' place.

613
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,999
How do you make a living?

614
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,234
I work parttime sometimes.

615
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,236
Or get pocket money.

616
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,738
Pocket money?

617
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,207
-From men?
-What?

618
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,575
Objection.

619
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,645
The question is not related to the case,
and it insults the witness.

620
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,114
Your Honor, judges,

621
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,851
the reliability of her statement
is concerned.

622
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:19,190
The witness had been caught
multiple times for compensated dating.

623
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,930
What does that have to do with this case?

624
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,432
I only said I saw Nana because I did.

625
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,169
You could've been paid
to give a false statement.

626
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,604
Your Honor, what he just said--

627
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,774
You are the one insulting
the investigation organization, lawyer.

628
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,345
Saying the time of death
deduced by the police was too early

629
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,783
is only a theory because you
hadn't actually examined the body.

630
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,952
In addition,

631
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:52,456
the lawyer has connected a murder
from 11 years ago in Kanagawa,

632
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,727
which had its final decision made,
to this murder.

633
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,195
I've been informed

634
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:02,299
that he places the focus on finding
the truth in that case instead.

635
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,437
I have to say that, as a lawyer,

636
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,340
your attitude is very problematic.

637
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,949
Here he is…

638
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,952
Mr. Kurokawa, what's the case
from 11 years ago that was mentioned?

639
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,721
Will you deny all charges
in the coming trials?

640
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,190
No comment. Please let us through.

641
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,526
Do you have any valuable information?

642
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,006
Dr. Akiu.

643
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,510
Hello. Hoshundo Law Office.

644
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,147
We won't accept an interview
about that case.

645
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,550
This is really bad.

646
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,453
After last time,

647
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,823
we're digging up another case
that had been concluded in a trial.

648
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,725
It became the headline
across all kinds of media.

649
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,626
IS A KILLING FROM 11 YEARS AGO
RELATED TO THE SERIAL KILLINGS?

650
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,629
If Kurokawa continues as a lawyer,

651
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,664
he has to go through it someday.

652
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,201
I'm saying that I hope he won't
get our office involved in this.

653
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,073
I mean, I don't want to be involved
in this case again.

654
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:55,246
This case made my brother die
with regret as a lawyer, after all.

655
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,616
Yes, indeed.

656
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,262
I know you want
to take your mind off this,

657
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,597
but we should go back.

658
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,902
Would you like some snacks?

659
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,008
The trial isn't over yet.

660
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,144
The case from 11 years ago too.

661
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,516
Pull yourself together, starting tomorrow.

662
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,958
Dr. Akiu and Mr. Ibusuki were right.

663
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,031
I don't know how cold a dead body is.

664
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,569
Sorry I asked you to come, but…

665
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,907
would you leave me alone for a while?

666
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,746
Don't drink too much.

667
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,280
SATOKO ARIMA

668
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:38,716
Wakura speaking.

669
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,518
<i>I'm Arima. Is Kurokawa with you?</i>

670
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,687
No, I just left.

671
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,422
I see.

672
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,191
He didn't answer my call.

673
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,094
I have to tell him something urgently.

674
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,195
<i>Tell him something?</i>

675
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,499
It might lead us to the real murderer.

676
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,768
What?

677
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,774
JUNPEI FUJITA

678
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,180
KOOZ: I AM ALWAYS WATCHING YOU.

679
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,316
AYAKA'S DIARY
RANDOM STUFF IN MY DAILY LIFE

680
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,960
Where is he?

681
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:45,716
Mr. Kurokawa!

682
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,984
THIS DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS

683
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,152
THE SHOCKING FINAL EPISODE

684
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,487
Ms. Wakura!

685
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,289
<i>The guy who stabbed Ms. Wakura</i>
<i>turned himself in.</i>

686
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,757
I killed all three of them.

687
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,525
He is the murderer!

688
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,328
-<i>Pressure from the authorities.</i>
-<i>You're a coward.</i>

689
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,963
<i>Can the false charges be cleared?</i>

690
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,898
-You framed someone innocent 12 years ago!
-Shut up!

691
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:35,999
I'll never accept this!

692
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,402
The real murderer was someone else.

693
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,904
Please help me one last time.

694
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,109
We'll prove the convictions in this
and the murder 11 years ago wrong.

695
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,310
Please help us.

696
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,878
The Prosecutors Office and you

697
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,014
will turn a blind eye to it
just to keep your honor?
