1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,237
<i>Two murders are thought to be</i>
<i>committed by the same person.</i>

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,307
<i>The dead bodies have something in common</i>

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,543
<i>with the Touo University</i>
<i>Student Murder Case 11 years ago.</i>

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,180
She was stabbed in the throat.
Don't you think it looks like

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,650
the wound on Ayaka Akiu's throat
in the murder 11 years ago?

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,688
The real murderer is another person
and they put the blame on someone.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,224
This time, it was the man Fujita.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,726
Eleven years ago, it was Daisuke Asama.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,096
The Public Prosecutors Office
will set up a specialized agency

10
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,999
independent from the police
to conduct forensic investigation.

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>I was invited to join it.</i>

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,037
<i>By your own father.</i>

13
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,438
Very soon,

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,609
maybe we can clear Senior Asama's
false charges and avenge Ayaka!

15
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,713
You don't know how cold a dead body is.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,618
I don't mind that Asama ended up
being the murderer.

17
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,453
Instead of the truth,

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,622
having a ready answer can stop our agony.

19
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:58,925
Mr. Kurokawa!

20
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,646
Miss Wakura.

21
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,053
My nails.

22
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,955
What?

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,424
Clues.

24
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,795
Miss Wakura?

25
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,466
Miss Wakura!

26
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,967
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

27
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,304
You mean the lady was stabbed
to protect you?

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,841
Excuse me. Will you analyze this?

29
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,278
We are going to properly collect
evidence ourselves.

30
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,447
I've seen you on the news.

31
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:59,085
Well, I guess you don't trust the police.

32
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,821
How can they say something so mean?

33
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,458
You asked for it yourself,
didn't you, Kurokawa?

34
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,164
The reason you agreed to be
the case's defense lawyer is because

35
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,400
you suspect it's related to
the case 11 years ago, right?

36
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,606
But to the police and the prosecutors,
the case is closed.

37
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,775
You're doing this now
just to satisfy yourself, aren't you?

38
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,745
Mr. Beppu, please don't say anymore.

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,259
<i>I killed all three of them.</i>

40
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,593
He is the murderer!

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,061
How dare you treat me
like a murderer without evidence!

42
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,863
Everything was on your order, wasn't it?

43
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,631
FINALLY, THE TUMULTUOUS FINAL EPISODE!
FIGHTING AN EVIL SERIAL KILLER

44
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,966
A serial killer who killed three women.

45
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,967
I don't care! What's wrong with you?

46
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,270
-You were innocent 12 years ago.
-Shut up!

47
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,971
I will never accept it!

48
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,027
Miss Wakura?

49
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,829
Mr. Kurokawa.

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,700
Thank goodness, you've opened your eyes.

51
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,803
I had a horrible nightmare.

52
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,007
<i>Your pile of books and files</i>

53
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,311
<i>kept falling onto my desk.</i>

54
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:37,684
I had no idea I was unconsciously
stressed out by that.

55
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,221
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,991
And…

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,695
Why are you holding my hand?

58
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,438
I am really sorry.

59
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,708
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

60
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,745
Miss Arima, it isn't your fault.

61
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,048
Kurokawa would've been stabbed
if you hadn't called.

62
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,085
He might have died in that case.

63
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,287
His power to survive
seems weaker than Miss Wakura's.

64
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,991
JUNPEI FUJITA

65
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,995
Among Mr. Fujita's
and Hanamaki's followers,

66
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,598
KooZ here is the only one
who follows both of them.

67
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,635
I'm impressed that you found them.

68
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,437
Let's say Kyoka Hanamaki
didn't die because

69
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,973
Junpei Fujita stalked and killed her.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,844
<i>In that case, the real culprit</i>
<i>clearly did something to deceive us.</i>

71
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,648
If that's the case,
they must know the life of the victim

72
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,150
and the "murderer" to a certain extent.

73
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,620
Also, look at this.

74
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,289
They had been closed,

75
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,458
but they're Ayaka Akiu's
and Daisuke Asama's blogs.

76
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,528
ASAMA'S RUINS TOUR

77

00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,032
AYAKA'S DIARY

79
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,433

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,101
Even 11 years ago…

81
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,873
KOOZ: TWEET: 3
FOLLOWING: 15, FOLLOWER: 11

82
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,808
The symbol.

83
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,748
So, what do you think?

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,684
What do I think of what?

85
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,288
I'm saying, do you think
this KooZ is the real culprit?

86
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,023
Look at the Magatama.

87
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
Doesn't it look like the wound
on the victims' necks?

88
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,395
Apostrophe.

89
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,731
Apostrophe?

90
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,404
You add it to a noun
to turn it into possessive form.

91
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,141
In other words, the wound on their necks

92
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:47,880
could be the murderer's claim that
the victims were his possessions.

93
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,853
But this alone can't even
be circumstantial evidence.

94
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,660
So you have never met KooZ?

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,531
No. He sent me a follow request,
so I accepted it. That's all.

96
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,369
Could the person be the murderer?

97
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,636
JUNPEI FUJITA, DEFENDANT

98
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,038
We have to investigate.

99
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,377
The person arrested
in the murder 11 years ago

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,848
killed himself
after he lost the case, didn't he?

101
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,485
Yes.

102
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,224
I know how he felt!

103
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,694
He was arrested
for something he didn't do,

104
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,430
so he would rather die in that case!

105
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,598
Mr. Fujita!

106
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,535
Please don't give up.

107
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,806
Until the very last moment…

108
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,643
I'm going to go all out
to investigate and defend you.

109
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,046
TODOROKI POLICE STATION

110
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,182
Excuse me.

111
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,617
Yes?

112
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,387
I'm here to turn myself in to the police.

113
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,157
Last night, I stabbed someone.

114

MIC GENERAL LEGAL OFFICES
KIYOSHI DOGO

115
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,264
Impressive.

116
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,900
The guy turned himself in
and he's here to negotiate already.

117
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,668
If the negotiation is successful,

118
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,303
it'll give him an advantage in the trial.

119
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,072
He said he was sorry about
what he did to Miss Wakura

120
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,541
and he regrets doing it.

121
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,477
He did not plan the assault,

122
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,712
he just did it on impulse.

123
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,449
In other words,
the victim could have been anyone?

124
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,986
Yes. He got frightened after that
and turned himself in to the police.

125
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,358
This is my client's personal details.

126
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,094

OCCUPATION: EMPLOYEE

131

It says he works at
a university's student affairs office.

132
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,771
Which university is it?

133
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,440
I heard that it is Seiran Arts University.

134
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:56,843
Excuse me.

Mr. Kurokawa.

137
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,858

but he is a renowned pathologist.

He will pay more to settle this--

142
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,338
We'll talk to Wakura whether
we'll settle it out of court or not,

143
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,508
but on one condition.

You were actually going to stab me,
weren't you?

149
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,266
KAZUNARI KOZU, SUSPECT

150
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,433
Well…

151
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,804
I saw you on the news.
You're a famous lawyer, right?

152
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,606
No.

153
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,109
Clearing someone of false charges
must be difficult.

154
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,711
The police

155
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:10,182
leaps at someone's self-confession
or simple circumstantial evidence.

156
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,053
You work at a university's
student affairs office?

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,922
My father got me the job.

158
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,692
I had been idling about at this age.
It's been half a year,

159
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,295
but I couldn't fit in at work.

160
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,163
Half a year?

161
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,732
I had been living abroad
for nearly ten years,

162
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,835
so my dad said it was time
for me to re-join society.

163
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,272
But I ended up working at
the student affairs office again.

164
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,076
You had worked at
the student affairs office before?

165
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,679
Yes, at Touo University.

166
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,316
It made me feel inferior.

167
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:47,954
All the students were gifted
and enjoying their youth.

168
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,024
It annoyed me so much at that time.

169
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,394
But you know,

170
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,432
no matter how gifted they are
and how much they enjoy their youth,

171
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,968
when people die,
they die in no time at all.

172
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,072
You…

173
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,579
Actually…

174
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,583
I killed all three of them.

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,422
In the case 11 years ago
and the two lately.

176
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,093
When I stabbed the knife into
their necks and twisted it,

177
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,794
it was so satisfying!

178
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:36,969
What's the matter?

179
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,171
The lawyer suddenly…

180
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,041
He is the murderer! He just confessed it.

181
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,643
I didn't say that.

182
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,245
The public didn't know
about the wound on their necks!

183
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,082
He knows that because he is
the murderer, without a doubt!

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,084
-What are you talking about?
-Calm down.

185
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:53,953
The interview is over.

186
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,391
You treat me like a murderer
without any evidence.

187
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,826
Are you a detective who forces people
to make a confession?

188
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,172
Mr. Kurokawa, how did the interview go?

189
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,407
Kurokawa.

190
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,911
Mr. Kurokawa, what's the matter?

191
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,479
Hey, don't ignore us!

192
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,747
Kurokawa.

193
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,282
He confessed it.

194
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,056
He said to me
that he killed all three of them.

195
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,101
Mr. Kurokawa. Breathe in.

196
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,337
Take a deep breath. Slowly.

197
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,442
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,680
But I have no evidence!

199
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:59,085
Evidence… None was found
in those two murders too.

200
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,455
It must be even harder
to get the evidence 11 years ago.

201
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,524
The investigator at that time.

202
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,227
Do you have any clue who it was?

203
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,465
When I produced the documentary,
one person was evasive.

204
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,134
He was still active at that time,
so he refused to be interviewed,

205
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,470
but he should be retired now.

206
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,445
Are you bringing up the murder
11 years ago again?

207
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,117
We heard that you participated in
the initial investigation,

208
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,319
so we hope you'll tell us about it.

209
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,055
At that time, in Kanagawa,

210
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,824
there was another major case, right?

211
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,895
A family in Hodogaya was murdered.

212
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,997
A man arrested by the police
wasn't charged

213
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,500
by Yokohama Prosecutors Office
due to lack of evidence.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,636
The man committed the murder
right after that, right?

215
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,073
-It was…
-A family of five was brutally murdered.

216
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,443
The prosecutors' office's
stupid young prosecutor

217
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,546
caused the death of people
who didn't have to die.

218
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,183
The Touo University Student
Murder Case happened that instant.

219
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,954
To regain people's trust,

220
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,925
the police wanted to solve the case
at an early stage, right?

221
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,293
So they rushed it--

222
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,328
We made no mistake in our investigation.

223
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,864
We, the police,

224
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:24,036
arrested the most likely suspect
and collected evidence.

225
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,740
The method was the most proper one
in an investigation.

226
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,408
We want to pick up the pieces,

227
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,112
starting from that juncture.

228
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,915
If in the case 11 years ago,

229
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,551
something wasn't used as evidence,

230
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,453
another truth could be hidden in it.

231
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,557
Please tell us anything you know.

232
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,793
-Please help us.
-Please help us.

233
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,933
A cigarette butt?

234
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,302
It was found at the crime scene,

235
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:01,173
but it wasn't even presented
as evidence at the trial at that time

236
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,475
because Senior Asama didn't smoke.

237
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,146
The prosecutor can choose
what they present as evidence, right?

238
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,517
That's why they didn't present
anything unfavorable to them.

239
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,953
If we analyze the cigarette butt,

240
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,789
maybe we can prove that Kozu was involved.

241
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,325
I'll file an appeal

242
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,627
in Yokohama District Court
for the retrial of the case 11 years ago

243
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,863
and request for the disclosure
of the cigarette butt collected.

244
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:30,236
<i>In Kanagawa's Touo University</i>
<i>Student Murder Case 11 years ago,</i>

245
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,405
<i>there was a mistake of fact</i>
<i>in the evidence at that time,</i>

246
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,375

-Is this okay?
-<i>stated that he is guilty…</i>

250
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,952
The Public Prosecutors Office
warned us to report this with care.

251
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,821
It's all right.

252
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,490
I've prepared myself for the worst.

253
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,261
<i>Miss Ayaka Akiu was stabbed</i>
<i>with a knife and her body was found.</i>

254
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,364
<i>The convict of the case had already died.</i>

255
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,300
<i>An appeal for a posthumous retrial</i>
<i>has been filed.</i>

256
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,270
<i>Mr. Taku Kurokawa, the representative</i>
<i>of the victim's family,</i>

257
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,772

<i>collected by</i>

258
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,074
<i>the investigation organization</i>
<i>at the crime scene</i>

259
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,776
<i>and he requests for the disclosure…</i>

260
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,611
The press is making
too much noise about it.

261
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,215
The Prosecutor General is outraged.

262
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,384
<i>We hope the prosecutors' office</i>
<i>will respond quickly.</i>

Mr. Kurokawa!

267
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,800
Look! A cigarette butt was also left

268
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,635
at the scene of Kyoka Hanamaki's murder.

269

Later. We're in trouble.

270
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,044
Hey! Don't do whatever you please!
It's an unjustifiable search!

271
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,580
What's your reason for the search?

272
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,817
Mr. Tokunori Isawa
violated the Lawyers Act.

273
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,453
-Me?
-Twenty days ago,

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,889
when you had dinner with your friend,

275
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,026
you gave him legal advice
and accepted a fee, didn't you?

276
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,398
Oh. My friend is starting a business
and we talked a bit about it.

277
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,968
But I didn't charge him.
He only paid the bill.

278
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,203
Do you have to go so far
for something so trivial?

279
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,105
In other words, you're harassing us

280
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,941
because we brought up
the case from 11 years ago, right?

281
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,144
We're Tokyo's Public Prosecutors Office
and not related to Yokohama.

282
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,748
It's the Deputy Prosecutor General's
order?

283
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,650
Kurokawa, calm down!

284
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,720
That man worked at
Yokohama's office originally, so he…

285
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,722
Kurokawa. Don't.

286
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,524
Excuse me. It's a document for you.

287
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,926
Why now?

288
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,196
"Yokohama District Court"?

It isn't among the evidence?

295
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,424
They say there is no cigarette butt
among the evidence?

296
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,393

Taku just came home.

308
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,251
You are too nasty.

309
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,857
The search in our office
and the concealment of evidence.

310

Everything was on your order, wasn't it?

Taku, your dad just came home--

313
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,506
Why is someone here now?

314
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,142
Anyway, both of you should calm down.

Yeah?

316
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,449
The real murderer was someone else.

317
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,655
The man himself confessed it
in front of me.

318
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,059
He laughed and said we had no evidence.

319
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,264
If only we have the evidence,
we could prove what he did!

320
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,133
But the prosecutors' office and you…

321
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,671
Are you going to turn a blind eye to it
just for your own dignity?

322
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,476
Miss Wakura is here too.

323
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,079
Sorry for coming so suddenly again.

324
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,549
It's okay. Anyway, your face is very pale.

325
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,317
I am fine.

326
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,353
Just wait a second.

327
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,625
Deputy Prosecutor General Kurokawa.

328
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,196
I am here for the same thing
as Mr. Kurokawa.

329
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:30,169
So far, Mr. Kurokawa has been
handling all the cases honestly.

330
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,439
He investigates what he doesn't know
until the last moment,

331
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,008
does experiments to prove it,

332
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:42,481
and it all started because of how
he feels about the case 11 years ago.

333
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,320
If you really think
the prosecutor's conclusion was right…

334
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,823
Miss Wakura.

335
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,434
I had no idea.

336
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,005
I didn't know about the cigarette.

337
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,541
That's my answer.

338
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,748
It was a waste of effort.

339
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,886
No matter what we ask him…

340
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,623
Was it really?

341
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,458
What?

342
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,965
Your father didn't say,
"There was no evidence."

343
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,201
He said he had no idea.

344
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,205
He had no idea.

345
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,108
If he was telling the truth…

346
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,814
The police didn't give it to him.

347
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,052
HOSHUNDO LAW OFFICE

348
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,723
You're back, Kurokawa.

349
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,392
What's the matter, everyone?

350
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,427
We talked about what we're going to do.

351
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,698
Our office is on the verge
of closing now because of you.

352
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,001
I am very sorry.

353
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,105
I'll take the responsibility
and quit my job here.

354
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,175
But please let me finish the case.

355
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,544
Can you take the responsibility
by resigning?

356
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,215
You inflicted such a big loss
on our office,

357
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,751
can you take the responsibility
by resigning from your job?

358
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,287
No, I think I can't.

359
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,956
But what should I do, then?

360
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,460
Show people that our office is correct.

361
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,196
In other words, prove that the defendants

362
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,066
of this case and the one 11 years ago
were falsely charged.

363
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,968
Don't yield to the oppressive prosecutors.

364
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,272
But the appeal for the retrial of the case
from 11 years ago was dismissed.

365
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,940
We will adopt a secret tactic.

366
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,511
In Mr. Fujita's trial,
we'll bring Kozu out as a witness.

367
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,881
Then we'll present the evidence
and prove the crimes he committed.

368
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,149
It's Mr. Beppu's idea.

369
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,350
Mr. Beppu!

370
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,185
Don't get me wrong, Kurokawa.

371
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,988
I hate criminal cases.
They don't earn me money.

372
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,725
But my brother defended the case
11 years ago.

373
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,227
If it'll settle the old score,
then it's a different matter.

374
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,266
Now, the whole Hoshundo Law Office

375
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,403
will work to exonerate Asama
in the Touo University Student Murder Case

376
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,574
and Fujita in the recent murders!

377
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,809
We have to be thorough!

378
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,577
Yes, sir!

379
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,085

00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,252

381

-Let's go.
-Okay.

382
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,925
Hello.

383
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,827
-I'm Kurokawa, a lawyer.
-Yes?

384
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,696
I'd like to ask you about
student affairs office's Mr. Kozu.

385
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,066
Have you seen Nana with this man?

386
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,768
No idea.

387
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,903
Please have a closer look.

388
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,705
What?

389
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,475
-I've never seen him.
-No.

392

-Please tell us if You know anything.
-Here you are.

393
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,581
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

394
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,150

397

All right. Yes.

398
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,324
Mr. Beppu.

399
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,993

Is the cigarette butt from 11 years ago
really here?

402
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,270
I don't know.

403
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,276
Not knowing something
is important, isn't it?

404
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,848
That means we are going
to try very hard to find it out.

405
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,990
What a slave driver you are, Mr. Lawyer.

406
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,726
Thank you, sir.

407
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,561
But are you really sure?

408
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,875
What do you want?

TOUO UNIVERSITY STUDENT MURDER CASE
CIGARETTE BUTT

410
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,054
The murderer was another man.

411
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,625
Senior Asama was falsely convicted,

412
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,262
so please help me do
scientific experiments to prove it.

413
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,937
Dr. Akiu, you are right.

414
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,577
I don't know how cold a dead body is.

415
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,083
And the pain it brought you.

416
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,787
The sadness too.

417
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,457
But…

418
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,597
I know the warmth that Senior Asama had
when he was alive.

419
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,038
We grew up together.

420
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,908
He had told me a lot.

421
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,717
About how much he loved Ayaka.

422
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,258
And how much he respected you
as a senior too.

423
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,498
The murderer was someone else.

424
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,407
Please help me this one last time.

425
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,914
I beg you.

426
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:58,823
Your son seems to have gotten
some new evidence.

427
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,994
I can't let him do something
that makes people criticize

My son…

430
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,136
He only wants to seek the truth.

431
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,470
Kurokawa!

432
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,242

This case, Kyoka Hanamaki's murder,

450
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,483
and Touo University Student Murder Case,
which happened 11 years ago,

451
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,251
have many things in common.

452
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,421
Like the wound left
on the victims' bodies…

453
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,555
SIMILAR WOUNDS FOUND ON VICTIMS

454
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,226
…evidence stained with the victim's blood
found near the body.

455
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,127
VICTIM - CLOTHES USED BY
MS. ASAMA FOR RESEARCH

456
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:46,197
Also, after 11 years, in this case,

457
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,667
we've found new, common evidence.

458
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,172
It shows that other than
this case's defendant, Mr. Junpei Fujita,

459
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,477
and Mr. Daisuke Asama, who was seen
as the culprit 11 years ago,

460
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,547
a third-party was possibly
involved in both cases.

461
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,216
He's saying that
the murderer is someone else?

462
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,754
Please have a look at
Defendant's Exhibit number 63.

463
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,891
The cigarette butt was found

464
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,660
at a riverbed in Ota City,
the scene of this murder.

465
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,631
The police found several cigarette butts

466
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,466
but did not treat them as evidence.

467
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,170
It is because the defendant
is a non-smoker.

468
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,041
Next, please have a look at
Defendant's Exhibit number 64.

469
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,010
This cigarette butt

470
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,079
was found at the ruin in Kanagawa,

471
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,648
the scene of the murder 11 years ago.

472
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,819
However, it wasn't even presented
to the public prosecutor

473
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,556
and was hidden in Kanagawa
Prefectural Police's evidence room.

474
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,992
It's also because,

475
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,262
like in this case,
Mr. Daisuke Asama was a non-smoker.

476
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,299
What? The police conducted investigation
under an assumption?

477
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,602
The two cigarette butts
have already been analyzed.

478
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,539
Now, with special permission,

479
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,542
Touo University Science
and Engineering Department's

480
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,277
Dr. Akiu will explain it.

481
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,849
The DNA on the evidence of this case

482
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,118
and the one of the case 11 years ago

483
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,020
have been analyzed using STR analysis.

484
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,757
A certain truth has been found after that.

485
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,493
The same person's DNA

486
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,262
was attached on both cigarette butts.

487
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,797
The same person?

488
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,867
It's a man being charged
for another crime.

489
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,636
<i>The victim scratched the man</i>
<i>and his DNA was obtained</i>

490
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,872
<i>by taking the pieces of skin scraped off.</i>

491
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,306
IDENTIFY DNA TYPE

492
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:35,940
MALE SKIN TAKEN FROM
A VICTIM IN ANOTHER INCIDENT

493
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,208
In other words, the evidence

494
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,546
shows that this murder is directly related
to the one 11 years ago

495
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,050
and we can identify the man who is
likely to be involved in both cases?

496
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,386
That's right.

497
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,455
Witness.

498
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,556
DEFENDANT WITNESS CROSS-EXAMINATION

499
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,958
In response
to the lawyer's claim just now,

500
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,162
I think there is another possibility.
For example--

501
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,198
A third party with ill intention
got a cigarette butt

502
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,768
and planted it at the crime scene.
It's a possibility.

503
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,504
Yes, you are right.

504
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,639
In that case,

505
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,809
that piece of evidence
makes no contribution as a clue.

506
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,479
I can say the same about
the prosecutor's evidence too.

507
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,016
The sketchbook stained with blood
found in this murder

508
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,985
and the blood-stained clothes and shoes

509
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,721
presented as evidence
in the murder 11 years ago

510
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,926
could also be planted to put the blame
on the two defendants.

511
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,261
But…

512
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,463
Relying on circumstantial evidence

513
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,999
to construct the image of the culprit

514
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,535
is the most risky and foolish act.

515
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,406
The investigation organizations
choose evidence intentionally

516
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,409
and even conceal it. This is outrageous!

517
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,581
People are falsely convicted,

518
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,016
not due to the lack of ability
to inspect or the lack of evidence.

519
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,387
It's caused by prejudice,
assumption, and useless dignity,

520
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,690
the weakness and ugliness
of people's hearts.

521
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,759
No matter how advanced
forensic science gets,

522
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,495
it's pointless if the people
who use it are corrupt.

523
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,900
What we need is

524
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,938
the simple and honest will-power
to seek the truth.

525
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,675
Without that,

526
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,044
the victim's resentment

527
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,348
and the agony
that the victim's family suffer

528
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,320
will never be able to be settled
in the real sense.

529
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,125
That was the case for the prosecution.

530
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,027
Thank you.

531
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,862
Please call the next witness.

532
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,746
I swear that…

533
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,018
the evidence I give shall be
the truth, the whole truth,

534
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,755
and nothing but the truth.

535
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,090
Witness, Kazunari Kozu.

536
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,293
You'll be accused of perjury if you lie.

537
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,560
Please be aware of that.

538
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,663
Now, please begin.

539
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,136
First, please watch
Defense's Exhibit number 65, a video.

540
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,073
It's a video taken by
security cameras at a place

541
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,508
related to both murders.

542
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,176
CAMPUS OF SEIRAN ARTS UNIVERSITY

543
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,911
Mr. Kazunari Kozu,

544
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,847
at places near the victim, Kyoka Hanamaki,

545
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,849
near the defendant,

546
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,519
and the scene where
Nana Yamashiro's body was abandoned,

547
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,622
you were caught on the security cameras.

548
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,691
Also,

549
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:44,362
a witness testified that they saw you
with Nana Yamashiro.

550
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,101
From the result of the DNA analysis
and this evidence,

551
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,836
you're extremely likely

552
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,773
to be involved in these two murders
and the one 11 years ago.

553
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,311
If you can deny the accusation,
please explain yourself.

554
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,717
Well…

555
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,618
I cannot.

556
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,355
I've told you already, haven't I?

557
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,328
I was the one who killed Ayaka Akiu
11 years ago.

558
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,101
I was also the one who killed
Kyoka Hanamaki and Nana Yamashiro.

559
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,005
He admits to all the crimes?

560
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,606
Why did you do that?

561
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,911
If I must say, it was to reveal

562
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:37,148
the problem of Japan's police
and public prosecutors' office.

563
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,551
I came up with the idea 11 years ago.

564
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,654
If I plant evidence that points directly
to someone as the murderer

565
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,623
and go to kill someone,

566
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,358
what would you guys do?

567
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,030
<i>I carefully selected the person</i>
<i>I would kill and the culprit.</i>

568
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,436
<i>Put the bait there.</i>

569
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,077
I half-prepared myself for the worst.

570
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,446
I thought, they would find out
at once anyway.

571
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,285
But the result was
you guys simply took the bait.

572
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,022
So, I did it again,

573
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,426
using Kyoka Hanamaki
and the stalker there.

574
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,765
<i>I stole Hanamaki's student ID card</i>
<i>and let the stalker find it.</i>

575
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,104
<i>I took the sketchbook</i>

576
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,140
<i>from the crime scene to the factory</i>
<i>and threw it away.</i>

577
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,379
The only thing that went wrong
was someone saw me.

578
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,114
The kid, Nana Yamashiro.

579
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,983
She saw you,
so you killed her to shut her up?

580
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,085
No.

581
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,822
The idiot shamelessly showed up
in front of me

582
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,758
and told me to give her hush money.
That's why.

583
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,028
I did feel sorry for the stalker.

584
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,297
She was killed in the same way,

585
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,166
so they suspected that
you were a serial killer.

586
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,370
No wonder false convictions
still exist in this country.

587
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,713
I've been able to say everything
and I feel amazing now.

588
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:21,085
The press will make a fuss
and I'll become famous tomorrow.

589
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,590
"The vicious serial killer confessed
his crime in court," they'll say.

590
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,594
I'll be sentenced to death anyway.

591
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,829
If you like,

592
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,600
I'll tell you in detail
how I killed the women.

593
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,468
Mr. Akiu!

594
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,877
Good Lord, my work was amazing!

595
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,580
The useless police, prosecutors.

596
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,182
In your faces!

597
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,955
Kazunari Kozu, 35 years old.

598
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,227
Your father is a renowned pathologist.

599
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,430
You applied to Touo University's
Medical Department to do pathology

600
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,365
but failed four times.

601
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,567
What?

602
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,801
After the four years,

603
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,738
you finally passed the exam,
but just before your enrolment

604
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,240
on March 20, 2006,

605
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,544
you were suspected of molesting
a girl in high school on a train.

606
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,245
-You were arrested--
-Hey!

607
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,114
Stop it.

608
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,483
You kept denying the charges,

609
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,652
but you were charged,
put in custody for 58 days,

610
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,686
and found guilty.

611
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,724
As a result, you couldn't study
at the university you wanted to go to.

612
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,493
I said, stop talking about my past!

613
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,465
I went to meet the woman
who accused you of molestation.

614
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,469
She regretted it very much.

615
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,674
She lied and accused you of molestation

616
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,243
to get the money
for settling it out of court.

617
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,881
She said she falsely accused you.

618
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,554
She confessed to me that
she messed up your life.

619
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,659
This is ridiculous!

620
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,096
This is ridiculous!
What's the point of doing this now?

621
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,664
Ridiculous!

622
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,399
Falsely charged of molestation.

623
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,570
This is the reason that
you committed the series of murder?

624
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,741
Mr. Kozu,

625
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,010
I cannot forgive you.

626
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,882
If you'll serve your sentence
without regretting what you did,

627
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,385
I will never accept it!

628
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,690
If you don't look properly
at what you had done,

629
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,295
the victims and those who lost
a family member won't get closure.

630
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,466
I don't care! What's wrong with you?

631
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,436
Because I didn't know.

632
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,440
I want to know everything about you.

633
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,677
-I want to understand you.
-Shut up!

634
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,612
Your Honor, I killed three people.

635
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,782
A serial killer who killed three women.

636
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,853
I don't want that to be
all I know about you.

637
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,354
Shut up!

638
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,657
Kazunari Kozu.

639
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,125
Shut up.

640
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,827
-You were innocent 12 years ago.
-Shut up!

641
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,264
Shut up!

642
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,833
-You were innocent.
-Stop…

643
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,672
That is exactly why…

644
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:30,975
I am very frustrated.

645
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,148
You should be the person…

646
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,053
who knows the agony
of being falsely accused most.

647
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,030
As a person…

648
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:04,508
Please face the pain in your heart
until the very last moment.

649
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,954
That was the case for the defense.

650
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,092
Prosecutor, any cross-examination?

651
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,561
No, Your Honor.

652
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,062
Come on. Stand up!

653
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,000
In that case, next--

654
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,001
Your Honor.

655
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,777
I would like to say something.

656
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,117
Just now,

657
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,853
the truth of a murder 11 years ago

658
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,323
and these two murders have been revealed.

659
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,764
I prosecuted Daisuke Asama
and claimed that he was guilty

660
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,334
and drove him to his death.

661
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,137
As a judicial professional,

662
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:12,743
a decision I made
took away a person's life.

663
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,983
I would like to apologize wholeheartedly.

664
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,493
I've finished.

665
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:45,109
People make mistakes.

666
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,179
That's why there are criminal cases.

667
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,848
People are falsely charged sometimes

668
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,517
and many people are hurt.

669
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,458
Even so, I don't want to lose hope
in the judiciary.

670
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,730
If we want to seek the truth,

671
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,968
admit our mistake if we made one,

672
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,705
and have the courage to correct it,

673
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,475
I believe

674
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,278
that we can surely
clear someone of false charges.

675
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,886
The defense lawyer…

676
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:34,124
insists that the defendant, Junpei Fujita,

677
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:42,500
and Daisuke Asama in
Touo University Student Murder Case

678
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,504
are innocent.

679
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:01,886
It's over.

680
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,056
Yes.

681
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,860
But I still don't feel relieved.

682
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,899
Because Ayaka and Senior Asama…

683
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,202
and the two victims this time…

684
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,938
will never come back.

685
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,140
True.

686
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:28,245
But at least I feel better now.

687
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,218
I can now…

688
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,456
mourn over the death of Ayaka and Asama,

689
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,392
the person she loved.

690
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,163
Yeah.

691
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,742
Why do you follow me?

692
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,679
What? You go for a drink
at a time like this.

693
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,548
But I'm telling you,
I'm going to have Oolong tea.

694
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:13,824
I want to file an appeal for the retrial
of the murder 11 years ago.

695
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,928
A public prosecutor has the right
to do so, indeed, but…

696
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,133
One needs to correct his mistake.

697
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,775
Good evening, dear.

698
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,579
UNREAD - CRIMINAL DEFENSE
REQUEST FOR MR. KUROKAWA

699
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,815
This is impressive!

700
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,517
It's packed with criminal case orders!

701
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,087
It isn't impressive and I am not happy!

702
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,656
We are short of staff
and they don't earn me money!

703
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,392
Calm down. A young man
who aims to be a lawyer

704
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,161
because he wants to handle
criminal cases has shown up.

705
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:55,466
Someone who is going to bring us
even more trouble than Kurokawa.

706
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:56,467
PASS

707
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:57,668
Have some tea.

708
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,403
Thank you.

709
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,206
Ms. Kinosaki, is it okay to be so relaxed

710
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,642
when the bar examination is coming up?

711
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,312
Ms. Kinosaki's result in the mock exam
was better than mine.

712
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,382
-Really?
-After I pass it,

713
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,519
I can help Mr. Kurokawa
on many, many more things.

714
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,622
I am going to work much, much harder too.

715
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,225
TAKU KUROKAWA'S HOME

716
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,994
What's the matter?

717
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,496
-Okay.
-Yes?

718
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,964
Interview!

719
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,366
My boss finally let me do
a special program on you!

720
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,036
I really don't know how to be interviewed.

721
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,805
You really won't
do the interview, Kurokawa?

722
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:35,806
I am sorry.

723
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,008
Oh, I have to work now. Sorry…

724
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,380
In that case,

725
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,350
I'll make it using the videos
I've filmed so far.

726
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,052
We've got loads of materials.

727
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,422
But in that case, you have to get
Dr. Akiu's permission too.

728
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,791
<i>Speaking of whom,</i>

729
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,394
<i>Dr. Akiu is planning to set up</i>
<i>a private forensics science lab.</i>

730
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,665
<i>It'll be heartening to Kurokawa</i>
<i>if he sets up the lab.</i>

731
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,435
Kurokawa will surely make Dr. Akiu
do large-scale experiments for him.

732
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,335
Excuse me.

733
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,772
Okay, where is the document?

734
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:09,740
Oh no!

735
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,812
I've learned my lesson.

736
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,715
It's useless asking you
to tidy up your desk,

737
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,583
and I know that now.

738
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,920
I'm impressed.

739
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,923
THIS DRAMA IS FICTITIOUS
