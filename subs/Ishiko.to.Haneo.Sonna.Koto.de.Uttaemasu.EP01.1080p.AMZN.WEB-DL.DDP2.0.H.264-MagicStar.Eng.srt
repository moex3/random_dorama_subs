1
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,624
You could get sued for that.

2
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,596
TOKYO DISTRICT COURT

3
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,555
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,124
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,061
Are you Mr. Haneoka? I'm the paralegal--

6
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,163
Ms. Shoko Ishida. I know.

7
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,667
Thank you for taking on this case.
My father strained his back--

8
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,169
I know that too.

9
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,271
Do you always waste time?

10
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,375
I've read the materials. Let's hurry.

11
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,681
However, as a premise,

12
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:25,319
she has no reason for a divorce
and wants to avoid divorce proceedings.

13
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,721
Do you still not get it?

14
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:33,360
They agreed to share the chores equally
because they're both working.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,031
But when they had a fight,
even though it was her duty,

16
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,034
she intentionally excluded
the husband's laundry.

17
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,504
I believe this is
a default of an obligation.

18
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,842
She also banned him from smoking,
a habit of his since before marriage.

19
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:53,681
And her unilateral decision to limit
his beer consumption to one 350 ml can

20
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:58,619
were acts of moral harassment that caused
unbearable stress to my client.

21
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:05,392
In addition, she gave her husband
only 400 yen for lunch,

22
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,495
when she enjoyed course lunches herself.

23
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,065
Such outrageous action has caused him
financial and emotional stress--

24
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,933
No. Um…

25
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,936
My wife can be sweet, too.

26
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:18,606
Good work.

27
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,442
Are you sure that went well?

28
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,945
The client is only seeking
an amicable divorce. But you--

29
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,481
By properly instilling
the wife's wrongdoings

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,584
we're making the mediation committee
stand on the husband's side.

31
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,987
May I say something?

32
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,624
You may be a good lawyer,

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,028
but in terms of lawyer ethics, I felt that
you made very dangerous statements.

34
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,931
You could get sued by your client.

35
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,500
I doubt we'll ever meet again,
but in the future--

36
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,269
You're hard-headed, aren't you?

37
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,403
Ms. Ishiko.

38
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,604
Excuse me?

39
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,575
Shoko Ishida. "Ishi" means "stone."
So, stone-headed Ishiko. Understood?

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,850
<i>Sono contento.</i>

41
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,618
By the way, about your attitude.

42
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,221
Aren't you being rude
to your future partner?

43
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,756
What?

44
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,425
I'm officially hired starting next week.

45
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,095
<i>Dad, please explain!</i>

46
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,766
Your voice is hurting my back. Ouch.

47
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,202
I thought you hired him just for the day.

48
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:25,206
<i>Well, I'm getting old.</i>
<i>I thought I should hire someone new.</i>

49
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,208
Someone like him?!

50
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,176
But it's already been decided.

51
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,045
He's on our website too.

52
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>-Ow, ow.</i>
-What?

53
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,052
LAWYER YOSHIO HANEOKA

54
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,089
"Call me Haneo."

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,394
"I want to be a free man,
who can fly anywhere like a feather."

56
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,631
What's with him?

57
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,252
TOWN OF BIG PORTIONS KAMOGAYA

58
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,598
THREE DAYS LATER

59
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,068
Alright.

60
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,543
Okay.

61
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,813
USHIO

62
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:48,188
Our motto is "Be an umbrella
to protect those who live earnestly."

63
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,191
Whatever the request may be,

64
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,693
there's an important…

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,094
Please take it easy.

66
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:54,995
Oh, really?

67
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,697
Then I guess I will.

68
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,667
BE AN UMBRELLA
TO PROTECT THOSE WHO LIVE EARNESTLY.

69
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,270
It's more spacious than I thought.

70
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,838
<i>Sono contento.</i>

71
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,476
Oh, can I see the materials
I returned the other day?

72
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,377
Sure.

73
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,615
I thought I'd take a look
from a different angle.

74
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,823
"A charismatic phrase."

75
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,426
"Maybe I should
mutter something in Italian."

76
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,561
This was in the file.

77
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,698
"Neglecting husband's laundry is
default of obligation."

78
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,134
"Banning smoking is moral harassment."
I found these too.

79
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:39,773
You accidentally slipped these help notes
and were desperate to get them back.

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,607
Am I wrong?

81
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,346
Could you be acting out
the unconventional great lawyers

82
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,948
that we see on TV shows and novels?

83
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,951
Reading my notes without permission
is a breach of privacy.

84
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,020
It wasn't on purpose.

85
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,522
-Even so--
-Hang on! It's still my turn.

86
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,323
What?

87
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,525
Now, I'm guessing that was on purpose too.

88
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,426
That?

89
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,762
That, when you appeared just in time.

90
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,731
I knew something was weird.

91
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,234
I looked away because you weren't there,
but I heard a voice.

92
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,403
And the next thing I know, you were there.

93
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,605
You showed up in such a short time.

94
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:15,943
<i>Weren't you just hiding behind the pillar</i>
<i>to appear at the right time?</i>

95
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,778
Sorry to keep you waiting.

96
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,880
And…

97
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,316
that "<i>sono contento</i>" you keep saying.

98
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,185
Apparently, it means "satisfied."

99
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,454
But it doesn't make sense at all.

100
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,356
<i>Sono contento.</i>

101
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,026
I'm sorry, but it's just lame.
It's no Sonokong.

102
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,829
Who cares?
There are tons of lawyers today.

103
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,733
It's saturated. So we need to show people
what kind of lawyer we are.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,004
There's cosplay lawyers and idol lawyers.
I just happen to be a genius lawyer.

105
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,941
-I see.
-It's called branding.

106
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,244
I figured we'd get more requests that way.

107
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,346
I'm happy to receive more requests.

108
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,982
But your actions and words
could get us in trouble.

109
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:59,119
We're a small firm.
One scandal could put us out of business.

110
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,622
Please stop that behavior right now.

111
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,457
-No.
-Stop it.

112
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,525
No.

113
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,860
Your fake talent
will be exposed in no time.

114
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,229
I don't want to hear that
from a paralegal!

115
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,433
From you, who still can't be a lawyer.

116
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,839
It's not that I can't be a lawyer.
I choose not to be one.

117
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,174
Huh?

118
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:25,312
To be honest, I don't think
my legal abilities are inferior to yours.

119
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,114
Yeah, right. That's not true.

120
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,516
That's so lame.

121
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,624
As a paralegal,
I will assist you perfectly.

122
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,892
Oh?

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,335
Hello, this is Ushio Law Firm.

124
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,272
<i>I would like to request</i>
<i>Mr. Haneoka to look at my case.</i>

125
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,173
What?

126
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,577
See?

127
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,821
Oh, right. I see.

128
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,157
So, you saw me on the website.

129
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,758
Yes.

130
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,131
I will make sure
you will be <i>sono contento</i>.

131
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,033
"Sono"?

132
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,368
Please have a seat.

133
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,004
Here.

134
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,672
-He saw the website.
-Thanks.

135
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,042
And he thought I was the one.

136
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,214
And what is your request?

137
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,284
The thing is…

138
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,822
I was charging my phone in a café

139
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,424
and I got sued for that.

140
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,362
Okay, let me confirm.

141
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,969
Mr. Oba, you've been frequently going to
Café de Sevon for the past month,

142
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,505
where you stay from 7 to 9:30 p.m.

143
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,542
and used their outlet
to charge your phone.

144
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,644
-I didn't use that much.
-It's a bother.

145
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,113
<i>In response, the café manager suddenly</i>

146
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,583
<i>demanded one million yen</i>
<i>for emotional distress</i>

147
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,920
<i>on top of the electricity bill.</i>

148
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,321
Is that correct?

149
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,593
If I ignore him, he said he'll… You know.

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,428
No, I don't know.

151
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,664
-He'll file civil and criminal lawsuits.
-Oh, civil…

152
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,067
How can he sue me for something like this?

153
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,635
This isn't America.

154
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,004
How often do you go to this café?

155
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:31,872
Almost every day.

156
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,173
That often?

157
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,611
I only have Wednesdays off
and I work the rest of the week.

158
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,349
So I stop by every day after work
to do some small tasks.

159
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,785
Why this café?

160
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,887
It's cozy.

161
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,592
And you work at--

162
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,560
Car Captain. A used car dealership!

163
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,661
Right. Okay.

164
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,333
What do you think?
A million yen is just too…

165
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,568
Um, first of all,

166
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,705
um, can you see me?

167
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,674
First of all, this is a warning letter.

168
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,911
You haven't been sued.

169
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:11,645
Oh.

170
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,615
<i>However,</i>
<i>Article 245 of the Penal Code states that</i>

171
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,150
<i>"electricity is considered a property."</i>

172
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,553
Using the outlet
without permission is a theft--

173
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,520
Th-Theft?

174
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:25,258
Also, if it becomes a criminal case,
the police will question and arrest you--

175
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,526
A-Arrest?!

176
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,129
-Let's calm down for a moment.
-I'll be arrested?

177
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,265
-I'm sorry.
-Let's take a deep breath.

178
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,101
And breathe out.

179
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,074
-Good.
-Thank you.

180
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,111
I'm really sorry for what I did.

181
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,814
But can we somehow settle for 100,000 yen?

182
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,249
Okay.

183
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,451
Well, a million yen is a rip-off.

184
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,121
By the way,
our initial consultation is free.

185
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,258
The retainer fee is 100,000 yen
plus a contingency fee. Is that alright?

186
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,226
Yes.

187
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,828
Then your signature here please.

188
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,304
Why are you following me?

189
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,106
You could cause trouble for us.

190
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,642
Don't worry. This is an easy case.

191
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,479
There are cases where small claims
were made into criminal charges.

192
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,984
In 2008, a teenager was arrested for
charging her phone at a train station.

193
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:28,555
In 2010, a man who pulled electricity from
a shared outlet was sentenced for--

194
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:29,756
It'll be fine.

195
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,659
He'll back off if a lawyer shows up.

196
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,942
We believe that this claim for damages is
clearly an overcharge.

197
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:51,912
And?

198
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,246
Huh?

199
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,781
It's too complicated.

200
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,718
Well, as I said…

201
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,287
You're saying you can't comply, right?

202
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,789
It's not that we can't comply.
Not everything…

203
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:06,727
He stays for hours every day
and even charges his phone. It's annoying.

204
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,894
<i>Right.</i>

205
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,199
<i>Have you warned him several times?</i>

206
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>No.</i>

207
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,334
Then…

208
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,203
There's a written warning.

209
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,871
PLEASE DO NOT CHARGE

210
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,473
That's not really…

211
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,108
Are you saying I'm at fault?

212
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,175
No, I meant--

213
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:26,179
It may not be much, but it becomes a
pretty big damage if everyone does it.

214
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,914
Do you know how stressful it is?

215
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,185
It's a million yen for many reasons.
Also as a warning to other customers.

216
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,420
This is not negotiable.

217
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,189
Could you reduce the amount?
It's clearly--

218
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,559
Then let's just let the police
or the court handle it.

219
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,928
We're getting nowhere bickering here.

220
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:42,829
Um…

221
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,826
What's wrong? You suddenly went quiet.

222
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,262
It's no good.

223
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,830
Huh?

224
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,532
That manager won't back down.

225
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,234
And he seems to have financial trouble.

226
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,068
What?

227
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,538
<i>The prices of the drinks</i>
<i>were raised by 50 yen</i>

228
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,807
<i>and 130 yen for pizza toast in a year.</i>

229
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:27,941
You went there often?

230
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,509
No, just once.

231
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,745
Come on, pretending to be a genius--

232
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,880
Let's persuade our client. Okay?

233
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,650
If he can't pay,
we should give up on settling.

234
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,485
Excuse me?

235
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,454
I'm giving up.

236
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,290
What?

237
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,194
You're giving up way too early.

238
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,730
If we can't settle,
there'll be no contingency fee.

239
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,666
You negotiate with the manager then.

240
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:56,002
You know that paralegals can't
negotiate legally, don't you?

241
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,972
Besides, I believe my role is to
stay behind the scene

242
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,075
and assist the lawyers to do a good job.

243
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,512
It's against my rule to
ignore you and stand out.

244
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,547
I don't care about your rule.

245
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,082
Mr. Haneoka!

246
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,085
Huh?

247
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,354
What's his problem?

248
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,302
Hey, Shoko. Shoko?

249
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,873
Could you raise my allowance--

250
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,573
No.

251
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:36,576
Okay.

252
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,554
This month is tight again.

253
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,897
ENGAGEMENT LETTER

254
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,201

255
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,624
Hey, Oba. Make sure to empty the trash.

256
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,725
Yes.

257
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,523
CAR CAPTAIN NEWS

258
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,601
Slow down. Wait for me.

00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,582

CAFÉ DE SEVON PAYMENT PLAN

263
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,134
I saw the light.

264
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,035
What?

265
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,303
Can you proceed with
the settlement with this?

266
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,105
What is this? Calm down.

267
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,073
Here.

268
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,541
Come on, do it yourself.

269
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,412
Like I said,
only a lawyer can handle this.

270
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,250
Excuse me. Hello.

271
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,686
I'm not going to negotiate.

272
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,125
Let me get to the point.

273
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,095
I believe you're having financial trouble.

274
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,300
This café is rented, correct?

275
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,870
And you're behind on your rent.

276
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,407
<i>I went to see the landlord.</i>

277
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,677
I asked if I could rent it
when the property becomes vacant.

278
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,914
And he complained that
the current tenant is behind on rent.

279
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,349
So what if I am?

280
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,952
Maybe as a last resort
to delay the rent payment,

281
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,789
did you tell the landlord you're getting
a large amount of money from this?

282
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,595
If you can consider
resolving Mr. Oba's case peacefully,

283
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,664
we may be able to help you.

284
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,899
Such as
negotiating to pay in installments.

285
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,336
That's what you suggest.
To terminate a lease agreement for…

286
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,672
…not paying the rent,
the court has established

287
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,141
a standard that
non-payment of rent isn't enough.

288
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:34,481
But there also must be a breach of trust
between the landlord and the tenant.

289
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,248
Therefore…

290
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,717
…it's important to first
express clearly that

291
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,620
you're willing to pay
and maintain a trusted relationship.

292
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,058
When negotiating,
it helps to have a payment plan…

293
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,393
…including the amount of monthly payment…

294
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,595
…and the period of time…

295
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,829
…until the full payment is made.

296
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:50,697
We have it here…

297
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,798
…just in case.

298
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,502
If you would
reconsider your claim against Mr. Oba…

299
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,972
…we'll help you with everything we have.
What do you say?

300
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,917
I'd love to get your help.

301
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,289
I panicked after he came in yelling at me
for falling behind on rent once.

302
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,991
That's why I ended up doing this.

303
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
I'm really sorry.

304
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,462
Oh, could you tell him I apologized?

305
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,298
Please tell him in person.

306
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,366
Huh?

307
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,075
I'm sorry for the trouble.

308
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,577
No, no. Me too.

309
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,714
Can I come to the café again?

310
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,117
Yeah, of course. Come by anytime.

311
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:44,984
Thank you.

312
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,586
Would you like a drink now?

313
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,354
I can't today, but thank you.

314
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,490
Thank you very much.

315
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,325
Thank you for the phone call.

316
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,094
Not at all. Thank you.

317
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,629
I'm Sawamura.

318
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,366
Thank you very much for everything.

319
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,634
I'm glad I could help.

320
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,069
You too, Ishiko.

321
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,738
Oh, I just work behind the scenes.

322
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,473
Ishiko?

323
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,741
Huh? Oh.

324
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,911
Actually, I'm your junior from
Nishi High School.

325
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,613
What?

326
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,815
I was in
the sports festival committee with you.

327
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,885
Oh, you're two grades below me.

328
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:19,786
Yes.

329
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,228
Isn't that cool? Seriously.

330
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,497
Hey!

331
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,570
I'm sorry.
It's just, you seem quite different now.

332
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,471
No worries.

333
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,472
Ishiko?

334
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,676
That was her nickname back then
because she's a hard worker. Right?

335
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,912
Apparently, also because I'm hard-headed.

336
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,314
So it's always been your nickname.

337
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,583
I've always admired you.

338
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,724
Oh, no. I mean, you know…

339
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,526
You were smart and popular.
I looked up to you.

340
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,931
You wanted to be
a lawyer back then, right?

341
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,334
I remembered that.

342
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:14,274
<i>But when I checked the firm's website,</i>
<i>I only found Mr. Haneoka.</i>

343
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,543
That's why you chose me?

344
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,479
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:20,847
It's fine.

346
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,216
Aren't you going to be a lawyer?

347
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,023
Um, I'm not sure.

348
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,703
Well, my train is here. Bye.

349
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,571
You're hiding something, aren't you?

350
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,443
<i>From your workplace,</i>

351
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,147
<i>Car Captain's workshop,</i>
<i>your house and the café</i>

352
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,316
<i>are in opposite directions.</i>

353
00:21:56,382 --> 00:22:01,454
<i>That means you've been going to a café</i>
<i>all the way on the other side of town</i>

354
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,456
<i>just because it's cozy.</i>

355
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,331
<i>Also, there's a Car Captain branch</i>
<i>across that café.</i>

356
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,300
<i>And your usual seat has its perfect view.</i>

357
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,235
<i>I doubt this is a coincidence.</i>

358
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,672
<i>Door's closing.</i>

359
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:27,013
There's something else
you actually want to request, right?

360
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,414
Again.

361
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,483
I'm back.

362
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,618
Oh, they're back.

363
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:41,552
Hey, daughter.

364
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,889
Yup, the daughter’s here. Hello. Welcome.

365
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,161
We're back.

366
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,562
Hi.

367
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,230
Wh-Who are those people?

368
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,366
Huh? They're my friends. Yeah.

369
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:59,003
Another party?
Your back is not healed yet.

370
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:02,006
Food tastes better
if we all eat together, right?

371
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:05,176
Oh, let me.

372
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,211
Really? Thanks.

373
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:09,413
There.

374
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,916
Did you reach a settlement?

375
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,117
Yes, successfully.

376
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,318
Let's eat together.

377
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,786
Oh, yes. Thank you.

378
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:17,254
Isn't it great, Shoko?

379
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:21,091
But Mr. Oba still seems troubled
about something else.

380
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,761
He wouldn't tell us what it is.

381
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:26,964
I see. A lot of Japanese people

382
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:30,734
think that confiding in a lawyer
is a last resort.

383
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:33,904
That American system,
where people easily sue others,

384
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,906
has a lot to do with their gun society,

385
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:40,911
but it prevents directly fighting
each other and ruining relationships.

386
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,449
Well, I guess we approach law
in a completely different way.

387
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:46,884
Yes, that's true.

388
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,954
Yeah. Oh, is there a new ketchup?

389
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,591
Wait! The one we have is still good.

390
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:54,825
But that's…

391
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,127
See, there's so much left.

392
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:58,629
Geez, what a cheapskate.

393
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,431
Business is tough, you see.

394
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,299
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

395
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:05,769
It's your fault, Dad.
You keep consulting clients for free.

396
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:10,407
If there's someone soaked in the rain,
you'd hold an umbrella over them, right?

397
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:11,842
There you go again.

398
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:16,046
Shall we set a trap?

399
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:20,885
DAY OFF

400
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,172
As I thought, he's filming them.

401
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:43,908
Go.

402
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,984
Okay, drop your pen.

403
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:56,153
<i>Drop it.</i>

404
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,288
There.

405
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:58,355
<i>Okay.</i>

406
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:01,659
Bend over and pick it up
with your back to the camera.

407
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:04,728
Come on, bend over.

408
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,366
What are you doing? He'll be suspicious.

409
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,736
Get over here. We need to talk.

410
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,606
I'm not doing this.

411
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,542
-Get over here!
-Don't shout.

412
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:19,343
Hurry.

413
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,278
What is it?

414
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,913
This plan is useless now.

415
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,682
It was useless to begin with.

416
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:25,583
What?

417
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,786
You want Mr. Oba to film my backside
and use that against him.

418
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:29,620
Yup.

419
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,789
And we can ask him what he's doing.

420
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:33,591
This is sexual harassment against me.

421
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:36,060
What are you thinking in this day and age?

422
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:36,927
Rude.

423
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:39,430
And this deceitful conduct
to have such a moment filmed

424
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:41,966
and using that on him is against my rules.

425
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,635
This is to get us a case.
We need the money, right?

426
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:45,369
Still!

427
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:49,106
If he finds out what we're doing,
we could get sued instead.

428
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:51,909
Don't be such a stiff. It's a gray area.

429
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,111
What? Don't be silly.

430
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,512
What are you doing here?

431
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,420
Are you spying on me?

432
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:04,955
No.

433
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,592
You said something about
getting sued, right?

434
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,928
Can I get sued for what I'm filming?

435
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,867
I really am in trouble. Aren't I?

436
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:21,405
That's right.

437
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,110
We were so worried when we found out
that you're secretly filming them, right?

438
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,745
Yes.

439
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,752
I wasn't sure if I should ask for help.

440
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:35,653
Right.

441
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,659
Let me confirm.

442
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,763
You used to work at
the Car Captain Koide branch

443
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:48,098
<i>across the street from Café de Sevon.</i>

444
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:52,336
<i>But the branch manager Yano puts pressure</i>
<i>on the employees to increase the sales</i>

445
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:54,438
<i>in order to compete with other branches.</i>

446
00:27:55,139 --> 00:28:00,044
At times, it went beyond power harassment
to what we call workplace bullying.

447
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:02,446
That's right.

448
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:07,484
The bullying was
especially harsh towards you.

449
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,421
<i>You were taunted for being</i>
<i>inefficient and unsociable</i>

450
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,723
<i>and were reprimanded for hours every day.</i>

451
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,359
<i>He either gave you no work at all</i>

452
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,395
<i>or forced a huge amount of work on you.</i>

453
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:22,566
<i>On top of that, he told everyone in</i>
<i>the sales department to ignore you.</i>

454
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,969
<i>They took part</i>
<i>so they wouldn't be his target</i>

455
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,339
<i>and treated you like you didn't exist.</i>

456
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:30,240
<i>That's right.</i>

457
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:35,946
<i>The only one who treated you well was</i>
<i>your colleague, Atsuhiko Sawamura.</i>

458
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,248
<i>But one day, after helping you</i>

459
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:41,485
<i>with the huge amount of work</i>
<i>you were forced to do,</i>

460
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,089
<i>Mr. Sawamura</i>
<i>also became a target of bullying.</i>

461
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,990
That's too much work for one person.

462
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,426
Thanks. Sorry.

463
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:50,894
<i>In the sales group chat,</i>

464
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:54,765
<i>you get scolded unless you reply within</i>
<i>two minutes after the message is read.</i>

465
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:58,535
<i>And messages are sent regardless of</i>
<i>it being a late night or an early morning.</i>

466
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,072
<i>If you don't respond,</i>
<i>you'll be reprimanded again.</i>

467
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:06,610
<i>From all the pressure,</i>
<i>Mr. Sawamura had a nervous breakdown</i>

468
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:08,946
<i>and began to make more trivial mistakes.</i>

469
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:11,381
<i>One day, the branch manager</i>

470
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,617
<i>hit him over that mistake.</i>

471
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,052
Yes, I'm so sorry.

472
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:18,222
That's right.

473
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,260
You reported the branch manager's conduct
to the company.

474
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:28,365
However, the head office only interviewed
the branch manager and determined that

475
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,768
there was no evidence of bullying.

476
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:35,072
Right after that,
you were transferred to the workshop.

477
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,842
That's where you work now. Correct?

478
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:40,811
Yes.

479
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:44,548
I think it's because
of the accusation I made.

480
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:48,952
Sawamura…

481
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,255
is probably…

482
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:56,160
still getting bullied.

483
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,832
Even if I told him to leave evidence,

484
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,035
he'd be too afraid of retaliation.

485
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:07,004
So I thought I would.

486
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:09,873
<i>I filmed them every night.</i>

487
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:22,653
<i>But even after a month,</i>
<i>I couldn't get anything.</i>

488
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,059
Um…

489
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,995
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

490
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,233
Mr. Oba.

491
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,138
Bullying should be
brought to justice by law.

492
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,642
Words like "idiot"
and "go to hell" are insults.

493
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:49,346
Spreading baseless rumors is defamation.

494
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,615
Forcing you to do something is extortion.

495
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,218
Hitting someone is assault.

496
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:55,352
Without a doubt.

497
00:30:58,222 --> 00:30:59,823
Please help me.

498
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:03,260
I want to save Sawamura somehow.

499
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,598
Leave it to us.

500
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:15,739
-Sorry.
-That was on purpose.

501
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,008
ARTICLE 230 OF THE PENAL CODE
DEFAMATION

502
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,877
-Good work, sir.
-You too.

503
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,949
ARTICLE 208 OF THE PENAL CODE
ASSAULT

504
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:47,869
Sawamura.

505
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,474
Why are you…

506
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,012
Did you lose weight again?

507
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,582
Oh, excuse me.

508
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,952
I'm Haneoka, a lawyer.

509
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,754
About the bullying in--

510
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,855
I have nothing to say.

511
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:09,624
W-Wait. Don't worry. They're on your--

512
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,026
Excuse me.

513
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:23,838
He's probably
afraid of the company finding out.

514
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:32,447
Thanks for everything.
The landlord agreed to wait for the rent.

515
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:33,882
And this.

516
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,518
Thanks to you, we're now busy.

517
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:39,387
I guess everyone was
looking for a place to charge.

518
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:41,523
May I?

519
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:42,757
Of course.

520
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:44,993
-Excuse me.
-Coming.

521
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,161
Enjoy.

522
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:47,162
Thank you.

523
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,232
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

524
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,401
Our fifth-anniversary sale
starts tomorrow.

525
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:55,670
-Please stop by.
-Thank you.

526
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,339
A FEW HOURS AGO

527
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:59,708
"Fifth-anniversary sale"?

528
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:04,112
<i>Yes. I was suddenly asked</i>
<i>to go to the Koide branch tomorrow.</i>

529
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:06,948
<i>They're short-staffed and need help.</i>

530
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,250
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>the branch manager requested it.</i>

531
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:11,419
This is our chance.

532
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:15,824
I wonder what'll happen tomorrow.

533
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:18,393
You think we'll get any proof?

534
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:23,732
What?

535
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:24,733
Huh?

536
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,035
Oh, my, my.

537
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:29,437
Be careful. You spilled it.

538
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:33,241
-Is this…
-A month's worth of Mr. Oba's recording.

539
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:35,143
I was looking for a proof.

540
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:38,480
That's so unexpected.

541
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:40,849
You do this kind of dull work too?

542
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:44,719
What do you think I am? You won't find
an earnest lawyer like me anywhere.

543
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:45,620
Really?

544
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:48,723
Excuse me. We're from Car Captain.

545
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,192
Okay.

546
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,996
We saw you talking to Sawamura last night.

547
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:56,598
Oh, yes.

548
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:59,901
I understand you're a lawyer,
but I think you're mistaken.

549
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:04,205
It wasn't the branch manager
who harassed Sawamura.

550
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:05,807
It was Oba.

551
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,443
-Excuse me?
-What?

552
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,012
He was transferred
because of power harassment.

553
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:15,583
Oba always said harsh things to Sawamura.

554
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,953
Messages like these
were daily occurrences.

555
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,121
May I?

556
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,189
YOU DONE YET? CALL ME.

557
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:23,925
He was pressuring and rushing him.

558
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:28,830
I can understand
feeling pressured by this.

559
00:34:28,897 --> 00:34:30,532
But transferring him for this--

560
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:32,133
This is the worst one.

561
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,540
After this, he couldn't deny his actions
and he was transferred.

562
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,775
ENOUGH ALREADY

563
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,811
HOW MANY TIMES NOW? JUST QUIT ALREADY

564
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:46,314
It's not a screenshot, so it's not fake.

565
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:49,150
JUST DIE

566
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:54,556
What do you think?

567
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,426
Can I have your business cards first?

568
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,328
-Of course. I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

569
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,007
Is Mr. Oba here?

570
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:14,609
He's not here today.

571
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,778
I see. Thank you.

572
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,221
<i>Please help me.</i>

573
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:29,023
I want to save Sawamura somehow.

574
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,596
<i>This is Oba.</i>
<i>I can't answer the phone right now…</i>

575
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:42,837
Mr. Oba is absent.

576
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,674
Mr. Sawamura back then.

577
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,478
He also seemed to be afraid of Mr. Oba.

578
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:56,551
He could be resenting them for
the transfer and plotting revenge.

579
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,353
What?

580
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:04,292
I can't.

581
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,294
Let's turn down this case.

582
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,597
But we've already accepted--

583
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,599
He hid things from us once.

584
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,235
This is too risky. It'll ruin my brand.

585
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,136
Your brand?

586
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:16,604
Do it on your own.

587
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,507
Like I said,
a paralegal can't do this on my--

588
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:22,477
Then just give up.
Since you <i>are </i>a paralegal.

589
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:29,284
Fine. I'll give up.

590
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:32,320
I'll give up expecting anything from you.

591
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:38,860
<i>Slowly lower your center of gravity.</i>

592
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,831
Right hand, up. Left hand, down.

593
00:36:43,898 --> 00:36:46,568
Like you're holding a ball,
bring in your left leg.

594
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:48,136
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

595
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,470
Don't strain yourself.

596
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,440
I can invoice tabs
that are up to five years old?

597
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:53,374
That's right.

598
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:55,076
That's great news.

599
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,811
A lot of my customers have open tabs.

600
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:58,213
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

601
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,816
Shoko will get mad again
if I ask for your advice like this.

602
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:04,018
What's that?

603
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,420
-Is there a point?
-Yes.

604
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:07,422
Rock, paper, scissors!

605
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,389
Yes!

606
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,225
You're so bad at this.

607
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:11,626
-So bad.
-Hush.

608
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:13,695
Drink whatever you want.

609
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:16,598
How long have you been living together?

610
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:18,066
About three years.

611
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,767
But she's still polite.

612
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,069
Big emotional distance.

613
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:23,938
That's what I love about her, Dad.

614
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:24,739
Don't call me dad.

615
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,275
-I got a haircut.
-So?

616
00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:28,876
Will she notice it?

617
00:37:28,943 --> 00:37:30,111
I've no idea.

618
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:31,012
Come on.

619
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,614
-Dad.
-Geez.

620
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:35,783
Excuse me, I need to talk to you.

621
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:37,752
Oh, hello.

622
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,254
Good evening.

623
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,557
Hey, do I seem different today?

624
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:43,625
Huh?

625
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:44,826
-I don't know.
-See?

626
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:48,096
I can't tell.
I've never looked at you that closely.

627
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,669
You okay? Stay strong.

628
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:57,138
There's always tomorrow.

629
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:59,040
-Hang in there.
-Okay.

630
00:37:59,674 --> 00:38:00,808
What do you need?

631
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:01,709
Oh.

632
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,245
Could you replace him?

633
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:05,146
What?

634
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:07,448
Mr. Haneoka and
I have very different rules.

635
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:09,851
I don't know

636
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:13,021
if I can work with him from now on.

637
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:11,895
This is where I first met him.

638
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:16,099
<i>He was having trouble with pool tickets.</i>

639
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:19,669
<i>So I recommended him to buy</i>
<i>a set of tickets if he comes often.</i>

640
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,171
What a strange encounter.

641
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:23,807
That was all that day.

642
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:27,644
<i>I saw him again</i>
<i>three weeks later in a Tai Chi class.</i>

643
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:29,746
<i>So he does Tai Chi.</i>

644
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,050
<i>He thanked me for the other day,</i>
<i>but I didn't remember.</i>

645
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,821
<i>I asked him how he knew it was me,</i>
<i>when I was wearing sunglasses and a hat.</i>

646
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,657
<i>And he said</i>
<i>he knew from the shape of my ears.</i>

647
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:41,725
Ears?

648
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:42,893
Incredible, right?

649
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,896
Apparently,
he memorizes everything instantly.

650
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:47,497
-Sir.
-Hi.

651
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,401
<i>I got curious, so I had a chat with him.</i>

652
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:56,106
<i>And I found out that he's a lawyer,</i>
<i>who passed the preliminary and bar exam</i>

653
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:59,376
<i>in one try</i>
<i>despite being a high school graduate.</i>

654
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:00,410
Me too.

655
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:01,578
You're a lawyer?

656
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:02,579
Yes.

657
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:04,848
Really?

658
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,717
In one try?

659
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:14,658
But he couldn't accommodate the clients'
request in every case he took on.

660
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:18,728
So he was fired and was looking for a job.

661
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:20,830
Even though he's so smart?

662
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,299
<i>The thing is…</i>

663
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:23,767
Thank you.

664
00:41:25,168 --> 00:41:27,537
Have you heard of photographic memory?

665
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:29,139
No. What is it?

666
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:33,109
It's an ability to memorize everything
like a photograph.

667
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:34,945
I see.

668
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:39,015
<i>I passed only because</i>
<i>I have a good memory.</i>

669
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:41,117
But…

670
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:44,621
With such great ability,
no lawsuit is difficult--

671
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:50,193
Well, this job is not just
memorizing articles and precedents, right?

672
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,194
That's true.

673
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:55,532
The important thing is to
apply my knowledge to the situation.

674
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:59,703
But I can't deal with unexpected events.

675
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:04,040
If my prepared plan fails,
I don't know how to overcome it

676
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,710
and I freeze up on the spot.

677
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:09,346
Is there a reason for that?

678
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:12,248
Well…

679
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:21,124
<i>The price of the drinks</i>
<i>were raised by 50 yen</i>

680
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:23,326
<i>and 130 yen for pizza toast in a year.</i>

681
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,696
He's suffering too.

682
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:31,701
<i>Then let's just let the police</i>
<i>or the court handle it.</i>

683
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:33,570
<i>We're getting nowhere bickering here.</i>

684
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:37,140
I think I said too much again.

685
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,111
<i>Welcome.</i>

686
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,199
Sorry to barge in.

687
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:15,703
Sorry about tod--

688
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,638
Those messages to Mr. Sawamura…

689
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,274
Did you really send them?

690
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,549
Yes.

691
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:32,920
Please come in.

692
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:37,558
So you were secretly filming the branch
to get back at them for the transfer?

693
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,763
Then what exactly did you want to do
when you asked for my help?

694
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,042
Welcome.

695
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:45,780
<i>Car Captain…</i>

696
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:49,651
Here, have a balloon. It's a hippo.

697
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:51,019
Here you go.

698
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,256
Sure. Please follow me.

699
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,323
Thank you.

700
00:42:58,927 --> 00:42:59,761
<i>Car…</i>

701
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:16,011
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

702
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:18,647
Uh…

703
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,183
You're not coming in today?

704
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,818
<i>No. We have no case, right?</i>

705
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:27,689
Then at least let me know.

706
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:29,491
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

707
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:31,226
<i>Car Captain</i>

708
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:33,461
Are you outside?

709
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,729
Well, yeah.

710
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:37,399
I can hear the "Car Captain" jingle.

711
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:39,134
I think you're hearing things.

712
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,635
No, I can hear it clearly.

713
00:43:41,136 --> 00:43:43,204
Are you at the Koide branch?

714
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:47,108
<i>You said you turned down the case</i>
<i>because he admitted to harassment.</i>

715
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:50,145
Um, this is my private time. Bye.

716
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,115
What? Wait a minute.

717
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:55,917
What's going on?

718
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,787
Come on…

719
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,593
-You scared me.
-Why are you here?

720
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,595
What are you plotting?

721
00:44:07,662 --> 00:44:10,198
Nothing! I told you, it's my private time.

722
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:15,337
Actually…

723
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:17,706
I'm keeping an eye on him.

724
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:21,776
Mr. Oba might do something
to Mr. Sawamura as retaliation.

725
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,213
Um, could you take over my client?

726
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,349
-Though you declined?
-My hands are full.

727
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:29,184
I don't mind.

728
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:31,619
All you need is their signature.

729
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,596
I'll be taking over from here.

730
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:42,864
You're in my way.

731
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:43,998
I'm Oba.

732
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:45,567
What kind of car are you…

733
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:47,802
Please follow me.

734
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:49,070
Thank you for waiting.

735
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,612
Thank you very much.

736
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,014
Thank you very much.

737
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:05,420
Nothing happened, huh?

738
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:08,690
Yeah.

739
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:13,995
Oba.

740
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,164
Yes.

741
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,335
You messed up, Oba.

742
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,206
You sold the car with reduced mileage.
You tampered with the meter, huh?

743
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,508
What's this about?

744
00:45:29,544 --> 00:45:31,546
This is the car you sold, right?

745
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:35,316
Did you do this to increase sales?

746
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:39,721
No. I didn't do anything.

747
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:41,623
You're the one who was in charge.

748
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:42,524
I just…

749
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:55,403
I took over Sawamura's client.

750
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,139
Is that true, Sawamura?

751
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,748
I know nothing about that.

752
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:13,321
Oba, you really shouldn't lie.

753
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:14,489
I didn't do this.

754
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:15,457
Fine. I got it.

755
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,357
Please listen.

756
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:17,625
Let's talk in the office.

757
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:20,161
Let's go.

758
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:23,531
Hey.

759
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:24,699
Let me go.

760
00:46:24,766 --> 00:46:25,867
Don't make a scene.

761
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:26,768
It's not me.

762
00:46:26,835 --> 00:46:29,103
Stop causing trouble for your colleagues…

763
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:32,774
I'm sorry, but we're--

764
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:33,741
Excuse me.

765
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:36,511
I will be taking over from here.

766
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,481
I'm sorry, but who are you?

767
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:43,818
I'm Yoshio Haneoka.
A lawyer representing Mr. Oba.

768
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:45,954
A lawyer?

769
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,322
And she is…

770
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,792
I'm Shoko Ishida. A paralegal.

771
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:53,394
Mr. Oba, you can hang up now.

772
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:54,295
Okay.

773
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,531
What's this about?

774
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,299
Please give us a moment.

775
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,338
Mr. Sawamura, this way please.

776
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,140
Hey, what are you doing?

777
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:09,310
This is not an unlawful possession.
It's a test drive.

778
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:11,212
-What?
-Ishiko, put him in the car.

779
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:13,181
Hey, stop.

780
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,217
-Where are you going?
-Wait a minute.

781
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:18,520
Oba!

782
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:21,456
-Kawai, get us a car!
-Yes, sir.

783
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:26,294
Hey, what are you doing?

784
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,195
Mr. Sawamura.

785
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:31,633
I'm guessing the branch manager told you
that if you helped him frame Mr. Oba,

786
00:47:31,699 --> 00:47:34,035
he would stop being so strict with you.

787
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:38,139
And you ended up
participating in his plan.

788
00:47:38,673 --> 00:47:41,109
Excuse me, could you fill me in?

789
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,211
Mr. Oba had already noticed.

790
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,813
That you had betrayed him.

791
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:48,016
I…

792
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:50,785
<i>Last night, I heard the truth</i>
<i>about those messages.</i>

793
00:47:50,852 --> 00:47:51,753
I…

794
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:55,256
I didn't send all of them.

795
00:47:55,857 --> 00:48:00,295
He did send messages to rush him,
such as "Hello?"

796
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:05,199
But he didn't send the abusive messages
that caused his transfer.

797
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:10,638
That message was sent

798
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:14,909
during the lunch break on my workday.

799
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,513
<i>The branch manager called me in</i>
<i>when I was taking a break.</i>

800
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,582
<i>It was during that time frame.</i>

801
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,583
Oba!

802
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:23,985
Yes, sir!

803
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:27,989
<i>If you touch the laptop I left behind</i>
<i>before it turns to the lock screen,</i>

804
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:31,926
<i>anyone can send messages as me</i>
<i>even if they don't know my password.</i>

805
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:35,797
<i>The only person</i>
<i>who could've done that back then</i>

806
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:40,368
<i>was Sawamura, who was with me.</i>

807
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:47,642
But even so, Mr. Oba didn't go after you.

808
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,980
He went through with it
under such obvious circumstances,

809
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,783
so I knew that the branch manager had
forced him to do it.

810
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:03,358
Hey, stop the car!

811
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,727
You felt guilty towards Mr. Oba.

812
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:08,262
Th-That's why
you seemed scared of him, right?

813
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,333
How much of this
is going according to plan?

814
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,936
I didn't expect you to tag along.

815
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:18,606
Other than that, mostly…

816
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:23,144
Stop the car!

817
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:27,115
Oh…

818
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,349
Oba!

819
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,317
You!

820
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,386
-Oba!
-Hey, Oba! Wait!

821
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:32,487
Wait!

822
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,622
Do you have any idea what you've done?

823
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:37,925
Last night, I wondered
if you'd really call back

824
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:41,696
someone you personally transferred,
no matter how short-staffed you are.

825
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:46,334
And so, I came to the conclusion that

826
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:50,104
you've noticed we're up to something
and decided to make a move.

827
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:53,875
-What are you talking about?
-So we played along to get proof.

828
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:55,410
Then why didn't you tell me?

829
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:57,912
Because you're very hard-headed.

830
00:49:59,013 --> 00:50:01,983
You'd tell me that
this plan is a fraudulent act, right?

831
00:50:02,717 --> 00:50:04,786
-What's this ab…
-Mr. Sawamura.

832
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:05,687
Hey.

833
00:50:06,387 --> 00:50:09,757
Once you submit the evidence,
everything will be over.

834
00:50:10,525 --> 00:50:12,393
<i>In Mr. Oba's recordings,</i>

835
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,964
<i>there was a moment when you seemed to be</i>
<i>checking a voice recorder.</i>

836
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:20,568
<i>You're collecting evidence, aren't you?</i>

837
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:29,310
Didn't you also record the conversation
about today's data tampering?

838
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:41,255
Let me hear…

839
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,459
that audio.

840
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,195
What's this about, Sawamura?!

841
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:49,230
Come on!

842
00:51:00,842 --> 00:51:01,709
Huh?

843
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:04,679
No?

844
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:07,715
Sawamura, come over here.

845
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:08,616
Please wait.

846
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:10,752
-Hey, let me go!
-Hang on!

847
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,253
-Let go!
-Sawamura!

848
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,489
What's wrong with you? Let me go!

849
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:15,389
Sawamura!

850
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:17,391
Both of you, calm down.

851
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:34,675
-Everyone!
-Please hang on.

852
00:51:34,742 --> 00:51:35,843
Everyone!

853
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:39,113
Why didn't you speak up?

854
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:44,986
Mr. Oba. When they covered up
the workplace bullying that you reported,

855
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:47,755
why didn't you talk to a lawyer
right away?

856
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:52,627
Before you started
recording from the café.

857
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:55,696
Because…

858
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:02,770
Suing a company I work for

859
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:04,972
felt bad.

860
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,775
And it's a private matter,

861
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:11,579
so depending on someone felt wrong.

862
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:14,315
Also…

863
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:19,253
You felt pathetic.

864
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:23,991
But that's not true.

865
00:52:26,294 --> 00:52:29,130
Rules that exist
to make human relationships easier.

866
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:30,932
That is the law.

867
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:36,971
Speaking up in accordance with those rules
is not pathetic nor wrong at all.

868
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,612
Article 14 of the Constitution

869
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:49,317
stipulates that
all citizens are equal before the law.

870
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:54,055
If you know the law,
there are things you can protect or avoid.

871
00:52:54,121 --> 00:52:56,490
You can also minimize the damage.

872
00:52:57,158 --> 00:52:59,827
And we are here to help you with that.

873
00:53:00,328 --> 00:53:05,266
However, we cannot help you
unless you speak up.

874
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:11,472
We hope you'll make good use of the law
and live a happy life.

875
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,843
That's all.

876
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,345
Right?

877
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:19,847
Yes.

878
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:23,451
If you'd submit the evidence--

879
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:25,119
<i>Give this document to Oba.</i>

880
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:29,023
<i>Get him fired.</i>

881
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,425
Hey, wait…

882
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:33,494
Hey, stop it. Hey!

883
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,363
I will submit this audio!

884
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:41,569
Branch manager,
I will report your action to the company

885
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,271
and demand appropriate measures.

886
00:53:43,337 --> 00:53:46,474
If you cover it up, I'll take it to
the Labor Standards Office.

887
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,642
I promise you!

888
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,176
Don't you dare!

889
00:53:50,244 --> 00:53:53,347
You can speak up for yourself too!

890
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,081
What?

891
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:58,719
If your actions were due to pressure
from a reckless working environment,

892
00:53:58,786 --> 00:54:01,722
you may be able to
hold the company accountable for

893
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:04,992
violating their safety obligation.

894
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:08,129
If you were forced to work long hours
outside of the Article 36 agreement,

895
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:11,699
they may be violating Article 32,
Clause 1 of the Labor Standards Act

896
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:14,502
regarding the maximum
working hours per week.

897
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:18,506
Also, Clause 2. "Employers shall not
allow workers to work more than

898
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:22,376
eight hours a day excluding break time,
for each day of the week."

899
00:54:22,443 --> 00:54:25,246
And I could help you to…

900
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,215
<i>A new law to prevent</i>

901
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:04,785
<i>workplace harassment, such as</i>
<i>power harassment and sexual harassment</i>

902
00:55:04,852 --> 00:55:07,755
<i>was enacted by the Diet today.</i>

903
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,225
<i>Meaning, all companies and firms</i>

904
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:15,129
<i>must take measures against</i>
<i>power harassment in the workplace.</i>

905
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,665
-Let's dig in.
-It's huge!

906
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,000
-Excuse me.
-Wow.

907
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:21,635
Thank you.

908
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:24,438
Really, what's wrong with this town?

909
00:55:24,505 --> 00:55:27,341
Binge eating
is the selling point of this town.

910
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,178
Eat as much as you want. It's my treat.

911
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,148
-You don't have to.
-Thank you.

912
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:36,650
Man, that was a quick response.

913
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:37,818
You're that hungry?

914
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:43,624
So, are you really resigning?

915
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,698
Yes.

916
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,068
I'm going to start something new.

917
00:55:55,069 --> 00:55:57,605
I'll hang out with Sawamura as a friend.

918
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,711
Delicious, isn't it?

919
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:06,047
Yes.

920
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:08,149
Yeah?

921
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,448
Man, I'm so stuffed.

922
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:49,690
Huh?

923
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,828
Yes, hello?

924
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:58,232
<i>Surprisingly, you don't eat a lot, huh?</i>

925
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:00,534
What?

926
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,407
You eat too much.

927
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:09,410
Do I?

928
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:12,680
Anyway,

929
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,483
good work today.

930
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:20,454
You, too.

931
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:25,960
<i>Sono contento.</i>

932
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:41,041
<i>However, we cannot help you</i>
<i>unless you speak up.</i>

933
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:48,048
Actually, I--

934
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:52,520
What did you say?

935
00:57:55,089 --> 00:57:57,892
Nah, it's nothing.

936
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,393
What?

937
00:58:00,261 --> 00:58:01,095
Bye.

938
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,268
Good morning!

939
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:08,469
Good morning.

940
00:58:08,536 --> 00:58:09,370
Morning.

941
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:11,405
Huh? What's this?

942
00:58:11,472 --> 00:58:14,074
It's a gift from that
divorce settlement couple.

943
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,214
<i>When Haneo criticized</i>
<i>the wife's actions that day,</i>

944
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,650
<i>our client stood up for her, right?</i>

945
00:58:23,317 --> 00:58:27,454
<i>Apparently, that made him realize</i>
<i>that he still cares for her</i>

946
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:29,657
<i>and they decided to stop the divorce</i>
<i>for now.</i>

947
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,292
That's wonderful.

948
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:37,198
See? I was right after all.

949
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:38,999
It's a coincidence.

950
00:58:39,066 --> 00:58:41,535
You may bow down and apologize.

951
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:42,770
Did you memo that too?

952
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:44,371
-Don't talk about my memos.
-I'm back!

953
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,606
I didn't write that.

954
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:46,507
Hello.

955
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:48,075
Oh, thank you.

956
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:54,215
I'm working part-time here from today.
Pleasure to work with you!

957
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:58,319
-What?
-What?

958
00:59:01,422 --> 00:59:03,691
My son paid for game items
without telling me.

959
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,993
Meaning, he lied that he's an adult.

960
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,027
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

961
00:59:07,094 --> 00:59:08,028
You want to win?

962
00:59:08,095 --> 00:59:08,996
Yes, sir!

963
00:59:09,063 --> 00:59:11,765
<i>I wonder if he really said</i>
<i>he wants to take the exam.</i>

964
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:13,100
<i>Do you like Ishiko?</i>

965
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,435
This is a criminal case.

966
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:15,903
I need to check something.

967
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:16,870
