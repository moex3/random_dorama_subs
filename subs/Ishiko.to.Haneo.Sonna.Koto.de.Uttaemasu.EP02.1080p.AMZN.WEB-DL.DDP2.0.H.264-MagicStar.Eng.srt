1
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,311
KOONI

2
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,279
I want this character.

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,749
Let me verify your age.

4
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,751
Are you 18 or older?

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,818
Yes.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,957
You'll get into trouble

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,458
<i>later on.</i>

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:29,196
FREE LEGAL CONSULTATION

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,599
So, we hold events like this too.

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,168
Yes. So that people can reach out easily.

11
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,772
One-hour consultation is free.
There's a fee for those with requests--

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,107
Man, this is such a hassle.

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,412
It's because you're not getting any cases.

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,315
We have renovation loans,
utility costs and also your salary--

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,650
I got it.

16
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,485
There you go again.

17
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,253
Hey, hey.

18
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,054
What?

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,322
We start at 11 o'clock.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,891
It's only a banner.

21
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,660
It would look like we're already open.

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,529
It's only one or two more minutes.

23
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,430
No!

24
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,598
I'll leave it to you then, Ishiko.

25
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,902
You came to a tough workplace.

26
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,972
No. They let me work part-time
while I look for a job. I'm only grateful.

27
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,807
Good boy.

28
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,377
I expect your
paychecks' worth of performance.

29
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,344
You got it.

30
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:29,824
"When coming up with genius ideas,
I should furrow my eyebrows."

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,425
He's at it again.

32
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,860
Did you bring your phone?

33
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,696
Excuse me, are you open?

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,431
Yes.

35
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,901
I'd be happy to consult you.

36
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:45,806
Um, my son paid for game items
without telling me.

37
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,508
Can you help us?

38
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,412
Alright, let me confirm.

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,184
Ms. Eiko Aida, you let Kota,
your sixth-grader son, have a smartphone.

40
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,086
But only to contact him,

41
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:02,823
who attends cram school
until late every night.

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,128
However, Kota bought 198,700 yen
worth of items for a social game called

43
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,099
Dropping Puzzle, also known as Doropazu
without your permission.

44
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,435
You found this out three days ago,

45
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:18,339
when you checked your
credit card statement.

46
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,542
You tried to cancel it,
but it had already been withdrawn.

47
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:26,180
You sent a refund request mail to Tension,
the company that manages Doropazu,

48
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,817
<i>but they declined your request</i>
<i>and that's why you're here.</i>

49
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,188
This is his smartphone.
And Doropazu… There it is.

50
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,289
Yes.

51
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,392
It looks fun.

52
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,226
Right?

53
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,394
Kota.

54
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,596
Sorry.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,299
May I look through your phone?

56
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,468
Oh, yes. Of course.

57
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Apparently, he can memorize</i>
<i>what he sees like a photograph.</i>

58
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,075
What do you think?

59
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:03,250
Well, we'll probably have to talk to
their legal department or lawyer.

60
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,288
<i>But Article 5 of the Civil Code</i>
<i>states that a contract made by a minor</i>

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,090
without parental consent can be rescinded.

62
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,528
Leave it to me.

63
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,798
Oh, thank you very much!

64
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,569
Kota, I wasn't sure
but I'm so glad we decided to come.

65
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:28,042
And do we have to go to court?

66
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,411
Legal fees cost a lot, right?

67
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,014
No, it should be fine.
I'm sure they wouldn't want that either.

68
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,450
That's great.

69
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,551
Excuse me.

70
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,021
It feels wrong to rescind
just because a child did it.

71
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,890
Ah, I know what you mean.

72
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:46,493
But it's a rule that a minor's mistakes
should be covered by society.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,529
-Ishiko, the contract.
-Coming.

74
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,866
<i>Now, this is our fee.</i>

75
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,850
Really, I'm fine by myself.

76
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,053
No. I'm worried about
your actions that lack L.E.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,154
L.E.?

78
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,122
Lawyer Ethics.

79
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,523
-Go home.
-No way.

80
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,901
-Mr. Haneoka.
-Oh, hi.

81
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:28,802
How are you?

82
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,904
I didn't think you were the legal counsel.

83
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,973
I'm sorry I resigned so suddenly.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,874
Not a problem.

85
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,245
I've been wondering
how you've been after you quit.

86
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,713
But I'm happy for you.

87
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,217
They insisted on having me in their firm.

88
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,621
That's right. We needed him.

89
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,689
Is that so?

90
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,294
Here's the access log
to the account you requested.

91
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:58,198
There've been payments repeatedly,
so it's clear that these are not mistakes.

92
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:01,635
However,
the user is currently 12 years old.

93
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,937
The minor's right to rescind--

94
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,841
But since the phone is under
the mother's name,

95
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,577
we have no proof
that it was used by a minor.

96
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,579
Unless you can prove--

97
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:17,051
So, you'll give us the refund
if we can prove that. Correct?

98
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,719
We're gathering the records--

99
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,154
Mr. Haneoka.

100
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,425
Here's the problem.

101
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:30,197
Doropazu asks if you're 18 years or older

102
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,568
and only users who select "Yes"
can pay for game items.

103
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:39,773
Meaning, he lied that he's an adult.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,777
This is fraud clearly intended to
deceive the game operators--

105
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,347
Under METI standards,

106
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,917
even if a minor chose "Yes" to
"Are you an adult?" it's not a fraud--

107
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,054
Mr. Haneoka, Doropazu asks
if the user is 18 years or older.

108
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,222
I know that.

109
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,225
But this April,
the legal adult age was lowered to 18.

110
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,893
So, asking if you're 18 or older…

111
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,629
-Mr. Haneoka!
-It's the same as--

112
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,900
Then…

113
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,704
I guess we'll just have to
settle this in court.

114
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,341
If it's approved, the refund will be paid.

115
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,744
-But a trial is--
-Then…

116
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,980
You'll just have to give up.

117
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,050
I've heard your story.

118
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,622
After you got kicked out of our company,
no one wanted to hire you, right?

119
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,360
Can someone like that

120
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,797
turn this case over?

121
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,871
I'll see you in court.

122
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,825
Geez,
he's trying to rattle me with such a lie.

123
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,993
You don't believe him, right?

124
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,061
Right.

125
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,397
I almost fell for it.

126
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,543
GET INTO KEIMEI MIDDLE SCHOOL

127
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,653
SCHOOL SELECTION TEST (SAT)

128
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,154
MOCK EXAM

129
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,137
I see.

130
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,606
It's my fault too.
I've been busy with work

131
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,075
and I didn't have things under control.

132
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,044
You must be very busy.

133
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm a single parent. So, you know.

134
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,784
Middle school entrance exam?

135
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,989
Oh, I wasn't really thinking about it,

136
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,294
but he said he wants to go to a good
school and take care of me in the future.

137
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,732
Kids grow up so fast before you know it.

138
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,569
So Mr. Haneoka,

139
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,573
does this mean we're going to court?

140
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,742
Um, not exactly--

141
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,544
I don't want to take the exam.

142
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,380
I want to quit cram school.

143
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,284
I've had enough.

144
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,152
That's why I've been playing games.

145
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,323
Please excuse us.

146
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,528
What are you saying?

147
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,096
You're lying, right?

148
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,264
I'm not.

149
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,166
You're lying.

150
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,202
I won't approve of this.

151
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,907
Kota, what's going on?

152
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,443
Kota.

153
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,879
Kota, look at me.

154
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,184
Um, I'm really sorry about this.

155
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,098
I wonder if he really said
he wants to take the exam.

156
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,402
It seemed like
his mother was imposing her wishes on him.

157
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,736
Like a toxic parent?

158
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,837
I guess.

159
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,375
Even if she is,
it has nothing to do with this case.

160
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,045
-Is that a game?
-What?

161
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,881
No, it's part of my job.
I'm checking out Doropazu.

162
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,549
It might help me with the case.

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,152
It only seems like a waste of time.

164
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,520
That's not true.

165
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:50,891
I also think it's a waste of time to
practice furrowing your eyebrows.

166
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,326
-You saw my memo.
-Memo?

167
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,195
I'm trying to keep our firm
out of trouble.

168
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,297
-What memo?
-We lawyers have our own issues.

169
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,600
Don't think of him as the average lawyer.

170
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,068
Because I'm above average.

171
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:01,969
No!

172
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,871
I mean his concept of the norm
isn't average. Get to work.

173
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,772
Yes.

174
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,677
And he has the tendency to
exaggerate himself. Beware of that.

175
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,646
On what basis is she saying this?

176
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,549
Your social media.
Your lunch the day before yesterday.

177
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,553
It says, "I'm having a hotdog at a park
between meetings. So busy!"

178
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,856
But in fact, you were slurping noodles
right here in the office.

179
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,257
This is called hype marketing.

180
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,192
No way!

181
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,094
You're steel-headed, Ms. Tetsuko.

182
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,195
Tetsuko?

183
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,030
As in steel, harder than stone.

184
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,634
What a load of nonsense, Mr. Morio.

185
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,534
Morio?

186
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,970
Morio, as in
"<i>More</i> exaggeration than truth."

187
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,805
You're the one spewing nonsense.

188
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,906
Let's stop this.

189
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,776
Whose side are you on?
You think Tetsuko is right?

190
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,977
Or Morio?

191
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:44,945
<i>Which is it?</i>

192
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,784
Who knows at what temperature
water turns into ice?

193
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,818
Me!

194
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:52,786
Okay, Yamazaki.

195
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:53,587
It's 0℃.

196
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,891
If someone passes,
that means someone else fails.

197
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,726
Do you want to fail?

198
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:00,661
No, sir!

199
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,695
You want to pass?

200
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,496
Yes, sir!

201
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,330
You want to win?

202
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,231
Yes, sir!

203
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,766
Wow.

204
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,702
Who else knew
that the answer is one-third?

205
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,803
Me.

206
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,838
Open page 53 of your textbook.

207
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,409
Good job everyone.

208
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,443
<i>The next class is…</i>

209
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,380
<i>Don't go outside of this building.</i>

210
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,816
Come back in 15 minutes.

211
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,086
Excuse me, who are you?

212
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,890
This is it for today. Good job everyone.

213
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,291
Thank you.

214
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,560
Man, it's so tiring.

215
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,828
Oh, Kota.

216
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:35,662
Yes.

217
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,763
Go ahead.

218
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,667
Who's that?

219
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,568
A lawyer.

220
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,371
His mother asked us for help.

221
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,006
About what?

222
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,841
-No details.
-About that game.

223
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,045
If you're a lawyer, are you smart?

224
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,514
Yes, I am smart.

225
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,584
-Which university?
-I went to university abroad.

226
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,052
So cool.

227
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,555
But I dropped out
because I didn't see the point.

228
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,224
What? So, you're a high school graduate?

229
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,726
Well, yeah.

230
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,660
What about you?

231
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,929
The University of Tokyo.

232
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,731
-Really?
-Amazing!

233
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,466
-Yes.
-You're very blatant.

234
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,605
I have to go. Bye, Miss.

235
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,140
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

236
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,810
I wish I was born into
a good family like Eiichi.

237
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,547
<i>But he comes from a family of doctors,</i>
<i>so the pressure is intense.</i>

238
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,684
<i>Yeah, but he's already a winner</i>
<i>if he's that rich.</i>

239
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,619
I totally lost the parent-gacha.

240
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,657
Parent-gacha…

241
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,160
See you. Miss, goodbye.

242
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,295
So, they all refuse to greet me.

243
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,664
-To the main topic.
-Yes.

244
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,568
This is your Doropazu access log.

245
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,972
According to this,
you play twice a week on average.

246
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,141
That's only seven times a month.

247
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,545
It seems you played very little
considering you were so addicted

248
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,680
that you spent 198,700 yen.

249
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,186
Busted.

250
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,690
Actually, I'm not really into it.

251
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:16,029
But I did it to let my mom know
that I don't want to take the exam.

252
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,168
I remembered there was someone who was

253
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,404
forced by their parents to quit
cram school because of a video game.

254
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,808
So, you paid for game items on purpose?

255
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,979
That's terrible.
You've deceived a lot of people.

256
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,986
Let's tell your mother the truth.

257
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,695
Okay.
I'll tell her, but give me some time.

258
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,602
I wonder if he thought his mom won't
let him quit unless he did all that.

259
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,972
Like I said, it's not our business.

260
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,542
I wonder if any of it is
actually the children's choice.

261
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,214
When I was in sixth grade,
having fun and Kendo was all I did.

262
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,315
How innocent.

263
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,216
Really?

264
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,017
Did you think about taking exams?

265
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,819
I took the middle school entrance exam.

266
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,856
For real? So, you worked hard like Kota?

267
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,825
Nope. I didn't go to cram school
and I had no struggles.

268
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:19,459
What?

269
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,162
I have an extraordinary memory.

270
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,097
I see.

271
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:26,800
But…

272
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,870
it's not like I wanted to take it.

273
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,840
These exams are for your parents' benefit.

274
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,079
<i>Has Shoko always been smart?</i>

275
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,015
Yeah. But I divorced her mother
when she entered middle school,

276
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,417
so I don't know about after that.

277
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,419
She got into
University of Tokyo in one try.

278
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,354
Yeah.

279
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,022
She must've studied so hard.

280
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,392
My ex-wife must've worked
really hard for her.

281
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,526
Mom did, huh?

282
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,561
Don't call her mom.

283
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,829
-Why not?
-Just don't.

284
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,831
I only meant I wish I could've met her.

285
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,066
Oh, right. Anyway, you should leave.

286
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,134
I have time.

287
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,736
It's not about your schedule.

288
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,803
It's mine.

289
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,274
Anyways, the bar exam
must be very difficult, huh?

290
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,110
A smart girl like Shoko failed four times.

291
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,145
She'd pass in a few more tries, right?

292
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,484
Well, the thing is,
you can only take it five times.

293
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,987
What? So next year is her last chance?

294
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,757
Well, yeah.

295
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,060
Aren't you warming it up?

296
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,630
-Hello.
-Welcome home.

297
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,098
Hi, Shoko!

298
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,402
-Hello.
-Huh? Who are they?

299
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,771
-I've told you.
-What?

300
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,774
You didn't tell me
that they're so good-looking.

301
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,909
Why would I say all that?

302
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,312
He's Mr. Shiozaki,
the Soba restaurant owner.

303
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,646
-Hi.
-Hello.

304
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,581
Hey.

305
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,784
This is bad.

306
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,219
What is it? What's bad?

307
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,120
Thank you.

308
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,522
Thank you. Take care.

309
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,759
This is so bad.

310
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:01,895
So handsome…

311
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,334
-I'm sorry. You scared me.
-I'm sorry.

312
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,403
I'm terribly sorry. Is Mr. Haneoka here?

313
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,272
-You have a guest!
-Can we help you?

314
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,109
Oh, sorry.
I got charged for that game again.

315
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,046
TENSION INC. 254,000 YEN

316
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,482
254,000 yen.

317
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,684
The full credit limit in one day?

318
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:25,952
Yes.

319
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,220
It wasn't me.

320
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,322
I don't think it's him.

321
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,426
Since that billing, I changed the setting
so he can't play games on it anymore.

322
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,329
I've suspended my credit card,

323
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:37,831
but what should I do?

324
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,234
Um, c-can I talk to you?

325
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,268
Excuse me.

326
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,336
Sure.

327
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,205
-Here.
-Thank you.

328
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,007
It's really not your doing?

329
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:47,907
No.

330
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,309
I'm Ushio.

331
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,579
That means someone hacked the account
and bought the items.

332
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,048
Have you told your mother
about that thing?

333
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,050
Not yet.

334
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,024
It might be hard to talk about,
but are you getting bullied?

335
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,091
Not at all.

336
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,994
I see. Here.

337
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,431
Is it possible
your credit card information was leaked?

338
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,298
I doubt that.

339
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,199
The password?

340
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,734
I didn't tell anyone.

341
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:15,969
Hmm.

342
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,406
This is a completely different case
to the previous billing problem.

343
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:23,109
Unauthorized access and use of
a credit card. This is a criminal case.

344
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,980
Let's talk to the police.

345
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:32,352
Please. Regarding the retainer fee,
you can bill that to me again.

346
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,922
No need.
We can deal with it with the initial fee.

347
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,690
-Huh? But…
-No.

348
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:42,195
It's our job to be the umbrella
for those in need.

349
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,097
Right?

350
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,403
Thank you so much. You saved me!

351
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,741
Doropazu again?

352
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,176
It's my break time.

353
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,777
You play it during work too.

354
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,612
Ow…

355
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,183
How do you want to proceed
with the initial refund?

356
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,718
As long as our client
refuses to go to trial,

357
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,288
we're in a bind
if the opponent is so defiant.

358
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,756
Please don't give up.

359
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:13,159
The police is handling the 250,000 yen.
So there's nothing to do.

360
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,262
There's time
until the information is disclosed.

361
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,065
Why don't we investigate someone
who has a grudge--

362
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,034
Let the police handle it.

363
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,875
<i>Kota, look at me.</i>

364
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,072
Good work today. See you tomorrow.

365
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:03,910
JUSTY INC.

366
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,066
She's working two jobs.

367
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,547
Um. Once again,
I'm looking forward to working with you.

368
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,649
Same here.

369
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,719
I'm job hunting at the same time,
so I may cause trouble--

370
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,190
You're too polite. And a little too loud.

371
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,724
Right, I'm sorry.

372
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,792
Let's take it easy.

373
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,794
Okay. See you tomorrow.

374
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,431
Oh, by the way. Come back here a bit.

375
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,466
-Okay, too close.
-Sorry.

376
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,634
So…

377
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,071
what do you think about Ishiko?

378
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,472
Huh?

379
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,178
Um, she's a senior I respect--

380
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:12,845
You like her?

381
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,582
What?

382
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:22,255
Oh. It's not like that.

383
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,526
Well, it doesn't matter really.

384
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,762
It's just I'm dense at things like that.
So, I thought I'd ask.

385
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,631
It's very… that.

386
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,904
-Got it.
-Okay.

387
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,405
Bye.

388
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,841
Goodbye.

389
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,043
Got it.

390
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,248
KAMOGAYA

391
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,823
Kota is close friends with Eiichi Kitano.

392
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,890
Eiichi Kitano.

393
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,828
And Emiru Tanaka, I guess.

394
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:02,929
Emiru Tanaka.

395
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,731
Is there anyone else?

396
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,233
Is Kota alright?

397
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,606
<i>I heard that Kota paid a lot for</i>
<i>game items on Doropazu.</i>

398
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,978
<i>Hello? Ishida speaking.</i>

399
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,947
What do you think you're doing?

400
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:21,981
Excuse me?

401
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,184
We got a complaint about you
talking to the students.

402
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,986
I was wondering where you were.

403
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,488
CRAM SCHOOL BUILD UP

404
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:32,058
I was hoping to get a clue
to find the culprit.

405
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,026
Any possibility--

406
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,461
I'm not sure, but it's not zero.

407
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,562
How inefficient.

408
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,232
I don't want to hear it from you
who only plays games.

409
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:46,239
My impression of his mother changed.

410
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,309
<i>You said she's a toxic parent.</i>

411
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,245
I haven't reached that conclusion. But…

412
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,082
I want to help her in any way I can.

413
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,217
<i>Right.</i>

414
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:02,455
<i>Hang on. Are you the kind of person</i>
<i>who says things like that?</i>

415
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,392
I thought you were all about money.

416
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,296
<i>As long as we're getting paid--</i>

417
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,800
Anyway, just don't do anything
without my instructions.

418
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,370
You are a paralegal.

419
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,838
<i>You got it?</i>

420
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,743
Is it okay to get complaints,
according to your rules?

421
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,013
<i>Hello--</i>

DROPPING PUZZLE ACCESS LOG

423
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,858
My eyes are tired.

424
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,276
Ishiko?

425
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,811
-Oh, hi.
-Hello.

426
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,013
-See you tomorrow.
-Wait. Take this.

427
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,949
-You'll get wet.
-I'll be fine.

428
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,016
No, really.

429
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,719
Then, why don't we use it together?

430
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,723
I just remembered
I forgot something in the office.

431
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,160
Let's go together.

432
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,737
Well, if you insist.

433
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,806
Okay.

434
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,516
Are your shoulders covered?

435
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,450
Yes.

436
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,120
I heard a funny joke the other day.

437
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,489
Okay.

438
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,794
Uh, it's about maternity.

439
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:50,662
Maternity?

440
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,930
Yes.

441
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,300
Do you know what kind of tea
a pregnant person drinks?

442
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,002
A materni…

443
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,370
Oh.

444
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,007
I gave it away…

445
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:02,908
What?

446
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,909
No, I…

447
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,747
It's about pregnancy.

448
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,483
A pregnant person.

449
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,819
Could you forget I said "maternity"?

450
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,754
-I can't.
-I thought so.

451
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,591
I'm so bad at this.

452
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,894
You looked down,

453
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,831
so I was trying to make you laugh.

454
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,366
I'm sorry.

455
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,604
I appreciate it.

456
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,706
Huh?

457
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,511
Thanks to you, I feel a little better.

458
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,781
Really?

459
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,223
A pregnant woman and a tea.

460
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,090
Right.

461
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,859
-Materni-tea.
-Materni-tea, right?

462
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,560
I got it.

463
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,033

466
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,011
Hot.

00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:12,771
Morning.

470
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,806
Good morning!

471
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,843
How do you level up?

472
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,346
-Huh?
-Doropazu.

473
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,549
I started playing too.

474
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,187
Right.

475
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,656
You can defeat enemies.

476
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,226
And join events to gain experience points.

477
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,397
It's all about experience, huh?

478
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,703
You're wearing it backward.

479
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,343
Yeah. Um, this is how you wear it.

480
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,279
My bad, then.

481
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,219
Alright. Let's go meet the culprit.

482
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:02,988
What?

483
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,056
The account hacker.

00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:10,395
<i>I finally became friends</i>
<i>with Kota's character in the game.</i>

"Help me. I'm being threatened"?

490
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,050
We're supposed to meet here.

491
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,388
So you weren't just playing games.

492
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,923
Of course not. It's all going as planned.

493
00:27:49,824 --> 00:27:51,159
I'm sorry!

494
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,163
Huh? You're the hacker?

495
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,968
So, you paid for the game items. Correct?

496
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:01,503
Yes.

497
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:05,373
Didn't you feel guilty towards Kota?

498
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,908
That was Kota's account?

499
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:07,809
Huh?

500
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,178
I didn't know that.

501
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,550
Four days ago, I found a letter in my bag
on my way home from cram school.

502
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,452
Here's the pudding a la mode.

503
00:28:18,486 --> 00:28:19,821
Hang on.

504
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:21,856
Please use this.

505
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:32,267
"You cheated on the mock exam
on June 5th."

506
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,035
"If you don't want to be exposed,

507
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:37,739
log in to Dropping Puzzle
and keep paying for game items."

508
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,775
"Use the account below."

509
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:43,144
It's Kota's ID and password.

510
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:45,847
Go ahead.

511
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,182
Thank you.

512
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:52,721
Hey, was there a security check
when you paid for the items?

513
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,989
Nothing after I logged in.

514
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:57,425
So, the credit card info was
tied to the account.

515
00:28:57,492 --> 00:29:01,563
You followed the instructions
without knowing the circumstances, right?

516
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:02,464
Yes.

517
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,765
So, you did do it.

518
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:05,700
The cheating.

519
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,771
I failed the elementary school
entrance exam, so this is it.

520
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:10,538
I'm sorry!

521
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:12,173
You scared me. It's alright.

522
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,677
Do you have any idea
who sent you this letter?

523
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:16,578
No.

524
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:17,846
Will I be exposed?

525
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:20,582
Don't worry.
Let's forget about the cheating for now.

526
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:23,284
Take your spoon and eat the pudding.

527
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,453
The mock exam seating
based on his statement.

528
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,389
It was for all classes
and there were about 40 students.

529
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,359
The examiner was Mr. Kondo
and Ms. Fukase, the clerk.

530
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,862
And Eiichi's seat is right at the front.

531
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,697
It's hard to narrow down the culprit.

532
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:37,432
-I'm back.
-Good work.

533
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:38,566
-Hi.
-Hello.

534
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,369
This is the client's call log.

535
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:43,304
-Thank you.
-Finally.

536
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:46,074
Well, it's no longer about refunds now.

537
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,175
Oh, yeah.

538
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:49,644
<i>Ichigo</i> pants.

539
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:51,279
-What?
-Huh?

540
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:55,583
<i>Ichigo</i> Pants. As in strawberry pants.

541
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,218
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

542
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,287
I can hear you. What about it?

543
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:01,389
That's the password for Kota's phone.

544
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:04,325
1582.

545
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:08,062
It's wordplay
of the year of the Honno-ji Incident.

546
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:10,832
He said Emiru knows this password.

547
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,001
Yes, I know.

548
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:17,305
Kota felt sorry for you because
your parents banned you from playing games

549
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:20,141
and he let you play
on his phone once after class.

550
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,677
That's when
he told you the password. Correct?

551
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:23,678
Yes.

552
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,850
This password, Ichigo Pants or 1582,
have you told it to anyone?

553
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,585
No, I never did.

554
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,188
I see.

555
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,056
Oh, but…

556
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:41,229
Huh?

557
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,234
This call log.

558
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,573
<i>It's different</i>
<i>from the call history I saw.</i>

559
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,807
It wasn't on his phone.

560
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:53,708
What?

561
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:58,213
That means someone
intentionally deleted this call log.

562
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,180
Yeah, most likely.

563
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:01,549
You really do have an amazing memory.

564
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:04,018
Here.

565
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,187
That number is for…

566
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,228
This is Oba.

567
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:14,963
I need to check something.

568
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:18,032
"Free phone consultation."

569
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:20,735
Thank you.

570
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,004
Sorry to keep you waiting.

571
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,852
We called you here to help us
catch the culprit who stole Kota's wallet.

572
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,656
The real culprit will show up soon.

573
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:46,361
I told the culprit I won't expose
the crime if he or she confesses here.

574
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:50,398
Will we be able to help?

575
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,902
Sure. We just need you
to testify about what you saw.

576
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,170
-Okay.
-Yes.

577
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:57,972
I'm nervous.

578
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,773
Yeah.

579
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,408
Please take one.

580
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:10,985
Those are bad choices.

581
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,955
Why such random selections?

582
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:18,026
Because people have different tastes.

583
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:19,994
The point was to get them to relax.

584
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:22,030
It's hard to choose
when there's only one of each.

585
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,064
What was better--

586
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:24,699
Like normal tea and water.

587
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:27,835
I researched children's favorite drinks
and there they are.

588
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,537
Tea or water was not listed.

589
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:31,339
But look, no one is drinking it.

590
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:33,775
-We'll take one.
-Yes.

591
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,476
-Thank you.
-I want this.

592
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:37,045
Everyone, sit over here.

593
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:38,513
Yes, sir.

594
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,783
I'll take something refreshing.

595
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,484
We got it!

596
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,853
I'll be taking this.

597
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,988
-Excuse me.
-What?

598
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:51,726
I said we gathered you here because
we needed your help catching the culprit

599
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:55,096
who stole Kota's wallet
on the day of the mock exam, right?

600
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:58,299
Such an incident did not happen.

601
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:01,469
What we really wanted to expose

602
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:05,540
is the person who caused the 250,000-yen
damage to Kota and his mother.

603
00:33:05,606 --> 00:33:06,541
And that is…

604
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,042
you.

605
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:11,946
What are you talking about?

606
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:15,149
Man, I got worried
because you wouldn't touch the drinks.

607
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:17,185
It's your mistake to begin with.

608
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,153
We were supposed to hand them out.

609
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,055
-Hey, can we forget--
-What is this?

610
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,792
Emiru said…

611
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:27,495
When she was unlocking Kota's smartphone,

612
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:30,198
she may have said "Ichigo Pants" out loud.

613
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:32,533
-That's Kota's.
-I got his permission.

614
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,936
1582, Ichigo Pants.

615
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:35,870
So…

616
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:37,271
…she may have overheard…

617
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:38,272
…Kota's password…

618
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:39,507
…in the office.

619
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:40,742
If you know the password…

620
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,910
…you can unlock the phone
that are kept during class.

621
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,446
<i>All that's left is to start the game.</i>

622
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,050
<i>Doropazu's ID and password</i>
<i>can be displayed.</i>

623
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:51,853
<i>So, there's a possibility you used that to</i>

624
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,789
blackmail Eiichi.

625
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:57,191
Assuming with just "a possibility" is--

626
00:33:57,258 --> 00:34:00,528
Since the possibility isn't zero,
I did a little digging.

627
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:04,766
You have caused a similar incident at
the cram school you previously worked at.

628
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,903
These are the notes from the interview.

629
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,707
<i>When you were caught, you said</i>
<i>you were raised by poorly educated parents</i>

630
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:15,343
<i>and they wanted you to work</i>
<i>after high school.</i>

631
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:19,380
<i>Had you gone to a good university,</i>
<i>you would've had a good life.</i>

632
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:24,018
That's why you wanted to drag down
the kids who are taking entrance exams.

633
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:27,488
You never apologized for it.

634
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,694
Ms. Fukase?

635
00:34:34,262 --> 00:34:37,298
You felt the same way again
and committed the crime, right?

636
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:38,633
No.

637
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:42,170
I wouldn't do such a thing.

638
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:44,539
Ms. Fukase, let's talk about this.

639
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:46,274
Then, why are you running?

640
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,809
The police are on this case.

641
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,412
The blackmail letter has fingerpri--

642
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,780
Don't touch me!

643
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:55,850
Why do I have to be arrested?

644
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:58,753
Why did you go after Kota?

645
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:02,523
<i>He was whining that</i>
<i>he wants to quit cram school but he can't.</i>

646
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,892
<i>So, I thought I'd make it happen.</i>

647
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,260
You're out of your mind.

648
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:10,465
Everyone here is a winner
who won the parent-gacha, right?

649
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,936
All my parents ever told me
was to give up.

650
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:18,639
How pathetic.

651
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:23,611
Don't drag others down just because
you're unhappy with your life.

652
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:24,846
-Are you stupid?
-L.E.!

653
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,247
The world is unfair.

654
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:29,417
Fine, that's enough.
I'm calling the police.

655
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:35,056
Hello. I'm Haneoka from Ushio Law Firm.

656
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:42,396
I only said it to let everyone here know

657
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:45,566
how blessed you all are.

658
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:48,870
There's no denying

659
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:54,142
that everyone's life is different
from the moment we're born.

660
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:58,813
With an actual gacha capsule toy,

661
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,916
you have the right to exchange your item
if it's defective.

662
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:07,021
But for a parent-gacha,
there's no law that allows an exchange

663
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:09,023
even if you think they're defective.

664
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:15,897
However, I don't think we should just
accept the environment we're born into.

665
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:20,701
Because horrible parents do exist.

666
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,504
If that's the case,

667
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,674
I want you to speak up.

668
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:30,344
But…

669
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,583
<i>I think most parents are</i>
<i>doing their best to be a parent.</i>

670
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,651
Aloha.

671
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:42,056
<i>Kota,</i>
<i>today's lunch is minced meat on rice.</i>

672
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,226
<i>I wonder how much you can eat.</i>

673
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:46,794
<i>This much?</i>

674
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:49,463
-Let's eat.
<i>-I'll put it in the fridge, okay?</i>

675
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:52,633
<i>I know you don't like eggplants, but look.</i>

676
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,803
<i>I chopped it up so finely,</i>
<i>so I don't think you'll notice it.</i>

677
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,871
I noticed it!

678
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:58,406
<i>You can't taste the eggplant.</i>

679
00:36:58,472 --> 00:36:59,640
I can!

680
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:03,077
<i>There's miso soup too.</i>

681
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:09,951
<i>Most children are also</i>

682
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:13,754
trying their best as children
to make their parents proud.

683
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:17,892
Saying you won or lost…

684
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:21,195
about such parent and child relationship…

685
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:25,666
What's the point?

686
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:34,642
That's all.

687
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:40,881
Hey, no. Don't run!

688
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:42,583
Your sins are grave.

689
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,020
Article 223 Clause 1 of the Penal Code,
extortion against Eiichi is

690
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,822
up to three years of imprisonment.

691
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:50,691
Unauthorized login to Kota's account
is also a violation.

692
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,661
Up to three years in prison
or a fine of up to one million yen.

693
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:57,765
Additionally, the unauthorized use of
a credit card is a computer fraud.

694
00:37:57,832 --> 00:38:01,102
You could be imprisoned
for up to 10 years.

695
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:03,671
Considering the motive
and the amount of money,

696
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:06,907
it's quite possible
you'll be facing a prison sentence.

697
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:18,319
That leaves the 198,700 yen refund.

698
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:20,321
The refund, huh?

699
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:22,523
I'm out of ideas.

700
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,560
How about this?

701
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,197
I saw this on
the Doropazu walkthrough website.

702
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:36,037
This game's specifications changed
drastically 32 days ago, didn't it?

703
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:38,839
This is the current
age verification screen.

704
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,107
As you said,

705
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:44,945
it asks, "Are you 18 years or older?"
and the user answers with a yes or no.

706
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,917
On the other hand, this is the age
verification screen before the change.

707
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:52,320
This was being used until a while ago.

708
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:55,222
The age verification is listed
within other statements

709
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:00,728
and the user answers whether
they agree to the terms of use as a whole.

710
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:03,564
This is intended for use by minors,

711
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:07,768
but the age verification is listed
in this tiny space while scrolling down

712
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:08,936
and it's hard to read.

713
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:11,605
And the problem is…

714
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:13,140
Here's the problem.

715
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:16,644
Kota Aida paid for game items 56 days ago.

716
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:17,678
Meaning…

717
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:21,115
it was during
the use of this specification.

718
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:26,754
We believe that, in this regard,
Doropazu may also be at fault

719
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:29,457
and will assert
the minor's right to rescind.

720
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:33,027
Of course,
we're considering going to court.

721
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:40,534
We have good news for you today.

722
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:43,070
-The refund--
-Mr. Haneoka.

723
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:44,538
Yes?

724
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:45,639
He told me earlier

725
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:49,009
that he paid for game items on purpose.

726
00:39:49,577 --> 00:39:52,213
I know
I've put you through so much already.

727
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,117
But we no longer want a refund.

728
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:59,019
What? Are you sure?

729
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:01,288
It's a fair rule.

730
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,825
Society's rules may be so.

731
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:08,696
But I'd like to follow our family's rules.

732
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:14,969
I want Kota to take responsibility.

733
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:20,441
So, he'll be paying me back half of
the cost from his monthly allowance.

734
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:22,410
The other half

735
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:25,346
will be my punishment.

736
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,549
He won't be taking the exam either.

737
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:30,151
Right?

738
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,194
Can I ask you a question?

739
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:43,431
In your call log,

740
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:48,536
there's a record of you calling
a legal consultation service.

741
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:49,437
<i>Huh?</i>

742
00:40:50,304 --> 00:40:53,541
But that call log was deleted
from your phone.

743
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:55,342
Why did you do that?

744
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:58,579
What? You did that?

745
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:03,150
You found that out too, huh?

746
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:09,457
When I was searching for
a way to quit cram school online,

747
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:11,892
I found a case

748
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:16,397
where a student
who paid for game items got a refund.

749
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:20,301
I called a lawyer to ask about it.

750
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:25,206
And I was told we'd usually get a refund.
That's why I did it.

751
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:30,511
But I didn't want anyone to find that out.
So I deleted it.

752
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,414
What do you mean?

753
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:38,752
If we find out that
he was calm enough to consult a lawyer,

754
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,657
his scenario, paying for game items
due to exam stress, would fall apart.

755
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:49,330
It was a grand scenario in his own way.

756
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,767
To figure out how quit the cram school
without troubling his mother.

757
00:41:57,204 --> 00:42:00,908
But actually, you still want to
take the entrance exams, don't you?

758
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:18,025
Mom, you've been working
so hard for me every day.

759
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:22,196
<i>I said I want to take the entrance exam</i>
<i>to make your life easier.</i>

760
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:25,599
<i>But I had second thoughts</i>
<i>because it's wearing you out.</i>

761
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:31,639
<i>But if I told you that, you'd say,</i>
<i>"Don't worry about me," right?</i>

762
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:34,742
So, I decided to go with exam stress.

763
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:46,520
And yet, we couldn't get a refund.

764
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:48,589
I caused you trouble.

765
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,991
-Sorry.
-Silly boy!

766
00:42:56,196 --> 00:42:58,399
You said you want to quit out of the blue.

767
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:00,768
I knew something was wrong.

768
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,037
If you want to do it,

769
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:05,673
you can do it.

770
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:09,543
Yeah.

771
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,448
I hope I'm not being intrusive, but

772
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:17,618
this is a list of benefits available
for single mothers.

773
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:22,156
My mother was the same.

774
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:26,894
She worked hard to support me because
she didn't want me to give up anything

775
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:30,564
for the reason that she's a single parent.

776
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:38,405
It still makes me feel regretful to think
that I could've made her life easier

777
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:41,208
had I known these rules back then.

778
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:50,451
Thank you very much for everything.

779
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:54,421
<i>The number of consultations</i>
<i>about children paying for</i>

780
00:43:54,488 --> 00:43:58,125
<i>game items on smartphones and video games</i>
<i>without parental consent</i>

781
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,994
<i>has been increasing…</i>

782
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:05,499
INCREASING TROUBLE OF CHILDREN
BILLING WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT

783
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:10,671
Alright.

784
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:13,540
How's my resume?

785
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:14,875
Yeah…

786
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:15,843
Oh, here.

787
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:18,379
Could you read the self-introduction part?

788
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:19,546
Sure.

789
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,150
"I was subjected to
power harassment in my previous workplace

790
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:25,085
and I'm still fighting this case."

791
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:28,522
I think you can leave those things out.

792
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:31,792
It's great to be honest,
but don't you think

793
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,694
it makes it harder to hire you?

794
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,896
-Great advice!
-Good luck.

795
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:36,797
Thank you.

796
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,134
What? Another complaint?

797
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,736
Adding gesture
does make you look genius-ish.

798
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:46,740
I'll accept that.

799
00:44:47,474 --> 00:44:49,977
It probably won't cause any trouble

800
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:54,415
and I've learned that
you have your own way of doing things.

801
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:55,883
Oh, really?

802
00:44:55,949 --> 00:44:57,451
So, like this.

803
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,720
-My pose?
-Yes.

804
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:03,490
Like this? Hmm.

805
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:05,459
Yes.

806
00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:08,495
Don't I look like Piccolo
doing the Special Beam Cannon?

807
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:09,930
You do.

808
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:11,699
That's no good then.

809
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:15,202
Isn't there something more original?

810
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:17,638
-Something else?
-More creative.

811
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:20,040
And also cool.

812
00:45:20,107 --> 00:45:21,709
Delicate touch of the finger.

813
00:45:21,775 --> 00:45:23,377
The hand should be here.

814
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:24,912
Like I'm deep in thought.

815
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:26,914
-Let me see.
-Yes, that's it.

816
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:29,783
What's wrong with fast movies?

817
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,318
I'll make him feel remorse.

818
00:45:31,385 --> 00:45:34,455
I spent ten years on it
and this is it, huh?

819
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:35,923
I should just give up?

820
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,891
You're a genius.

821
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:41,929
<i>He may not get a suspended sentence</i>
<i>unless he changes that attitude.</i>

822
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:42,896
