1
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,648
Right, let's download it!

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,695
Okay, you're under arrest.

3
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,899
NO MORE PIRATING MOVIES

4
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:39,740
<i>Coming.</i>

5
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,410
Can I help you?

6
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,978
-Are you Ryohei Yamada?
-Yes.

7
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,780
Your arrest warrant.

8
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,348
What?

9
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,556
-We're back now.
-We're back.

10
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:56,524
Welcome home.

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,758
Going out?

12
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,860
-Yeah. For an interview.
-What?

13
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,662
JLSC requested a court-appointed lawyer.

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,930
They did, huh?

15
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,598
<i>Court-appointed lawyer?</i>

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,567
If a suspect or a defendant--

17
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,670
…can't afford a lawyer
because they have no assets,

18
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,505
the country appoints one for them.

19
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:16,877
The appointed lawyer or defendant
can't refuse unless there's a good reason.

20
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:17,678
I see.

21
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,180
On top of that,

22
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,081
it's cheap!

23
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,051
If we do all we can for the case,
we may end up in the red.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,822
What's the case?

25
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,623
Defending a man who pirated a movie.

26
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,558
What?

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,462
His arrest is getting attention online.
It's a chance to sell myself.

28
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,763
Oh.

29
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,198
Don't!

30
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,001
If you focus on your publicity,
it could cause problems.

31
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,103
Here we go.

32
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,105
-Make sure to--
-Understood!

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,906
I'll be off.

34
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,341
-See you later.
-See you.

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,348
Huh? You're not going?

36
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,050
No, I'm not.

37
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:02,423
Unfortunately, paralegals are considered
unqualified in the Japanese legal world.

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,558
So they can't attend interviews.

39
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,528
Even in the courtroom, they can
only sit in the spectators' seats.

40
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,235
But Haneo seemed motivated, so he'll be--

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,003
That's why I'm worried.

42
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,340
He may do something
to cause trouble for the firm.

43
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,010
WEAR GLASSES.
I MAY LOOK MORE LIKE A GENIUS.

44
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,150
YAHOGAWA POLICE STATION

45
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,584
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

46
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,422
I'm Haneoka, your defense counsel.

47
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,790
Hello.

48
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,993
I'm sure you have a lot of concerns,

49
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,495
but let's build
a trusting relationship. Okay?

50
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,696
-Okay.
-Good.

51
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,432
Alright, let me confirm.

52
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,640
<i>Mr. Ryohei Yamada. You are</i>
<i>a 23-year-old, aspiring film director.</i>

53
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,010
<i>You made independent movies</i>
<i>in a college film club and</i>

54
00:02:56,076 --> 00:03:00,381
<i>uploaded them to "Yamada-chan Channel,"</i>
<i>your own video-sharing website.</i>

55
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,515
Yes.

56
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,487
<i>One day, you were watching a movie</i>
<i>for studying purposes.</i>

57
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,790
<i>Since it was good,</i>
<i>you wanted to share with the staff.</i>

58
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,661
<i>You downloaded and edited the movie</i>
<i>into a ten-minute clip and uploaded it</i>

59
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,363
<i>to "Yamada-chan Channel"</i>
<i>for members-only access.</i>

60
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:17,898
Right.

61
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:23,003
<i>You've uploaded movie summary videos</i>
<i>to "Yamada-chan Channel" since then.</i>

62
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,938
<i>But five months ago,</i>

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,942
<i>you mistakenly uploaded one to the public</i>
<i>and not to limited users.</i>

64
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:32,279
<i>To your surprise,</i>
<i>it reached 10,000 views overnight</i>

65
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,982
<i>and it went up to</i>
<i>200,000 views in a few days.</i>

66
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,984
<i>The response was incomparable</i>

67
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,987
<i>to the independent movies</i>
<i>you've released in the past.</i>

68
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,190
<i>You received grateful comments,</i>
<i>such as "This is what I needed,"</i>

69
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,526
<i>and</i>
<i>"It's great when I don't have much time."</i>

70
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,162
<i>The number of your channel subscribers</i>
<i>also shot up.</i>

71
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,063
<i>Yup.</i>

72
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,501
So, you started posting summary videos of
movies that have already been released,

73
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,171
which are also known as "fast movies"--

74
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,440
Then the police suddenly showed up
and I was shocked.

75
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,009
Right.

76
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,580
And you uploaded 27 videos in total.
Correct?

77
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,115
I guess.

78
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,650
Okay.

79
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:14,288
And Zipangu Pictures, a film company
that produced nine of those movies

80
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,957
<i>have sued you for</i>
<i>violation of the Copyright Act.</i>

81
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,325
Seems like it.

82
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,232
Well, yes. Um…

83
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,236
Your account has been suspended
and you've been arrested too.

84
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,738
I'm sure you're regretting--

85
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:31,472
What? Why?

86
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:32,740
Huh?

87
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,041
Regret what?

88
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,644
Excuse me?

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,479
I'm just annoyed.

90
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,748
What's wrong with fast movies?

91
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,351
As I said, the copyright--

92
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:48,222
My videos aren't monetized.
It's not about making money.

93
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,290
So it's fine, no?

94
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,659
Times have changed.

95
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,795
No one will watch paid content
if they don't know the plot.

96
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,997
Also, fewer people go to the cinema today.

97
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:02,369
But the people who saw my videos said
they've come to like movies.

98
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,804
So, what's the problem?

99
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,979
What's wrong with him?

100
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,314
Zero! Seriously!

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,282
-Zero remorse.
-Keep your voice down.

102
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,685
I hate dealing with guys like that.

103
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,786
Lawyer Ethics!

104
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,889
-So, it's him.
-Huh?

105
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,326
I was annoyed because he also uploaded
my favorite director's movies.

106
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,027
What's his name?

107
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,529
Kyohei Yamada.

108
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,897
Isn't that the suspect?

109
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,732
That's Ryohei Yamada.

110
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,936
Kyohei is a late-blooming director,
who's almost 70 years old.

111
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,206
But he recently won an international award
and is gaining popularity.

112
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,307
I see.

113
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,942
The suspect is his fan too.

114
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:47,548
He watched his movies because their names
are alike and wants to be a director too.

115
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,050
Even more unforgivable if he's a fan.

116
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,020
I want to settle this out of court
for a dismissal, but…

117
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,423
That would be difficult.

118
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,359
Thanks for waiting.

119
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,327
Here you go.

120
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,564
Kakesoba for Shoko.

121
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,565
Thank you.

122
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,066
Kamo Nanban for you.

123
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,301
Here's your Zaru.

124
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,869
This is on the house.

125
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:09,703
Really?

126
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,238
-Thank you.
-No!

127
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,639
You scared me.

128
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,541
It's for Shoko.

129
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,410
Sorry?

130
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,979
Look at where the plate is.
It's not for you guys.

131
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,582
Thank you very much.

132
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,017
A-All of them?

133
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,352
Yup, all for her.

134
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,689
Let's eat.

135
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,459
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

136
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,035
Oh, wait.

137
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,175
Did you just blow on it?

138
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:50,978
Of course not.

139
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,112
I saw you do it.

140
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:52,946
I didn't.

141
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,348
Your face said it all.

142
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,549
-I didn't.
-You did.

143
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,450
Who did?

144
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,684
You did.

145
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,419
I blew on it?

146
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,087
-Yes.
-I didn't.

147
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:04,491
<i>We were hoping Zipangu Pictures</i>
<i>would agree to a settlement.</i>

148
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:09,329
In the first place, the suspect
didn't receive any profit from this.

149
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,532
This is not about money.

150
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,237
The reason for this lawsuit
is to have a judicial decision against

151
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:21,341
the criminal act of fast movies
and for the public to recognize that.

152
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,544
There will be no settlement.

153
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,748
Turned out exactly the way we expected.

154
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:28,816
Indeed.

155
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,021
WASEDA

156
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,463
INDICTMENT

157
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,398
Now that he's been indicted,

158
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,734
all we can do is to
try and get a suspended sentence.

159
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:52,573
For that to happen,
the defendant must express his remorse.

160
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,609
For my sake too.

161
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,884
My social media is blowing up
with people telling me not to defend him.

162
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,752
<i>-Don't defend him.</i>
<i>-How much are you getting paid?</i>

163
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,287
<i>-Quit your job.</i>
<i>-Just as guilty!</i>

164
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,355
<i>He looks stupid.</i>

165
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,390
Why did it turn out this way?

166
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,692
-Ouch.
-Here.

167
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,726
Oh, thanks.

168
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,829
I'll make him feel remorse
to calm this down.

169
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:16,964
But will he feel remorse?

170
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,798
I doubt it.

171
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,699
What?

172
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,901
It doesn't matter if he really is sorry.

173
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,737
What's important
is for him to say he's sorry in court.

174
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,340
Is that good enough?

175
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,842
If it's not genuine remorse,
his future will--

176
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,411
Do I have to get involved that far?

177
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,482
Didn't she complain that being a court
appointed lawyer will put us in the red?

178
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,050
-Yes.
-Well, it would be a problem.

179
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,720
Right? Now, now.

180
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,356
Just watch how I do it.

181
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,791
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM

182
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:50,964
And for that reason,
it's important for you to show remorse.

183
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,633
Okay.

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,503
Here's a list of potential arguments.
Could you memorize the answers?

185
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,740
You went too far
due to your love of movies.

186
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,908
That's our plan.

187
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:02,743
Okay.

188
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,547
Let's read this once, shall we? Together.

189
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:11,184
So, if they ask
"Are there any errors in the indictment?"

190
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,252
You say…

191
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,256
"No, I did it."

192
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:20,327
There are no errors in the indictment.

193
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,097
I know that my actions have
hurt a lot of people

194
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,734
and caused a lot of trouble.

195
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:34,841
My actions were thoughtless
and I am deeply regre…

196
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,253
But actually, what's the problem?

197
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,455
I really don't get it.

198
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,356
Mr. Yamada.

199
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,358
It's the same as trailers.

200
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,294
Even if it's made by someone
who doesn't own the rights,

201
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,096
it ends up promoting the movie.

202
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:01,101
And introducing classic movies contributes
to the film industry in general.

203
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,436
It's all good.

204
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,621
Come on. Sit here.

205
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,257
Let me ask you this.

206
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,361
Is this how you do it?

207
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,930
How did you advise him exactly?

208
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,466
It was a devil.

209
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,167
What?

210
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,302
His T-shirt.

211
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,771
<i>It was a horrifying devil.</i>

212
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,442
That'll give
a bad impression to the judges.

213
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,410
Why that shirt?!

214
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,245
I told him that too!

215
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,147
I said, "Let's not wear that, okay?"

216
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,517
"A white shirt
and a jacket would be nice."

217
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,754
But apparently, it's his favorite
because of some movie.

218
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,524
Since it's not just one or two
copyright infringement lawsuits,

219
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,826
the defendant may not get
a suspended sentence

220
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,229
unless he changes that attitude.

221
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:07,200
If that happens, it will damage the lawyer
and the firm in charge.

222
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,201
Damn!

223
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,871
Yoshio.

224
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,507
Oh.

225
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:15,976
It's been a while.

226
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,244
You have a trial?

227
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,545
Well, yeah.

228
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,848
Good timing.
Keep the 18th of next week open.

229
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,585
Dad's birthday dinner. The judgment date
was postponed, so he can come.

230
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,355
Okay.

231
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,791
Is she from your office?

232
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,093
Yeah, she's the paralegal--

233
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,162
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

234
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,798
Thank you for taking care of him.
I'm his sister.

235
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,168
-Yuno Haneoka.
-Thank you.

236
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,604
I'm Shoko Ishida from Ushio Law Firm.

237
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,906
Thank you.

238
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,709
Mr. Haneoka has been a great help to us.

239
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,545
What? Are you sure?

240
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,515
Then I guess you're keeping things
hidden pretty well, huh?

241
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,250
What do you mean?

242
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,753
Please continue to look out for him.

243
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,021
Sure, it's my pleasure.

244
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,923
-It was nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

245
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,693
Nice glasses.

246
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,863
See you.

247
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,871
So, your sister is a prosecutor.

248
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,473
Yeah.

249
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:25,078
I overheard that
your father is also in the legal world?

250
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,081
He's a judge.

251
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh.

252
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,953
It's not like I wanted to take it.

253
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,756
These exams are for your parents' benefit.

254
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,661
<i>Smells good.</i>

255
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,666
We're home.

256
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,502
-Welcome back!
-Nice work.

257
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,469
Wow.

258
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,971
We're eating together today.

259
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:52,906
Waterless tomato curry.

260
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,141
Ooh.

261
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,510
With Brazilian enzymes.

262
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,577
Oof…

263
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,516
What experiment is this?

264
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,986
It's not an experiment.
I'm just growing pea sprouts.

265
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,120
What?

266
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,657
You can eat them again
if you grow them carefully.

267
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,159
Maximum three times, though.

268
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,394
How stingy.

269
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,830
Fine.

270
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,933
You won't be eating
our pea sprouts anymore then.

271
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,669
Please remember that.

272
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,603
Okay.

273
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,139
That's fine with me.

274
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,241
Oh yeah, you two.

275
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,477
He turned defiant in court, right?

276
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,512
After watching that news,

277
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:38,251
people who mistook Ryohei Yamada for
Kyohei Yamada are criticizing him.

278
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,621
Look at the official Twitter page
of his new movie.

279
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,224
"Someone like him is making movies?"

280
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,460
"Cancel the screening!"
It's flooded with horrible comments.

281
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,297
Reality is brutal.

282
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,499
There are too many idiots.

283
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,607
This is the worst possible timing.
We're the movie premieres tomorrow.

284
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,844
The reputational damage will be grave.

285
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,747
Why didn't you sue him for defamation
in the first place?

286
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,418
Aren't you angry about
how he edited your work?

287
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,288
Of course he is.

288
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,292
But we're a small production company.
What can we do?

289
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,597
TAINTED TOWING

290
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,333
I just want to focus on
this movie right now.

291
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,303
-Yup. Right there.
-Yeah?

292
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:32,939
It premieres tomorrow.

293
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,741
His new movie.

294
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,476
Right.

295
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,410
That's good.

296
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,411
Oh, nice.

297
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,013
There's a showing near here.

298
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,282
Okay.

299
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,019
There's a late-night show too.

300
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,323
Oh.

301
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,126
Is this an invitation?

302
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,527
Oh… Yes.

303
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,364
If you're interested, that is.

304
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,034
I'm a member at the cinema,
so I can get two tickets for one.

305
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,335
Then I'm in!

306
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,638
Really?

307
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,307
I'm also interested in
Director Yamada now.

308
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,209
Exciting, isn't it?

309
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,711
Yes.

310
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,682
<i>Please do something.</i>

311
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,185
I want to get released
and watch Director Kyohei's new movie.

312
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,891
That director is getting flamed right now.

313
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,027
Did he make a faux pas?

314
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:27,994
No.

315
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:32,332
People think <i>he</i> uploaded the fast movies
because your names are similar

316
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
and are criticizing him.

317
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,835
As if!

318
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,504
I'm telling you the truth!

319
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,106
You're lying to make me feel sorry,
aren't you?

320
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,009
Fast movies were appreciated.

321
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,978
No one would criticize them.

322
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:49,950
I give up.

323
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,621
I won't come here anymore.

324
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,857
You can just stay remorseless
until the verdict.

325
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,759
Going to jail may be a good experience.

326
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,861
Huh? Can a lawyer act like this?

327
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,597
I'm only following your wishes.

328
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,836
We should both give up to the fact that
we met under unrefusable circumstances.

329
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,071
Hey!

330
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,206
I'll see you in court then.

331
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,982
<i>Am I not good enough?</i>

332
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:42,335
It was pretty empty
even though there was a stage greeting.

333
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,270
Yeah.

334
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,976
So, what do you want to do now?

335
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,513
I don't have any plans after this.

336
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,781
That man.

337
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:57,817
Over there.

338
00:16:59,052 --> 00:16:59,886
Oh!

339
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:00,787
Right?

340
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,991
What a terrible first day.

341
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,865
Those slanders
may have given it a bad image.

342
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,735
I'm sorry to disturb you.

343
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,206
Your movie was great.
Two hours went by so fast.

344
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,275
Thank you.

345
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,844
Can I get your autograph?

346
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,179
Thank you very much.

347
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,820
I know people are saying things on
Twitter and stuff,

348
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,789
but please don't mind it.

349
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,559
We fans are always here for you.

350
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,331
I think this is a chance for me

351
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,069
to reflect on myself.

352
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,974
I value futility and vagueness.

353
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,878
And those are the kind of movies I make.

354
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,048
The complete opposite of fast movies.

355
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:07,420
But if that's not what society wants,

356
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,523
I'll just be weeded out.

357
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,093
Your movies won't be weeded out.

358
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:13,993
Hey.

359
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,229
Excuse me.

360
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,768
To think that
he's dealing with it so calmly

361
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,170
makes this even sadder, doesn't it?

362
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,208
I've become his fan
including his personality.

363
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,909
Right?

364
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,344
Director Yamada is awesome.

365
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,021
Do you wanna go to dinner?

366
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,490
Sorry, I'm going home today.

367
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,791
Oh, okay.

368
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,160
I want to watch his other movies.

369
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:52,165
I have all his movies,
so I'll lend them to you.

370
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,066
Are you sure?

371
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,067
Yes.

372
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,836
I'll get them and
bring them to your house.

373
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,039
No, wait. Mr. Oba.
That's too much trouble for you.

374
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,508
So, um…

375
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,377
Can I go to your place with you?

376
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:05,912
What?

377
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,218
Well, but…

378
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,989
My room is a mess.

379
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,024
I won't be entering your room.

380
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,059
Oh, right.

381
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,729
Of course.

382
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,175
Is your room that messy?

383
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,210
No, just untidy.

384
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,811
-Like you can't see the floor?
-You can.

385
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,079
Food on the floor?

386
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,082
I'm not a hoarder. Just normal untidiness.

387
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,751
A FEW DAYS LATER

388
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,822
<i>Hello everyone. Let me introduce</i>
<i>Kyohei Yamada's latest movie,</i>

389
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,891
Tainted Towing<i> today.</i>

390
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,826
What is this?

391
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,296
This is his latest movie.

392
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:01,367
Someone uploaded a ten-minute
summary video of <i>Tainted Towing</i>.

393
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,838
Oh dear. Maybe they copied Ryohei Yamada.

394
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,341
Who would do this?

395
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:12,679
The original video was
reported immediately and has been deleted.

396
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,815
But the copied video is
already all over the internet.

397
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,385
"No need to watch the movie now."
"A publicity stunt."

398
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,854
"Maybe the director did this himself."

399
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,323
Saying what they like.

400
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,325
Damn it.

401
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:32,532
<i>Shoichi had feelings for Sonoko.</i>
<i>But Sonoko had a fiancé called Minoru.</i>

402
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,336
<i>One day, Shoichi noticed a bruise</i>
<i>on Shoko's arm.</i>

403
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:42,842
SHOKO WAS LIVING IN FEAR BECAUSE SHE WAS
A VICTIM OF MINORU'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

404
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,982
SEEING HOW WORN OUT SHE IS BY MINORU'S
VIOLENCE, SHOICHI RUSHES OVER TO SHOKO.

405
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,819
<i>Shoichi, who realized something,</i>
<i>took her to a shrine</i>

406
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,788
<i>and tried to convince her</i>
<i>to elope with him.</i>

407
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,559
<i>Minoru finds them and comes after them.</i>

408
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,527
Why did this happen?

409
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,764
<i>Sonoko runs, but trips and falls.</i>

410
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,334
The movie might get canceled.

411
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,139
I spent ten years on it

412
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,009
and this is it, huh?

413
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,445
Let's find out who did this.

414
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,948
To clear the director's name.

415
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,083
Just leave it.

416
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,786
There's no need if there's no request.

417
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,354
We can't take the case anyway.

418
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,722
What?

419
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:35,061
Director Kyohei Yamada is also the victim
of the case Mr. Haneoka is defending.

420
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,297
<i>When the same firm</i>

421
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:41,367
<i>take on cases from conflicting parties,</i>
<i>it's called "conflict of interest"</i>

422
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,469
and it's prohibited by the law.

423
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,907
So, we should just give up?

424
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,042
That's right.

425
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:54,180
Even if we don't, it's not like Ryohei
Yamada will get a suspended sentence.

426
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,631
Shoko.

427
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,234
I'm going out for a drink
with Mr. Matsuda.

428
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,836
Sure, have fun.

429
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,248
If you're wondering
what you can do for the director,

430
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,153
why don't you refer him to a lawyer
at another firm?

431
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,223
I thought that too.

432
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,993
But we won't get a penny.

433
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,596
That would be the same as
what you're doing.

434
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,700
But then,
we can't charge him for it either.

435
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,070
Why not look at the bigger picture?

436
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,975
Referring him
will improve our firm's reputation.

437
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,645
Then, maybe we'll get more requests
and make more profit.

438
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,682
But there's no guarantee of that.

439
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,851
Well, yeah.

440
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,655
But the defendant is a fan of
Director Yamada, right?

441
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,556
Yes.

442
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:15,395
If we can help the director,
he might hear out our defense strategy.

443
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:22,502
You're right.

444
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,773
That would benefit the firm
and it's not against my rules.

445
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,809
Thank you very much.

446
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,312
-Looks good.
-Yes, it does.

447
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,580
Let's eat.

448
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,048
Let's eat.

449
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,984
Looks delicious. Is this sea bream?

450
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,352
Looks like it.

451
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,154
Yeah, let me try.

452
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,722
-How is it?
-Well…

453
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:47,693
I'm so happy
I get to celebrate my birthday

454
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,929
with my family again this year.

455
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,031
Honey, you're always smiling.

456
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:56,369
Yuno, your success always inspires me.

457
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,237
Happy birthday.

458
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:02,408
Yoshio, you always…

459
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,411
manage to surprise me.

460
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,949
Yuno told me about your current firm.

461
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,987
I didn't think you'd be a local lawyer.

462
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,457
So you chose to tread a thorny path.

463
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,825
Hats off to you.

464
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,696
I'm sure any firm would've wanted
Yoshio in their team.

465
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,098
-Dad.
-Huh?

466
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,570
<i>I've heard your story.</i>

467
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:35,308
After you got kicked out of our company,
no one wanted to hire you, right?

468
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,212
As I said before,

469
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:44,984
I was asked to resign
because I couldn't achieve any results.

470
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,253
That rumor spread and no one--

471
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,721
That's not true.

472
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,692
Who wouldn't want someone
who's as talented as you?

473
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,094
-Dad--
-You…

474
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,397
You do not lose to anyone.

475
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,903
I've witnessed your talent
since you were a child.

476
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,973
You're a genius.

477
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,176
And that hasn't changed.

478
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,547
You are capable.

479
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,690
Take care.

480
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,225
Thank you.

481
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,330
You're really socially awkward,
aren't you?

482
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,101
Why couldn't you just go with it?

483
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:39,639
He only sees what he wants to see
and hears what he wants to hear.

484
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,606
You know that.

485
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,874
Here's your cab.

486
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,846
-Bye.
-Yeah.

487
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,984
Oh, hey.
He doesn't seem to be sorry at all, huh?

488
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,219
Huh?

489
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,922
I heard about that
horrible guy in the devil T-shirt.

490
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,090
Oh.

491
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,126
<i>But actually, what's the problem?</i>

492
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,727
<i>What's wrong with fast movies?</i>

493
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,263
<i>Fast movies were appreciated.</i>

494
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,499
<i>He may not get a suspended sentence.</i>

495
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,833
Are you gonna be okay?

496
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,870
I mean,
you're bad at trials to begin with.

497
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,272
Okay then, good night.

498
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,141
Thank you.

499
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,696
<i>Hello?</i>

500
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:41,332
I'm sorry to call you so late.
Do you have time to talk?

501
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:42,166
<i>Yeah.</i>

502
00:26:42,232 --> 00:26:42,933
Okay.

503
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,439
I was thinking of referring another lawyer
to Director Yamada, if he wants.

504
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:49,974
Oh, that.

505
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,009
Fine. Do as you wish.

506
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:56,313
Sorry for the trouble, but could you ask
Mr. Ryohei Yamada if he's okay with it?

507
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,849
No way. I'm not going to visit him.

508
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,285
<i>Don't say that. I need you to go.</i>

509
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,890
Hey, I was wondering…

510
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,492
<i>Yes?</i>

511
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:13,364
Why did you choose this job?

512
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:15,899
Is it because of your dad?

513
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,001
Well,

514
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:18,702
I guess so.

515
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:21,005
He told you to choose this path?

516
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:22,573
No.

517
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,210
Seeing my dad work got me interested.

518
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,385
Like removing the thorns
from the hearts of his clients,

519
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:39,156
being able to help the victims

520
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,459
and those
who committed a crime to start over

521
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,062
just seemed wonderful.

522
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,600
Even if someone made a mistake
and lost everything,

523
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,069
that person's life still goes on.

524
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:59,043
To be able to help them sprout
and grow again is one of the reasons

525
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:01,979
<i>I wanted to be a lawyer.</i>

526
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:05,516
Well, I'm not a lawyer though.

527
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,053
So, that <i>is</i> your true nature.

528
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,854
<i>What?</i>

529
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:14,491
That money-loving character is
only a pretense.

530
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,794
Right? You sound just like your father.

531
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,629
I'm not like him.

532
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,031
I'm a money grubber.

533
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:24,068
People usually don't call themselves that.

534
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,671
Anyway, is something wrong?

535
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:28,672
<i>Huh?</i>

536
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:32,543
You usually only seem to be
interested in yourself,

537
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,411
but you're asking me these questions.

538
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,115
It's nothing.

539
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,316
<i>No reason.</i>

540
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh. Okay.

541
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,991
About what you said.

542
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:49,660
Huh?

543
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,096
I guess I can ask him.

544
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,164
<i>Ryohei Yamada.</i>

545
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:55,399
Really?

546
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,367
You want me to, right?

547
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:58,168
Yes!

548
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,372
What do you say
when you ask someone for a favor?

549
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:09,246
Please help me out.

550
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:12,616
Okay.

551
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:13,784
I'm hanging up now.

552
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,620
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

553
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:19,223
<i>Good night.</i>

554
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:22,826
Good night.

555
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,845
But we're pretty tight too.

556
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:46,850
Mr. Kurahashi is reliable and I'm sure
he's open to discussing the fee.

557
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,319
Hello.

558
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:50,654
Hello.

559
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:52,923
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of the fans.

560
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,758
No need. I've become his fan too.

561
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,227
Which one did you like?

562
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,863
My favorite is--

563
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,131
Oh!

564
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:04,301
Sorry. Can we continue this
when I come back from court?

565
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:07,471
Chief asked me to file a complaint.

566
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,339
Go ahead. No need to rush.

567
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:12,142
Okay, I'll hurry without rushing then.

568
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,310
I'll be off.

569
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,012
See you later.

570
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:17,381
I guess I'll go too.

571
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,349
Where to?

572
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:21,685
To the interview.

573
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:29,259
I decided not to give up on
making him feel remorse.

574
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,629
Not only for my social media.

575
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,332
<i>Shoichi reciprocated her feelings.</i>

576
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,800
Got it.

577
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,303
<i>They kept running and ended up on a beach.</i>

578
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:40,337
Stop!

579
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,645
IS THERE HAPPINESS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN?

580
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,860
This scene…

581
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,469
<i>I wanted to protect you all along.</i>

582
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,707
<i>I would die with you.</i>

583
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,801
<i>Could you check the editing?</i>

584
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:45,602
Sure.

585
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

586
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,611
Do you do the editing here?

587
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,649
For some of them. We usually
send it to the editorial office.

588
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,021
How can I help you?

589
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:10,594
I was thinking that maybe you have an idea

590
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:13,897
who uploaded the fast movie
of <i>Tainted Towing</i>.

591
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,371
Please take a look at this.

592
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,243
<i>This scene…</i>

593
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,513
It wasn't there
when I watched it at the cinema.

594
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:31,782
You watched it?

595
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:35,953
Well, the defendant is a fan.
So I thought it would help.

596
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:40,123
Meaning, there are unused scenes
included in this fast movie.

597
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:44,428
There's no way you didn't notice that.

598
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:50,167
I believe there's only a handful of people

599
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,803
who has access to unused scenes.

600
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:03,680
Would you like to step out of the office?

601
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,287
The guy who was in the next room.

602
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:13,724
<i>His name is Moroboshi</i>
<i>and he's very passionate about movies.</i>

603
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:17,127
It all started when he ambushed me here

604
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:21,031
and begged me to hire him
as an assistant director.

605
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,837
I think it's him

606
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,039
who uploaded the video.

607
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,042
On opening night,

608
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:34,778
we went out for a drink
and he was complaining

609
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,214
how small the audience was.

610
00:33:38,782 --> 00:33:40,784
"If only we could get them to see it."

611
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:45,722
"We should do whatever we can
to promote it. Even fast movies."

612
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,725
He spat those words out and left.

613
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,229
The video was uploaded right after that.

614
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:59,970
He did it for the sake of the movie,
but in the end…

615
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,638
I don't know

616
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:05,409
how he feels about all this.

617
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:11,314
But the reviews of the movie
are all my responsibility.

618
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,351
I don't think it became

619
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:18,288
a box-office failure
only because of that video.

620
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:25,862
On second thought,
can I cancel the lawyer?

621
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,298
My team's misconduct

622
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,236
should be dealt with within the team.

623
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,820
I was going to tell him that
I watched the movie,

624
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:53,356
but he wouldn't even listen
saying he won't be convinced.

625
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:58,128
It's hard to confront someone
who won't accept anything.

626
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,132
The questioning of the defendant
is tomorrow, you know.

627
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,235
I'm out of ideas.

628
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,038
We're doomed.

629
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,244
You'll be famous
if he doesn't get a suspended sentence.

630
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:16,313
In a negative way.

631
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,915
I know, right?

632
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,121
I thought about it too.

633
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:29,493
How to make him face his sins.

634
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,263
I think this is the only way.

635
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,268
Do you want to hear it?

636
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,640
What do you say
when you ask someone for a favor?

637
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,249
Please…

638
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:53,783
Huh? What?

639
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,219
Please…

640
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:57,287
Pardon?

641
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,524
Oh, excuse me.

642
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:06,329
I forgot to tell you one thing.

643
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:10,000
Um…

644
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,337
Have you memorized
the possible arguments for tomorrow?

645
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,139
There's no need.

646
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:19,309
I'll tell them how I feel in my own words.

647
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:22,445
Okay.

648
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:28,618
Then, as my final request,
could you take a look at this?

649
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,656
First, you'll show him this video.

650
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:39,763
That's the end.

651
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,901
This is a fast movie of
Director Yamada's latest movie.

652
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:46,937
The one you were looking forward to.

653
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:50,140
Someone uploaded this video
and it's causing a controversy.

654
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,074
Who did this?

655
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,542
We don't know.

656
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,744
That person is messing with the movie.

657
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:57,214
It's such a low-quality fast movie.

658
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,718
The sensitive psychological portrait
and its unique sense of excitement.

659
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:04,788
That's what makes
Director Yamada's movies appealing.

660
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:09,125
But if you edit it like this,
it'll ruin that quality.

661
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:13,230
It took away the anticipation of
watching the full movie.

662
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:16,866
That's what you did.

663
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,973
No, I received comments saying
it made them want to watch--

664
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,743
And I wonder how many of them
actually watched the movie.

665
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,113
Aren't there more people who didn't bother
after watching the video?

666
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,352
There are way too many cons than pros.

667
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:41,057
Moreover, if the producer
doesn't wish for it, it is wrong.

668
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:43,793
Even if you did it
for the sake of the movie.

669
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,297
Unfortunately, the screening of
Director Yamada's new movie

670
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,132
has been terminated.

671
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:50,433
What?

672
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:54,304
Maybe the online reviews
had something to do with it too.

673
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:56,072
There weren't many audiences…

674
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,108
…but there are many reviews online.

675
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,576
And they're all bad reviews.

676
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,747
I did a little digging
and the majority were

677
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:06,216
people criticizing
without having seen the movie

678
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:10,020
and those commenting
only after watching the fast movie.

679
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,790
They're rating it
based on the video alone?

680
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:15,058
It seems so.

681
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,427
I guess they think
they've watched the movie.

682
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,333
They think a ten-minute video is enough
to understand the whole movie.

683
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,970
They criticize everything based on
headlines of online articles alone.

684
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:29,639
They don't bother
going through the contents because…

685
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,341
…it's a waste of time.

686
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,145
Those who praised you…

687
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:38,148
…aren't going to take any
responsibility. Rather…

688
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:41,651
…they crushed the work that took
ten years to complete in a flash.

689
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:47,390
Director Yamada mortgaged his house
in Suginami to raise 22 million yen.

690
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,026
He raised 13 million yen
borrowing money from people.

691
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,595
And he covers
half of the production costs himself.

692
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:55,098
The other half
is paid by the production company.

693
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,633
He also had to beg the actors…

694
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,336
…to perform in the movie
for a very low fee.

695
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:00,870
But it turned out like this…

696
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:03,973
…making everyone
who worked on this movie suffer.

697
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:12,048
Now, do you have an idea of
how sinful this "fast" world is?

698
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,951
The one you took part in?

699
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:22,559
That's all.

700
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,934
SECOND TRIAL

701
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:34,070
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

702
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:37,807
Yes.

703
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,211
I know it's too late,

704
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:44,214
but I really think
what I did was disgraceful.

705
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,384
I thought I was doing it for the movie,

706
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,853
but I was completely wrong.

707
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:54,524
But if I could ever be forgiven

708
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:58,228
I'd like to be involved with movies again.

709
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:01,464
The defendant is sentenced to
one year and two months…

710
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:04,100
<i>The execution of this sentence</i>
<i>is suspended for three years</i>

711
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,969
<i>from the day the trial is finalized.</i>

712
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:10,507
Thank goodness.
I'm so glad you got a suspended sentence.

713
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:12,742
You cared so much for me.

714
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,414
What a relief.

715
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,417
I'm sorry about everything.

716
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:22,986
Me too. I'm sorry.

717
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:27,090
You wanted to watch the movie,
but I showed you the video.

718
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:29,426
No, that brought me to my senses.

719
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,028
Shall we go then?

720
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:32,929
Yes.

721
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,431
Excuse me!

722
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:38,735
Could you come with me?

723
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,310
I'm sorry to call you out here.

724
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,780
Director, he's…

725
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,919
I'm terribly sorry!

726
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:04,227
I don't expect you to forgive me, but
I wanted to apologize to you in person.

727
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:17,440
You see,

728
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:22,979
I'm a slow writer and I think too much,

729
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,682
so I need a lot of time.

730
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:29,486
I'm far from getting
a general blockbuster hit,

731
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:31,654
so I can't get sponsors.

732
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:33,756
So, I need at least seven years.

733
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:38,261
For this movie, it took me ten years.

734
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,766
And I realized, I've turned 65.

735
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,903
If the next one will also take ten years,

736
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,206
I may not be able to make another movie.

737
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,616
I'm sorry for my immaturity.

738
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,720
But no matter how much you apologize,

739
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:06,656
I cannot accept it.

740
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:43,426
I wonder if we were able to
help anyone this time.

741
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,195
Who knows.

742
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:49,832
Maybe this became a deterrent
for future crimes.

743
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,772
And I guess the rest is up to
Ryohei Yamada from here on.

744
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:58,474
I guess so.

745
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:01,811
Geez.

746
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,480
It's already summer, huh?

747
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:05,548
Yes.

748
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:08,051
I haven't had the time to
look up at the sky.

749
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,753
I've been busy, like moving to a new firm.

750
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:15,458
So? Have you gotten used to the office?

751
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:20,129
I'm not sure.
The paralegal there is hard-headed.

752
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,864
Oh, I'm sorry.

753
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:24,000
But I'm grateful.

754
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,137
Just a little.

755
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:30,540
You've helped me a little.

756
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:44,187
Maybe you don't need to
pretend to be a genius anymore.

757
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:49,792
I feel that you're competent enough,
Mr. Haneoka.

758
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,728
So…

759
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:59,035
It's fine. This is my branding.

760
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:11,547
<i>In the criminal trial, he is found guilty</i>
<i>of violating the Copyright Act.</i>

761
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,450
<i>13 film companies and TV stations</i>

762
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,787
<i>filed a lawsuit to the Tokyo District</i>
<i>Court claiming 500 million yen</i>

763
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:22,125
<i>in compensation for</i>
<i>copyright infringement by fast movies.</i>

764
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:25,595
The defendant is going viral.

765
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:28,331
The photo of him when he was charged.

766
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:33,636
This will affect his future,
whatever he decides to do.

767
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:38,207
I guess today, you get other kinds of
punishment on top of the law's judgment.

768
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:41,210
The victims remain as well.

769
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,281
The comments of those
who misunderstood the director remains

770
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,083
and will remain that way.

771
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,651
That's awful.

772
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:51,287
A digital tattoo, indeed.

773
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:55,792
Once information spreads online,
it can't be deleted completely.

774
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:01,097
The director…

775
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:05,234
After Mr. Moroboshi admitted to
releasing the video,

776
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:07,270
he fired him.

777
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:12,909
Maybe it's out of love
that he didn't file a lawsuit.

778
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:15,845
To let him have a proper fresh start.

779
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,627
I didn't hit and run.

780
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:33,429
I almost died because of the hit-and-run.

781
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:35,732
Where's your confidence, Mr. Lawyer?

782
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:36,466
I'll be prosecuting.

783
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:37,333
See you in court.

784
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,403
<i>I want to prove</i>
<i>that my sister isn't lying.</i>

785
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,938
Enough already.

786
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:43,940
<i>I think I wasn't determined enough.</i>

787
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:46,209
