1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,841
Yeah! Hey! Let's go!

2
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,609
Watch out!

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,711
Are you okay?! Hey?!

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,015
-Yes, I'm fine.
-You sure? See ya, then.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,649
-Hey.
-Huh?

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,419
You should report it to the police.

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,487
You're fine, right?

8
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,721
-Yes.
-Okay.

9
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,924
If you don't, you might get arrested.

10
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,259
<i>What?</i>

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,634
This should do.

12
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,103
<i>"I'm enjoying a cruise today."</i>

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,175
<i>"Even a lawyer, who continues to fight,</i>
<i>needs a moment to rest his wings."</i>

14
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,556
USHIO LAW FIRM

15
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,561
What?

16
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,130
Oh, sorry to call you
in the middle of the night.

17
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,233
Chief. Is something wrong?

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,637
Actually,
we just got a request for defense counsel.

19
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:10,538
<i>Right.</i>

20
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,807
Do you think you can take it?

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,042
<i>I'll support you, of course.</i>

22
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,145
-Yes, sure.
-Oh, thank you.

23
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,147
So, here are the details.

24
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,119
<i>-In front of that.</i>
<i>-Right here.</i>

25
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,890
<i>The day before yesterday,</i>
<i>on July 22nd, at around 12:30 at night.</i>

26
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,559
<i>Ms. Kazuna Domae</i>

27
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,329
<i>was driving her electric scooter</i>
<i>from her part-time job to her home.</i>

28
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:38,833
<i>When she dodged past</i>
<i>the parked van on the road,</i>

29
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:43,537
<i>a man came out from behind the van</i>
<i>and they crashed.</i>

30
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,108
Kazuna rushed over to the man
who fell on the ground

31
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,445
and asked, "Are you hurt?
I'll call the police and ambulance."

32
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:56,250
But the man said, "I'm fine.
You don't have to do anything," and left.

33
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,320
So she couldn't get
his contact information and came home.

34
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,056
That's what she said.

35
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:07,261
But yesterday, she got worried
and went to the police.

36
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,732
There, she was told that
the man had fallen unconscious

37
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,834
and she was arrested on the spot.

38
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,336
Yes.

39
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:20,274
The victim, Mr. Takanobu Shinjo,
had walked home.

40
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,476
After a brief conversation with his wife,

41
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,979
his condition suddenly changed
and he lost consciousness.

42
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,415
His diagnosis was hypoxic encephalopathy
caused by fat embolism.

43
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,018
After that,
his wife reported it to the police

44
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,987
and they were looking for the culprit.

45
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,757
The police seem to think that

46
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,594
you left the scene
without doing anything to help.

47
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,364
If so, it's a violation of
the duty of care and report.

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,698
Basically, a hit-and-run--

49
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,333
I didn't hit and run!

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,668
He really said he was fine.

51
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,570
Right.

52
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:53,340
That's what we'll be arguing in court,
so I'm confirming it now.

53
00:02:55,376 --> 00:03:00,481
Under today's law, electric scooters are
treated the same as mopeds.

54
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:04,451
Causing serious injury
to someone you crashed into…

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,555
Someone you crashed into

56
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,559
and if that turned out to be
a hit-and-run,

57
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,096
you could be sentenced to prison
for several years.

58
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,874
You have a driving license, of course,
and liability insurance too.

59
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,777
But not the optional one.

60
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,646
Ah, I see.

61
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,988
I'm sorry about this.

62
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,724
I called you without thinking.

63
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,594
-No problem.
-It's an honor that you remembered us.

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,761
That's right.

65
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,531
I'm surprised
you remembered an old man like me.

66
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,803
You really helped us
during the accident two years ago.

67
00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:00,341
Oh, no.
I only helped you claim for damages.

68
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,442
Right?

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,547
Thanks to you, the insurance company
paid the full amount.

70
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,283
I'm glad I was able to help.

71
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,519
My little sister and I managed to get by
because of that money.

72
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:18,559
Well, you two lost both your parents and
you lost your eyesight in that accident.

73
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,594
So I wanted to do
what I could for you both.

74
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,895
Here.

75
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,564
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,300
Mr. Haneoka will also support you too.

77
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,935
Thank you.

78
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,336
I'll take the civil case.

79
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,538
Mr. Haneoka will handle the criminal case.

80
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,508
<i>He'll try and get a settlement</i>
<i>without punishment.</i>

81
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,212
Get off already.

82
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,549
Honestly, I avoided these because
I didn't want to be a bandwagoner…

83
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,786
I can't hear a word
he's blabbing on about.

84
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:49,023
The 30-minute free ride will be over
if he doesn't hurry.

85
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,557
And what am I here for?

86
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,426
Oh, I'm sorry.

87
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,596
I wanted you to help us
look for witnesses.

88
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,097
-Okay.
-Yes.

89
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,768
What about checking the security camera?

90
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,370
<i>We asked around earlier,</i>
<i>but they all declined.</i>

91
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,941
<i>While submission of footage to the police</i>
<i>is an obligation, it's not to lawyers.</i>

92
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:08,876
<i>Oh…</i>

93
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,180
So, we're going to search the hard way
until the time of the accident.

94
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,348
Hey, hey, hey.

95
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,550
-Don't just drive past us. Get off.
-No.

96
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,419
We're returning it within the free--

97
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,353
They're so close.

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,754
Stingy Ms. Ishiko.

99
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,823
By the way, about that swept-back hair.

100
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,894
<i>Is that from your genius memo,</i>
<i>"A unique hairstyle might be good"?</i>

101
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,295
There's no problem, right?

102
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,265
I told you, there's no need
to act like a genius anymore.

103
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,466
This is my weapon.

104
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,269
I think you're totally straying
from your plan.

105
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,005
Get off!

106
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,922
He's fully conscious and
we're told he won't have any aftereffects.

107
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,323
Ma'am.

108
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,460
I have a letter for you
from the suspect's sister.

109
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,330
I didn't agree to meet you
because I wanted an apology.

110
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,001
I just want to clarify
what she put my husband through.

111
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,405
He said…

112
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,241
he was hit by an electric scooter

113
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,144
and the driver just left him there
and fled the scene.

114
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,647
But the suspect said she helped him up.

115
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,183
The police told me
there's no proof of that.

116
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,488
If she had reported immediately,
none of this would've happened.

117
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,060
Could our client be lying?

118
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,230
Well, I'd hate to think so.

119
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,832
-I wanted to offer a settlement.
-Huh? Yoshio?

120
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,302
Hello, Ms. Ishida.

121
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,404
Good afternoon.

122
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,439
Why are you here? Are you unwell?

123
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,507
Same reason as you.

124
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,743
I've been assigned
to take over the electric scooter case.

125
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,981
I'm glad you're the defense lawyer.
It'll spare unnecessary hardships.

126
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,549
What do you mean?

127
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,353
You heard that the victim
doesn't want a settlement, right?

128
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:03,257
I'll be prosecuting for
negligent driving resulting in injury

129
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,025
and violation of duty of care.

130
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,962
I'm also in charge of the trial,
so I'll see you in court.

131
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,130
Bye.

132
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,979
First of all, there's no dashboard camera
on this parked van.

133
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,117
This is security camera footage
from the area.

134
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,719
Here is the victim.

135
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,189
And this is the defendant.

136
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,026
As you can see,
the victim is walking beside the van.

137
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,130
And the defendant
on the electric scooter drives up.

138
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,032
They seemed to have collided here.

139
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,167
The moment is not captured on camera.

140
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,772
This means there's no proof
she has offered any assistance.

141
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,075
Rather, considering the time
until she left the scene,

142
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,245
it's reasonable to think
that she did not do anything.

143
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,151
As you can tell from the earlier footage,

144
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:08,188
the victim was trying to cross the road
with no pedestrian crossing.

145
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,291
Additionally,
there are many parked cars at night.

146
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:15,229
As it is difficult to foresee a pedestrian
rushing out from behind them,

147
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:20,501
it should be considered that
the victim had also been negligent.

148
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,106
Although this is a legal precedent
from a civil case, there was a case

149
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,075
with similar circumstances to this one

150
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,912
where the level of negligence for
the offender was judged to be very low.

151
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,781
Lastly, two years ago,

152
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,051
you've lost your parents
in a traffic accident, correct?

153
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:38,952
Yes.

154
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,657
Did that change or influence
your awareness toward driving?

155
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,793
Yes. I've followed the legal speed limit

156
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,831
and made sure to drive safely
so I won't cause an accident.

157
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:56,203
You've never committed traffic violations
nor lied to the police, correct?

158
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,172
Correct. I haven't.

159
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,276
Very well. That'll be all.

160
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,045
Prosecutor, your cross-examination.

161
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:05,946
Yes.

162
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,950
Let me get to the point.

163
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:13,687
Don't you have a juvenile record
involving a traffic violation?

164
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,126
Four years ago, when you were 17,

165
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:23,363
you rode double on a bicycle with a man
you were dating then and hit a pedestrian.

166
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,033
And you two fled the scene
without reporting it.

167
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,438
A witness reported the accident later
and you were arrested.

168
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,206
Am I wrong?

169
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,177
You're right.

170
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,279
Do you remember what you said back then?

171
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,949
You said
you had no recollection of the accident,

172
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,253
but you admitted to lying after learning
there was security camera footage. Right?

173
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,623
Yes.

174
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,827
She said she's never committed a traffic
violation nor has she lied to the police.

175
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,529
But that is clearly a lie.

176
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,765
The defendant's testimony
has no credibility.

177
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,541
She probably thought
she wouldn't be trusted

178
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,277
if she told you about her juvenile record.

179
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:15,082
We managed to secure one more opportunity
to question the defendant.

180
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,917
Thank you very much.

181
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,659
She may not be able to avoid
prison sentencing.

182
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,429
What if this wasn't a hit-and-run?

183
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,099
Well,
his injury wasn't so serious after all,

184
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,167
so it will be completely different.

185
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,638
Should we focus on finding witnesses?

186
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,308
Something isn't right.

187
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,046
My sister is the leading young star
in the Public Prosecutors Office.

188
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,914
She's not in the traffic department

189
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,617
and it's not like her to take on
traffic accident cases.

190
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,587
And yet, why her?

191
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,289
The electric scooter is a new vehicle,

192
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:00,594
which is becoming more common,
so maybe they're proceeding cautiously.

193
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,461
I see.

194
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:02,996
Hmm…

195
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,741
Hello. This is Ushio Law Firm.

196
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,943
<i>I'm Shinjo's wife.</i>

197
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes. How may we help you?

198
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,084
<i>My husband said</i>
<i>he's willing to consider a settlement.</i>

199
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,388
If she pleads guilty in court

200
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,558
and pays 10 million yen immediately,
I'll consider it.

201
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm sorry,
but that amount may be a little difficult.

202
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,065
How much were you expecting?

203
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,568
It'll take a little time
since she doesn't have optional coverage,

204
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,205
but 2 million yen plus medical expenses
and compensation for absence--

205
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,707
Do you really get it?

206
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,076
I almost died because of the hit-and-run.

207
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,611
Yes, Ms. Kazuna Domae is also very sorry--

208
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,547
Enough of your lip service.

209
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,619
I won't be able to go back to work
for a long time.

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,057
If she seems sincere, I'll testify that
I don't wish for her to be punished.

211
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,026
But if she continues to lie,

212
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,029
all I hope for her is severe punishment.

213
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,404
How can I prepare that much money…

214
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,572
We understand.

215
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,075
If I sell this house…

216
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,712
Then, I can pay it.

217
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,218
I guess… you're right.

218
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,354
Yes.

219
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,759
If your lives can be protected
by paying the settlement…

220
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,296
This house is filled with
memories of our parents, but…

221
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,433
But if it can protect Kazuna.

222
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,139
No way!

223
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,008
Why should I pay 10 million yen to a liar?

224
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,345
I swear that Shinjo guy is lying!

225
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,514
I really ran up to him…

226
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,820
Oh, yeah. Back then,
I smelled a sweet and sour odor on him.

227
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,655
Sweet and sour odor?

228
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:09,823
Isn't that proof?

229
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,958
Not with your testimony alone.

230
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,328
We may be able to use it if we can prove

231
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,532
Mr. Shinjo definitely
had that odor on him that day, but…

232
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:24,871
Oh, I have something for you
from your sister.

233
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,508
<i>She knows you're sensitive to the cold.</i>

234
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:32,779
Here you go.

235
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,147
I'll check it.

236
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,248
Thank you.

237
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,455
Why would she…

238
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,400
Our apologies, but we're unable to
pay the amount you suggest--

239
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,668
Then…

240
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,306
I'll go all out to claim
the compensation in the civil trial.

241
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,876
By the way…

242
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,583
what were you doing there
at that time on the day of the accident?

243
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,718
It seems pretty far from your workplace--

244
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,186
I don't have to answer that.

245
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,087
Honey.

246
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,523
You have a call.

247
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,427
Hello?

248
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,829
What if he gets upset? What's bugging you?

249
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,765
I wonder what the sweet and sour odor is.

250
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,401
Who knows if she really smelled it.

251
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,537
She could be lying again.

252
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,940
We don't know what the smell is
to begin with.

253
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,745
They should pay
even if they had to sell their house.

254
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,882
If all goes well,
she may get a suspended senten--

255
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,283
Really?

256
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,587
If the client says that's not the truth,
I think we should fight.

257
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,122
But we have no proof.

258
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,224
So we should try and find the proof--

259
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,260
-You know I hate wasting time.
-L.E.!

260
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,494
Unbelievable!

261
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,830
Did you reach a settlement?

262
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,000
No.

263
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,468
I see.

264
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,537
You don't change, huh?

265
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,241
You still fight like that?

266
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,478
If you can't be flexible, it's over.
You get that?

267
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,582
Clients' lives depend on your competency.

268
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,551
Are you determined enough for that?

269
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,788
If you aren't,
you should quit being a lawyer.

270
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,160
You may be family, but that's--

271
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,330
Being too soft on your family
is also debatable, isn't it?

272
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,707
Take a look at this.

273
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,111
The father of the victim's wife,
Wakaba Shinjo,

274
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,180
was the chief prosecutor in Tokyo.

275
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,483
Maybe this is the reason
Mr. Haneo's sister was assigned.

276
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:51,952
It's possible.

277
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,555
In other words, the victim
is related to the prosecution side

278
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,158
and he might be under silent pressure.

279
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,059
Yes.

280
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,862
When your sister said,
"Being too soft on your family,"

281
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,664
could she mean the prosecutors?

282
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,068
I don't know about that.

283
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,239
I'm gonna go home.

284
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,140
Bye.

285
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,575
See you tomorrow.

286
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,676
See you.

287
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,463
USHIO LAW FIRM

288
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,869
The key is over there.

289
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,540
Yeah, I know.

290
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,846
What?

291
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,050
Apparently, they don't eat natto.

292
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,618
Huh?

293
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,490
The people who work in sake breweries
don't eat natto during the brewing period.

294
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,524
What's this about?

295
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,292
It's to prevent the natto bacteria

296
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,129
from killing the microorganisms
that the sake needs.

297
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,600
Doesn't knowing that
make you want to drink sake?

298
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,903
Is that an invitation?

299
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:21,808
Yes.

300
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,977
It's so hard to tell…

301
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,954
You drink fast.

302
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:35,955
Do I?

303
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,492
Here's your <i>itawasa</i>.

304
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,393
Thank you.

305
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,028
Looks good.

306
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,305
I thought it might be necessary for us
to get to know each other

307
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,641
as partners, once in a while.

308
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,612
Partners? That's an exaggeration.

309
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,582
Is that so.

310
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,257
If you're trying to cheer me up,

311
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,328
I'm not bothered.

312
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,931
By her words, I mean.

313
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,838
Here's <i>tamagoyaki</i>.

314
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,041
Man, I'm exhausted.

315
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,743
Excuse me.

316
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,045
-May I?
-Hey…

317
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,783
Since there aren't other customers around,
maybe I'll drink too.

318
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,717
What?

319
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,519
So, how's it going?

320
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,654
How? What is?

321
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,590
You know, like everything.

322
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,392
How is <i>it</i> going?

323
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,461
-That's so vague.
-You don't have to--

324
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,729
-So good.
-The bubbles.

325
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,397
Sorry about that.

326
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,999
Please clean up.

327
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,969
-You're like a crab.
-Mom, clean up!

328
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,871
It's not your mom's job.

329
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,939
You're going fast.

330
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,975
Oh, am I?

331
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,878
Walking helps
when you're trying to figure things out.

332
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,247
It clears your mind, doesn't it?

333
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,684
Even if you can't find the answer
if you keep walking,

334
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,820
you'll definitely find something one day.

335
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,024
<i>Are you sure it's alright</i>

336
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,393
to fully trust
Mr. Takanobu Shinjo's testimony?

337
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,862
Maybe we should've been more careful.

338
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,165
Better bend than break.

339
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,402
Oh, I heard. The opposing lawyer
is your brother, right?

340
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,637
Don't go easy on him.

341
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,472
Of course not.

342
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,674
You know how I am, don't you?

343
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,742
My bad.

344
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,019
Hello, it's Ishida.

345
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,188
-Hello.
-Hello.

346
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,756
Thank you.

347
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,192
-Hey, you.
-How are you?

348
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,795
"Thank you for taking care of my sister."

349
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:02,099
"Could you help her
renew the fire insurance?"

350
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,470
"You can find the contacts
in the right top drawer of my desk."

351
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,371
"Also…

352
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,146
she tends to overeat sweet things
so please keep an eye on her."

353
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,549
Cheeky.

354
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,387
Alexa, turn on the air conditioner.

355
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,455
<i>Yes.</i>

356
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:25,957
What happened to your arm?

357
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,431
I went to see Mr. Shinjo.

358
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,800
At the hospital?

359
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,103
Yes. Yesterday, with my friend.

360
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,872
But he refused to see me.

361
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,543
Next time, please let us know.

362
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,546
Mr. Shinjo is also a witness
for the criminal case,

363
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:52,116
so contacting him impulsively
could worsen our position.

364
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,252
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,323
I want to prove
that my sister isn't lying.

366
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,796
-No one's home?
-No.

367
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:06,931
Where are you going?

368
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,499
Asking this person.

369
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,601
He's sleeping. Hey…

370
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,149
Oh, it's so cool.

371
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,183
Welcome back.

372
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,084
Hello.

373
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:27,985
Oh.

374
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,255
These are the documents you asked for.

375
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,990
Thank you very much. A suit?

376
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:33,991
For a job interview.

377
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,493
Now?

378
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,694
They made time for me.

379
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:37,762
I see.

380
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:41,499
I'll join the witness search
after the interview.

381
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,901
No, you should get some rest today.

382
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:47,705
But late-night investigation is dangerous.

383
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:48,873
I'll be fine.

384
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,107
But I can go.

385
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,110
But I feel bad.

386
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:57,982
Please hear me out.

387
00:21:58,683 --> 00:21:59,517
Huh?

388
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:03,421
This is when I was in high school.
On the first Monday of April.

389
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:04,322
Right.

390
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:08,292
There was a lady on a train in a suit.
It was probably her first day at work.

391
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,162
She's mumbling a speech written on a note.

392
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,298
But she had a tag from the dry cleaners.

393
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:15,966
Okay.

394
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,636
I thought
she's probably introducing herself today.

395
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:22,306
And I felt bad
because she had that tag on her suit.

396
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:25,676
But I didn't have the courage to tell her
and she got off the train.

397
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,181
I still think about it after ten years.

398
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,183
My point is,

399
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:35,186
I'm the kind of guy
who'd always regret not doing anything

400
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:36,921
when I could've prevented it.

401
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:41,992
So, if I didn't do anything
knowing that you could be in trouble,

402
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,563
it will haunt me for the rest of my life.

403
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:46,797
So, I'll come!

404
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:49,533
Okay.

405
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:52,970
Huh?

406
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:55,873
If that's the case…

407
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:58,275
Please come.

408
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,345
Sure.

409
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,881
Are you not late?

410
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,683
Oh, crap. I'll see you later.

411
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,654
Mr. Oba.

412
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:13,991
Good luck!

413
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,401
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

414
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,902
Oh, this guy.

415
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,170
You know him?

416
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,606
He bumped into me.
I think he was pretty drunk.

417
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,408
He left without apologizing.

418
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,610
Do you remember when that was?

419
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,279
Um, it was July 22nd.

420
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:36,347
Are you sure?

421
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,316
Yeah, I was in a hurry that day
for my daughter's birthday.

422
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,454
Was there anything else
you noticed about him?

423
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,756
Umm…

424
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:50,528
The smell? He had this
strong sweet and sour odor like an apple.

425
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:53,497
Do you know which direction he came from?

426
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,599
Yeah, from back there.

427
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:05,476
<i>Actually, I've been wondering</i>
<i>where Mr. Shinjo came from all this time</i>

428
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,145
<i>and I've been checking out</i>
<i>the stores in this area.</i>

429
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:11,515
<i>And one of them stood out.</i>

430
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:13,484
<i>That's the entrance.</i>

431
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,430
I'm Ueno, referred here by Mr. Suzuhara.

432
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,266
<i>We've been informed. Welcome.</i>

433
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,481
No.

434
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:45,583
You'll lose if you don't.

435
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:48,285
Your timing's off.

436
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,566
<i>Yes?</i>

437
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,169
We've been referred here
by Mr. Takanobu Shinjo.

438
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,471
We're Ishida and Haneoka.

439
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,674
<i>Mr. Shinjo, did you say?</i>

440
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,944
Huh? Have you not been informed?

441
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,313
He said he'd make the call.

442
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,084
That's strange. Did we get the date wrong?

443
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:21,919
Maybe.

444
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:31,255
<i>No, please come in.</i>

445
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:37,528
Ms. Ishida and Mr. Haneoka.

446
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:40,031
Mr. Shinjo referred us here.

447
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,734
Yes, welcome.

448
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,387
Has he told you about this place?

449
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:04,789
Yes, roughly.

450
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,824
Betting starts at 30,000.

451
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,592
-Oh…
-Right…

452
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:13,497
Once you have the chips, you can't
redeem them until you win or lose 10,000.

453
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:14,465
Okay.

454
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,866
I'll bring your chips now.

455
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,334
-Thank you.
-Yes.

456
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:19,970
Oh!

457
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,273
Do you smoke hookah?

458
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,875
Oh, yes.

459
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:25,776
Yes.

460
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:27,378
Very well.

461
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:46,363
Smells like apples.

462
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:48,532
This is it.

463
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,169
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

464
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,573
I confirmed with Mr. Shinjo
and he doesn't recall referring you.

465
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,908
I need you to explain yourselves.

466
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,010
-Let's talk--
-We're leaving.

467
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,979
Sir.

468
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:02,880
Wait!

469
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,916
-We're leaving.
-Wait!

470
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:07,084
-Come back!
-Wai--

471
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:09,620
We'll talk to you in the back.

472
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,725
Hey…

473
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,931
Mr. Takanobu Shinjo comes here, right?

474
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:21,832
Huh?

475
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:24,969
Could you testify that he came here
on July 22nd?

476
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:25,870
Shut up!

477
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,238
-Are you crazy?
-Please!

478
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:30,374
All we need is for you to testify and--

479
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,977
-Please! Ouch…
-Get in here!

480
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,713
Oh, let's not do that.

481
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,448
No violence. No fists.

482
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,283
Who the hell are you two?

483
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,319
I'm a lawyer.

484
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,889
Any additional violence--

485
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,824
And what?!

486
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,660
You think that's gonna scare me?!

487
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:52,329
Police! Don't move!

488
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:54,798
We received a tip
that this is an illegal casino.

489
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:57,401
Show me your ID!

490
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:07,878
Please stop!

491
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:10,548
-Oh.
-Come on, get up!

492
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:13,217
-Hey…
-Ishiko!

493
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,521
Don't move, we're the police!

494
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:20,457
All of you, don't move!

495
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,426
Oh geez…

496
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,930
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, we're not…

497
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,499
-We're not customers here.
-We're not.

498
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:31,168
Oh, really?
We can talk about that later. Okay?

499
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,704
-Please wait.
-My leg. My leg hurts.

500
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,508
Let go!

501
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,009
He's so energetic.

502
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,545
You saved us, Mr. Oba.

503
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,547
Yeah, you really did.

504
00:28:43,614 --> 00:28:46,383
I couldn't wait for the police
and I charged in.

505
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,651
We owe you.

506
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:49,820
No worries.

507
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,657
There are no more trains,
so let's take a taxi.

508
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,993
-It's on the firm.
-Okay.

509
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,294
-Okay.
-Ow, ow…

510
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,932
-You okay?
-You're going the other way, right?

511
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,500
Ah, yes.

512
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:11,742
It'll be cheaper if I drop off
Mr. Haneoka on my way home.

513
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,444
-Okay.
-So, you get in.

514
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,449
Please take a good rest.

515
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:19,717
I will.

516
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,385
Good night.

517
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:23,254
Hey, good work today.

518
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,154
See you.

519
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,456
-See you.
-Please drive.

520
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,595
-Bye.
-Take care.

521
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,203
One, two. One, two.

522
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,007
-Three-legged race, is it?
-Make sure you go to the hospital.

523
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,908
I'll get better if I sleep.

524
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,911
-Is this it? Here.
-Thanks.

525
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,881
Okay then. See you tomorrow.

526
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,092
Do you contribute
to the hometown tax program?

527
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:04,328
Excuse me?

528
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,032
The place I contributed to

529
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,801
sends me draft beer in return.

530
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,670
Huh?

531
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,808
I heard that draft beer
is the same as tap beer in Japan.

532
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,545
-What about it?
-So, you know…

533
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:27,051
Do you wanna join me for a drink?

534
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,218
What?

535
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,695
Sure.

536
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,239
-Can't we drink inside?
-No.

537
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:52,509
I can't enter a man's room so casually.

538
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,445
I see.

539
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:56,547
There.

540
00:30:57,948 --> 00:30:59,717
It's a great view.

541
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,251
Yeah.

542
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:12,930
Actually, I was bothered.

543
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:15,666
By my sister's words.

544
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:21,939
Honestly, I've no confidence.

545
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,112
Ever since I was little,
the only weapon I've had is my memory.

546
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:35,252
I have this ability called
photographic memory,

547
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:38,589
where I can memorize what I see instantly.

548
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:42,326
I only passed the bar exam
because of that ability.

549
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,095
And also…

550
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:58,075
If anything unexpected happens, my body…

551
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,943
Actually…

552
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:03,147
My father has told me about that.

553
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,617
Oh, he has?

554
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:11,221
Is that why you made up that
genius character?

555
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,491
Well…

556
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:16,593
Yeah…

557
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:23,734
So, I wasn't confident enough
to defend this case in court either.

558
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,372
That's why I wished for
an out-of-court settlement.

559
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,046
Like my sister said,

560
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:40,350
I think I wasn't determined enough.

561
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,193
Where's your confidence, Mr. Lawyer?

562
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,594
Huh?

563
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:54,731
You know I've failed
the exam four times, right?

564
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,635
You passed.

565
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,306
That should be enough
to make you confident.

566
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,642
You're right.

567
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,080
I guess
there's always someone beneath you.

568
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:11,315
Watch it.

569
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:14,451
It's pretty amazing
how you've failed four times.

570
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:16,820
-After graduating from Tokyo University.
-Enough of that.

571
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,021
Okay.

572
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,735
<i>Let's help them, yeah?</i>

573
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:37,508
-We're looking for a witness.
-Emi, drink some water.

574
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,443
Did you witness a traffic accident?

575
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,179
Thank you very much.

576
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:45,582
We're looking for
a witness to a traffic accident.

577
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,251
We'd appreciate your help.

578
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,419
It's my little sister!

579
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,392
SECOND TRIAL

580
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:59,530
Do you know a building called "Quest"
in Onaga town?

581
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,498
No.

582
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:04,568
A witness testified
that he saw you coming out

583
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:07,070
from that building at the concerned time.

584
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:08,605
You really don't know?

585
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,841
No.

586
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,611
As per the Plaintiff's Exhibit 18,
which we just examined,

587
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:18,215
one of the stores in that building
allows illegal casino activities.

588
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:20,183
Have you not been there?

589
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,252
No.

590
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:23,320
Objection.

591
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,956
These questions
have no relevance to this case.

592
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,058
Counsel,
what's the purpose of your questions?

593
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,862
These are important questions
to verify that the witness

594
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,064
is not giving a false testimony.

595
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,167
Objection is overruled.

596
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,735
Please continue.

597
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,337
Thank you.

598
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:46,577
As per the evidence we submitted,
that store is filled with hookah smoke.

599
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:48,612
So if you've been there,

600
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,515
your clothes will pick up its
sweet and sour odor within a few minutes.

601
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,718
The previously mentioned eyewitness

602
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:58,755
and the defendant,
who ran up to you after the accident,

603
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:03,126
have testified that they smelled
something sweet and sour from you.

604
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:04,494
Have you not been there?

605
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:06,663
No.

606
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,031
Are you sure?

607
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:11,368
If she called an ambulance
and the police questioned you,

608
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:15,038
people may find out that
you're a regular at an illegal casino.

609
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:17,007
Isn't that why you left the scene?

610
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:17,774
Your honor.

611
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:22,079
These statements are circumstantial
and unsubstantiated.

612
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:25,415
These are mere speculations
and it's not even a question.

613
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:30,120
Counsel should be asking based on facts
and not making claims.

614
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:31,488
My apologies.

615
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:38,762
Now, to clarify the statement,

616
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:40,998
I'd like to show you the map
from Plaintiff's Exhibit 20.

617
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:41,898
Go ahead.

618
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:48,305
The distance to Supermarket Katsuzen
from your home is approximately…

619
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:50,807
four kilometers.

620
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,843
Is that correct?

621
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:54,611
Yes.

622
00:35:56,113 --> 00:36:00,550
From the day you started
using an electric scooter

623
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,953
until the day of the accident,

624
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,159
do you remember how many times
you drove to Katsuzen?

625
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,362
We've kept the receipts for
household accounts

626
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,297
and it was a total of 24 times.

627
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:20,203
Okay. That means, a round-trip will be
four times two. So, eight kilometers.

628
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,204
Four times eight…

629
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,440
Four <i>times</i> eight?

630
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:26,009
Four times eight is 32.

631
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:31,281
So, 160 added to 32 is 192 kilometers.

632
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:36,319
The round-trip distance to her workplace
and the round-trip to the supermarket is

633
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:42,492
1,047 kilometers.

634
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,727
-May I?
-Please!

635
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:47,831
It's not even worth an objection,

636
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:51,168
but this is not the place for the defense
to make assumptions.

637
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,805
Receipts from the supermarket
does not prove

638
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:58,108
that she drove there on
an electric scooter in the first place.

639
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,077
She could've walked or ridden a bicycle.

640
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:02,646
And even if she was
using an electric scooter,

641
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,114
what does that matter?

642
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:08,885
Assertions based on such weak grounds
do not prove anything.

643
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,291
It scares me that
you think this is good enough evidence.

644
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,261
Counsel, we don't need
your personal opinion right now.

645
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:19,663
Please stick to the facts.

646
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:21,898
Can we move on?

647
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:24,067
-Oh, I still--
-Enough already.

648
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,304
Your honor, the defense
keeps questioning with unknown purposes

649
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,773
<i>and is clearly impeding the trial.</i>

650
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,209
<i>You're right. Counsel, we cannot--</i>

651
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:34,878
No. Um, I still…

652
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,185
Excuse me.

653
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,692
-You're late. I'm sweating so much.
-Sorry.

654
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,093
No personal conversations.

655
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,728
I apologize.

656
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:54,164
The defense has no more questions.

657
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,398
Instead…

658
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:59,302
I would like to submit
a new piece of evidence.

659
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,805
What is this? We haven't been informed.

660
00:38:01,872 --> 00:38:04,608
The defendant's sister, Emi,

661
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:07,511
has been handing out flyers every night
for the past two weeks

662
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,614
at the time of the accident
in search for witnesses.

663
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,916
In order to prove that her little sister,

664
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:15,952
who's always taken care of her,
didn't commit hit-and-run.

665
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,754
She did it every day for two weeks.

666
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,161
And those who sympathized with her
posted on social media

667
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,897
and it caused a buzz on the internet.

668
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,134
A truck driver, who parked

669
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:35,839
a little distance away from the
scene of the accident,

670
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:39,743
<i>saw the post on social media</i>
<i>and contacted us last night.</i>

671
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,181
And he said he'd give us
the dashboard camera footage.

672
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:47,684
That's what you say.

673
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:48,585
Sounds good.

674
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:52,222
But he was away for delivery,
so he couldn't give it to us immediately.

675
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,625
He didn't know
how to send the data either.

676
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:56,827
So, my paralegal…

677
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,028
My…

678
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:02,933
My partner, a paralegal,

679
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,669
rushed over there to pick up the footage.

680
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:09,072
However, I feared that
she may not make it to the trial

681
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,509
and decided to stall a little just now.

682
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:16,079
If you follow the cross-examination
and questioning on this script,

683
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:20,650
your sister should have a lot to say.
So take a moment to show her gratitude.

684
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:22,686
Thanks to you…

685
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,822
I was able to buy a lot of time.

686
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:27,724
Thank you very much.

687
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,329
Thus, I would like to
submit this data as evidence--

688
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:33,363
One moment please.

689
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:37,667
Such footage with unknown details
is obviously unacceptable--

690
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:40,070
Please decide that after you watch it.

691
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:43,840
You could end up falsely accusing someone.

692
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,545
Then the prosecutor can
give their opinion after watching it.

693
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:51,514
We'll decide
if it's acceptable or not after that.

694
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:30,153
Kazuna rushed over to him.

695
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:36,860
Mr. Shinjo is waving his hand in refusal.

696
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,166
She seems to be talking on her phone.

697
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,470
Emi…

698
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:53,276
Kazuna looks like
she's trying to call an ambulance.

699
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:14,397
It is very clear that the defendant
did not violate her duty of care.

700
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:15,932
On the other hand,

701
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:21,338
I'd say this is the most decisive evidence
of the victim's false testimony.

702
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,253
She's here.

703
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,688
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER

704
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:43,927
Sis!

705
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:45,862
Kazuna.

706
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:48,965
I believed in you.

707
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,969
I'm glad
your bail was granted immediately.

709
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:56,272
But I doubt you'd be acquitted.

710
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,474
That's fine.

711
00:41:58,008 --> 00:42:01,277
I lost my family to an accident.

712
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:06,216
And yet, I was unmindful of the fact
that I could kill someone.

713
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:08,918
I'm really sorry.

714
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:13,556
I'll do the best I can
for the civil compensation too.

715
00:42:14,424 --> 00:42:17,060
And I'll continue to support you.

716
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:21,031
The revised law is expected to
take effect within two years

717
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:24,300
and those over 16 years old
will be allowed to ride electric scooters

718
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,470
without a license and a helmet,
if it's up to 20km/hr.

719
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:30,907
Most likely,
the number of accidents will increase.

720
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,610
I hope more people will be aware

721
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,880
that they could end up killing someone

722
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:39,382
because it's an easy vehicle to ride.

723
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:43,353
I'm relieved

724
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:48,058
their child didn't have to go through
what we did.

725
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:55,598
<i>The defendant is sentenced to</i>
<i>two years in prison.</i>

726
00:42:55,665 --> 00:43:00,070
The execution of this sentence
will be suspended for three years.

727
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:04,107
<i>In addition, the defendant is acquitted</i>
<i>of the second indictment of</i>

728
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,909
<i>violation of the Road Traffic Act.</i>

729
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:27,163
Oh, yeah.

730
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,033
That job interview.

731
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:31,901
I didn't get it.

732
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:33,937
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:36,539
No need to rush.

734
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:39,843
You're doing more than
what we pay you to do.

735
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,044
Really?

736
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:43,613
So hot. Something's wrong with Japan.

737
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:48,017
Where's Yoshio?

738
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,752
He's coming in the afternoon today.

739
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:50,854
What?

740
00:43:51,788 --> 00:43:54,357
I see. Then I'll come by some other time.

741
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,559
Here. It's Kisaburo's baumkuchen.

742
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:59,629
-Thank you very much.
-Sure. I'm gonna go.

743
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:01,464
-Man…
-Ma'am.

744
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,968
Could it be that

745
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:09,339
you knew about
the illegal casino store all along?

746
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:14,344
You wanted to expose that casino group.

747
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,980
But if a relative of the prosecutor
is a regular there,

748
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:19,449
the higher-ups may cover it up.

749
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:22,819
Because prosecutors are
too soft on their family.

750
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,955
Therefore, you led us to expose that store

751
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:28,191
so the police will have to take action.

752
00:44:28,758 --> 00:44:32,395
In fact, there was a raid after the trial,
wasn't there?

753
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:34,964
Takanobu Shinjo was arrested too.

754
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:38,501
So, as I said, this trial was all your--

755
00:44:38,568 --> 00:44:41,504
Hang on a second. What is this?
Is this a courtroom?

756
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:43,139
Am I being interrogated?

757
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:49,212
You know, you're a strange one.

758
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,015
Well, it might suit him better.

759
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:56,419
Please take care of my little brother.

760
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:08,131
She brought us something yummy!

761
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:19,609
-Dad!
-Don't call me dad.

762
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,244
I need your help!

763
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:24,447
We might sue someone!

764
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:31,487
<i>Your neighbor's plum tree branch has been</i>
<i>growing into your yard for years.</i>

765
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,655
<i>My uncle's been sued!</i>

766
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:35,291
<i>She's demanding 500,000 yen</i>
<i>in compensation.</i>

767
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,060
<i>When I get the job,</i>
<i>I'm going to ask you out.</i>

768
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,294
You two stay put.

769
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,996
Please wait. I don't understand.

770
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:41,864
-Stay here.
-Why won't you let me…

771
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:42,832
