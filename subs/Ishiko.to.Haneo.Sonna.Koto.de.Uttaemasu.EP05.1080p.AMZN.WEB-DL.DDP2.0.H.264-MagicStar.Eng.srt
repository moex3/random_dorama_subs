1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,013
It's so beautiful.

2
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,048
Hey!

3
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,753
Don't cut it without my permission!

4
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:20,955
I'll sue you!

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,057
Sorry?

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,992
I will sue you!

7
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,928
I'll sue!

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,097
Don't do that!

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,772
Hello.

10
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>Good morning.</i>

11
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,741
Good morning.

12
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,043
<i>Can you look down?</i>

13
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,212
Oh.

14
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,580
I felt antsy and got here early.

15
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,182
Hang on. I'll be right down.

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,817
Oh, stay there a bit longer.

17
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,522
This situation with you on the balcony
is like that, isn't it?

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,289
Romeo and--

19
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,891
I'm coming down right now.

20
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,528
What a good girl.

21
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,695
KURUGA TOWN

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,864
<i>Let me confirm.</i>

23
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,300
<i>Mr. Yoshiyuki Shigeno,</i>
<i>there's a large plum tree</i>

24
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,769
<i>growing out of your neighbor's house and</i>

25
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:12,540
<i>you've been distressed about</i>
<i>the yearly outbreak of caterpillars.</i>

26
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,842
<i>However, there was nothing you could do</i>

27
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,211
<i>because the house</i>
<i>had been empty for years.</i>

28
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:21,315
<i>Then, a year ago,</i>
<i>Ms. Masue Arimori moved into that house.</i>

29
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,984
<i>But nothing has been done</i>
<i>about the plum tree</i>

30
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,654
<i>and the caterpillars</i>
<i>are manifesting again this year.</i>

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,190
<i>If possible,</i>
<i>you'd like us to inform Ms. Arimori</i>

32
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,193
<i>to fulfill her responsibility as an owner</i>

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,728
<i>and deal with the caterpillar problem.</i>

34
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,197
That's your request, yes?

35
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,934
That's right.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,505
We were drinking the other day and he said
telling her directly could offend her.

37
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,341
So I told him that
I'll refer him to a lawyer.

38
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,476
Right.

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,147
I'm glad you came to us.

40
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,716
No matter how much
it grows into your property,

41
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,618
it's illegal to cut them on your own.

42
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,988
Mr. Haneoka here will suggest
how you can deal with it.

43
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,556
Okay.

44
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,497
YOSHIYUKI SHIGENO'S HOUSE
MASUE ARIMORI'S HOUSE

45
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,466
You're right. There's loads of them.

46
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,139
It's a larvae of a moth
called fall webworm.

47
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,574
Don't show me. This is insect harassment.

48
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,781
You don't have to look at it,
but show motivation.

49
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,251
But this case is so bland.

50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,987
And most of all,
the client seems so uninterested.

51
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,922
I'm concerned about that too.

52
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,056
It's probably that.

53
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:39,527
Mr. Shiozaki forced his uncle
to make a case just to impress you.

54
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,095
What about me?

55
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:41,996
Nothing.

56
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,364
You don't look dependable.

57
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,567
I asked her dad
to take the case to begin with.

58
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,602
But he was too busy and it went to you.

59
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:50,971
You seem shallow.

60
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,575
Please rest assured.

61
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,045
Despite his looks,
Haneoka is as capable as the next guy.

62
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,280
As the next guy?

63
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,149
Exaggerating your capability
could be seen as a lie.

64
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,584
You should trust me.

65
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,485
Even so.

66
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,619
Even so what?

67
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,587
Oh, a bug.

68
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,590
<i>Coming.</i>

69
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,561
Good afternoon.

70
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,033
<i>Therefore, Article 233 of the Civil Code</i>

71
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,736
<i>"Cutting off branches and roots of trees"</i>
<i>stipulates that if your neighbor's</i>

72
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,774
tree branch grows over
the boundary line into your yard,

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,977
the landowner can ask the neighbor
to cut off that branch.

74
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,179
Also, Article 717 of the Civil Co--

75
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,748
I understand.

76
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,851
Then, could you take care of it?

77
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:42,256
I apologize for the trouble.

78
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,657
No problem.

79
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,268
I wonder if that was the right move.
Didn't we pressure her a little too much?

80
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,170
It's fine.

81
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,871
Is it really?

82
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,476
SATOMI COAST BUS

83
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,578
It won't be here for a long while.

84
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,147
The one we're getting on is there.

85
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:09,950
I know.

86
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,219
See, I just thought I'd go to the beach--

87
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,621
You checked the timetable.

88
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,122
Maybe dip our feet in.

89
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,058
-We're not here to have fun.
-Come on. Until the bus comes.

90
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,094
No. We could miss the…

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,462
Man, it's so hot.

92
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,631
Ow, ow.

93
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,702
Ouch.

94
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,805
80 MILLION YEN IN DAMAGES
FOR REAL ESTATE FRAUD

95
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,776
My, that was an efficient job.

96
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,479
-We solved it in a second.
-It wasn't a second.

97
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,648
Do you know how many hours it took to--

98
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,617
It's just a figure of speech.
Just say, "You're right."

99
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,019
-You're right.
-Good.

100
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,854
Alright.

101
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,159
I'm sorry to disturb you.

102
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,362
Can I go to a job interview next Tuesday?

103
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,298
Yeah, sure. Is it going well?

104
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,467
Yes. One of them went well
and it's the final interview.

105
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,969
I see.

106
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,105
I want you to get the job,
but we're sure going to miss you.

107
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,208
Yes. You've been a great help.

108
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,782
Hello!

109
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,417
We didn't order anything.

110
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,154
It's not that.
My uncle's been sued by her neighbor!

111
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,488
What?

112
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:39,239
So, Ms. Masue Arimori
has been troubled by the sounds of piano

113
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,009
coming from your house
since the day she moved in.

114
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,545
She's demanding
an improvement of this situation

115
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,115
and 500,000 yen in compensation
for her emotional distress.

116
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,016
That's right.

117
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,787
This is only a content-certified mail,
so you haven't been sued yet.

118
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,524
It is under her name
and she doesn't seem to have a lawyer.

119
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,461
However, we shouldn't let our guard down.

120
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,098
Have you ever had complaints
about the piano?

121
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,299
No.

122
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,135
Have you had any trouble
with Ms. Arimori in the past?

123
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:08,836
None at all.

124
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,704
You've met her, yes?

125
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,674
We've said hi.

126
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,909
Do you play the piano often?

127
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,112
Sometimes.

128
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,782
Since my mother passed away,
I've had nothing to do.

129
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,517
So I bought it.

130
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,086
Around what time?

131
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:31,992
I play between noon and seven p.m.

132
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,195
I wear headphones
when I play outside that time.

133
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:39,266
If that's the case, it is unlikely
for the court to accept her claim.

134
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,871
You could lose if you're playing
at ridiculous times and volumes

135
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,507
and if you don't stop
even after repeated warnings.

136
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,941
But this is not the case.

137
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,476
Okay.

138
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:55,015
I guess it's probably a counterpunch
to the insect complaint.

139
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:02,022
Maybe we were too tough on
Ms. Arimori, after all.

140
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,993
I thought you'd be pleased.
We're getting another consultation fee.

141
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,896
But if I think about
their relationship as neighbors…

142
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,199
Hey.

143
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,534
Yes?

144
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,603
You stay off this case.

145
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,706
I'll ask Oba to help me from now on.

146
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,710
What are you talking about?
I need to keep an eye on you.

147
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,746
No, I'm serious.

148
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,614
Aren't you stepping over boundaries?

149
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,419
You're a paralegal.
I need you to follow my policies.

150
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,422
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,357
Go do some accounting at the office.

152
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:41,929
Okay.

153
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,042
Why don't you two go home?
How long are you going to stay?

154
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,044
But they're not back yet.

155
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,679
It's so late.

156
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,116
Is there a chance
they're not coming back today?

157
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,118
They will.

158
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,788
What if they missed the hourly bus

159
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,390
and have no choice but to stay the night?

160
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,428
And what if
there's only one room available?!

161
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,596
What?

162
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,764
You see it in TV dramas, right?

163
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,434
They decide to stay
and there's only one room left.

164
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,971
And they end up in the same room,
saying "Don't come into my side…"

165
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,707
but they start to get cozy. You know?!

166
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,742
Y-You're overthinking it.

167
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,744
Aren't you worried, dad?

168
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,745
Don't call me dad.

169
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:32,646
Why not?

170
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,948
But that won't happen.

171
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,684
They're both young man and woman.
You never know.

172
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,328
We're back.

173
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,269
-Welcome back!
-Welcome!

174
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,436
Welcome home.

175
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,605
We're back.

176
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,914
Haneo.

177
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,382
Hm?

178
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,286
The other day,
you asked me how I feel about Ishiko.

179
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,454
Yeah.

180
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,992
I like Ishiko.

181
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,064
I see.

182
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,936
And why are you telling me this?

183
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:34,107
If I ask her out, things might get awkward
regardless of if it goes well or not.

184
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,511
So, you're gonna ask her out officially?

185
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,513
I intend to.

186
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,182
But when? When is this happening?

187
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,918
Um, I still haven't…

188
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:45,852
Haven't decided?

189
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,753
Right.

190
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,356
Okay, I see.
Let me know when you've asked her.

191
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,960
If that's the case,
however it may turn out,

192
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,695
when I've told her I'll…

193
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,032
I'll touch my nose.

194
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,168
Got it. Hey, are you coming in tomorrow?

195
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,869
Um, yes.

196
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,505
Then could you investigate
Mr. Shigeno's case?

197
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,341
I don't mind.

198
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,477
I asked Ishiko to do some paperwork.

199
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:11,745
Right.

200
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,513
Okay. See you tomorrow.

201
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,414
Sure.

202
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,315
Ears, yeah?

203
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,017
-The nose!
-Right, the nose.

204
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:17,918
See you.

205
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,095
Yup. It's the next right.

206
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,563
Okay.

207
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,969
Did something happen between
you and Haneo?

208
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,407
He asked for my help out of the blue.

209
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,677
To be honest, I'm not sure.

210
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,780
Huh? Was it really okay for you to come?

211
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,516
Yes.
I've finished processing the expenses.

212
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,719
And since we're getting paid,
I'll do what I can.

213
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,229
Ms. Arimori is stylish and pretty,
isn't she?

214
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,699
She's become the "it girl" of
the neighborhood association, right?

215
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,503
-And she has a lot of hobbies.
-She's well educated.

216
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,306
She knows a lot about classical music,
paintings and movies.

217
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,911
The other day, she told me about
the news where the fast movie's culprit

218
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,913
was arrested in detail.

219
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,553
Now, President of the Association.

220
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,389
How would you describe Mr. Shigeno?

221
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,193
I barely know anything about him.

222
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,631
He doesn't come to the gatherings either,
so I'm not sure.

223
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,965
Right, Ms. Hashimoto?

224
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,002
Right.
I don't think he has any close friends.

225
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,403
Not even one?

226
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,340
He's the complete opposite of Ms. Arimori.

227
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,880
There are many elderly people living here.

228
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:58,518
Seems the generation who moved here when
it was developed as a bedroom community

229
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,020
has aged out.

230
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,094
Ishiko?

231
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,063
Ishiko?

232
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,599
-I'm fine. Really.
-Let's go to hospital.

233
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,700
No!

234
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,136
I'll carry your stuff.

235
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,671
Okay.

236
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,674
Get on!

237
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,042
But…

238
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,778
We can't get a taxi here.
Just up to the main road.

239
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,751
Thank you.

240
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,785
Sure.

241
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,463
<i>It could be an ovarian cyst.</i>

242
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,634
Let's do the tumor marker test today.

243
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,470
I'll write a referral letter
to a hospital in Tokyo,

244
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,439
so please do the MRI test there.

245
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,948
How was it?

246
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,284
She said I was under
the air conditioner too much.

247
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm sorry I made you worry.

248
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,289
Not at all. I'm just glad.

249
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,190
Thanks.

250
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,330
Get in.

251
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,668
I called Ms. Hashimoto
and borrowed her car.

252
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,871
For me?

253
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:25,772
Yes.

254
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,509
Are those for me too?

255
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:33,013
Yes. I bought both stick-on
and non-stick heat packs.

256
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:36,950
I appreciate it.

257
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,255
You made me very happy.

258
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,162
No worries. Please get in.

259
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,476
Okay, I'm gonna go return the car.

260
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,078
Thank you very much.

261
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,346
No problem.

262
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,249
Take a good rest during the weekend.

263
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,519
Thanks. Please drive safely.

264
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,653
I will.

265
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,440
I'm home.

266
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,718
-Dad.
-Huh?

267
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,152
Sleep on your bed.

268
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,454
Welcome home.

269
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,588
Yeah, thanks.

270
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,790
You've worked hard today.

271
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,559
Here. A souvenir.

272
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,627
Oh.

273
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,062
You two really are partners.

274
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,399
See, Haneo brought this just now.

275
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,901
His souvenir.

276
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:02,469
Oh…

277
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,171
You two are getting in sync, huh?

278
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,776
You're a paralegal.
I need you to follow my policies.

279
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,711
Go do some accounting at the office.

280
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,215
I wonder.

281
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,559
Seriously, don't push yourself.

282
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,796
I slept the whole weekend, so I'm fine.

283
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:33,366
Alright. Shall we start from
Mr. Shigeno's house today?

284
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,267
Yes.

285
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,769
We borrowed a noise meter--

286
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,271
Huh? Haneo!

287
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,506
-No.
-Hey.

288
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,447
Why are you here?

289
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,151
I'm helping Mr. Oba.

290
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,153
Hmm.

291
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,754
Oh, I asked her.

292
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,488
No, I did.

293
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,490
It doesn't matter which.

294
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,759
What are you doing?

295
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,797
Right. I did a little research and

296
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:08,168
I found out there's an outbreak of
fall webworm in the entire Kuruga town.

297
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,937
It's actually a problem
in the whole prefecture now.

298
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,773
And if each town's community
wants to exterminate it,

299
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,509
the prefecture lends out
this pest control equipment.

300
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,278
This is the equipment?

301
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,179
Yup.

302
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,983
I'm surprised you found that out.
You're afraid of bugs.

303
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,551
I squinted my eyes.

304
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,590
Oh, here it comes!

305
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,260
It's an environmentally friendly
naturally derived pesticide.

306
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,596
So it won't affect
the surrounding environment.

307
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,299
You're a lifesaver.
The caterpillars are everywhere.

308
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,235
I was so sick of them.

309
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,105
I spoke with the president and

310
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,509
the neighbor's association will be
handling the caterpillars from now on.

311
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,410
That's right.

312
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:55,849
So, from now on, you won't have to
deal with the plum tree personally.

313
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,150
Thank you.

314
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,691
Mr. Shigeno said
as long as the insects are gone,

315
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,027
he's not bothered by the branches.

316
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,530
If we get rid of the insects,
we can tell her

317
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:14,934
we no longer care about the branches
as an exchange condition.

318
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,271
Do you think she'll withdraw
the noise problem now?

319
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,672
Most likely.

320
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,241
So, that's your plan.

321
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,346
Getting rid of the insects
has nothing to do with the noise problem.

322
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,417
Huh? Oh, sorry.
We're having a private conversation.

323
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,153
I've been entrusted to
deal with this case.

324
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:33,920
What?

325
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,822
I was a judicial scrivener.

326
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,426
I advised her to
send the content-certified mail.

327
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,228
Let's talk about the contents with me.

328
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,964
But you're not her official repres--

329
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,201
I'm not doing this as a profession.

330
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:53,206
Well, since we're in
the same neighborhood association,

331
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,308
she personally asked me to intervene.

332
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,545
Is that true?

333
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,346
You're so persistent.

334
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,452
She doesn't want to
talk to you directly anymore.

335
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,900
So, where should we start?

336
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,044
Regarding the noise,
we'll do more to keep it down.

337
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,645
And the compensation?

338
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,484
I'm sorry to say this, but
I don't think it's a reasonable amount.

339
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,553
That's not for you to decide, is it?

340
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,925
From now on,
make sure everything goes through me.

341
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,895
It was him?

342
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,430
Right.

343
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:56,069
He's not her official representative,
so we don't have to go through him.

344
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:01,341
But if Ms. Arimori herself has
no intention of talking to us directly…

345
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:05,245
You don't have any association
with the president, right?

346
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,780
I've only greeted him once.

347
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,516
We'll negotiate one more--

348
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,351
It's fine.

349
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,487
I'll pay the full amount.

350
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,359
I'm the one who made things complicated
by involving a lawyer.

351
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,130
I see.

352
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,533
If that's the case…

353
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,468
Mr. Shigeno.

354
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,435
Yes?

355
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:30,803
In truth,

356
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,642
aren't you and Ms. Arimori good friends?

357
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,547
Over there.

358
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,447
H-Hey.

359
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,216
You have a movie ticket framed.

360
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,117
Hey.

361
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:49,889
It was screened at a revival house
and it's from January this year.

362
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,028
And the same ticket…

363
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,700
<i>was also displayed in Ms. Arimori's house.</i>

364
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,338
I wondered if you two
watched the movie together.

365
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,976
I apologize if I'm wrong.

366
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,182
You're right.

367
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:24,357
Since she moved in a year ago,

368
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,228
she was
the only person in the neighborhood

369
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:32,465
<i>who shared things with me</i>
<i>and she became someone I could talk to.</i>

370
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,236
<i>She's invited me to</i>
<i>watch a movie together.</i>

371
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,772
But gradually, we kind of drifted apart

372
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,443
and I haven't seen her
for the past few months.

373
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,983
I'll pay the compensation.

374
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,385
It's okay now.

375
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,623
Excuse me.

376
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,132
May I use your bathroom?

377
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,802
Sure, it's down the hallway on your right.

378
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,271
Thank you.

379
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,874
Oh, my leg…

380
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,776
My right leg…

381
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,426
<i>I wonder if Ms. Arimori came to</i>
<i>dislike Mr. Shigeno for some reason</i>

382
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,094
and decided to sue him.

383
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,263
It's too soon to decide.

384
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:42,068
But Mr. Shigeno just seemed so sad.

385
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,938
He hired a lawyer to avoid a dispute,
but it got worse instead.

386
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,541
Okay, that's enough.
No need to think further.

387
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,611
-The client said it's fine.
-But he doesn't have to pay--

388
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,046
You two stay put.

389
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,380
Excuse me?

390
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,348
I told you, right?

391
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,816
Follow my policies.

392
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,786
Geez.

393
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:10,463
I'm sorry about the sudden invitation.
I wanted to sit and talk with you.

394
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,898
I'm happy you asked me.

395
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,000
You're drinking jasmine tea.

396
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,468
So, you don't drink alcohol?

397
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,738
I love it, but I have a check-up tomorrow.

398
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,839
What? Medical exam?

399
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,475
-Yes.
-We should cut this short.

400
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,177
-Oh, it's fine.
-You know…

401
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,647
I didn't worry about
things like that before.

402
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:31,417
But these days,
I'm afraid of finding out the results.

403
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,354
Doesn't it freak you out
just seeing the word "retest"?

404
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,889
You start imagining
the worst-case scenario.

405
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,096
It could be an ovarian cyst.

406
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,331
Let's do the tumor marker test today.

407
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,234
It does make you think about things,
doesn't it?

408
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,769
Yeah.

409
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:53,639
If I'm gone, my father will be alone.

410
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,175
It's embarrassing,
but he's sloppy with money.

411
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,011
So, I'd have to
summarize the office finances into--

412
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,248
Hang on. It's only a medical exam.
You're overthinking it.

413
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,619
-You're right.
-Yeah.

414
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,055
-Please excuse me.
-You scared me.

415
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:10,723
It's fine.

416
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,228
-Ma'am.
-Woah, hang on a sec.

417
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,131
Are you gonna keep calling me "ma'am"?

418
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,365
I'm just making sure.

419
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,400
Yes.

420
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,901
Here you go.

421
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:22,668
Thank you.

422
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,904
-This is good.
-Thank you very much.

423
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,407
Let me. Oh, well.

424
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,875
And?

425
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,177
It's about your brother.

426
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,046
Oh, no. Did he do something?

427
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,883
Like he's too insensitive
and driving you crazy?

428
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,119
It's nothing like that.

429
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:45,124
We always investigated together,
but recently, he tries to work alone.

430
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,995
Even when I ask him about it,
his answers don't seem honest.

431
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,833
You know what?
You should ask him what you want to know.

432
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,035
No one knows what he's thinking.

433
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,308
She nags a lot, so it must be tiring.
I've been there.

434
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,111
Well, I can't deny that.

435
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,483
-Oh, I've had enough.
-You sure?

436
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,085
I've become such a lightweight now.

437
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,488
It makes me feel so old.

438
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,624
I may not have much time left.

439
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,294
"Oh, come on. That's not true."

440
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,863
Can you not say things
where I'm expected to respond like that?

441
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,634
But seriously.
I've become really forgetful.

442
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,070
If Shoko hadn't come back,

443
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,273
I probably would've retired by now.

444
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,042
Come back?

445
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,278
Yeah. I got divorced
when she entered junior high school.

446
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,981
We've lived apart since then.

447
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,917
And we started living together again
three years ago.

448
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,018
I see.

449
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,755
But we still have this emotional distance,
you know?

450
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,759
She wasn't so polite towards me before.

451
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:57,630
And how's work? Are you two getting along?

452
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,734
Well, yeah. As usual.

453
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,002
-Yes.
-I see.

454
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,576
He's really staring.

455
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,146
He's looking at me, right?

456
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:16,415
Yeah, he is.

457
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:19,852
So intense.

458
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:21,921
Ooh.

459
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:32,198
TEICHI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

460
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,772
I'M COMING IN AT 11 TODAY.
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. SHOKO ISHIDA

461
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,812
Good morning.

462
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,182
Morning.

463
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,525
I'm off.

464
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,360
Where to?

465
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,397
Informing the association president know
that we're paying.

466
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,365
I'm coming with you.

467
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,433
Like I said--

468
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,436
Why are you trying to
proceed with this on your own?

469
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,607
You value efficiency. And yet, why?

470
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,445
Rather than working on your own,
shouldn't you make use of me, a paralegal?

471
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,884
I'm sorry for always butting in.

472
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,487
As the one in charge of this firm,

473
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,924
I'll continue to question your behavior
if I think it'll cause trouble.

474
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,293
And I believe my suggestions are necessary

475
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,563
in order to
examine the case from various angles.

476
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,398
But those are only

477
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,602
my personal opinions

478
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,539
and I will follow
the final decision you make.

479
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,279
So, please let me stay by your side

480
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,248
as your partner.

481
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,251
No!

482
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:02,722
You stay here.

483
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,490
Please wait. I don't understand!

484
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,659
-Stay here.
-Why won't you let me…

485
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,094
You're unwell, right?

486
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,133
For the past few days,

487
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:16,435
<i>you've been looking pale.</i>

488
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,107
<i>And you were rubbing your stomach,</i>
<i>so I wanted you to take it easy.</i>

489
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,778
Even if I tell you to rest,
you won't listen. Right?

490
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,912
That's why…

491
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:37,857
I went for a check-up this morning.

492
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,860
They think it's a benign tumor.

493
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,196
If I get treated, there's no problem.

494
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:46,565
Really?

495
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,503
I appreciate your kindness.

496
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,683
You've changed a little.

497
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:08,487
Huh? Oh, you mean my hair and my clothes?

498
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,324
I just thought this was more comfortable.

499
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,664
Yes. I think it's nice.

500
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,773
So, can I come with you?

501
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,211
Sure.

502
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:36,015
Aren't you going to
reject the compensation?

503
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:36,916
Yeah, I--

504
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,952
I think we should continue to negotiate.

505
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,555
500,000 yen for that case
is just unreasonable.

506
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:47,526
Going to court is an option, but there's
the neighborhood relationship issue.

507
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,029
Above all,
it'll take up a lot of money and time.

508
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,665
So it may not be
the best option for Mr. Shigeno.

509
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,234
For this case,
I think the cause of the dispute--

510
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,569
Stop, stop.

511
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,305
Now that you're well, you're a pain.

512
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,878
Fine.

513
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:14,118
Thank you very much.

514
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:15,419
Thank you.

515
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:17,821
Mr. Ao Oba, please enter.

516
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:18,722
Yes.

517
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:22,760
FINAL INTERVIEW VENUE

518
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,194
Hello.

519
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,095
Please come in.

520
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,732
Mr. Mikogami is here.

521
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,286
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

522
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:53,290
Yes?

523
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,628
We're sorry to come to you directly.

524
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,297
Could we talk to you one more time?

525
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,833
We were wondering

526
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,303
if that content-certified mail
is what you really wished for.

527
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,907
<i>When I met the president,</i>

528
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:13,343
I let it slip that
I had been warned by a lawyer.

529
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,145
And then,

530
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,417
he told me
he'll take action to restrain you.

531
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,087
Is that why the piano issue came up?

532
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:30,828
I told him I overheard the piano once.
And it turned into a big deal.

533
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,930
The compensation was also his idea?

534
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:36,733
I left everything to him,
so I didn't know about it.

535
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:42,306
I feel terrible towards Mr. Shigeno.

536
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:47,277
Then, that content-certified mail…

537
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:50,214
Oh, please let me withdraw it.

538
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:53,750
I'll speak to the president myself.

539
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:59,089
Then, can I get your signature
for confirmation? Just in case.

540
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,090
Sure.

541
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,194
Let's see.

542
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:10,200
You must've been surprised too.
For us to suddenly show up like that.

543
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:17,107
Actually,
didn't you want him to tell you directly

544
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,042
instead of hiring a lawyer?

545
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:21,311
Yes.

546
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:25,449
Mr. Shigeno said that
you two have been to the movies together.

547
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,623
At one point,
we used to see each other often.

548
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:38,996
But if I think about it,
he's never asked me out.

549
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,665
I guess it was my one-sided love.

550
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,533
-Huh?
-What?

551
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,169
You're the one with feelings for…

552
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,071
Your surprise is rude to Mr. Shigeno.

553
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,940
But you were surprised too.

554
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:52,943
Sorry.

555
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,980
Everyone asked me
why I decided to move here.

556
00:31:57,047 --> 00:32:01,919
But he never asked me anything.

557
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:03,720
Right.

558
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:08,692
That kind of silent kindness
just felt comfortable.

559
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,094
Were you two dating?

560
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:12,763
No, it wasn't like that.

561
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:19,069
Though, he's mentioned that
he wants to celebrate my birthday with me.

562
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,337
Wow.

563
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,640
But about three months ago,

564
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:25,709
all of a sudden,

565
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,846
he said he wants to cancel our meeting.

566
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:32,983
And that
we shouldn't see each other anymore.

567
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,118
That was it.

568
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:38,488
Do you have any idea why?

569
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,827
None at all.

570
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:52,836
-Huh?
-Oh.

571
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,706
Hello.

572
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:56,740
Welcome back.

573
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,209
What's wrong?

574
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,180
Oh, I wanted to speak to Ishiko.

575
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:04,047
Huh?

576
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:09,753
Oh, right. See ya, then.

577
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,088
I'll get my bike and go home.

578
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:13,924
-Um…
-See you tomorrow.

579
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:15,792
See you.

580
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:19,229
And?

581
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:23,066
Today's interview went well.

582
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:26,303
Oh, that's great!

583
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,071
Yes. And…

584
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,273
And…

585
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,178
And when I get the job,

586
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,448
I'm going to ask you out.

587
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,183
What?

588
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:44,654
I won't now because we work together
and that'll be against the rules.

589
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,593
Um, how should I put it…

590
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:52,763
So, this is like a confession
about a confession?

591
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:53,730
Oh…

592
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:58,068
I guess so.

593
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,403
You guess so.

594
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:00,404
See you tomorrow!

595
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,671
Wha…

596
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:11,148
KURUGA TOWN
KONJAC SHORTBREAD

597
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,689
Shortbread?

598
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,391
Thank you.

599
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,765
Here.

600
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:30,067
Thank you.

601
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,741
I wonder why
Mr. Shigeno stopped seeing her.

602
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,646
Doesn't matter now, does it?
The case is closed.

603
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,681
Do we need to be hired to help?

604
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:48,852
Mr. Shigeno definitely has feelings
for Ms. Arimori, don't you think?

605
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,923
If they like each other,
shouldn't we do something?

606
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,862
I think I passed the interview.

607
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:03,767
So, I think this will be the last case
I'll be working on.

608
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,503
I want to be of help to the client.

609
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:09,873
Didn't you just jinx it?

610
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:11,341
What?

611
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,543
It won't be funny if you fail.

612
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,378
I'll be fine.

613
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:18,515
So?

614
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:24,821
Since we've already been paid, it's not
against my rules to serve the client.

615
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:25,822
You heard her.

616
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,327
Now, let's find out
why they stopped seeing each other.

617
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,828
While we drink some tea.

618
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:33,430
Thank you.

619
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:42,606
You did?

620
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:43,507
Huh?

621
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,743
You touched your nose. Was that the sign?

622
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,844
Sign?

623
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:51,648
You know, if you ask Ishiko…

624
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,783
Oh, it was just itchy.

625
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,018
No need to hide it!

626
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:55,919
I'm not.

627
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,120
Fine, if you say so.

628
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,688
-Seriously, I haven't!
-What?

629
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,957
But I guess you're not completely wrong.

630
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:04,094
What does that mean?! Which is it? Which?

631
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,595
-Well…
-Tell me.

632
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:06,930
What's this about?

633
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:10,133
You said, "Which?"

634
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:15,672
We were wondering which is faster,
the semi-express train or the rapid train.

635
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,773
Why that topic now?

636
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,908
Thanks for the tea.

637
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,276
Thank you very much.

638
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,547
Hey!

639
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,016
You got some on me.

640
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:27,717
-This is…
-Isn't it too bitter?

641
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:31,388
This is the green tea my dad bought.
It has high catechin content.

642
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:34,457
It tastes healthy, but it has a kick.

643
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,734
Something wrong?

644
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,339
Was that nutrient content?

645
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,476
<i>May I use your bathroom?</i>

646
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,445
<i>My leg. My right leg.</i>

647
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,758
One banana, 468.

648
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,561
A pack of natto, 330.

649
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,164
Pork fillet, 492.

650
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,668
<i>Half an avocado, 648.</i>

651
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:22,105
<i>Two taros, 768.</i>

652
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,941
Potato was…

653
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,544
574.

654
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:30,947
Pumpkin, 630.

655
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:33,717
Hello.

656
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:37,854
Excuse us for coming. You weren't at home.

657
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:41,057
Oh, it's already time for our appointment.
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:44,928
Um, before we submit the report,

659
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:46,963
may I ask you one question?

660
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:51,868
Please forgive me for
stepping into your personal life.

661
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,571
If it's uncalled for,
we'll leave immediately.

662
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,605
What is it?

663
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:01,211
Mr. Shigeno, are you ill?

664
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:07,083
There was a vegetable chart
on your refrigerator.

665
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,787
That's for potassium content, isn't it?

666
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:15,125
And on your calendar,
the word "Tsuru" was written

667
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,660
<i>three times a week.</i>

668
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,895
Could that be about

669
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,766
Tsuruyama Hospital?

670
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,502
So, we thought maybe…

671
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,937
Well. Actually, I uh…

672
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:32,275
I'm on dialysis for
chronic kidney disease.

673
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:36,146
That's why
I'm watching my potassium intake.

674
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,583
And the reason you stopped seeing
Ms. Arimori is also…

675
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,355
Yeah.
Because I'll just be causing her trouble.

676
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:51,361
Even if

677
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:53,763
by chance

678
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,566
we became close,

679
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,636
I don't have long to live.

680
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:04,874
If I think about the procedures
after my death and what she has to bear,

681
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:07,777
it's better to be alone…

682
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:12,048
If you'd like,
there are things we can help you with.

683
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:18,154
We can assist in making a will
and disposing of unwanted items

684
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:21,291
to determine the division of property

685
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,427
while you're healthy
and able to make accurate decisions.

686
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,331
We may not be able to erase your worries,

687
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:31,034
but we could help you reduce it.

688
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,038
Right.

689
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,473
Then, you and Ms. Arimori--

690
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:38,074
But you know…

691
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:43,213
It's embarrassing
for the elderly to fall in love.

692
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,920
You should tell the person you love
how you feel.

693
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,657
Age doesn't matter.

694
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:01,564
I also want you to enjoy your life
no matter how old you become.

695
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:05,301
Young people are often told
to have dreams for the future.

696
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:10,140
But the elderly people
are the young people's future itself.

697
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:18,948
I think it's the elderly's duty
to enjoy their life.

698
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:21,985
Or something.

699
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,120
Well, but…

700
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:29,359
Come to think of it,
today, September 8th is

701
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:31,995
Ms. Arimori's birthday. Isn't it?

702
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:37,600
There was a schedule
written on the calendar at your house too.

703
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:41,538
If that has to do with her birthday,

704
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:47,177
Ms. Arimori said
she has no plans for today yet.

705
00:40:58,154 --> 00:40:59,556
I'd like your help

706
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:02,091
with the arrangements of my estate.

707
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:06,262
Sure.

708
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:21,277
Yes?

709
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,552
I wonder what he wrote on his calendar.

710
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,421
Yeah, we couldn't ask.

711
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:37,527
Apparently, he made a reservation
at Vivace, a restaurant with a piano.

712
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:38,495
What?

713
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:42,932
He told me earlier.

714
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,134
Hang on a sec. He's gonna play the piano?

715
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:48,271
I heard that Ms. Arimori likes this scene

716
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:53,142
from <i>Casablanca</i>, where the character asks
the pianist to play "As Time Goes By."

717
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,312
That's why he was practicing.

718
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,851
I received the email.

719
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,520
From that interview.

720
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:05,989
-Ooh!
-Can I open it?

721
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:08,124
-Of course. Open it.
-Right.

722
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,193
Here goes.

723
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:16,399
You got this.

724
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:20,203
I got the job!

725
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:26,009
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

726
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:27,210
It's a new beginning.

727
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,177
Yes.

728
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,691
INCREASE IN NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO DOES DEATH CLEANING

729
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:45,361
MANY PEOPLE ARRANGE
THEIR END OF LIFE PLANNING

730
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,044
<i>This is from my uncle.</i>

731
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:36,613
Thank you.

732
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:40,650
I see you in a whole new light, Haneo.

733
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:43,886
I wouldn't mind leaving Shoko

734
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:46,522
in your care.

735
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,191
Huh?

736
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:50,526
She's a nice girl.

737
00:43:50,593 --> 00:43:53,930
So I was looking out to make sure
she doesn't end up with a weirdo.

738
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:56,633
But,

739
00:43:58,635 --> 00:43:59,702
if it's you…

740
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:04,340
Um, could you stop
with your wild imagination?

741
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:06,409
She's just a partner to me.

742
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:08,444
He's not listening.

743
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:18,354
<i>Can I talk to you after work tomorrow?</i>

744
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:27,864
Ouch.

745
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:30,600
Good evening.

746
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:37,907
I'm sorry, you must be tired.

747
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:38,808
No, I'm fine.

748
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,447
Nakamaru, the company that hired me

749
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:47,517
is a company
that mainly sells office supplies.

750
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:51,721
It's a completely different type of job,
but I was attracted to their energy.

751
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:54,924
Sounds like a job interview.

752
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,771
I will ask you out as I declared.

753
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,441
Please go out with me.

754
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:22,719
"It's a haunted apartment."

755
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:25,121
If I had known, I wouldn't have rented it.

756
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,224
You had the obligation to notify
that someone had died--

757
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,195
Why don't you tell the court it's a breach
of contract because it's haunted?

758
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:33,996
<i>There could be a miracle comeback.</i>

759
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:34,964
