1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,442
I recommend this bargained property.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,113
The reason for the price
isn't because someone died here, right?

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,347
Right.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,384
If you're keeping that information,
I'll sue you.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,355
-I want hamburg steak for dinner.
-Sure.

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,724
-Okay, I'll see you later.
-See you.

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,693
Bye.

8
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,512
I will ask you out as I declared.

9
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,382
Please go out with me.

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,923
Good morning.

11
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:57,892
Good morning.

12
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,362
We need the documents
for provisional disposition, right?

13
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,297
Yes.

14
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,500
Thank you.

15
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,435
Sure.

16
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:09,970
This is it.

17
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,709
-Oba, good morning.
-Good morning.

18
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,447
Oh yeah. You're leaving us soon.

19
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,415
Any requests for your farewell party?

20
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,885
-Then your special no water curry.
-Okay!

21
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:25,886
Without Brazilian enzymes.

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,558
Yeah.
I had a feeling that was ruining the dish.

23
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,062
Come in.

25
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:36,964
Who's that?

26
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,571
-Ishiko, get ready to go out.
-What?

27
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,575
I got a request through a DM
on my Twitter account.

28
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,243
You can come if you want.

29
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,681
You may tag along.

30
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,550
You want me to come, right?

31
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,887
No. I never said that.
You always come anyway.

32
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,590
Yeah, sure. I'll come.

33
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:07,061
A request via DM? What an era we live in.

34
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,897
-My competence must be--
-We're off!

35
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,800
-Please continue with the cleaning up.
-See you.

36
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,602
-Come on. Let's go.
-Bye.

37
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,872
-Follow me.
-Don't boss me around.

38
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,609
They're starting to act like partners.

39
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,944
Oh. I meant…

40
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,481
-Nothing romantic.
-Oh, I'm not…

41
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,016
Right.

42
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,253
<i>Now, let me confirm.</i>

43
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,556
Mr. Takuma Takanashi.
You and your wife Fumika,

44
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,659
moved into this rental apartment
a month ago

45
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,929
along with your
one-and-a-half-year-old twin sons.

46
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,565
You've been busy working at

47
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,102
an accounting app company
that you launched with your friends,

48
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,972
while Fumika had to
take care of two children by herself

49
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,508
and she's shown signs of
childcare neurosis.

50
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,046
And two weeks ago,
you received a letter in your mailbox.

51
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,283
After reading that,
Fumika has become depressed.

52
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,620
She's even started to hallucinate
and hear things since four days ago.

53
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,557
Excuse me.

54
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,163
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Sorry.

55
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,732
Here. Come on.

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,208
If I had known what kind of room this was,
I wouldn't have rented it.

57
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,980
Excuse me. What do you mean by
hallucinations and hearing things?

58
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,717
Like she hears someone talking,
or feels like someone is there.

59
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,754
She went to a clinic,
but nothing seems to work.

60
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,658
She's sleep-deprived from
the babies crying and hearing things.

61
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,694
So she often sleeps during the day.

62
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,632
Ms. Ishiko.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,834
Read it.

64
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:55,669
Okay.

65
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:01,242
"Did you know that an elderly died
a solitary death in room 506?"

66
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,878
"The person who lived there after that
also left after two months."

67
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,482
"It's a haunted apartment."

68
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,087
"I suggest you leave
before disaster strikes."

69
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,790
Um, this was in the mailbox
at the entrance?

70
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,626
Yes.

71
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:25,666
Well, it's hard to precisely call this
a threat at this point.

72
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,702
It'll be difficult for the police
to make a case with this.

73
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,471
That's why I need your help.

74
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:34,041
I want the real estate agent in charge
to take responsibility for

75
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,477
hiding the fact that
someone had died here.

76
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,879
Then,
we'll claim the moving expenses and--

77
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,848
And I want to nullify the contract.

78
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,919
In exchange for no key money
and cheaper pricing,

79
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,556
it will result in a penalty fee
if we move out within two years.

80
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,126
840,000 yen for six months' worth of rent?

81
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,695
I can't afford that.

82
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,697
Alright.

83
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,266
Please leave it to me.

84
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,404
-Then, may I explain the fee--
-By the way, um…

85
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,108
You said you saw my Twitter.
Does that mean you're interested in me?

86
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,844
Um, it was more like,

87
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,482
the lawyer who we've been consulting
when we started our business retired.

88
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,219
And when I was looking for someone new,
I saw your Twitter.

89
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,656
You posted that
you used to work at a major law firm.

90
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,658
So, I thought I could depend on you.

91
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,727
I see. Right.

92
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,662
You have a good eye.

93
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,365
You're being loud.

94
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,270
MIZU HOME

95
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,440
Therefore, we believe
you had the obligation to notify

96
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,343
that someone had died
three years ago in room 506,

97
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,311
which is owned by this agency.

98
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,613
-But--
-It's alright. I'll take over.

99
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,484
I'm Muguruma, the CEO.

100
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,624
Generally, I don't think
it's necessary to notify in case of

101
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,561
solitary death of an elderly
or accidental deaths.

102
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,797
Generally speaking, yes.

103
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,666
However, in this case,

104
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,070
the resident's death was confirmed when
other residents noticed a strange odor

105
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,839
a few days after the death.

106
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,508
It must've been subject to
special cleaning.

107
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:18,278
Under Article 47-1 of
the Real Estate Brokerage Act--

108
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,781
But we rented it to the next resident

109
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,684
after properly notifying them
about the death.

110
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,487
Why did that person move out
after two months?

111
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,088
I'm told it was work-related.

112
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,926
Either way, the lease agreement
between your agency and Mr. Takanashi

113
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,296
stipulates the landlord's liability
for non-conformity to the contract.

114
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:40,401
Property defects include psychological
defects, which makes people hesitant to--

115
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,070
Not only did someone live there
after the death,

116
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,474
we've renovated and renewed the property
before renting it to Mr. Takanashi.

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,610
What more do you expect us to do?

118
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,212
Ghosts just aren't convincing enough

119
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,548
for it to be called
a psychological defect.

120
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,349
But--

121
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,583
If you're dissatisfied,

122
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:02,322
why don't you tell the court it's a breach
of contract because it's haunted?

123
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,097
She's the type I'm not good with.

124
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,467
Even if we did go to court,
if she continues to act defiant,

125
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,736
it'll take a long time to settle the case.

126
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,005
Then, the Takanashi family
can't move anywhere.

127
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:18,906
Yeah.

128
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,408
We want to help but we can't go to court.

129
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,410
It's common for lawyers.

130
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:31,251
Shall we change our target?

131
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,155
-Find the person who sent that letter…
-And claim compensation.

132
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,858
Sounds good. Alright!

133
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,560
You're very motivated.

134
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,996
Depending on the result, he may ask us
to be their corporate counsel.

135
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,131
You think so?

136
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,066
That'll be huge.

137
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:46,934
That's true.

138
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,313
As the manager of the apartment,

139
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,749
I thought it'd be bad
if a strange rumor spread.

140
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,686
So, I gathered
the management association here.

141
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,887
He's my lawyer.

142
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,889
I'm Haneoka.

143
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,824
I'm Ishida, a paralegal.

144
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,026
I'll ask you all directly.

145
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:17,097
Do any of you know
who may have sent this letter?

146
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,100
It was dropped off in the mailbox
on August 29th.

147
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:28,475
Then, did you all know that there was
a solitary death in room 506?

148
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,515
Are there rumors about ghosts?

149
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,783
Within the apartment, yes.

150
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,855
Maybe that rumor spread because
the last resident moved out quickly.

151
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,158
Did he move out because of ghosts?

152
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,127
We never really talked.

153
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,197
We live next door,
but I don't even remember his face.

154
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,734
-Can we have his contact--
-Not that.

155
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,102
I thought so.

156
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,574
If the real estate agency won't agree,
then I guess…

157
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,677
No, we'll continue to
investigate both cases.

158
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,578
Yes.

159
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,180
I'm sorry. Thank you.

160
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,183
You all seemed very close.

161
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,219
Do you interact with them?

162
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,322
Our kids are around the same age,
so we go to the park together.

163
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,892
My wife was happy
that it's a nice place to raise children.

164
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,727
But I didn't expect this.

165
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,903
Fumika, he's crying. Can you check on him?

166
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,438
Fumika?

167
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,110
I'm sorry. Can we discuss
our strategy later over the phone?

168
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,080
When one cries, it wakes the other one.

169
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,152
He seems to be having a hard time.

170
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,987
Let's help him somehow.

171
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,489
For the sake of corporate counsel, too.

172
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,490
Don't!

173
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,860
As long as we're getting paid,
all clients are equal.

174
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,729
-You--
-Let's go.

175
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,433
You <i>do</i> know
you're not wearing a watch, right?

176
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,602
Could you stop noticing stuff like that?

177
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,273
Now Oba, would you like to say a word?

178
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,641
Sure.

179
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,613
The past three months were so fulfilling
and it went by so fast.

180
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,883
At my previous job,
everyone called me slow and inefficient.

181
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,254
But you all say that my work is meticulous
and that made me happy.

182
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,825
-Thank you very much!
-Nice.

183
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,360
-Good job.
-Great job.

184
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,694
-Oh!
-Ahh!

185
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,030
-Please eat this.
-Eat what?

186
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,033
-It's eggplant <i>nukazuke</i>.
-Eggplant?

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,003
Yes, it's a local specialty
of Senshu region in Osaka.

188
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,906
It's more juicy and has less bitterness
compared to normal eggplants.

189
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,975
We don't need
the description of the eggplant.

190
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,911
-Huh?
-So, what about it?

191
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,882
My mom is from Senshu
and when I went to see her last week…

192
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,286
That may have sounded like a pun,
but it wasn't meant to be.

193
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,856
-We know. You're being paranoid.
-We get it.

194
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,425
It's a thank-you gift
from my mom to everyone.

195
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,260
-It's huge.
-You don't want it?

196
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,295
-Of course we do.
-We want it.

197
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,965
-We should eat it together.
-Yes.

198
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,434
Thank you.
Please send our gratitude to her.

199
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,103
Sure. There's loads in here.
What should I do?

200
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,639
-Shoko, we have food containers, right?
-Yes.

201
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,674
Let's share it now.

202
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,776
-Okay.
-We'll share it.

203
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,678
-Thank you.
-Okay, thanks.

204
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,413
Now, let me do it.

205
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,551
It was an unrequited love, huh?

206
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,452
-Huh?

207
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,321
I knew that you liked Shoko.

208
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,693
Well, I'm sure you'll meet someone
in your new workplace.

209
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,061
Good luck.

210
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,830
Uh, right…

211
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,670
That's a fat eggplant.

212
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,340
I'll start drinking.

213
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,079
That's a lot.

214
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,585
Huh?

215
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,124
What?

216
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,260
Is your nose that itchy?

217
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,429
What? It's just…

218
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,330
Huh?

219
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,339
You did? You did it?

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,408
-So, it's this?
-Yes.

221
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,078
Argh! Now my nose is starting to itch.

222
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,647
What is it?

223
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,416
I see.

224
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,086
Yes. I asked her out.

225
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,258
I really appreciate it.

226
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,097
But can I think about it
for a little while?

227
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,336
I told her that she doesn't need to rush.

228
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,975
You were talking to her normally
for someone who asked her out.

229
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,845
I thought she'd feel awkward if I don't.

230
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,514
So, I did my best.

231
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,084
If that's the case, you did a good job.

232
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:35,115
The manager called and said
we can check the security camera footage.

233
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,284
Thank goodness.

234
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,219
-We should go today.
-Yes.

235
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,722
Go ahead.

236
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,890
Excuse me.

237
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:44,825
Sure.

238
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:49,996
Hello.

239
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll make it in the afternoon.

240
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,969
Yes. Bye.

241
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,805
You seem very busy.

242
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,574
Well, yeah.

243
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,810
Have you taken your childcare leave?

244
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,912
No.

245
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,583
<i>It hasn't been that long since</i>
<i>my friends and I launched our company.</i>

246
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,152
<i>It's a small company</i>
<i>with only seven people.</i>

247
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,754
The administration staff is
on maternity leave,

248
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,524
so it doesn't feel right
for me to take mine as well.

249
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,060
But it's your legitimate right.

250
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,796
The law may be so,

251
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,498
but we can't live on ideals alone.

252
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:32,639
If the sales decrease due to my leave,
we may not be able to pay our employees.

253
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,844
So, your wife takes care of the children
by herself?

254
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,513
Yes.

255
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,317
Originally, we were planning to
leave our kids at daycare

256
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,219
<i>so she could go back to work.</i>

257
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,455
<i>But there's a long waiting list.</i>

258
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,625
<i>So she's raising our two sons</i>
<i>the best she can</i>

259
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,793
<i>while waiting for a spot to open.</i>

260
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:55,862
As I thought.

261
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,266
-You're daycare hunting.
-Daycare hunting?

262
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,602
An activity to enroll your children
into a licensed daycare center.

263
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,938
Lots of children are on the waiting list.

264
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,909
I found out after some research that
there are points for daycare hunting.

265
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:09,876
What's that?

266
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,611
It's an evaluation criteria,

267
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:15,348
where they assess if a family
truly needs to use the daycare center.

268
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,551
Such as, if both parents are working
full time,

269
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,854
or they don't have any relatives nearby.

270
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:25,025
It seems higher points are given to those
who need more help from daycare centers.

271
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,862
You get more points
if you've used a private daycare center,

272
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:34,601
so there are people who do that as a part
of their strategy to build a history.

273
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,736
Wow, that sounds tough.

274
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,838
And I wanted to be of help,

275
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:43,243
so I've compiled some subsidy programs
where you can hire babysitters.

276
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,079
Here.

277
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,081
-This is great.
-Good.

278
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,951
Again…

279
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,756
Hello.

280
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,125
Not bad.

281
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,460
-Obviously.
-That's right.

282
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,629
Yes.

283
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,165
Is Fumika alright?

284
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,120
My wife and sons are fine.

285
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,688
Oh, good.

286
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,959
But she'll be hospitalized for a few days
due to severe fatigue.

287
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,796
But I guess you're lucky
it was only a minor fire.

288
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,234
I can't believe she dozed off
while heating the pot.

289
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,574
I wanted to help my wife,

290
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,744
but I may have ended up making her suffer.

291
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,852
I'll give up.

292
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,688
The apartment manager told me

293
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,592
not to make a big deal
about the ghost rumor

294
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,261
because it could
affect the property value.

295
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,633
There's no reason
for you two to be blamed.

296
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,971
She's right. We'll make sure to
find the person who sent that letter.

297
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,181
Will you be taking care of the boys
for the time being?

298
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,086
I guess so.
Since my parents live far away.

299
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,993
I'll try and find a babysitter.

300
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,351
-So, how are things?
-Welcome.

301
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,486
What things?

302
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,456
You know, your health.

303
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,295
I've been feeling better
thanks to the medication.

304
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,199
They said I'll be fine after the surgery.

305
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,167
Okay.

306
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,269
Well, don't work too hard.

307
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,371
Okay.

308
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,443
So, he asked you out?

309
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,546
-Oba told me.
-What?

310
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,382
No, no.
I've been asking him if he likes you.

311
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,384
That's why he told me.

312
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh.

313
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,724
It feels weird to pretend not to know
when I've been told about it.

314
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,027
You shouldn't say anything
and just keep it inside.

315
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,762
Keep it inside. Right. And?

316
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,898
Here you go.

317
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,868
-Your <i>karaage</i>.
-Thank you.

318
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,736
Thank you.

319
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,372
It's mountains of food wherever we go.

320
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,910
Let's eat.

321
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,182
You still haven't decided?

322
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,384
I said, don't say anything.

323
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,418
We're partners.

324
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,187
Now you call us partners.

325
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,255
But I'm curious.

326
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,357
Why do you need to think about it?

327
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,325
I'd go out with them if I liked them.

328
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,294
If not, I won't.

329
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,635
It's not that simple.

330
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,305
I'm not sure
if my feelings for him are strong enough.

331
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:33,907
Meaning?

332
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,710
<i>There are many things I like about him.</i>

333
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:39,779
But…

334
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,816
I don't know
if I should be going out with him

335
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:49,589
when I'm not sure if I like him
100 percent.

336
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,091
I think it's against my rules.

337
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,961
You really are hard-headed.

338
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:55,862
Plus,

339
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:00,033
the firm is not doing well
and I should be focusing on work.

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,469
So, I doubt
having a love life is a good idea.

341
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,080
Huh? Is there only one camera
at the entrance?

342
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,014
Yes.

343
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,650
I thought there were two security cameras.

344
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,953
<i>Oh, one of them is fake.</i>

345
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,421
<i>Do the residents know that?</i>

346
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,522
Yes, I've told them.

347
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,457
Please let me know when you're done.

348
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,693
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you very much.

349
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,067
On the day the letter was sent,

350
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,104
this is the only person who put something
in the Takanashi family's mailbox.

351
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,007
We can't even tell
if it's a man or a woman.

352
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,842
Unspecific clothing.

353
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,944
But…

354
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,185
This person entered at an angle
as if he or she knew the location

355
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,288
<i>of the security camera</i>
<i>and left without showing their face.</i>

356
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:59,425
Normally,
if you're trying to avoid two cameras,

357
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,861
you wouldn't walk in at this angle.

358
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:06,299
This person knew that this camera is fake.

359
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:12,071
Meaning, this person is most likely,
a resident of this apartment.

360
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,640
This is Ninzaburo Haneoka.

361
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,142
What do you think?

362
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:17,944
Sure.

363
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,948
We should check
if anyone was behaving differently

364
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:26,252
from their usual routine during the week
before and after the posting.

365
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,654
Do we need to go that far?

366
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,622
You never know what could be a clue.

367
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,325
If we check
all the security cameras in the building,

368
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,661
we can find out which room they live in.

369
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,329
Let's ask the manager--

370
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,564
Okay. I'll leave that to you then.

371
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,732
What?

372
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,001
-I've other things to do.
-You're just lazy.

373
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,336
Nope.

374
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,438
-You're not going anywhere.
-Hey…

375
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,010
Oh!

376
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,146
I'm not falling for that. I'm not a child.

377
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,715
Come on. A grown man
is trying to get away like this.

378
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,351
You said, "get away." Hey!

379
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,736
Yes?

380
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,538
Hello.

381
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,278
Haneo called me to ask if I could help.

382
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,914
Um…

383
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,483
We won't be able to pay you.

384
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,451
That's fine.

385
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,020
Haneo said he'll treat me to a meal.

386
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,488
Are you sure?

387
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,357
Yes. I'm off work already.

388
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,292
Thank you.

389
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,138
Here.

390
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,411
Doesn't it bring back memories?
Our high school cafeteria.

391
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,513
Oh! The vending machine.

392
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,982
Yes, it was always sold out.

393
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:03,983
You're right.

394
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,185
I bought it the moment I saw this.

395
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,422
I appreciate it.

396
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,760
Alright. Shall we start?

397
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,627
Yes.

398
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:18,398
Let's start from August 28th.
The elevator hall footage…

399
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:33,813
Oh. So you <i>are</i> actually doing something.

400
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,582
What did you think? Of course I'm working.

401
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,483
And you?

402
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:40,787
Huh?

403
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,556
On the day we interviewed the residents,

404
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:48,694
Mrs. Tani who lives in room 105
followed us after we left the entrance.

405
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,595
Right.

406
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:54,333
But she seemed to have changed her mind
and the footage showed her going back.

407
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,705
I got curious about her behavior,
so I went to talk to her.

408
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,576
<i>She said she saw a suspicious person</i>
<i>on August 29th</i>

409
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,612
<i>and she thought about testifying,</i>
<i>but she felt awkward</i>

410
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,549
<i>because it felt like</i>
<i>she'd be betraying the residents.</i>

411
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,350
And? Did you get her testimony?

412
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,319
Come on, did you?

413
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,088
Please tell me if you did or not.

414
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,757
Enough with the faces!

415
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,494
I'll be off.

416
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,495
Okay.

417
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,430
Thank you for your help.

418
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,331
See you later.

419
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,528
Mrs. Kumakiri.

420
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,967
May we speak with you?

421
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,908
We think that you're the one
who wrote this mysterious letter.

422
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,844
The day this letter was posted,

423
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:17,581
someone saw you rushing out
of the apartment in a hoodie and trousers,

424
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:19,850
which is not the way you usually dress.

425
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:20,918
It wasn't me.

426
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:24,355
If Article 222 of the Penal Code
"Intimidation" was committed,

427
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:29,226
you may be imprisoned for up to two years
or be fined up to 300,000 yen.

428
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,696
This is an old precedent from 1960.

429
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:36,867
A person who sent a letter stating,
"My condolences for the fire. Be careful."

430
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:42,473
to someone they were arguing with
was actually arrested for intimidation.

431
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,809
This letter may not be as direct,
but it's enough to--

432
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:47,545
Now, now, Mr. Haneoka.

433
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:51,015
If she tells us the truth,
we'll settle this peacefully. Right?

434
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,451
Well, I guess we could.

435
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,763
Was it for daycare hunting?

436
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:12,136
You were at the childcare support division
at the ward office just now.

437
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,275
I heard that
you haven't been able to go back to work

438
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,845
because there are no spots available
at licensed daycares.

439
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,216
From what I've seen
in the security camera footage,

440
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,987
your husband goes to work early morning
and comes home around midnight.

441
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:32,323
He seems to have no weekends off.

442
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:38,162
You are practically raising your child
on your own.

443
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:40,364
-So, to enroll your child--
-I'm sorry.

444
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,238
Even if we wanted to enroll in
a private daycare center like Mrs. Tani's,

445
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,342
we can't afford to pay 80,000 yen a month.

446
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,212
Licensed ones are our only option,
but there are no spots.

447
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,916
While all this daycare hunting,
the Takanashi family moved in.

448
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,318
They get more points than me

449
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,422
because I only have one child
and they have twins.

450
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:09,460
So, I just…

451
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,933
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

452
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,736
I'll pay the compensation with all I have.

453
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,170
Please raise your head.

454
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,607
Forget the compensation.

455
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,314
I am mad,
but I also understand the struggle.

456
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,783
Besides, my wife told me.

457
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:39,156
When she was shopping at the supermarket,
the twins started crying.

458
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,459
And when she was at a loss,

459
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,563
Mrs. Kumakiri came up and said,
"Are you alright? I'll carry your stuff."

460
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,399
I heard you helped her.

461
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:53,971
When she was overwhelmed
with raising children

462
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,175
and nothing was going as planned,
Mrs. Kumakiri's words saved her.

463
00:27:58,242 --> 00:27:59,977
She said that repeatedly.

464
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,881
I'm sure my wife feels the same way as me.

465
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,399
Thank you for everything.

466
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:27,538
No. It's not over yet.

467
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:32,076
If you're not accepting the compensation,
let's go back to square one

468
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,045
and do something about
the real estate agency. Okay?

469
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:44,822
Mr. Takanashi is getting worn out
day by day.

470
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:47,191
I hope we can settle this soon.

471
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,929
How should we tackle this?

472
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,364
Good afternoon.

473
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,600
-Huh?
-Oh.

474
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:00,604
So this is what a law firm looks like.

475
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:01,705
Something wrong?

476
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:06,009
I found a clue to that mysterious letter,
so I thought I'd tell you.

477
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,812
Um, that's already been resolved.

478
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:09,813
Really?

479
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,050
Yes. I can't go into details,
but it won't happen again.

480
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:13,817
Who was it?

481
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,753
-No, that's…
-Gimme a clue!

482
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,020
We can't.

483
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,590
-Not even a clue?
-No.

484
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:24,194
I see. If it's been solved already,
then this is useless.

485
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:30,667
The person who lived in room 506
came to pass a circular notice board once.

486
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:34,238
And my husband remembered
that we have a recording of the intercom.

487
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:36,106
Thank you very much.

488
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,408
But it's already resolved, right?

489
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:40,511
Oh, um.

490
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,980
We'd like to use it
to check something else.

491
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:43,881
I see.

492
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,582
What do you know about him?

493
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,284
Nothing really.

494
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:51,288
Sometimes he went out in the morning
so I think he was working.

495
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:54,491
But he also seemed to be
in pachinko parlors during the day.

496
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:58,529
Could this be…

497
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,330
I was thinking the same thing.

498
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,933
There could be a miracle comeback.

499
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:06,170
But we can't find him just with his face.

500
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,810
Where did I…

501
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,087
Do you know him?

502
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:25,389
Thank you for your help.

503
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:26,757
I think he's found a clue.

504
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:29,193
Dad, konjac shortbread
for our guest please!

505
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,861
-It's okay.
-Please excuse me.

506
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,563
Oh, wait…

507
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:37,768
But maybe I should stay and have some.

508
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,974
FUJISAKI CONSTRUCTION

509
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:46,143
Wait up!

510
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:55,285
What's this place?

511
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,989
When I saw that logo on his uniform,

512
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:01,658
I remembered this car.

513
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,861
Oh.

514
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:10,300
I think his name was Kunihisa Murai.

515
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,205
Was he working here?

516
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:17,407
Yeah, only when he was broke.

517
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:20,210
He seemed diligent at heart, so--

518
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,946
President! You shouldn't be showing this!

519
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,649
We're in an era of compliance today.

520
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,685
But they're lawyers. We have to, right?

521
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,254
Not if there's no criminal case!

522
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,289
Sorry to disturb you.

523
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:33,557
Thank you very much.

524
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,626
Excuse us. Thank you.

525
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:37,060
Please excuse us.

526
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,931
You memorized it already?

527
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,505
<i>Continue swinging in a figure of eight.</i>

528
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,074
<i>Okay, get ready.</i>

529
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:52,843
<i>Lift to upper right.</i>

530
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:54,845
<i>Ready.</i>

531
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,881
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>

532
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:02,352
<i>five, six, seven, eight. One more time.</i>

533
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,988
<i>One, two, three…</i>

534
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,132
Sorry, did I wake you?

535
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,367
No.

536
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,672
Thanks for everything.

537
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,373
No worries.

538
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,945
Oh, I have bad news.

539
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,080
What?

540
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,116
The terrible twos may have started.

541
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:34,885
What?

542
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:37,688
"Let's change your diaper." "No."

543
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:39,957
"Let's take a bath." "No."

544
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:44,561
So it's started.

545
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:45,462
Oh.

546
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:50,500
I'll leave towels
and your change of clothes here.

547
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,035
Yeah. Thanks.

548
00:32:58,775 --> 00:32:59,476
You okay?

549
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:09,119
Excuse me!

550
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,223
Yes. Oh, hello.

551
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,826
They're both out of the office right now.

552
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,327
I see.

553
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:21,999
There's something I wanted to tell them
about my wife's condition.

554
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:25,969
I'm good right now.

555
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:35,312
Hello.

556
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,180
Can you talk now?

557
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,985
-Yes.
-<i>Mr. Takanashi came by just now.</i>

558
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:45,756
Apparently,
his wife gets sick due to smells from

559
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:47,657
<i>air fresheners and fabric softeners.</i>

560
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:49,326
Right.

561
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:52,629
<i>And I had this feeling that</i>
<i>maybe his wife--</i>

562
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,331
Sorry, I'll call you back.

563
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,203
Okay.

564
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:04,408
You're Mr. Murai. Yes?

565
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:10,414
We've met Mr. Kunihisa Murai,

566
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,083
who used to live in room 506
of that apartment.

567
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:17,487
He has testified that
he's received money from this agency

568
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,323
and lived in that room
for a certain period of time.

569
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,593
That is what is called room laundering.

570
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:28,532
You pay someone to lease a property
subject to notification obligation,

571
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:30,200
in order to clear that obligation.

572
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:33,103
We only leased it because he asked us to.

573
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,040
Your actions are a breach of duty
of disclosure against Mr. Takanashi

574
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:40,477
and also possibly fraud
since you intentionally covered up

575
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:43,580
the defect of a property
and still rented it out.

576
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,416
We intend to pursue that point thoroughly.

577
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,285
That's not all.

578
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:51,254
This is the result of
Mrs. Fumika Takanashi's allergy test

579
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,424
and the indoor air environment
measurement results of room 506.

580
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:59,563
We had also carelessly assumed that
her parenting neurosis had gotten worse.

581
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:03,900
But it became clear that the problem
was with that room and not her.

582
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,570
That's how we cut our way in.

583
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:10,073
After testing the air in room 506,
we found out that

584
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,944
the indoor concentration of formaldehyde
far exceeds the Ministry of Health's…

585
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,078
…guideline values.

586
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:20,650
Furthermore, Mrs. Fumika
was diagnosed with sick building syndrome.

587
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:25,455
Meaning, her poor physical condition

588
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:29,059
and hallucinations that we thought
were brought on by sleep disorders

589
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,894
was actually caused by this.

590
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:35,031
The renovation you did before
the Takanashi family moved in was a breach

591
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:38,602
of the sick building countermeasure
under the Building Standard Law.

592
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:40,770
This is clear from the inspection results.

593
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,539
Her symptoms are very severe.

594
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:45,242
She's developed chemical sensitivity.
She can't use…

595
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,543
-…fabric softeners…
-…perfume…

596
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,444
…hair sprays…

597
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,613
…and products that contain fragrances…

598
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,014
…restricting her daily life.

599
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,483
You can't get away with it…

600
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,185
…after causing so much damage.

601
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:56,920
Um--

602
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:59,189
From 2005,
there's a precedent where the court

603
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,058
canceled the sales contract
and fined a compensation

604
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,995
to an apartment seller
for liability for non-conformity

605
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:08,832
because the formaldehyde in the building
exceeded the government guidelines.

606
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,434
-The damage in our case--
-Please wait. Let's talk.

607
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,236
When she flinches, go all out.

608
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:16,806
First, we demand to cancel
the lease agreement effective immediately.

609
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:19,943
Without the penalty fee, of course.
Additionally…

610
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,079
…you will return the deposit,
key money, moving expenses,

611
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:26,316
and two years' worth of fire insurance
and rent paid in advance.

612
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:28,685
Plus, the medical fee and compensation.

613
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:32,389
We assume the fire was due to sleep
disorder caused by sick building syndrome.

614
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:35,325
Therefore, we're claiming
the repair costs for appliances

615
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:38,395
that weren't covered by insurance
and the babysitter fees.

616
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,729
That's too--

617
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:41,698
It's fine if you decide to decline.

618
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,534
But in that case,
we will file a lawsuit immediately

619
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:47,437
and file a complaint
with the supervisory authorities…

620
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,006
…that your firm has committed
a serious illegal act…

621
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:51,875
…as a real estate brokerage.

622
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,778
If that happens,
worst-case scenario, your license…

623
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,814
…will be revoked
and your firm will suffer a fatal damage.

624
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,516
I hope that's alright with you.

625
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:04,154
However, if you fulfill
the compensation for this case

626
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:08,725
and promise to ensure to practice
appropriate business from now on,

627
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,728
we won't make further demands.

628
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,602
Fine.

629
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:28,645
We were able to move to an area
with a shorter waiting list, so we got in.

630
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,213
That's great news.

631
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,883
It's all thanks to you two
for getting our money back.

632
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,752
Oh, not me. It's all him.

633
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:40,290
Yeah. This is a cool train, huh?

634
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,563
Excuse me. This type is not a train.

635
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,765
It's called a diesel railcar.

636
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:49,933
Mommy.

637
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,770
-Oh…
-I'm sorry.

638
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:56,172
We were in a railway research club.

639
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,907
Oh, right.

640
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:00,744
-Going somewhere?
-Okay, let's go over there.

641
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,848
Over there. Come on, let's go.

642
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,616
You dropped it. Hey…

643
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,587
Seems like she's back to her usual self.

644
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,793
Taking care of the kids by myself
for a few days

645
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:20,063
made me realize that
I haven't been doing enough.

646
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:26,703
Up until now, I'd bathe them
and leave the rest to my wife.

647
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,507
But drying them and applying
moisturizing cream after the bath…

648
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,643
Removing labels
when throwing away plastic bottles.

649
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,180
I thought little efforts like that
could lighten her burden

650
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,583
even if I can't get a childcare leave.

651
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,621
That's a wonderful way to think. Right?

652
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:45,755
Yes.

653
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:49,626
What you said the other day…

654
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,298
"The law may be so,
but we can't live on ideals alone."

655
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:57,934
It stuck with me.

656
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:03,573
The paternity leave system
will start this fall.

657
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:06,176
But in reality, I thought many people

658
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,645
in small companies
may not be able to use it.

659
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:13,049
As someone who practices law,
I felt frustrated.

660
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:18,088
But you made me feel that if more people
think for themselves like you do,

661
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,357
then society could change.

662
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,195
I apologize. She can be over-serious.

663
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,230
-You're creeping him out.
-Not at all.

664
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:30,166
By the way…

665
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:34,104
How about me?

666
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:37,107
What?

667
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,610
For your corporate legal counsel.

668
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:46,750
I believe I've done a good job
with this case.

669
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:50,854
Yes. I'm very grateful for that.

670
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:55,525
But we're still a small company,

671
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,394
so maybe when the time comes.

672
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:00,997
I won't take that as…

673
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,067
just lip service.

674
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,838
I'll join my kids now.

675
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:14,811
-What was that smile?
-Lip service, obviously.

676
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:16,179
Seriously?

677
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,915
You're too loud.

678
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,418
Seriously, please be quiet.

679
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:22,919
Oh.

680
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,287
Bye.

681
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,658
Corporate counsel.

682
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:43,139
Those two were senior and junior
in the same school.

683
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,942
-His wife was his senior.
-I see.

684
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,978
He told me how smitten he is with her.

685
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:52,949
He said at first,
he only saw her as a senior.

686
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,984
But the more time they spent together,

687
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:58,121
he fell harder for her
and now he can't live without her.

688
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,490
That's something.

689
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:10,533
-You know…
-Yes?

690
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,870
Some people say that

691
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:17,373
they can work harder
if their personal life is fulfilled.

692
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:22,145
You said you're worried about the firm,

693
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,949
but you can count on me for that.

694
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:31,054
Is this about Mr. Oba?

695
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:35,158
I'll bring in a request and settle it
like I did this time.

696
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,861
So, don't worry about that.

697
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,066
Okay.

698
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,509
<i>Paternity leave,</i>
<i>a system that encourages fathers</i>

699
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,311
<i>to take childcare leave,</i>
<i>will begin in October.</i>

700
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:58,815
<i>In addition to regular childcare leave,</i>
<i>it allows them to take</i>

701
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,584
<i>up to four weeks off</i>
<i>within eight weeks after childbirth.</i>

702
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:12,996
Alright.

703
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:17,534
Good evening.

704
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,434
Good evening.

705
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,174
I'm sorry to call you out here.

706
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:27,377
Oh, it's fine.

707
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:40,189
It's very humid today.

708
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:41,691
Yes.

709
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,762
Tomorrow will be sunny too.

710
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:47,997
I see.

711
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:56,472
Um…

712
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:01,878
About the confession you made to me
the other day…

713
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:04,447
Yes.

714
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:09,385
It made me happy.

715
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:14,457
I like how honest you are.

716
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:16,726
You would clean the areas people won't see

717
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,195
without being asked
and you don't claim credit for it.

718
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:23,199
Such consideration and modesty
are also lovely quality of yours.

719
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,868
And I think that
the way you beat around the bush

720
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:28,304
when you explain something
shows sincerity.

721
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:31,474
However…

722
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:36,579
I wasn't sure
if those were good enough reason for me

723
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,481
to go out with you.

724
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:46,089
But my feelings for you could build
as we spend more time together

725
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,191
and eventually become 100 percent.

726
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:52,962
I've begun to think
that might be alright too.

727
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:58,768
We may have
different views on relationships

728
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:02,305
and we'd have to talk about that
as we go along, but…

729
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:10,346
I'd love to go out with you.

730
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,518
Thank you very much.

731
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,332
-Huh?
-Oh, I'm sorry!

732
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,567
-Please forget that happened.
-Forget?

733
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:34,470
I mean, it did happen. But…

734
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:36,906
My feelings are sincere, but…

735
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:39,542
please forget it. I'll be careful.

736
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,711
Okay.

737
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,756
MY FIRST POST IN A WHILE

738
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:07,970
Woah…

739
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,539
Oh…

740
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,943
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

741
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:24,921
"Cho"?

742
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,556
One more time.

743
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:27,990
CASE 07 CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

744
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,159
Someone broke this mirror.

745
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:32,729
-Do you recognize this person?
<i>-I demand compensation!</i>

746
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:33,730
<i>700,000!</i>

747
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:36,999
<i>-Help!</i>
-I thought a lawyer could help!

748
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,735
<i>I'm upset about how things turned out.</i>

749
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,004
I'll allow myself to break my rule
just this once.

750
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:42,972
