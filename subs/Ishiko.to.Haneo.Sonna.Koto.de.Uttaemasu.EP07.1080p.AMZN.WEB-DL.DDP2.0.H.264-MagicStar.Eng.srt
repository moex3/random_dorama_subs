1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,140
You're cute.

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,041
I know.

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,075
How old are you?

4
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,110
15.

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,880
I'll give you pocket money.

6
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,349
Peep! Peep!

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,685
Violation of
Healthy Development of Youth Act!

8
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:18,586
Let's go.

9
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,787
Peep! Peep!

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,356
Woah…

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,158
Oh…

12
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,795
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

13
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,704
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>on September 10th at five a.m.,</i>

14
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,574
someone broke this mirror
and we're looking for the culprit.

15
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,510
Do you recognize this person?

16
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,444
It's a bit…

17
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,445
I don't know.

18
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,880
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,448
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,457
What language is that?

21
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,658
You don't know, do you?

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:58,826
I think he said good luck.

23
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,795
What? He seemed very angry--

24
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,897
I demand compensation! 700,000!

25
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,032
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,668
I'm sorry I took the request
without asking you.

27
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,539
But you can't refuse
if it's someone you crashed into.

28
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,873
Mr. Haneoka.

29
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:14,675
Yes?

30
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,379
Thank you for giving me a push
the other day.

31
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,146
A-A push?

32
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,050
I've decided to go out with Mr. Oba.

33
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:23,951
Oh!

34
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,821
Oh, really? Congratulations.

35
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,923
Of course, I won't let this affect my--

36
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,325
Yeah, okay. I'm not worried.

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,961
I know you always do your job perfectly.

38
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,767
YAMAMURO BUILDING

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,572
I saw this in a documentary.

40
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,874
Yamayoko kids, huh?

41
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,411
Hello there.

42
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,415
Excuse me, I'm a lawyer. Haneoka…

43
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,184
I'm a lawyer, Haneo…

44
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,456
Excuse me, do you know this person?

45
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,827
I'm a paralegal, Shoko Ishida.

46
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,797
Oh, excuse me.

47
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,900
Hello. I'm a lawyer, Hane--

48
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,368
We're busy.

49
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,837
Of course. You do seem very busy, but--

50
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,873
No thanks.

51
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,308
Please be quiet.

52
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,445
-They're younger than you.
-You want me to hear you out?

53
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:25,813
Sorry?

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,081
Want me to hear you out?

55
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,682
Yes!

56
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,518
We're looking for this person.

57
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,052
Buy me cigarettes in return.

58
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,787
-What?
-Cigarettes. Okay, sure.

59
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,189
No! Lawyer Ethics.

60
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,624
I know, but--

61
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,026
I'm sorry, but we can't give you anything.

62
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,594
Oh, come on.

63
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,105
We've been told that this person
might be the owner of this cafe.

64
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,507
Yeah. That outfit is definitely K.

65
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:54,942
Kei?

66
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:56,677
The alphabet, "K."

67
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,978
Their real name is…

68
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,847
I don't know.

69
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,050
Is it possible to meet this person?

70
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:06,520
I can't get in touch either
for almost two weeks now.

71
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,456
K tends to travel on a whim,
so maybe that's why.

72
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,995
Is it possible to give us
K's contact information?

73
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:15,996
I don't mind.

74
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,565
Thank you.

75
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,233
I doubt it'll be useful though.

76
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,241
K seems to be close with
the Yamayoko kids.

77
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,543
They all said K's like their leader.

78
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,913
Yeah. It's like charity work.

79
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,549
They come for advice
and K feeds them here.

80
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,117
Because they're all broke.

81
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,018
Have some tea.

82
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,720
Mom, he gave us tea.

83
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,690
"The young people
who hang out in the plaza

84
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,293
next to the Yamamuro Building in
Marukicho are called Yamayoko Kids."

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,162
"The majority of them are minors."

86
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:53,601
"They dress in black-based clothes,
which are called Landmine-style fashion."

87
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,237
"Some of them don't go home
for various reasons

88
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,940
and they stay in
manga cafés and hotels instead."

89
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:04,511
"Many of the girls engage in 'jobs,'
a hidden term for compensated dating,

90
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,148
to earn money for accommodation and food."

91
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,252
"This is becoming
a serious social problem."

92
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,856
And K was their savior.

93
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,893
I want to get in touch somehow.

94
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,334
Hello, this is Haneoka.

95
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,402
<i>Help!</i>

96
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,405
Come to Marukicho now!

97
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,306
Mifuyu!

98
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,841
Stay away from me!

99
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,409
Let me go!

100
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,379
Stop!

101
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,681
No!

102
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,518
<i>I'll give you information on K! So, hurry!</i>

103
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,419
Sorry?

104
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,221
What are you doing?!

105
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,391
Um, we'll be right over. Where are you?

106
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,093
Come on! We have to run. Hurry.

107
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,266
<i>Help!</i>

108
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,101
<i>We're near the pedestrian bridge!</i>

109
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,671
<i>I can see the pedestrian bridge. Um…</i>

110
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,239
<i>What else can you see?</i>

111
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,209
Mifuyu, run!

112
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,174
-Are you alright?
-Please get back.

113
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,775
The ambulance is here.

114
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,910
Please get back.

115
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,778
-Excuse me, coming through.
-Sorry.

116
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,980
-Please get back.
-One, two, three!

117
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,624
Mifuyu…

118
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,486
Mifuyu? Mifuyu!

119
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,690
-Um, is… Is she…
-I'm Miyabe.

120
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,125
Is she alright?

121
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,372
Doctor.

122
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,343
Here.

123
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,178
Thank you.

124
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,680
I'll have some now.

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,685
What happened earlier?

126
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,488
Nothing.

127
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,393
Okay.

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,734
Water?

129
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,570
Wha…

130
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,873
At this point, I can't tell
if she'll regain consciousness.

131
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,608
We'll do our best,

132
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,878
but please understand
that she's in a critical condition.

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,182
-Hey!
-This is your fault!

134
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,684
-You were beating Mifuyu!
-Okay, okay.

135
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,020
-What are you talking about?
-Don't act dumb!

136
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,457
You were trying to bring her back
by beating her just now!

137
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,491
-Calm down.
-No.

138
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:40,828
I'm also upset
about how things turned out.

139
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,496
Let's calm down.

140
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,864
-Calm down!
-Wait!

141
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,699
-Hina, please calm down.
-Hey!

142
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,634
It's over if you touch him.

143
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,969
No violence. Okay?

144
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,945
What happened?

145
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,515
Forget it.

146
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,118
Then why did you call--

147
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,721
I thought a lawyer could help!

148
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,092
It was pointless.

149
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,966
I'm sorry,

150
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,702
but we're not Superman.

151
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,105
We can't just fly and come to the rescue.

152
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,306
Superman?

153
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,976
You don't know Superman?

154
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,845
He has a mark on his chest. That "S"?

155
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:32,746
Not now!

156
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,548
Forget it, old man.

157
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,285
Why didn't you call the police?

158
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,227
We're doing jobs.

159
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,631
There's no way we can call the police.

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,978
Let's cool our heads for a moment.

161
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,580
Yeah.

162
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,451
Hang on. Where are you going?

163
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,987
Who cares.

164
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,556
Why are you asking?

165
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,660
As someone who practices law,
I can't let a minor leave like this.

166
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,495
-It's none of your business.
-It is!

167
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:26,900
Now that we are involved,
if you end up getting into trouble,

168
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,469
we could be held responsible.

169
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,304
Huh?

170
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,006
I'll be in trouble, so come to my house.

171
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,675
What? No.

172
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,277
-I'll be in trouble.
-No! I'm not going.

173
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,478
She's really stubborn.

174
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,247
Why not?!

175
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,682
Because I said so!

176
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,217
You guys sound like
you're fighting for the bill.

177
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,128
Barley tea?

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,523
So, would it be possible
to hold her father criminally responsible

179
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,726
for her falling down

180
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,462
because he's the one who chased her?

181
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,398
That's difficult.

182
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,334
It's possible if she fell
while she was being chased.

183
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,470
But it was after she got away, right?

184
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,371
<i>Yes.</i>

185
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,742
According to the witness,
she staggered and fell on her own.

186
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:47,047
I see. Then it'll probably be judged as
no direct causal relationship there.

187
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,584
That's what I thought.

188
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,320
Thank you for taking the time.

189
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,023
<i>No problem. Let's go for a drink again.</i>

190
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,191
We can go to a public bath first.

191
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,060
Yes. A public bath sounds great.

192
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,194
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

193
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,095
<i>Goodbye.</i>

194
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:02,996
Bye.

195
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:07,034
PROSECUTOR
YUNO HANEOKA

196
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,136
That's a surprise.

197
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,505
I can't believe
you're connected to my sister.

198
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,640
Sister Yuno and I seem to get along well.

199
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,741
Sister Yuno?

200
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,144
By the way, are you sure?

201
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,914
I thought you don't take cases
that don't pay.

202
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,852
I'll allow myself to break my rule
just this once.

203
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,926
She had another plate of fried rice.

204
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,366
Why don't you eat here too?

205
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,037
You can stay here for a while.

206
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,978
Hina, where are your parents?

207
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,513
They're both dead.

208
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,319
Do you know about
the Child Guidance Center?

209
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,021
They have shelters for women--

210
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,055
Stop it.

211
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,890
I don't trust grown-ups.

212
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,761
But…

213
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,164
You feel sorry for me?

214
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,366
I don't need pity or anything.

215
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,770
I'll be fine.

216
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,240
Just help Mifuyu.

217
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,043
I want to sue that guy.

218
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,846
I'll sue him on her behalf.

219
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,250
Mifuyu has been
physically abused by her current father,

220
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,920
whom her mother remarried to
three years ago.

221
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,690
About a month ago,
when she was severely beaten,

222
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,159
she ran away from home
and went to Yamayoko.

223
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,162
Didn't her mother protect Mifuyu?

224
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,599
She didn't seem to do anything.
I guess she was afraid of him.

225
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,034
Right. And…

226
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,371
you said you want to sue Mifuyu's father.

227
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,240
Did he do something to you too?

228
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,341
No.

229
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,543
Hmm. I see.

230
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,211
This is difficult.

231
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,279
What?

232
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,982
Well, it has to be the victim herself.

233
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,116
Why?

234
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,451
Well…

235
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,422
There are two ways
to hold her father legally responsible.

236
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,194
There's a civil trial and…

237
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,029
a criminal trial.

238
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,230
Sir.

239
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,832
Your stroke order is wrong.

240
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,300
It doesn't matter.

241
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,168
Yeah, not now.

242
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,204
As a general rule,
you can only sue someone in a civil trial

243
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:28,675
if the intention of the person affected
can be confirmed.

244
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,277
So, only Mifuyu can sue him?

245
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,611
What about her mother?

246
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,649
She's a minor, so her mother can sue him
as her legal representative.

247
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,517
I intend to ask her.

248
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,853
But she seems to be under his thumb.

249
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,755
It won't be easy.

250
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,057
And at criminal trial…

251
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,761
we judge the case that police--

252
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,931
I don't get it.
You're saying I can't sue him?

253
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,465
That's what I'm explaining!

254
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,435
Why do you keep interrupting?

255
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,139
I don't care how.
Just do something about him!

256
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,710
Mifuyu really is being abused.

257
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,713
"Do you have proof of that?"

258
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,548
That's what they'll say.

259
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,651
We don't doubt you.

260
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,522
We need proof to judge her father
in a court of law.

261
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,860
Presumption of innocence. Being suspicious
isn't enough to punish someone.

262
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,328
What?

263
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:26,700
It's to protect an innocent person
from being falsely charged.

264
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,135
You mean, I can't do anything about him?

265
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,503
So, sometimes…

266
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,640
Even the real bad guys are protected.

267
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,615
What the hell is that?

268
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,722
Hina, take a bath before you go to bed.

269
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,023
Hina.

270
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,592
Geez.

271
00:14:55,462 --> 00:15:00,066
After all,
lawyers can only work within the law.

272
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,436
We're not Superman.

273
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:11,211
<i>Clouds will be spreading across Chugoku,</i>
<i>Shikoku and Kyushu regions tomorrow.</i>

274
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,047
<i>Please beware of sudden showers.</i>

275
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:14,981
FOR HINA.

276
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:20,620
<i>Temperatures will be cooler than</i>
<i>this morning in Eastern Japan…</i>

<i>I'm counting on you! Seriously!</i>

278
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,135
Hey, if you can speak Japanese,
can't you just…

279
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:46,212
<i>Kanami Kuwata's body was found buried</i>
<i>in a vacant lot in Kutsuna City.</i>

280
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,617
<i>A 19-year-old boy was arrested</i>
<i>on suspicion of corpse abandonment.</i>

281
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,385
<i>Ms. Kuwata was…</i>

282
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,120
It's K, who died.

283
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,021
What?

284
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,458
<i>She was known as K,</i>
<i>who was popular amongst the youngsters…</i>

285
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,727
-K was a woman?
<i>-She posted on social media…</i>

286
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,362
I thought it was a man.

287
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,898
<i>Messages such as</i>
<i>"Let's build a new life together."</i>

288
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:09,169
<i>The arrested boy admits to the charge</i>
<i>and that they were in a power struggle.</i>

289
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,540
<i>Ms. Kuwata was also involved in</i>
<i>the mediation of prostitution and…</i>

290
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,141
She was mediating it?

291
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,876
<i>…caught up in the conflict.</i>

292
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,513
<i>Her estimated time of death</i>
<i>is the afternoon of September 9th</i>

293
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,516
<i>and it is believed</i>

<i>The police are…</i>

295
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,498
They said she was killed on September 9th.

296
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,802
The day K was caught on camera was
September 10th, right?

297
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,938
Who is this?

298
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,068
Are you hiding something?

299
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,705
No.

300
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,674
Do you know something about that--

301
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,043
No!

302
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,511
-I don't.
-Hey.

303
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,747
Hey, you're a minor.

304
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,416
Give it to me.

305
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,953
Just tell us.

306
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,027
The K in that video footage…

307
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,164
That's Mifuyu.

308
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,165
What?

309
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,766
She was in disguise?

310
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,168
Mifuyu and I also…

311
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,937
asked K to refer us to clients

312
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,274
whenever we ran out of money.

313
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,710
But she takes 70 percent
as a referral fee.

314
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,813
-70 percent?
-That much?

315
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,283
When we complained,

316
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,686
she secretly filmed us during our jobs

317
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,856
and she threatened to
post those videos online.

318
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,358
<i>We hadn't seen her for about two weeks.</i>

319
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,061
<i>So, Mifuyu pretended to be K</i>
<i>and snuck into the café</i>

320
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,931
<i>to retrieve the SD card of the videos.</i>

321
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,637
K? Is that you, K?

322
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,041
<i>But she failed. So we ran and…</i>

323
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,209
Meet at 7-Eleven!

324
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,510
<i>She hit the car.</i>

325
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,024
Thank you for telling us.

326
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:49,629
Unfortunately,
if Mifuyu was the one who damaged the car,

327
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,899
she would have to pay the repair costs.

328
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,635
-What?
-But she is a minor.

329
00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:00,940
And she is hospitalized,
so her parents will be the ones paying.

330
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:01,875
Really?

331
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:08,181
So now, we have business
with Mifuyu's parents. Don't we?

332
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,016
Yes, that's right.

333
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,454
We can visit her house
and ask them various questions!

334
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,789
Exactly. If we happen to find proof

335
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:21,127
of her father's violence
in the course of claiming compensation,

336
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,795
we can't ignore it.

337
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,299
Yes. We must demand
appropriate compensation.

338
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,170
Huh?

339
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,282
Oh.

340
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,757
700,000.

341
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,327
Yes. The car body is also damaged,
so the door needs replacing.

342
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,797
Did Mifuyu really do this
in the first place?

343
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,266
Her friend who was with her has testified.

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,936
She's probably a runaway too, right?

345
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,605
I wonder if her testimony is reliable.

346
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,140
Please come in.

347
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,041
Slippers!

348
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,279
They run away from home
due to reasons they can't control.

349
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,586
I don't mean to be rude,
but did Mifuyu have a reason like that?

350
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,823
What is this?

351
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,260
You're just a clerk, aren't you?

352
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:32,232
No. A paralegal is a clerk
who has the required knowledge of law--

353
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,634
I am talking to him, a lawyer.

354
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,003
This isn't the time for you to speak.

355
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,805
To be frank,

356
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,407
isn't it because of your violence?

357
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,143
What's going on?

358
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,044
I'm sorry. Hey.

359
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,246
-Mr. Haneoka.
-Yes?

360
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,616
You can sue me or do whatever you want.

361
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,618
Uh, um…

362
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,955
<i>Hey.</i>

363
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,825
That's not what I had in mind.

364
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,760
I was planning to break him slowly.

365
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,096
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,064
Seeing him in person just…

367
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,733
I get it, but still.

368
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,570
As long as we're working on the car case,
Mifuyu is our client's enemy.

369
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,471
Right?

370
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,540
If we work for her,
it'll be a conflict of interest.

371
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,509
But I want to help.

372
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,977
Both Mifuyu and Hina.

373
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,680
Well, yeah. But…

374
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,255
Last night, before going to sleep,
Hina told me a little bit about herself.

375
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,325
<i>She's been in Yamayoko for two years now</i>

376
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,361
<i>and that she didn't bother</i>
<i>making any friends.</i>

377
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,065
<i>But she met Mifuyu last month</i>

378
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,369
<i>and they hit it off because they both</i>
<i>suck at opening rice ball wrappers.</i>

379
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:47,573
Mifuyu is the first friend she made.
She said that so happily.

380
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,145
She opened up to me,
even if it's a little.

381
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:57,984
This could be a chance for them
to change their lives.

382
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,321
So, I strongly felt that I wanted to help.

383
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:04,991
Their lives?

384
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,826
That's an exaggeration.

385
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,231
I think…

386
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,668
it only takes a little
for a life to change.

387
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,544
PUSH BUTTON TO WALK

388
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,921
2019

389
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,457
<i>I witnessed a traffic accident.</i>

390
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,639
BAR EXAMINATION VENUE

391
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,913
Please move away!

392
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,948
Are you alright?

393
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,583
<i>Right in front of me, a woman…</i>

394
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,889
I was on my way to my first bar exam.

395
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,695
I did take the exam after that,

396
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,598
but my mind was blank.

397
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:24,737
Since then, every year…

398
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,809
it comes back to me
every time I take the exam.

399
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,479
Is that why…

400
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,916
you've failed four times?

401
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:39,552
Yes.

402
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,624
I really think that

403
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,495
people's lives can change in a flash.

404
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:55,868
When there are accidents or incidents,
it's not just victims, offenders

405
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,137
and their families.

406
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:02,809
But it also instantly changes the lives
of those who witness it.

407
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:10,016
Those people in Yamayoko, Hina and Mifuyu.

408
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,084
I think it's the same for them.

409
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,556
<i>Maybe a little encounter with something</i>

410
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,959
<i>has put them in an environment</i>
<i>they didn't wish for.</i>

411
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:26,332
If that's the case, this encounter with us
may change their lives a little too.

412
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,534
Don't you think so?

413
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,474
You're right.

414
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:36,909
But…

415
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,513
I won't get my hopes up.

416
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,351
With this job,

417
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,255
too much of it ends in disappointment.

418
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,797
AO OBA

419
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,465
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Ishiko.

420
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,601
I got a contract on my first day!

421
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,603
Wow, congratulations.

422
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,804
Thank you.

423
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,973
Oh, I forgot to say that it's me, Oba.

424
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,208
-I know.
-Here you go.

425
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,476
Let's celebrate soon.

426
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,377
Yay!

427
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:14,046
<i>Here's your yakitori platter and…</i>

428
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,849
<i>Is this a bad time? Are you still working?</i>

429
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,253
-Um, yes.
-This is a rolled omelet.

430
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,221
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

431
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,657
<i>I'll have a toast by myself for today.</i>

432
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,828
I usually only drink one can,
but I think I'll drink two today.

433
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,064
Mr. Oba.

434
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,369
May I come over to your place?

435
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,877
Sure. What?

436
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,718
Huh?

437
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,921
-Good evening.
-Hello.

438
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,222
I wanted to pick you up.

439
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,189
I'm sorry.

440
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,090
No worries.

441
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,959
You didn't get lost?

442
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:00,860
No.

443
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,461
Come in.

444
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,529
Thank you.

445
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,602
Sorry about the sudden visit.

446
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:10,870
No problem.

447
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,906
I'm just surprised
that our first date is here.

448
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,442
I mean, I'm completely fine with it.

449
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,410
But are you?

450
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:22,048
My rule is, I can enter a man's house
if I'm in a relationship with him.

451
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,685
Please sit.

452
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,886
Thank you.

453
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,261
It really is clean.

454
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,004
But will I be able to help you?

455
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,207
It's this.

456
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,143
I was hoping
you could work your magic as a techie.

457
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,014
-When, Hina?
-I have to go now.

458
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,349
Now?

459
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,917
-HOW ABOUT 20,000?
-OKAY. TIME AND PLACE?

460
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,219
-Good luck.
-Is he in heat?

461
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,655
I'm gonna go. Bye.

462
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,246
Ow…

463
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:58,208
People think Mifuyu's father
is a good and earnest man.

464
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:00,978
He does seem sensible.

465
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:04,481
But there's a bar
he often goes to after work.

466
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,283
His reputation isn't good there.

467
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,989
He's the typical, weak against the strong
and strong against the weak kind of guy.

468
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:17,227
So he acts very arrogant towards
store staff, women and young people.

469
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,962
The type I hate the most.

470
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,734
If we dig deeper,
we might find something useful.

471
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:31,141
So you didn't give up on those girls.

472
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,010
Of course not.

473
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:36,613
I've said this many times already,
but who do you think I am?

474
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,452
I got something too. Look.

475
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:43,721
Oh?

476
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:48,459
The video wasn't very clear,
so I asked for Mr. Oba's help.

477
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,427
-Oh, that's why…
-Huh?

478
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,395
Nothing. Continue.

479
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,363
She has a bruise.

480
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:58,068
Right? Wouldn't this prove that
Mifuyu is the one who damaged the car?

481
00:28:58,569 --> 00:28:59,636
Not bad, Ishiko.

482
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,638
-However…
-Yes?

483
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:03,307
This was two weeks ago.

484
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,276
I'm sure the bruise is gone now

485
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:11,181
and we also need evidence to prove
she had that bruise two weeks ago.

486
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,052
What about that video?

487
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,253
Huh?

488
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,489
The one K secretly filmed.

489
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:22,292
There are naked shots of us.

490
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:34,171
Are you serious? They were in the drawer.

491
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,373
I guess the police seized them.

492
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,977
Can't we borrow it?
We're the ones in the video.

493
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:43,981
They will be used as evidence
for a homicide.

494
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,817
I doubt they'll lend it to us so easily.

495
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,488
<i>-What's up!</i>
-Who's this?

496
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,992
<i>Hina, guess what?</i>

497
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:56,693
Who are you?

498
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:03,133
It's Kizaki.
We've met at K's cafe several times.

499
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,034
<i>Right.</i>

500
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:08,372
The café's been closed down.

501
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:12,543
So I'm low on money. Help me out.

502
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,011
Help you?

503
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:17,147
Yeah, you know the SD card that K kept?

504
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,651
I have it now.

505
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,119
<i>What?</i>

506
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:24,488
You don't want this
to be shared online, right?

507
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:30,227
To cut the story short,
I'll be replacing K now.

508
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:36,533
Hey! Are you listening?!

509
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:40,204
<i>Yes, I've been listening very closely.</i>

510
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:46,210
I'm Haneoka. The lawyer
who came to visit the café the other day.

511
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:50,013
You just threatened her, didn't you?

512
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,516
This is intimidation under Article 222--

513
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,151
<i>S-Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

514
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,287
No point apologizing.
This conversation is being recorded too.

515
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,122
You must first reflect on what you said

516
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:02,659
and swear you won't engage
in criminal activities in the future.

517
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:06,129
And hand over that video to us right now.

518
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,032
<i>Yes, I swear. I'll give you the data too.</i>

519
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,169
-You didn't make a copy, did you?
<i>-No, I--</i>

520
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:14,805
If you did, you'll be in big trouble.

521
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,707
<i>No, I didn't. For real.</i>

522
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:18,542
I'm in front of K's café--

523
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,644
I'll bring it to you right now!

524
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:24,014
Okay, then. Be careful.

525
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,885
See? This is what I'm capable of.

526
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:31,288
That's right.
He gets things done when he has to.

527
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:34,892
His socks may be mismatched, but still.

528
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,964
Old man, are you actually a klutz?

529
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:44,368
No, I am not a klutz.

530
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,136
This is a trend, right?

531
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,104
No.

532
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,972
-Anyway…
-He changed the subject.

533
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,341
If we have the video,
we're good for the trial?

534
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:53,777
Yes.

535
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,746
You mean the trial for the car, right?

536
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:57,915
<i>What about the abuse?</i>

537
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:59,082
Leave it to us.

538
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:04,321
If all goes well,
we may be able to win both battles

539
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:05,689
for the car and assault.

540
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:07,157
Right.

541
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:33,917
After watching this footage,
you are certain that this person

542
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,086
is not Ms. Mifuyu Azuma. Yes?

543
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:40,057
That's right.
I'm sure this is not my daughter.

544
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:43,026
I believe we are not liable
for the compensation.

545
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,394
That'll be all.

546
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:45,929
Plaintiff counsel.

547
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,632
Yes. Let me get to the point.

548
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,401
Please take a look at this photo,
Exhibit 11.

549
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:55,439
This is an enlarged image
of the dashcam footage.

550
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:59,509
This person has a large bruise.
Do you recognize it?

551
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,078
Not at all.

552
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:04,181
This was recorded on September 10th,

553
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:07,351
which was six days after
your daughter ran away from home--

554
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,052
I don't remember the date.

555
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:15,158
You don't remember the date
your daughter disappeared from your home.

556
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,662
Well, I guess that's how it is.

557
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:22,799
By the way,
on September 4th, the day she left,

558
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:25,535
did Mifuyu have any bruises on her body?

559
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:28,305
I wouldn't know.
I don't look at my daughter's body.

560
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:32,242
Then please look at the footage,
Exhibit 14.

561
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:38,015
This was recorded on September 7th
and Mifuyu is in it.

562
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,517
Let me play it.

563
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,054
<i>Hey, how did you get that bruise?</i>

564
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,223
<i>It looks bad.</i>

565
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,460
<i>That guy did it.</i>

566
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:52,696
<i>That guy?</i>

567
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,732
<i>I don't even want to say his name,</i>
<i>so "that guy."</i>

568
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:02,806
<i>That guy's been beating me for years.</i>

569
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:16,987
The appraisal result showed that
this bruise on her shoulder and back

570
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:22,292
is identical to the bruise on the person
in the dashcam footage we saw earlier.

571
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:26,430
The person in the latter footage
is your daughter, correct?

572
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,864
Yes.

573
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:35,472
By the way,
do you know when, where and how

574
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,441
she got those bruises?

575
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:40,644
Objection.
This has nothing to do with this case.

576
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:44,347
Plaintiff counsel,
is there a relevance to this case?

577
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,450
If her father knows about the bruises,

578
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:50,854
it further proves the identity of
the person who damaged the car as Mifuyu.

579
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:55,192
Objection overruled.
Please continue your question.

580
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:56,626
Thank you very much.

581
00:34:56,693 --> 00:35:00,564
Mifuyu was talking about the person
who assaulted her as "that guy."

582
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,133
Could you confirm
if "that guy" is you, Mr. Azuma?

583
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,935
Why would you think that?!

584
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:08,438
You can't assume that it's me
just because she said, "That guy."

585
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,109
Your honor, these questions
have nothing to do with this case!

586
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:15,378
Indeed. Haven't you asked
enough questions about the bruise?

587
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:16,947
No more questions.

588
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:21,852
The plaintiff demands
compensation from Ms. Mifuyu Azuma

589
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:26,189
and we believe her parents
also have the obligation to pay.

590
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:30,827
Fine. I'll take responsibility.

591
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:35,432
Plaintiff, please return to your seat.

592
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,502
Understand?

593
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:39,402
Yes.

594
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:42,339
You did a great job! Thank you!

595
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,608
Okay. Um, you need to be quiet.

596
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,079
So, you won that trial?

597
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:52,549
The verdict isn't out yet.
But by the judge's reaction, most likely.

598
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:53,450
Right.

599
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:56,853
But he didn't admit to the assault.

600
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,555
It all begins now.

601
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:02,225
Now, let's keep up the pace.

602
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,566
Hey, hurry up and bring another glass.

603
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:12,068
I'm sorry. It'll be ready soon.

604
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,971
That guy's been beating me for years.

605
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,806
Isn't it because of your violence?

606
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:19,376
<i>Could you confirm</i>
<i>if "that guy" is you, Mr. Azuma?</i>

607
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,145
They all piss me off.

608
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:23,446
-Good evening.
-Hello.

609
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,481
Welcome.

610
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,317
-Excuse us.
-Hi.

611
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:32,189
-I'll have a highball.
-Make that two.

612
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:33,490
Sure.

613
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,995
Sorry to keep you waiting.

614
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:44,868
Man. What a long day, huh? Oba?

615
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:48,338
Yes. I completely agree with you, Manager.

616
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:51,841
<i>You're going to act as</i>
<i>a senior and junior at work.</i>

617
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:54,844
You're both married with children.

618
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:57,681
After you sit next to him,
start with small talk.

619
00:36:57,747 --> 00:36:59,950
Be natural. Okay?

620
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,352
Hurry. We're waiting for you.

621
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:06,022
But sir, kids really are cute.
Aren't they?

622
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:10,427
Four years old, right?
That's the cutest age.

623
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:11,328
"Daddy."

624
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:13,263
She rushes towards me saying "Daddy."

625
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,465
"Daddy, daddy," huh?

626
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:16,733
Will you hear me out?

627
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:18,702
Me?

628
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:22,539
It shouldn't be too strange to talk to him
if you're in a bar.

629
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,774
Don't let him refuse and start talking.

630
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:29,512
You see, my daughter calls me "that guy."

631
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,082
She's a third-year in junior high.

632
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:33,550
Wouldn't that make you mad?

633
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,187
That is a problem indeed.

634
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:41,024
Right? Maybe she's looking down on me.

635
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:44,694
She ignores him when he talks to her
and says stuff like "Get lost!"

636
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:45,595
I see…

637
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,698
Don't you think it's terrible?
I mean, I'm her parent.

638
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,367
They're both in the living room,

639
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:53,803
but she would ask his wife
to pass on the message to him. Right?

640
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,704
Yeah.

641
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,039
Isn't it infuriating?

642
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,508
That really is annoying.

643
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:02,045
When he takes the bait,
get him to talk about specific incidents.

644
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:06,283
You get it, right?
I've been feeling so frustrated!

645
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:11,254
I understand.
My daughter calls me "that guy" too.

646
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,623
She doesn't see me as a parent.

647
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:18,528
I'm taking care of a stepdaughter,
but she's messing with me.

648
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:22,399
We'll use the term "that guy"
as an icebreaker.

649
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,234
From here, we'll get to the core.

650
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,972
How should we handle children like that?

651
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:34,811
If scolding them doesn't work,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

652
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:37,180
What do you mean?

653
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:39,616
Hit her.

654
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:41,918
Hit her?

655
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,854
Beating her
is the only way to shut her up.

656
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:47,057
Women can't win against men anyway.

657
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,692
Just hit her.

658
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:51,361
Will that make her obedient?

659
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:55,532
Yeah. She'll do whatever you say
if you beat her to a pulp.

660
00:38:56,366 --> 00:39:01,338
Do you actually beat your daughter?

661
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:06,710
No.

662
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,619
It's not just a beating.

663
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,422
To me, it's discipline.

664
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,728
I've been beating her this whole time.

665
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:27,263
But I do it as a necessary discipline
as a parent.

666
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:32,435
So when she goes out into society,
she doesn't embarrass herself.

667
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,104
That's why I beat her.

668
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,173
I see.

669
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,808
That's criminal assault.

670
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:39,709
Huh?

671
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,479
Right. I think you've crossed the line.

672
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:43,446
What is this?

673
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,182
Listen up!

674
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:50,086
Even if you're her father, you can still
get charged with assault and battery.

675
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:50,987
That's right!

676
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:52,555
Under Penal Code Article 2…

677
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,424
200…

678
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:56,860
Huh?

679
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,529
-Um…
-Huh? You're kidding, right?

680
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:00,864
200…

681
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,332
Article 204!

682
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,333
Oh…

683
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,001
Who are you?

684
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:08,872
Have you forgotten about the paralegal,
who isn't a lawyer?

685
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:13,743
<i>Under Penal Code Article 204,</i>
<i>anyone who inflicts physical harm</i>

686
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,414
will be imprisoned for up to 15 years
or pay a fine of up to 500,000 yen.

687
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,350
Mr. Azuma,
I believe your violence to Mifuyu

688
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,619
will be considered a battery charge.

689
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,355
That's an exaggeration.

690
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,590
I heard the whole conversation you had,

691
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:30,160
so I will testify
that you have been beating her.

692
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:31,294
I will too!

693
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,395
Me too!

694
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:36,232
I was only kidding.
It'll be no good as evidence.

695
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:39,035
-Now, now…
-I've also recorded it just in case.

696
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,671
This and the video will be enough.

697
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,239
I'll see you in the trial.

698
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,275
Huh? What trial?

699
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:47,010
The car trial is already--

700
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:51,981
Someone has come forward to sue you
for assault and battery.

701
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:54,617
No way. My wife?

702
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:57,854
The lawyer in charge
is on the way to see her right now.

703
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,493
Come in. Hi.

704
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,063
<i>To see Ms. Mifuyu Azuma,</i>
<i>who has filed the lawsuit.</i>

705
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:11,501
It's very nice to meet you.
Thank you very much.

706
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,503
<i>She regained consciousness yesterday.</i>

707
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,138
No, it's my pleasure.

708
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:16,940
Introduce me, will you?

709
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:18,942
I was just doing that.

710
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:20,777
They didn't tell me!

711
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,813
That's because she refused
to have them notify you.

712
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:26,015
What?

713
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:30,553
I'm glad we believed she'd wake up
and prepared beforehand.

714
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:35,124
Your earlier statements, Mifuyu's
testimony and the video of her bruises

715
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:40,363
should prove that you have been
physically abusing her on a daily basis.

716
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,200
We will proceed to sue you
with a civil case.

717
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:47,437
Additionally, Mifuyu will be
filing a report with the police,

718
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:49,472
so you'll eventually be arrested.

719
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:50,974
Please be prepared.

720
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:53,042
That'll be all.

721
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:02,952
The food truck compensation
has been settled, right?

722
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,357
Yes. Regarding that case,
the girls will…

723
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:10,727
I'll work and pay it myself.

724
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:15,398
She did all this for my sake as well,

725
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:17,267
so I'll pay too.

726
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:22,305
But the client wanted
the payment in a lump sum,

727
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:27,310
so I lent the money to Mifuyu as a friend.

728
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:30,513
Of course,
the client is aware of the process.

729
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,950
We've paid the full amount
and he's withdrawn the lawsuit.

730
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:35,118
You paid for her?

731
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:39,522
I know my actions may be
frowned upon as a lawyer.

732
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:43,593
But as a grown-up, I just had to.

733
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:49,132
Are you sure you want to sue your father?

734
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:57,674
I'm not running anymore. I'll fight.

735

740
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:23,866
See you. Old man, old lady.

741
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:26,369
O-Old lady?

742
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,338
Welcome to this side.

743
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,341
Shall the old man and old lady go home?

744
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:06,743
Who are you calling old lady?

745
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:18,888
Hi.

746
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:21,791
Oh, please stay seated.

747
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,231
Today I've gathered the managers,
who I think are close to me.

748
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:32,902
I hope I'm not the only one
who thinks that.

749

And they have chosen
and brought the rest of you here

750
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,308
because you have a promising future.

751
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,209
President Tone!

752
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:41,911
I'm excited about our future.

753
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,216
Expand your horizontal network today

00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:52,388
Oh, thanks.

756
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:56,693
Seriously,
the way to success is really easy.

757
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,197
Just don't give up until you succeed.

758
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:06,235
Just kidding.

759
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:11,274
Okay, then. Let's have a toast.

760
