1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,911
Wow, what a great view.

2
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,046
I'm delighted.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,917
Right. Let's post this photo on Instagram.

4
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,052
There we go.

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,720
Hey!

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,122
-Huh?

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,191
I'm in that photo, right? Don't upload it.

8
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,428
Huh? But your face isn't in the photo.

9
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,964
Still, some people can tell that it's me.

10
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,866
It's an infringement on portrait rights.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,035
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,604
You're the one
violating freedom of expression.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,805
-What?
-What?

14
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,743
Mr. Kayama needs your help with a case.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,979
Oh, really? I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,582
If it's urgent, could you ask
Haneo to take over?

17
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,286
I'm giving a consultation
on inheritance right now.

18
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,455
Oh, okay.

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,958
Please make sure to charge
for that consultation.

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,628
-Come on, he's a friend.
-Dad.

21
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,399
Since I can't take his request, could you
give Kayama an apology discount?

22
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,002
I cannot do that.

23
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,671
<i>Hey, hello? Hello?</i>

24
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,208
-Huh? Hello? Is it a bad connection?
<i>-Dad?</i>

25
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,677
-Hello?
-Hello?

26
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,212
Okay.

27
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,284
Geez…

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,262
Yeah, of course I'll pay the regular fee.

29
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,897
Oh, really?

30
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,034
I'm in the service business too.
I understand the importance of profit.

31
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,268
Thank you.

32
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:45,106
Plus,
I'm happy to have him work on my case.

33
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,042
Wataro told me that you're a great lawyer.

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,644
Thank you. Give him a discount.

35
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,179
Don't make unnecessary remarks.

36
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,248
So, what's the request about?

37
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,417
Well…

38
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,054
My restaurant is on
a restaurant guide website.

39
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,423
-What?
-Was it slandered?

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,158
No, it was a good review.

41
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,693
And that's bad?

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,296
The selling point of his restaurant
is that it's a hidden gem.

43
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,500
Now, let me confirm.

44
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,037
Seven days ago, when you were serving
your regular customers

45
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,840
at your creative cuisine restaurant
called Inside,

46
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,309
<i>a group of unknown customers came in.</i>

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,413
<i>They said they saw the review</i>
<i>on Umarepo, a restaurant guide website.</i>

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,849
<i>The person who posted it</i>
<i>was a popular reviewer</i>

49
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,019
<i>who goes by the handle "Refill Master."</i>

50
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,522
<i>You immediately sent</i>
<i>a removal request to DotM,</i>

51
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,825
<i>the company that runs Umarepo,</i>
<i>but they declined.</i>

52
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:41,529
At this rate, your restaurant
will lose its stance as a hidden gem,

53
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,364
so you want to sue DotM.

54
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,332
-Correct?
-Yes.

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,370
I've been declining interviews
for 15 years and this happens.

56
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,372
You've never been interviewed once?

57
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,774
No, never. I've kept my stance on that.

58
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,511
You're not suing Refill Master?

59
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,580
I'm upset about the review too,

60
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,584
but I'm more angry at the company
for rejecting my removal request.

61
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,253
I want to demand compensation too.

62
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,755
Very well.

63
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,225
Haneoka will handle
all communication with them from now on.

64
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,660
Do you have their contact information?

65
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,328
Yeah, sure. Hang on.

66
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,164
This is their lawyer.

67
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,065
FUMIHIKO TANZAWA

68
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,374
Inside has strictly maintained
its referral system style

69
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,610
and strived
to keep the restaurant private.

70
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:34,582
However, this post has undermined
the unique value of the restaurant

71
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,383
that the owner has built up.

72
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,853
This is an infringement of goodwill.

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,890
We'd like you to delete
the restaurant information and pay--

74
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,593
Look, Mr. Haneoka.

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,431
The Umarepo reviewers
have the right to freedom of expression

76
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:53,901
and the viewers have the right to know.
Therefore…

77
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,172
we can't comply with your request
to delete the post

78
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,675
and we believe it doesn't constitute
an infringement of goodwill.

79
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,413
Our client is happy to take this to court.

80
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,449
Go ahead.

81
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,517
I'll see you there.

82
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,729
Do you think
I should've grinned wider back there?

83
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,364
What? Who cares.

84
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,899
I can't lose if he's the opponent.

85
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,502
-You shouldn't lose any case.
-I know.

86
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,240
Then,
shall we talk to the regular customers?

87
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:37,044
We'll get their testimonies
on how they love it as a hidden gem.

88
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,849
Maybe this side was better.

89
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,421
Good evening.

90
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,124
Everyone is referred to by regulars

91
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,926
or are the manager's friends,
so we do feel at home here.

92
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,428
That's right.

93
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,831
And what's great is that the manager
can improvise dishes on the spot

94
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,335
according to
our physical condition on that day.

95
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,937
I think that's possible because
he knows us well.

96
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,573
That's what I'm most particular about.

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,943
I want to offer the best thing for them
at that moment.

98
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,645
It really is a great restaurant.

99
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,315
He took half off the bill
on our wedding anniversary.

100
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,251
-That's right!
-Truly a great service.

101
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,819
Now, now.

102
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,656
So if this place wasn't hidden
and strangers frequently visited,

103
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,758
you think it'll lose its charm.

104
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,693
Yes.

105
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,462
Will you testify that in court?

106
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,564
-Of course.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,535
I can't make any promises
because my work schedule is unsteady.

108
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,570
-Sorry about that.
-No worries.

109
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:37,638
See you.

110
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,606
-I'm off.
-Thank you.

111
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,175
-Bye.
-No charge today.

112
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,010
-Thanks.
-Sure.

113
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,445
-Take care.
-I will.

114
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,018
Are they regular customers in that photo?

115
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,853
It was our tenth anniversary.

116
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,089
Most are regulars.

117
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,859
But this is Mr. Kayama's late wife, Akie.

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,063
This is his son Hiroshi,
and Hiroshi's wife, Ran.

119
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,432
Will they be able to testify?

120
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,369
-Probably not. They're overseas, right?
-Yeah…

121
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,805
Oh, if you need testimonies,
what about Satsuki?

122
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,507
-That's it!
-Satsuki?

123
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,542
She used to work part-time here.

124
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,810
Her.

125
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,379
She'd be perfect.

126
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:22,750
She loves this restaurant
and she even found good suppliers for me.

127
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,751
Will you ask her?

128
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,386
-Sure.
-Yes.

129
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,593
Alright.

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,864
She said she'd be working here,
so we can talk to her anytime.

131
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,198
She runs a coffee shop?

132
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,300
No, she's a digital nomad.

133
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,869
Huh? What did you say?

134
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,072
D-Digital moped?

135
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,075
Digicam comrade?

136
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,042
No.

137
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,378
Miracle notepad?

138
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,415
Mythical crawdad?

139
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,518
-I'll let you continue.
-Stop me.

140
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,186
Don't you know digital nomads?

141
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,587
Yeah sure, digital nomads.

142
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,257
-You know?
-I do. They work from different places.

143
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,160
Correct.

144
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,928
You're that surprised?

145
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,732
What's going on here?

146
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,939
How long did you work at Inside?

147
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,874
Ten years, I think.

148
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,409
How did you start working there?

149
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,146
I've been trying to become a writer
since back then,

150
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,848
but I couldn't make ends meet.

151
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,117
Then the manager's son's wife
introduced me.

152
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,118
You mean, Ran?

153
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,053
Yes, we went to the same university.

154
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,954
I see.

155
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,658
Well, actually…

156
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,795
Someone posted
the restaurant's information on Umarepo.

157
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,532
This is it. Do you know about this?

158
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,235
Ah, I'm the one who posted this.

159
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,204
-What?
-Huh?

160
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,172
You're Refill Master?

161
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,976
Yes.
I write restaurant reviews as a hobby.

162
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:59,513
What?
But you shouldn't write about Inside.

163
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,915
You know it's a hidden restaurant, right?

164
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,820
When I post restaurants that other people
don't know about, I get more viewers.

165
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,722
I guess it's what you call
seeking approval.

166
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,027
Um, what you did could constitute
as obstruction of business.

167
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,263
Could you delete this?

168
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,834
I'll consider it if Umarepo told me to,

169
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,070
but I think it's fine as it is.

170
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,906
-You're mad at the restaurant?
-No.

171
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,674
What about his son and his wife?

172
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,943
Nope. I see Ran from time to time.

173
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,778
Huh? You go overseas?

174
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,980
Overseas?

175
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,183
-Huh?
-Huh?

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,419
Really? It was Satsuki?

177
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,089
-Unfortunately.
-What?

178
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,995
She told us that
your son and his wife live in Tokyo.

179
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,865
Why did you lie?

180
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,604
Hiroshi and I had a huge fight
three years ago.

181
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,308
I told him
never to come back to this restaurant.

182
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,113
I didn't want my regulars to know,
so I told them they went overseas.

183
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,882
You haven't seen him?

184
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,684
Not since the fight.

185
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,122
Would it be possible for me to meet them?

186
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,158
He's watched you work since he was little.

187
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,795
If he can talk about Inside and you
at the trial, it'll help us.

188
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,931
I'm not sure.

189
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,704
<i>Maybe it's for the best.</i>

190
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,076
Um, you and Mr. Kayama have grown apart?

191
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,444
I guess.

192
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,280
If you don't mind…

193
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,215
Oh, the reason?

194
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,884
-Yes.
-Yes.

195
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,489
My dad quit his job when he was 45
and he started that restaurant.

196
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,894
He barely made a profit since
there weren't many customers to begin with

197
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,730
and he kept giving discounts,
so my mom worked to support us.

198
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,002
I grew up seeing that,
so I got a scholarship to a university

199
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,503
and got a stable job.

200
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,341
I see. Was that partly
as a protest to your father?

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,343
You could say that.

202
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,180
When I started working, I realized again

203
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,049
that my dad was doing this
with no regard for profit.

204
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,086
He'll lose the restaurant like this.

205
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,888
That's why you fought?

206
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,325
No. I still didn't say anything.

207
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,061
But mom passed away three years ago.

208
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:30,731
About the restaurant.

209
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,367
Hm?

210
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,636
Can you go on like this?

211
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,906
You should think about business.

212
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,577
Even if you give discounts,

213
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,180
it's not like the regulars
will take care of you when you retire.

214
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,251
It'll only taper off
if you only rely on your regulars.

215
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,753
I'm running it my way--

216
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,389
You don't get it
even after mom sacrificed herself?

217
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,793
She practically wore her life out for you.

218
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,729
Do you really mean that?

219
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,233
At this rate, you'll lose the restaurant.

220
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:07,768
Shut up!

221
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,238
<i>And since then…</i>

222
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,410
Even so, the restaurant is in trouble.

223
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,046
Could you please testify?

224
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,650
No. I'm all for disclosing information
about the restaurant.

225
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,820
I see…

226
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:36,029
I wonder why Mr. Kayama is so hung up on
keeping his store hidden.

227
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,999
I don't know.

228
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,804
He should know that the restaurant will
suffer if he disregards profitability.

229
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,041
So why wouldn't he listen to
Hiroshi's advice?

230
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,412
Well, let's try and understand
Kayama's feelings too.

231
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,982
I get that
he wants to put his customers first.

232
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,690
Doing something for someone
is a wonderful gesture.

233
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:09,596
But is it okay to make other people suffer
in order to help someone?

234
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,033
You're okay with
offering someone an umbrella

235
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,001
while getting someone else wet?

236
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,870
No, that's not what I mean.

237
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,874
Mom was soaking wet, while you were busy
offering your umbrella to someone else.

238
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,120
Do you want Aonori seaweed on this?

239
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,459
You came to ask me that?

240
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,396
No. I just thought you might be hungry.

241
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:25,172
Ah, do you prefer bonito flakes
over Aonori seaweed?

242
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,612
I'll leave it here.

243
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,448
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,187
For making you worry.

245
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,389
It's fine.

246
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,360
Though I said that,

247
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>I broke my own rule the other day.</i>

248
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,732
<i>I know I have no right to blame my father.</i>

249
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:54,901
But…

250
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,637
when I think about my mom…

251
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,012
What was your mother like?

252
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:12,419
Well, she was gentle
and she'd put others before herself.

253
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,020
That's your father.

254
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,158
Yes, they might've been alike.

255
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,763
She was working here as a clerk.

256
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,367
<i>Even when my father took on</i>
<i>unprofitable requests,</i>

257
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,704
<i>she would work elsewhere</i>
<i>and supported us financially.</i>

258
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,876
But she couldn't go on like that,
and they got divorced.

259
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,378
Well, I wouldn't blame her.

260
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,916
<i>I've watched my dad work</i>
<i>and I do respect him.</i>

261
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,317
<i>But…</i>

262
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:50,090
I also can't get over the feeling
that he made my mom suffer.

263
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,526
Hence, the politeness?

264
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,396
I don't get it myself either.

265
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,366
He wants you to be more casual.

266
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,268
Hm?

267
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,637
Nah, not yet.

268
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,573
So?

269
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,610
Please let me think about it.
I can't be casual--

270
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,146
-You want Aonori seaweed?
-That?

271
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,382
Yes.

272
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,224
Hey! That's too much!

273
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,826
It's rich in nutrients.

274
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,462
Is that right? Thank you very much.

275
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,767
Here you go.

276
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,568
You put so much on it…

277
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,903
Thank you very much.

278
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,673
Can I talk about the case?

279
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,740
Yes, sure.

280
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,011
The client wants to protect
the restaurant's privacy.

281
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,415
Putting aside
whether we agree with him or not,

282
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,817
let's do whatever we can for him.

283
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:51,952
Of course.

284
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,090
First, I'll figure out their strategy
on preparation day.

285
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,159
ARGUMENT PREPARATION DAY

286
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,996
Does the defense have
any additional evidence?

287
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,599
Yes. I'll be calling a witness.

288
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,336
This is Ms. Fumi Kusakabe.

289
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,772
She publishes town magazines in Kamogaya.

290
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,643
She did an interview with Inside
and posted the article 15 years ago.

291
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,577
No way.

292
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,114
Not possible. I've confirmed
he's never done an interview.

293
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,315
Please take a look.

294
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,656
I'll also submit this magazine as evidence
at our next hearing.

295
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,560
This means
Inside has done an interview in the past

296
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,962
disclosing its own information.

297
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,366
So he hasn't exactly maintained
strict confidentiality.

298
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,903
Additionally,
the information posted on Umarepo is

299
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,972
pretty much the same as this magazine.

300
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,974
We'll be arguing
that publishing information

301
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:53,680
which has already been published doesn't
constitute an infringement of goodwill.

302
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,991
I'm off to a meeting
for the real estate investment fraud case.

303
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,626
Please travel safely.

304
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,373
Hello.

305
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,342
This is really bad!

306
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,912
-Huh?
-Find Mr. Kayama. Right now!

307
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,236
What's going on?
You said you never did an interview!

308
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,772
I completely forgot.
This is so embarrassing.

309
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,075
We had just opened the restaurant.

310
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,178
It was for a regular's friend,
who made the magazine as a hobby.

311
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,446
So you obliged?

312
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,414
But it was only about ten minutes.

313
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,950
They took one photo and it was over.

314
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,289
Did you get more customers after that?

315
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,590
Not at all!

316
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,059
There were only a few copies.
It had no effect.

317
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,528
That's why I forgot. I'm really sorry.

318
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,665
The fact that you did an interview
is a huge disadvantage.

319
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,100
Please don't be like that.

320
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,969
A new customer came yesterday,
wearing strong perfume,

321
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,772
and got so drunk
that all my regulars had to leave.

322
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,741
The atmosphere is really bad right now.

323
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,143
So, I'm counting on you.

324
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,344
Watch…

325
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,479
Wait…

326
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,151
I can't do this. Damn it.

327
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,454
Remembering Tanzawa's smug face just…

328
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,791
Don't think about it. Hey!

329
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,727
-That idiot! Hmph!
-Oh, hey! Geez.

330
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,696
But it just pops into my head!

331
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,732
You know…

332
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,168
he wears leather shoes barefoot.

333
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,336
Huh?

334
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,937
I bet he has stinky feet.

335
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,439
What's this about?

336
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm just insulting him.

337
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,478
If I don't do this
my distressed heart wouldn't heal!

338
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,313
Okay. Did it heal?

339
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,749
Absolutely not. I need to say 100 more.

340
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,717
That's a lot.

341
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,658
Just when it finally stopped doing that…

342
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,231
Ouch!

343
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,333
Where's your confidence, Mr. Lawyer?

344
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,468
That hurt.

345
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,569
Yeah, I'm sorry.

346
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,706
This trial is getting
quite a lot of attention. Look.

347
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,243
Restaurants that were posted
without permission

348
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,347
or are suffering from unfair low ratings
are beginning to speak up.

349
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,819
Maybe Mr. Tanzawa
is being pressured by DotM.

350
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,390
As a company,
I'm sure they can't afford to lose.

351
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,361
So, his smug face you were upset about.

352
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:00,166
If that's a sign of pressure,
wouldn't that make you feel better?

353
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:05,939
Let's get to work.

354
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,645
It will be intolerable

355
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:17,617
if other restaurants follow suit
and start suing us to remove more posts.

356
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,620
You must win this case.

357
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,922
There's no way I'd lose.

358
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,925
Not to someone
who was fired for incompetence.

359
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,099
There are plenty of
other law firms out there.

360
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:34,934
Yes, sir.

361
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,371
UMAREPO

362
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,543
REFILL MASTER

363
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,150
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

364
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,626
-Hi there.
-Oh, we didn't order anything.

365
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:03,463
I know. Wataro bought a new product
and he wanted me to try it out too.

366
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,064
Another exercise equipment?

367
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,933
Come on, go easy on him.

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,668
It's for your sake too.

369
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,970
He told me that

370
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,906
he wants to stay healthy and live longer
even for a day

371
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,477
because he's been given the chance
to live with you again.

372
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,546
Alright. Bye.

373
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,983
-See ya.
-Bye.

374
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,853
-Hello.
-Hey!

375
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:27,954
Hi.

376
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,789
What's wrong? Did something happen?

377
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,925
Huh? Oh, no. I'm here to see Ishiko.

378
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,929
So, you haven't given up on her. Huh?

379
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,732
Um, actually…

380
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,835
We're dating.

381
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,038
-Oh!
-Huh?

382
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,908
Ishiko and I are dating.

383
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,276
That's right.

384
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,870
That's what speechlessness looks like.

385
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,381
Don't worry and just go.
You have a date, right?

386
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,020
Um…

387
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,491
if it's okay with you, can I invite Haneo?

388
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,793
He's treated me many times.

389
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,364
And the restaurant we're going to
serves great food.

390
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,767
-I don't mind.
-Really?

391
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,104
-Um.
-Yeah, I heard everything.

392
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,539
-What?
-We even made eye contact for a moment.

393
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,440
I'm not going.

394
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,609
Oh, you're not?

395
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,543
No.

396
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,845
But everything's on me.

397
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,046
That's not the point.

398
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,315
But the food is really good.

399
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,886
Thank you for waiting.
Here's the Imoni hot pot.

400
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,456
Feel free to use Yamagata's spice blend.

401
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,824
Thank you.

402
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,393
It's my treat today.

403
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,560
I appreciate it.

404
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:15,461
Are you sure?

405
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,629
Don't worry.

406
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,997
I received an extra bonus.

407
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,701
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Can't lift it.

408
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:26,839
Ooh.

409
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,878
But I guess business is good.
Was it an office supply company?

410
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,614
Yes. They seem to like me.

411
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,749
That's great.

412
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,650
Yes.

413
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:41,020
The president took me to
Mr. Mikogami's dinner party the other day.

414
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,689
-Mikogami as in that Angel investor?
-Yes!

415
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,325
-Your president is friends with him?
-Seems like it.

416
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,694
-I see.
-Who is this Mikogami person?

417
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:55,334
He invests mainly in new companies,
regardless of the industry.

418
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,936
There.

419
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,171
Your fingers are in the way.

420
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,272
Sorry.

421
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,274
Never seen him.

422
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,376
His online community has 10,000 members.

423
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,778
I've seen him in a documentary too.

424
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,246
You really like your documentaries.

425
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,783
But it's cool that they introduced you
to such a high-profile person.

426
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,585
They must have high hopes for you.

427
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,588
My family is happy
I got into a good workplace too.

428
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:16,656
I see.

429
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,224
I'd like you to meet them.

430
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,026
Yes, sure.

431
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,361
Oh! Nothing formal, like for marriage.

432
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,763
Yes, I know.

433
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,466
They made a big deal
when I said I'm dating.

434
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,267
My little brother even cried.

435
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,735
What?

436
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,242
You can do it.

437
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,277
Keep trying.

438
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,414
-I'm just mixing.
-Excuses.

439
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,353
So plump.

440
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,688
Yum.

441
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,156
I'm so glad.

442
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,758
It has a high rating on Umarepo
with four stars.

443
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,794
-Four stars?
-Yes.

444
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,929
Wow. You're right.

445
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,565
Oh, so it's like this.

446
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,005
Refill Master?

447
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:07,673
Let me see.

448
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,160
This is…

449
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,565
-You have a grudge?
-It's not like that.

450
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:37,034
You know that
I don't want to disclose information.

451
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:41,438
Um, could you hold the discussion
a little longer?

452
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,807
I'd like to wait until everyone is here.

453
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:44,775
Everyone?

454
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:46,744
They should be here soon.

455
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:53,517
Please take a seat.

456
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,589
Shall we?

457
00:25:58,656 --> 00:25:59,490
Yes.

458
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,861
I'll get straight to the point.

459
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:07,631
You're not Refill Master, are you?

460
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,533
What are you talking about? I am.

461
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,136
To be more accurate, you are Refill Master

462
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:14,371
but you are also not.

463
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:17,041
Please look at this.

464
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:22,012
These are reviews written by
Refill Master, which we printed out.

465
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,716
I realized something
when I was reading them.

466
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:26,750
Ms. Ishiko.

467
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:27,685
Yes.

468
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,690
Actually, the reviews have
different writing styles.

469
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:35,459
This review writes "delicious"
in Kanji characters,

470
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:37,695
but this one writes it in Hiragana.

471
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:41,332
What I just pointed out
is consistent within each article,

472
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:44,034
but it differs depending on the article.

473
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,670
And the one
that writes "delicious" in Kanji

474
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:50,007
adds the "o" prefix,
like in "o-miso" and "o-shoyu."

475
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:54,945
Whereas the one written in hiragana
doesn't add a prefix.

476
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:59,016
Additionally,
in a Yamagata cuisine restaurant's review,

477
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,219
Refill Master wrote here
that she's from Yamagata.

478
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:05,990
But Satsuki, you're not from Yamagata.
Are you?

479
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:07,658
That's--

480
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,793
Based on this information,

481
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,730
we came to the conclusion
that there are two Refill Masters.

482
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:14,465
One of them is Satsuki.

483
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:16,066
And the other person is

484
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,837
someone who wrote that
she's from Yamagata on her social media…

485
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,873
I'm sorry, it's me.

486
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:25,743
I wanted to say it.

487
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,112
Refill Master is a handle

488
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:32,483
that Satsuki and I use to write reviews
on restaurants we've been to.

489
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:35,719
I asked Satsuki to post this.

490
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:36,654
But why?

491
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,691
I love Inside
and I know you care about it too.

492
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,995
He went around visiting farmers

493
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:48,032
<i>looking for good vegetables and suppliers</i>

494
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,300
<i>to support the restaurant.</i>

495
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:56,573
And he passed on that information
to Satsuki to let his father know.

496
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,043
What? So that was…

497
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:06,950
You figured if the restaurant's reputation
spread and sales increased,

498
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:12,756
Mr. Kayama would admit
that Hiroshi's arguments were correct?

499
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,725
Yes.

500
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,263
I think your food is really delicious too.

501
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,331
I just wanted everyone to know.

502
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:26,236
But after reading
the horrible comments people wrote

503
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,806
for not being able to
get into the restaurant,

504
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,309
we realized that it's not so simple.

505
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:35,679
-I'm really sorry.
-Sorry.

506
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,750
I'll ask DotM to delete my post.

507
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:45,956
What do you think, Mr. Kayama?

508
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:49,960
They all just wanted to
protect the restaurant.

509
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,963
Maybe you'd like to withdraw the lawsuit?

510
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,635
I fully understand everyone's feelings.

511
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:00,304
I appreciate it.

512
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:04,708
But I'm sorry.

513
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,278
The store must remain hidden.

514
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:09,847
Why is that?

515
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:12,916
Um…

516
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:14,718
Dad!

517
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:27,431
It didn't work.

518
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:31,468
It's kind of frustrating
watching those two, isn't it?

519
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,005
Yes?

520
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:36,406
Nothing.

521
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,645
If the trial is going to continue,
we need something else.

522
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:46,350
But the fact that Refill Master
agreed to delete the post is a big step.

523
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:50,788
Whether it's a big step or not
depends on how things go, huh?

524
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,326
Shall we go?

525
00:29:58,562 --> 00:29:59,596
Shall we?

526
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:07,337
Oh.

527
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,707
I know we're in the middle of a lawsuit,

528
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,443
but we came to
discuss some matters with you first

529
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,580
in order to avoid
further futile conflicts.

530
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:20,350
I'd also like to settle this quickly.
What's this about?

531
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:27,024
We were able to meet Refill Master,
the person who first posted the review.

532
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,261
And she has decided to
submit a post-removal request herself.

533
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,096
I see.

534
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:35,933
Then, I believe Refill Master's post
will be removed

535
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,368
in accordance
with the terms and conditions.

536
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,003
Therefore,

537
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,141
if you could also delete
the restaurant information that she--

538
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,910
I cannot allow that.

539
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:52,850
Based on the terms and conditions,
that information has become

540
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,085
DotM's property the moment it was posted.

541
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:58,856
So it's not applicable
to an individual post-removal request.

542
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,126
I'll see you in court then.

543
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:07,631
This is bad. Really bad. Come on, think.

544
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,132
Please calm down.

545
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,001
We might lose this time.

546
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:14,071
There's no precedent
that overturned a case like this.

547
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,206
-Take a deep breath!
-What?

548
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,574
Now, inhale.

549
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:20,911
And exhale.

550
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:23,347
Good.

551
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,416
Do you have any ideas?

552
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,421
USHIO

553
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,862
UMAREPO LAWSUIT GARNERS ATTENTION

554
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:40,597
Hello. It's Sadai.

555
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:42,432
Are you sure everything is good?

556
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:46,336
Yes, sir. Lawyers usually
avoid the word "definitely."

557
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:50,173
But I'll definitely win this case.

558
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:12,829
SECOND ORAL PROCEEDINGS

559
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,498
The plaintiff has voluntarily disclosed

560
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:18,201
the restaurant's information
to the public in the past.

561
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,736
Meaning,

562
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:23,206
he himself gave up the business interest
that he wanted to protect.

563
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:26,176
Such a contradictory claim
by the plaintiff

564
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,612
does not deserve legal protection.

565
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:34,384
Hence, we strongly argue that
the plaintiff's claim should be dismissed.

566
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,485
That'll be all.

567
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,056
Well then. Plaintiff and defendant,

568
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:43,593
can we agree that the arguments
are concluded and proceed to the judgment?

569
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:49,199
Your Honor.

570
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,270
Plaintiff's closing argument
is as stated earlier.

571
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:58,909
However, could you allow me
to add a little more to that argument?

572
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:01,712
Alright. Go ahead.

573
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:08,785
I believe…

574
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,322
just as there is the right to know,

575
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,361
there is also the right to be unknown.

576
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:21,298
That's how you start. Then…

577
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:26,470
Is it strange
to want to keep information private?

578
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:30,140
There are those who don't think it's
better to have their information spread.

579
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:33,877
There are those who are protected
by keeping their information hidden.

580
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,913
What the plaintiff wants to protect…

581
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,348
…are his customers.

582
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:43,086
Inside is only 33 square meters in size
and he runs it by himself.

583
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:46,089
Obviously, the number of customers
he can serve is limited.

584
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,692
So, he doesn't want too many customers.

585
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,995
Because that protects the customers
who come to the restaurant.

586
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,398
He wants to look them in the eye,
talk to them…

587
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:57,701
…and serve them food and drinks
that they'd enjoy.

588
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,469
He wants to face each customer.

589
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:02,305
That's the plaintiff's way.

590
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:04,174
Is it wrong…

591
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:08,545
to want to make a customer,
who is sitting in front of you, happy?

592
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:13,417
I'd like everyone here
to think about that question once again.

593
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:17,788
That'll be all.

594
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:21,958
Your Honor.
May I speak a few words as well?

595
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,193
Go ahead.

596
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:28,198
That was a lovely speech. However…

597
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:30,100
this is a courtroom.

598
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:35,872
It's a place to argue the interpretation
and application of existing laws.

599
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:39,943
If you want to make the handling of
information, like this one, an issue,

600
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,845
that's for legislation.

601
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,714
A job for the Diet, who changes the law.

602
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:50,220
If you want to change the law itself,
maybe you should talk to politicians.

603
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:55,992
That'll be all.

604
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,542
That was a lot of spectators.

605
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:17,814
I guess many people want to <i>know</i>
who'll win this case.

606
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:20,083
It seems so.

607
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,154
I'll see you at the judgment then.

608
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:38,401
Your sad look was great, Mr. Kayama.

609
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:40,670
Yeah? But will this really work?

610
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,739
Now, we just wait.

611
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:52,649
<i>Umarepo is a restaurant guide website</i>
<i>managed by DotM</i>

612
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,584
<i>and is used by people of all ages.</i>

613
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,820
<i>That website is pretty useful.</i>

614
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:01,591
<i>But that "right to be unknown" statement</i>
<i>made me think things over.</i>

615
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,193
In today's internet society,

616
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,229
once information is spread,
it remains online forever.

617
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:08,698
My heart aches for the restaurant owner.

618
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:12,169
<i>You're right. I feel sorry for him too.</i>

619
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:19,142
I believe we still have
a good chance of winning--

620
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:23,413
For companies like ours,
just winning the trial isn't good enough.

621
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,149
We're being bombarded with complaints.

622
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,386
I'm sorry.

623
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:32,656
Look.

624
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:36,092
This, this, and this too.

625
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,261
They're all sympathetic to the plaintiff.

626
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:39,396
Right.

627
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:43,567
S-So,
don't be upset even if you lose the trial.

628
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,569
You came all the way to say that?

629
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:48,171
Yes. I was worried about the two of you.

630
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,574
Please don't worry.

631
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:56,580
Our goal is to protect
the client's interests.

632
00:36:56,646 --> 00:37:00,383
The opponent is a company and they put
great importance on public image.

633
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,986
Therefore, by almost losing the trial,

634
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,989
we thought we could get the public
on our side.

635
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,658
So, Ishiko approached the press

636
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:11,127
and asked Satsuki
to gather her writer friends

637
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:13,563
to spread the word about this trial.

638
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,965
-That's right.
-Is that so?

639
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,802
Which means,
that for this trial, we lose to win.

640
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,639
The final touch isn't done yet though.

641
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,641
It should be soon.

642
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,443
Huh?

643
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,380
-See?
-Is it him?

644
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,983
Here it comes.

645
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,220
Hello, this is Ushio Law Firm.

646
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:40,557
I'm Tanzawa from
the Law Office of Rick &amp; Benjamin.

647
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:43,593
Oh, thank you very much for calling.

648
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,496
Haneoka, is it? Please hold.

649
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:55,372
Yes, this is Haneoka. How may I help you?

650
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,140
<i>Um…</i>

651
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,376
I've already told the court, but…

652
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,712
Yes, what is it?

653
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,115
After some discussion,

654
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:08,952
DotM has decided to remove
all information on Inside from Umarepo

655
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,288
before the verdict is delivered.

656
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,794
<i>Therefore, could you withdraw</i>
<i>the compensation claim</i>

657
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:20,563
and the lawsuit as well?

658
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,865
Very well.

659
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:25,302
My client's biggest wish
is the removal of the information

660
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:28,505
and we've confirmed
he's willing to give up the compensation.

661
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:30,073
So, we'll accept your offer.

662
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,677
Thank you very much.

663
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:37,647
Goodbye then.

664
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,182
<i>Mr. Tanzawa.</i>

665
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:44,220
Let's meet again in court.

666
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,390
Things will be different the next time.

667
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,161
Bring it o--

668
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,262
Yeah!

669
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,630
Geez.

670
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,632
Yes!

671
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:56,666
He's back.

672
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:06,009
Hey, welcome.

673
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,011
Why did you call us here?

674
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:10,113
-Here.
-Thank you.

675
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,383
-Um, could you tell me?
-Huh? Tell you what?

676
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,518
Why the restaurant must be hidden.

677
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:17,320
Right.

678
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:20,790
Mr. Kayama told me to ask you
if I really wanted to know.

679
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:22,492
I see.

680
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:28,298
The truth is, it was actually his wife
who told him to open that restaurant.

681
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,032
Huh?

682
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:34,604
She saw him working himself like a robot
at a trading company day after day

683
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,407
and told him to open the restaurant
he had always dreamed of.

684
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:39,242
<i>A hidden restaurant?</i>

685
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,111
<i>That was her idea too.</i>

686
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:45,582
<i>Because if the restaurant got too busy,</i>
<i>he'd overwork himself again.</i>

687
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:48,385
So basically, Mr. Kayama

688
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,323
wanted to keep the restaurant that way
to protect his wife's wishes.

689
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,392
I see.

690
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,264
I see. It was Mom…

691
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:06,436
But I was thinking of accepting
reservations for new customers.

692
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:09,672
Just three groups per day.

693
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,177
Like you said,

694
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:20,316
the restaurant will taper off
if I rely on regulars alone.

695
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,155
It's been a while
since you ate something here.

696
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:26,990
I came up with a new dish.

697
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:28,725
I want you to try it.

698
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:30,860
The three of you.

699
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:44,307
But after hearing Hiroshi's thoughts,
he said he'll change his ways a little.

700
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:47,410
Oh, really? That's great.

701
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:50,980
Well…

702
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:57,854
it's not like
either of them was wrong to begin with.

703
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:03,259
Maybe it's important for both sides
to compromise a little.

704
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,096
Are you saying that to me?

705
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:09,032
Not really.

706
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:14,537
But I'm jealous. To be able to
talk to your parents like that.

707
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:15,472
What?

708
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,843
It's pointless talking to my parents.

709
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:27,283
Ooh, drinking it in one go is torture.

710
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,118
-Yeah.
-I'm off.

711
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:30,787
-See you.
-See you.

712
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,822
-See you.
-See you.

713
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:46,336
-Dad.
-Hey.

714
00:41:58,147 --> 00:41:58,982
Um…

715
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,585
I know it's long overdue, but…

716
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:09,225
I put you and your mom
through a lot of hardships.

717
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:11,094
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,536
From now on,
if there's anything you want me to change,

719
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:22,372
I promise to do everything I can--

720
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:23,273
No.

721
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:32,448
No.

722
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,054
Out of all the lawyers…

723
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:42,926
you are the one that I admire.

724
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,932
Please stay the way you are.

725
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:51,167
I, too…

726
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,305
will continue to nag you.

727
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:08,117
I bought some Japanese traditional sweets.
Let's eat.

728
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:11,387
Dad.

729
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:17,493
Have a seat.

730
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,531
I'll get them.

731
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:55,932
<i>About these hidden restaurants</i>
<i>that don't even put up a signboard…</i>

732
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:58,401
<i>Their information is being shared</i>
<i>on review websites.</i>

733
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:00,670
<i>On one hand, there's freedom of speech.</i>

734
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,006
<i>That balance is very difficult to…</i>

735
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:24,861
I'm guessing it's about time
you've done everything you wanted to do.

736
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:27,096
Right?

737
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:28,998
The firm you're at now

738
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,835
is not good enough for you.

739
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,675
I've talked to a different firm for you.

740
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:43,012
Keep next Tuesday afternoon open.

741
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,783
D-Dad…

742
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,391
Mr. Ao Oba?

743
00:44:55,458 --> 00:45:00,129
Could you come to the police station
regarding the arson last night?

744
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:09,205
<i>Oba's been arrested.</i>

745
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:10,406
You started the fire?

746
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:11,374
I've got nothing to say.

747
00:45:11,441 --> 00:45:13,242
If only I wasn't a paralegal, right?

748
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:14,711
I want to believe he didn't do it too.

749
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:16,612
Oba killed my husband.

750
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,748
<i>It's hard to collect evidence.</i>

751
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,183
You're all a bunch of fools!

752
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:21,984
Did you kill someone?

753
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:22,952
