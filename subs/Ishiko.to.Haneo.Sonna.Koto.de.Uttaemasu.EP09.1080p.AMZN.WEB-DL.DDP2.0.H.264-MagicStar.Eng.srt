1
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,417
Mr. Ao Oba?

2
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,219
Yes.

3
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:22,690
Could you come to the police station
regarding the arson last night?

4
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,059
This is you, isn't it?

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,129
Is that you?

6
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,444
I…

7
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,549
I've no intention of switching firms.

8
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,450
Right.

9
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,423
You'll be able to use your ability
to the fullest over there.

10
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,624
But I don't want--

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,391
Yoshio!

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,334
Maybe not right now.

13
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,470
But you will.

14
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:13,140
Here. Your favorite jelly from Kinpakuya.

15
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,614
How long will he continue to
see me as the child I was…

16
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,420
ISHI

17
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,692
You know, today is a Saturday.

18
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,994
Mr. Oba's been arrested.

19
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,663
<i>Huh?</i>

20
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,299
He's in a detention center right now.

21
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,637
Huh? What? Why?

22
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,640
It seems to be an arson case,
but I don't know the details.

23
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,143
I'm on my way now.

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,145
SENOO POLICE STATION

25
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,250
Press this button when you're done.

26
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,329
You've been through a lot.

27
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:11,866
So,

28
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,101
what happened?

29
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,638
How were you falsely arrested?

30
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,843
I did it.

31
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,847
You mean you started the fire?

32
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,617
Yes.

33
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:34,822
Why?

34
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,994
Why won't say anything?

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,895
I've…

36
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,602
I've got nothing to say.

37
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,008
Hey…

38
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:56,877
What?

39
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,485
How was Mr. Oba?

40
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,188
He didn't do it, did he?

41
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,390
He said he did.

42
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,526
Then he kept his silence.

43
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,830
I don't know what's going on.

44
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,401
Please take a look at this.

45
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,341
<i>In a park in Senoo City of Tokyo,</i>
<i>a public toilet was set on fire</i>

46
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,611
<i>and an unidentified body was found</i>
<i>in the remnants of the fire.</i>

47
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,380
Did you kill and burn the victim?

48
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,249
<i>The arrested suspect is</i>

49
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:38,352
<i>a 26-year-old office worker</i>
<i>who lives in Toda, Saitama.</i>

50
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,688
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>the security camera</i>

51
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:45,426
<i>caught the suspect running away</i>
<i>right after the fire started.</i>

52
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,762
<i>The police are also investigating him</i>
<i>on suspicion of murder.</i>

53
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,600
Did Ao really say that he did it?

54
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:58,138
Yes. I'm going to see him again today.

55
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,074
So, I'll keep you posted.

56
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,010
Thank you very much.

57
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,484
Excuse us.

58
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,752
Excuse us.

59
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,853
Ms. Ishida.

60
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,658
Ao told us that you two are dating.

61
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,828
Thank you for taking care of him.

62
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:26,066
I'm sorry we had to meet this way.

63
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,770
Please, don't be.
He's been very good to me too.

64
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,615
Would Oba do this?

65
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,251
But he did say he did it.

66
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,454
Just to be sure…

67
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,091
Mr. Oba really said "I did it," right?

68
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,660
Yeah.

69
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,430
If he just nodded to "Did you do it?"
that's different. Do you get that?

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,999
What? He said, "I did it."

71
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,069
In what kind of nuance?

72
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,137
Nuance?

73
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,373
Like, was he forced to say it?
Or was he stressed--

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,441
What?

75
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,752
I'm sorry. I'm taking it out on you.

76
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,991
We can't visit him
because he's keeping his silence.

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,429
There's nothing I can do.

78
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:31,965
Hey.

79
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,502
If only I wasn't a paralegal
to begin with, right?

80
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,838
If only I had the qualifications.

81
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,241
Let's calm down first.

82
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,077
Okay?

83
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,281
I know you're upset.

84
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,217
I'm really upset.

85
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,587
I want to believe he didn't do it too.

86
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,224
But if I act out of my feelings,
you'll be like,

87
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,193
it's against Lawyer Ethics.

88
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:01,729
Right?

89
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,035
I'll go see him until he talks.

90
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,939
As many times as it takes.

91
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,380
Okay.

92
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,727
<i>The police are interrogating</i>
<i>the arson suspect</i>

93
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,629
<i>and trying to identify the body…</i>

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,135
Here.

95
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,978
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE
MR. YOSHIKI TAKAOKA

96
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,983
You seem to be having a hard time
preparing for your case.

97
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,887
It's a fraud case,
so it's hard to collect evidence.

98
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,024
Well, I'll just do what I can.

99
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,326
One step at a time.

100
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,331
Yes. Oh, hello.

101
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,601
Yes, I'm sorry. Thank you.

102
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,672
About that case, right?
Yes, thank you very much.

103
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:26,513
<i>Mr. Mikogami, my childhood friend is sad</i>
<i>because she can't see her busy boyfriend.</i>

104
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,782
<i>What should I say to her?</i>

105
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,853
MIKOGAMI'S CONSULTATION ROOM

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,789
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>She's sad because she can't see him.</i>

107
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:40,394
<i>But doesn't that also mean</i>
<i>she was able to reaffirm her love for him?</i>

108
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,798
Sorry for the sudden visit.

109
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,168
I came up with something I could do
as a paralegal.

110
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,507
-Come in.
-Oh, no.

111
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,509
It's against my rules, so here's fine.

112
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,744
Is it the time to be saying that?

113
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,147
It's me. Nothing's gonna happen.

114
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,519
Do that outside.

115
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,121
Thanks for having me.

116
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:15,295
You're currently in a situation
where you can't meet Oba, right?

117
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:16,897
Yes.

118
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:21,401
Maybe it was a good thing because
you're able to reaffirm your love for him.

119
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,302
What?

120
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,405
Right, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

121
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,007
So, what were you saying?

122
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,442
Mr. Haneoka.

123
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,845
I need a favor from you.

124
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,619
SENOO POLICE STATION

125
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,355
There's no deciding factor to rule it as

126
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,258
incident or accident,
so police are looking into both.

127
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,094
Did you kill someone?

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,701
You won't talk, huh?

129
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,346
This is a letter from Ishiko.

130
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,391
"Mr. Oba, are you alright?"

131
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,229
"The fact that
you're keeping your silence…"

132
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:27,534
"…probably means you have a reason
why you can't tell us so easily."

133
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:32,439
"But we've seen the kind of person you are
through working with you

134
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,979
and through spending time together."

135
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,750
"We've seen you fight hard
to save your friend at work."

136
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,221
"You tried to make us laugh
when we were feeling down."

137
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,160
"How you try to explain something
but your feeling comes first

138
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,228
and you can't explain it properly."

139
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,366
"But because of that,
it gets through to people."

140
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,704
"You're genuine, so you're honest about
everything even if it could hurt you."

141
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,671
"When surprised…"

142
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,606
"…your reaction…"

143
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,175
"…is so big that it surprises us."

144
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,711
"Because we know many qualities of yours,

145
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,150
we think that you're keeping your silence
for the right reason."

146
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:22,055
<i>"And we're very worried that</i>
<i>you might be suffering</i>

147
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,825
<i>because of that reason."</i>

148
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,200
"Whatever reason you may have…"

149
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,003
"…we want to help you."

150
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,507
"Mr. Oba,

151
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,712
please trust Mr. Haneoka and me."

152
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:53,553
"We cannot help you unless you speak up."

153
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,394
"It's my turn now
to offer my umbrella to you."

154
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,933
<i>"You helped me when I was soaking wet."</i>

155
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:12,239
"So, we will shelter you
from the rain this time."

156
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,614
"When everything is over and you're free…"

157
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,250
"…let's have a meal together again."

158
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm so sorry!

159
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,136
For not talking.

160
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,311
All this time, I didn't know what to do.

161
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,081
But…

162
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,485
can I trust you two
and tell you everything?

163
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,489
Of course.

164
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,426
<i>I…</i>

165
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,999
<i>I wanted to protect my little brother.</i>

166
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,570
I'm home.

167
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,474
<i>That night, I happened to be</i>
<i>back at my parent's place.</i>

168
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,076
Mom? Mom?

169
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,412
<i>My brother took my jacket for his walk.</i>

170
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,715
And he came back about an hour later.

171
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,718
There was a loud noise at the door

172
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,423
<i>and when I went to see,</i>
<i>he looked scared and also injured.</i>

173
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,859
<i>I knew something had happened.</i>

174
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:44,498
<i>But he was too terrified to talk.</i>

175
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:48,335
<i>The next day, when they told me</i>
<i>I was caught on security camera,</i>

176
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,838
<i>I remembered</i>
<i>that my brother was wearing my jacket.</i>

177
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,509
And you thought your brother had done it.

178
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,612
Yes.

179
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,351
I want to believe that he didn't do it.

180
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,154
But a part of me isn't sure
and I'm really confused.

181
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:08,989
But…

182
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,329
I cannot let them interrogate my brother.

183
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,230
Sorry.

184
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:23,837
I have siblings too,
but why are you so protective of him?

185
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,773
<i>My brother, Taku…</i>

186
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,011
<i>He was born with an inability</i>
<i>to interact with people.</i>

187
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,214
<i>He can't even go out during the day.</i>

188
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,384
<i>That's why he takes walks late at night.</i>

189
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,188
<i>He won't be able to go through</i>
<i>an interrogation.</i>

190
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,460
I'll remain to be the suspect.

191
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,733
If I tell the police I didn't do it,
Taku will be arrested.

192
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:04,311
So, could you and Ishiko prove
that Taku is innocent

193
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,513
on my behalf?

194
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,115
No, wait. Hang on. That's impossible.

195
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,651
I mean, you've already confessed.

196
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,189
Even if we did prove
your brother's innocence,

197
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,026
that doesn't mean
we can overturn your confession.

198
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,963
You could even get convicted.
It's too risky.

199
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,932
I know that it's a huge risk.

200
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,835
But I have to protect Taku.

201
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,049
You keep your silence.

202
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,953
Don't answer anything they ask you.

203
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,322
However this case develops,
don't say a word.

204
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,060
Then, at least,
they won't look into your brother.

205
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,797
Meanwhile, we'll do whatever we can.

206
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,533
So, hang tight until then.

207
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:04,771
Okay.

208
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:05,872
But…

209
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:11,778
I can't assume that your brother
didn't do it without investigating.

210
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,014
So…

211
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,919
we will investigate it
from a fair point of view.

212
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:21,621
Yes.

213
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:26,526
Also, when your detention period expires
and they decide to prosecute you,

214
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,431
I will tell them that you didn't do it.

215
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:35,435
As a lawyer,
I can't say you did when you didn't.

216
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,337
Is that alright?

217
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,928
<i>We were hoping to talk to Taku</i>
<i>about that day.</i>

218
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,733
Taku, you have guests.

219
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,336
They're Ao's friends.

220
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,480
Hello.

221
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,282
Hello.

222
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,085
I heard you're a calligrapher.

223
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,553
Yes.

224
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,989
Have you always been good at it?

225
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,392
I don't know.

226
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,495
These brushes are amazing.

227
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,396
Are they all--

228
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,099
No! No, don't.

229
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,368
Sorry. I'm sorry.

230
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,178
We'd like to ask you something.

231
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,347
Four nights ago…

232
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:59,019
where were you and what were you doing?

233
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,790
I heard you went for a walk.

234
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,501
I'm sorry. Please don't force yourself.

235
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,337
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

236
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,039
AO

237
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,015
What did you think?

238
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,552
I'm not sure yet.

239
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,790
Whether it's arson or murder,

240
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,992
he didn't seem like the type.

241
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,327
We can't be sure yet.

242
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,362
Yes.

243
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,867
We need to get something out of him
for Oba's sake.

244
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:50,870
Taku.

245
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,307
He doesn't seem ready to talk yet.

246
00:17:58,812 --> 00:17:59,646
You know…

247
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,651
I never knew why I freeze up
or why my hand trembles.

248
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,486
But I think it's my dad.

249
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:07,821
What?

250
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,659
Ever since I was a kid, he told me
not to show my emotional swings to people.

251
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,161
Emotional swings?

252
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,062
Yeah.

253
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:20,633
He said there are people who'll take
advantage of you when you're agitated.

254
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,471
I wonder if it has to do with his job.

255
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:30,310
And now that I've become a lawyer,
there's nowhere to run in court, right?

256
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,080
I have to face the pressure
no matter what.

257
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:39,886
But you and your dad are the opposite.

258
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,290
When I'm agitated, you're right by my side
trying to support me.

259
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,697
The other day, when my hand trembled
for the first time in a while,

260
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,434
I asked myself, "It hasn't happened
in so long, so why now?"

261
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,938
Then I realized you weren't by my side,

262
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,640
Ishiko.

263
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,445
Why am I talking about this?

264
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,248
So, you see…

265
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,650
What I'm trying to say is that

266
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,554
I think Taku will
eventually open up to you

267
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,890
because you're a compassionate person.

268
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,325
So, let's keep trying. Okay?

269
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:20,927
You want some tea?

270
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,401
Here.

271
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,544
<i>You're all a bunch of fools!</i>

272
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,978
Who got annoyed?

273
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,514
That's a bad sign.

274
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,653
I believe that not even one percent
of your emotions are needed for business.

275
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,822
Anger, agitation, anxiety.

276
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,957
They're all a burden.

277
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,561
That's why losers lose many times.

278
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,898
<i>What clouds your judgment is emotion.</i>

279
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,672
The Ministry of the Environment requested
you to be their standing director.

280
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,341
Sure, anytime.

281
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,314
There's a smoking area
on the first floor too.

282
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,383
If people saw me, it'll ruin my image.

283
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,618
Eco-friendly and clean.

284
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:22,855
I see.

285
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,724
Excuse me.

286
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,644
<i>A man found a large snake</i>

287
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,147
<i>buried in a clay pipe</i>
<i>at a riverbed in the center of Machida.</i>

288
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,417
Oh, hey. Are you eating that
with chopsticks?

289
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,853
<i>The snake was six meters long…</i>

290
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,388
I-I split them for you.

291
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,190
Thank you.

292
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,359
-It's Shiozaki!
-Huh?

293
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,994
Hi there.

294
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,962
I'm here for the empty plates.

295
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,332
I'm sorry. We've been busy
so we're about to have lunch now.

296
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,600
Thank you for the food.

297
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,669
-Sorry.
-Oh, right.

298
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,938
Then, can I eat here too?

299
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,874
-Man, it's so busy today.
-Here.

300
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,809
That's a good thing.

301
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,345
I'm thankful
we got more regular customers,

302
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,049
but some of them talk endlessly
and it's a hassle.

303
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,718
Is he whining?

304
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,819
Please hear me out.

305
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,555
They're a married couple.
Mr. and Mrs. Matsuda…

306
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,857
Now he is.

307
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,392
Let's listen.

308
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,993
…they said they pick up trash.

309
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,995
<i>They are talking to the office worker</i>

310
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,032
<i>but he has remained silent</i>
<i>for the alleged murder.</i>

311
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:44,404
<i>The police have identified the body</i>
<i>as Riichiro Hyuga.</i>

312
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,973
<i>A taxi driver from Manabe, Saitama.</i>

313
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,544
<i>Gasoline has been found on his body.</i>

314
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,548
<i>-Police are looking into what happened.</i>
-Riichiro Hyuga.

315
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,451
<i>The president of the taxi company</i>
<i>where he worked at…</i>

316
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,988
I'd like to meet his family
and talk about the case.

317
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,656
I'm not sure.

318
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,458
<i>I doubt she'd want to.</i>

319
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,761
<i>In that case, as the prosecutor in charge,</i>
<i>I can't let you see her.</i>

320
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,931
<i>But we may need to talk about</i>
<i>compensation too.</i>

321
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,104
Oh, I'm Haneoka.

322
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,308
Thank you for taking the time.

323
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,545
I'm Haneoka from Ushio Law Firm.

324
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,713
I'm Aya Hyuga.

325
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,614
I'm Ishida, the paralegal.

326
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,019
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite
get my lunch break on time.

327
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,288
No problem. Please have a seat.

328
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,590
What would you like to drink?

329
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,427
I can't just ask for water, can I?

330
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,029
It's pricey here.

331
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,900
We asked you here, so it's on us.

332
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,603
Then I'll have a coffee.

333
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,239
-Excuse me, one coffee please.
-Sure.

334
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,474
One moment please.

335
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,979
Thank you very much for--

336
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:04,250
I also want to know
why my husband had to die.

337
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,522
The culprit.

338
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,592
What did he say?

339
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,395
About that…

340
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,898
The suspect hasn't spoken a word
and we don't know if he's involved--

341
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,633
Of course he's involved.

342
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,270
Oba killed my husband.

343
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,305
What makes you say that?

344
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,778
My husband was deceived by Green Estate.

345
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,814
We filed to cancel the contract
but they won't pay us back

346
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,350
and the police told us
it's not exactly fraud.

347
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,019
I'm sorry, what is Green Estate?

348
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,888
A real estate broker.

349
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,858
Huh? What?

350
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,727
Have you not looked into this?

351
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,862
We're terribly sorry.

352
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:57,303
My husband and I
were investing our retirement savings.

353
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,071
We even borrowed money for it.

354
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,976
That day,
my husband went to see President Oba.

355
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,848
Excuse me,
who do you mean by "President Oba"?

356
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,850
The president of Green Estate.

357
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,288
It's on the registration too. See?

358
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,191
PRESIDENT, AO OBA

359
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,328
I’m sure he got killed over the refund.

360
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,668
What is this? Did you know?

361
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:30,336
Oh, yes.

362
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:33,673
President Tone of Nakamaru,
the company I originally joined,

363
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,209
was also the president of its subsidiary,
Green Estate.

364
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,110
-Right.
-But President Tone…

365
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,513
He said he wants me
to run that company someday.

366
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,149
Huh? Why? So soon after you were hired?

367
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:47,820
Yes. I started working in September
and he told me so in November.

368
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,289
<i>Because I'm the ace of his company.</i>

369
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:51,657
And?

370
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:55,361
So, he said he'll register my name first
as the president.

371
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,029
And you agreed to it?

372
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,197
Yes.

373
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:02,134
I was happy he had high hopes for me
and I get an extra 100,000 per month--

374
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,336
You idiot!

375
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,740
You shouldn't fall for something so fishy.

376
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:09,876
What?

377
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,214
This Tone guy made you lend your name
for some kind of scheme.

378
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:21,587
I was being deceived?

379
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,489
Most likely.

380
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,895
So, I was betrayed again.

381
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,198
We'll look into this too.

382
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:37,370
So, Mr. Hyuga saw the registration
and went to see you, the president.

383
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,774
But he mistook Taku for you
because you two are similar in stature.

384
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,511
Taku hasn't said anything yet?

385
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,981
No, not yet.

386
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,553
So it was my fault.

387
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,957
I thought I was protecting Taku,

388
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,360
but he got caught up in all this
because…

389
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,431
You said Taku was injured
when he came home, right?

390
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:06,332
<i>Yes.</i>

391
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,771
Mr. Hyuga tried to set Taku on fire
out of resentment.

392
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,409
But Taku resisted
and the fire spread to Mr. Hyuga himself.

393
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:23,249
If this hypothesis is correct,
Taku may have acted in self-defense.

394
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,918
SEVEN DAYS
UNTIL THE DETENTION PERIOD EXPIRES

395
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,720
Self-defense?

396
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,890
-Yeah.
-But we only have a week.

397
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:36,026
I'll investigate if Mr. Hyuga
prepared the gasoline himself.

398
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:39,363
I'll continue on my side too,
but the office is always empty.

399
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,398
-Neighbors haven't seen anyone either.
<i>-I see.</i>

400
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,299
GREEN ESTATE

401
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,636
I'll stop by Mr. Oba's parent's house
when I'm done here.

402
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:47,504
<i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

403
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,709
Ever since Ao was arrested,

404
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,378
he's been writing
the same character again and again.

405
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:58,182
The first character of Ao's name.

406
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:00,618
I doubt he knows about the case,

407
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:04,254
but maybe he's feeling something.

408
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:08,759
They used to talk on the phone
at least once a day.

409
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:25,843
Taku, there's something
I really need to ask you.

410
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:28,612
Okay.

411
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:33,417
What happened with Mr. Hyuga that night?

412
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:42,426
Taku, answer her.

413
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,795
Ao…

414
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:47,765
The character Ao has 13 strokes.

415
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,734
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:56,907 --> 00:28:02,312
We are almost ready to sue,
but we need something more solid.

417
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:03,747
It's already been a year.

418
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,115
Right.

419
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:07,484
Honestly, it's hard to make ends meet

420
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,853
and I need the money.

421
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,189
Please get my money back now!

422
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,124
Alright. Okay.

423
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,627
I'll be off.

424
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:27,171
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE
MR. YOSHIKI TAKAOKA

425
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,011
-Dad.
-Hm?

426
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:38,082
Mr. Takaoka's case you've been working on.
Tell me the details.

427
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:40,184
Mr. Takaoka, a chiropractor,

428
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,287
was approached by his customer,
who works at Yotsuboshi Housing

429
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:45,622
about real estate investment.

430
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,759
And he was offered
an apartment in Ishikawa.

431
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:53,997
The price was much lower than the market
and he could be an owner.

432
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,966
When he hesitated, he was told that

433
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,837
he can expect immediate rental income
as the rooms are already rented out

434
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,238
and he won't make a loss.

435
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,806
So, he signed the contract.

436
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:03,874
That's right.

437
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:07,044
But he didn't visit because
it was already occupied and it was far.

438
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,178
No, he didn't see it.

439
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:12,015
Mr. Hyuga had also bought a property
under the same circumstances.

440
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:12,916
What?

441
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:16,186
Mr. Hyuga bought
a 40-million-yen apartment in Toyama,

442
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:17,521
but it's pretty much the same.

443
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,758
Here, the residents moved out
one after another

444
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:24,595
within six months of signing the contract
and the rental income became zero.

445
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:25,763
What?

446
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,397
When he entered the empty room,

447
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,634
the plumbing was in shambles
and needed repair.

448
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,170
Hmm, it's the same.

449
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:36,774
They consulted the police,
but couldn't proof that it was fraud.

450
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,543
Their methods are too similar.

451
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,044
Yeah, indeed it is.

452
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:45,449
Maybe this fraud is being manualized.

453
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:46,650
Excuse me. Hi.

454
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:47,551
Hello.

455
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:49,119
The other day at the park…

456
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:52,756
Did this man come
to fill gasoline in his car?

457
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,826
These are the videos.

458
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:56,727
Thank you.

459
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,563
By the way, which is Mr. Hyuga's car?

460
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,431
It's the one at the back.

461
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:18,081
Mr. Hyuga was
draining gasoline from a truck.

462
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,985
I believe he went to see Mr. Oba with it.

463
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:30,160
If you know something, please tell us.

464
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:37,034
Actually, when Mr. Hyuga was in touch
with the real estate broker last March,

465
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,870
Mr. Oba wasn't working at Green Estate.

466
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,271
What?

467
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:45,676
At that time, he was working
at this used car dealership.

468
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:50,180
Meaning, he wasn't involved with
Green Estate--

469
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:52,049
But I checked. He was the president.

470
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,150
When was that?

471
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,753
Last December.

472
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,089
Right after we felt we were conned.

473
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:06,430
Mr. Oba became the president
last November. And in name only.

474
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,267
He's only an employee
of a company in a different industry.

475
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:15,239
We think he was used as a scapegoat
for when things went wrong.

476
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:19,676
You mean…

477
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:26,416
my husband resented Mr. Oba
for something he had nothing to do with

478
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:30,954
and now he's being accused of murder?

479
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:33,423
That's right.

480
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:41,231
If you know something,
could you please tell us?

481
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,255
The day after…

482
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,759
my husband went to see Mr. Oba…

483
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,396
I found this in the drawer.

484
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:24,071
At first,
it seems he was planning on killing him.

485
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:31,645
But he knew if he committed murder,
it would cause me trouble.

486
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,517
So he killed himself
for the insurance money.

487
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:48,862
"Aya, I'm going to set myself on fire
in front of Oba and kill myself."

488
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,667
"If they think my
suicide is due to a nervous breakdown,

489
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,369
you'll get the insurance money."

490
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:01,908
"I'm sorry
this is the only way I could think of."

491
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:04,778
"Aya,

492
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:10,484
you cannot tell this to anyone."

493
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:13,453
"Aya."

494
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,558
I WANT YOU TO LIVE ON
WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

495
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:23,030
I'm sorry I hid this from you.

496
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:24,865
Don't be…

497
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:31,204
Please have some tea.

498
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,673
I hoped that the bad guy,

499
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,810
who deceived us…

500
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,551
would be falsely charged with murder.

501
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:48,789
I thought

502
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:53,226
I'd kill him for my husband.

503
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:58,165
I can't believe I had the wrong person.

504
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,702
If you'd reveal all that,

505
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:04,871
Mr. Oba will be saved.

506
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:14,147
I'll tell them everything.

507
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,254
I need to confirm this,

508
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:25,592
but the insurance money
will no longer be paid.

509
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:34,968
My husband was a very kind man.

510
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:40,140
So, I don't think
he'd want an innocent person

511
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:44,478
to be falsely charged.

512
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,383
It's the same character,
but each and every one is different.

513
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:52,652
I like them all.

514
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:39,499
Got it.

515
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:46,807
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

516
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:50,076
I'm sorry I didn't submit this.

517
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:51,144
It's okay.

518
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:55,649
We'll do a handwriting analysis
to check if it's Mr. Hyuga's letter.

519
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:58,685
-Oh, it is.
-Even if it is.

520
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,458
Unfortunately, a suicide note isn't enough
to conclude this as a suicide.

521
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:08,295
I guess we'd need an eyewitness testimony.

522
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:11,398
We only have one more day.

523
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,168
I'll go see Taku now
and see if he's ready to talk.

524
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,575
But if I can't get anything out of him,
I'll tell them you didn't do it.

525
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:25,412
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

526
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:27,814
All of it…

527
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:33,820
Right. You should be sorry for
lending your name without much thought

528
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:40,560
and for lying that you did it,
even though you have your reasons.

529
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:43,997
But there's no need
to feel remorse for anything else.

530
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,403
You're being
a little too hard on yourself.

531
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:58,545
<i>And the one who should be blamed</i>
<i>is not you nor Mr. Hyuga.</i>

532
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:01,214
It's those who deceive others.

533
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,026
How's it going, Shoko?

534
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:15,896
I'm still looking for a witness, but…

535
00:37:15,962 --> 00:37:17,364
I see.

536
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:20,267
<i>Something wrong?</i>

537
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:21,801
No.

538
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:36,082
We don't have enough evidence to prove
that the deceased committed suicide.

539
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:39,486
Most importantly,
Oba has admitted to the crime once.

540
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,257
I didn't think he did it for Taku.

541
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:47,027
Did he think…

542
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:51,965
we'd be happy
if he took the blame for Taku?

543
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:59,205
OBA

544
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:04,945
<i>Did Taku really do something?</i>

545
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:08,548
<i>We're not sure.</i>
<i>That's why we'd like to speak to him.</i>

546
00:38:08,615 --> 00:38:13,086
If it's ruled as arson murder,
he'll receive a heavy sentence.

547
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:16,556
<i>We need Taku to tell us what he knows.</i>

548
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:24,164
Hello, Oba's residence.

549
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,899
<i>I'm with the Senoo police department.</i>

550
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:29,536
Mr. Sagane.

551
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,673
I'm his mother.

552
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,774
Um…

553
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:36,910
They're from a law firm.

554
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:38,278
Oh, hello.

555
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:41,548
Um… Did he come here by himself?

556
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,916
Yes, just suddenly.

557
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:46,252
He said he saw what happened
at the park and he went quiet.

558
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:47,854
We weren't sure…

559
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,761
If there's something he'd like to testify,
please summarize it first.

560
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,405
Please wait a little longer.

561
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,894
My brother…

562
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,931
was just trying to protect me.

563
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,569
<i>That day, I…</i>

564
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,004
Hey, Oba!

565
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:42,375
This is all your fault!

566
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:45,378
I'll never forgive you guys!

567
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:58,558
My life is ruined…

568
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:09,369
Then are you the person
who ran from the park?

569
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:10,270
Yes.

570
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:14,207
You mean, Mr. Hyuga set himself on fire
after he verbally abused you?

571
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:19,145
Tell us.

572
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:26,186
Taku. Taku, look at my eyes.

573
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:34,761
Well, that testimony seems plausible
given the circumstantial evidence.

574
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:36,830
Of course, we must verify--

575
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:39,699
There was someone else.

576
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:57,684
Someone was at the park.

577
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:02,922
Who else was there?

578
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:08,328
He lit the fire.

579
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,163
Who did?

580
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,732
-Tell us!
-I don't know. I…

581
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,534
Please stop.

582
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:16,903
Let's calm down.

583
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:21,407
DETENTION EXPIRATION DAY

584
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:25,845
<i>We must reprimand Mr. Ao Oba</i>
<i>for perjuring himself,</i>

585
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:28,681
but after examining
Mr. Taku Oba's testimony,

586
00:41:28,748 --> 00:41:31,184
<i>we've decided not to prosecute him.</i>

587
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,124
Thank you very much.

588
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:15,195
Ishiko.

589
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,173
Oh.

590
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:29,142
Huh?

591
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,076
Thank goodness!

592
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:32,145
I'm so glad!

593
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:33,713
Uh, um…

594
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,683
Welcome back!

595
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:38,017
Excuse me.

596
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,119
-Hello?
-What? Don't ruin our moment.

597
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:41,054
Yeah, my moment.

598
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,955
Excuse me?

599
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:44,457
It's my moment. You did all of it.

600
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:45,959
You're not making sense.

601
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:47,961
He came towards me for a hug.

602
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:49,762
It was for me. How could you not tell?

603
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:51,965
It wasn't. I wanted to hug him anyway.

604
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,734
I wanted to say "Welcome back" to him too.

605
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:56,469
Say it now then! Go on!

606
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:58,905
It's not the right timing anymore!

607
00:42:58,972 --> 00:42:59,973
What? Are you being shy?

608
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,541
Thank you very much!

609
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,644
Thanks to you both,

610
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:08,715
my brother and I
didn't have to get arrested.

611
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:11,851
And I'm sorry.

612
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:16,289
About lying and for making you worry.

613
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,628
We were very worried.

614
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:23,429
I'm sorry.

615
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:28,434
But Taku did his best.

616
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:34,974
Let's break this hug.

617
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,210
Let us go, okay?

618
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:39,312
Oh, I'm sorry.

619
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,648
<i>And, Taku?</i>

620
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:45,652

00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,963
How about suing them together?
