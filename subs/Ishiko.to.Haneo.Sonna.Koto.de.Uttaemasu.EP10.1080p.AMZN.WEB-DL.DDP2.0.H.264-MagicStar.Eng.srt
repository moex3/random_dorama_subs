1
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,040
In the end,

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,210
those who are deceived
will continue to be deceived.

3
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,114
Those without power
can't obtain information.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,083
They have no knowledge,
so they continue to lose.

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,589
Have you heard of <i>Swimmy</i>?

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:26,127
That story of a group of
weak small fishes gathering together.

7
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:32,400
Are the weak small fishes still weak
even if tons of them gather together?

8
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,569
The picture book?

9
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,737
That's right.

10
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,205
The picture book.

11
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,508
Wataro, you say the funniest things.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,475
Do I?

13
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,178
Even if they form a group,

14
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,381
weak people will always be weak.

15
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,550
I guess so.

16
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,488
It won't be like a picture book, huh?

17
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,293
Talking about fish
made me want to eat one.

18
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,129
I'm craving rosy seabass.

19
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,699
"I'll be gone for a few days."

20
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,968
He won't reply to my messages.

21
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,838
Even though he has
Mr. Takaoka's case to work on.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,144
We are investigating the other person
mentioned in the testimony.

23
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,847
But the security camera
in the area only captured

24
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,583
about ten people walking by
before and after the incident.

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,853
And we haven't identified anyone
other than Mr. Taku Oba.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,124
The only thing left at the crime scene
were two charred oil lighters.

27
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,027
<i>This matches our eyewitness,</i>
<i>Mr. Taku Oba's testimony</i>

28
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,730
<i>that Mr. Hyuga tried to</i>
<i>set himself on fire but didn't succeed.</i>

29
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:41,402
And right after that, someone dropped
a blue lighter into the gasoline.

30
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,311
Several footprints
have been found on the scene,

31
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,079
<i>which we're rushing to identify.</i>

32
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,281
<i>We're also looking at the alibis</i>

33
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:58,085
<i>of people connected to Mr. Hyuga,</i>
<i>but we have nothing useful yet.</i>

34
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,721
<i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

35
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,058
My misunderstanding
caused you and your brother trouble.

36
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,062
It's fine.
My brother's innocence was proven

37
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,731
thanks to your testimony.

38
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:17,004
Due to the position we're in,
we can't exactly tell you to sue them.

39
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,174
So, I will.

40
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,744
How about you sue Green Estate?

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,849
I'm responsible for lending my name too.

42
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,719
I'll support you during the trial.

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,822
Well, but…

44
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,959
He's already quit the company
and resigned from the president position.

45
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,594
That's right. I'm unemployed.

46
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,466
We will prove that it's fraud
and get your money back.

47
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,836
What do you think?

48
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,841
Let's speak up together.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,215
I'd like to sue them.

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,617
Okay.

51
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,130
President Tone,
I'd like to speak with you.

52
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,865
This is Mr. Haneoka, a lawyer--

53
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,434
I have nothing to say to a lawyer.

54
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,303
You tricked me.

55
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,104
You've already quit. What is it?

56
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,473
My brother got caught up in this
because of me.

57
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,411
I won't let this slide.
I'll cooperate with the fraud victims too.

58
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,981
On what basis are you calling it fraud?

59
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,450
I'll sue you, asshole.

60
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,330
Let's fight this together.

61
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,413
How about suing them together?

62
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,652
You're both
victims of fraud by different companies.

63
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,721
But there are many similarities.

64
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,391
Such as the property's characteristics,
their method

65
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,693
and they used the same
renovation contractor.

66
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:26,066
From that, we think it might be
an integral fraud by the same group.

67
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,736
If we could proceed
with this as one lawsuit,

68
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:32,139
while clarifying the connection of
these two companies, we could--

69
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:36,610
If they'll compensate me earlier that way,
then please.

70
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,246
If this goes on any longer,

71
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,217
I'll have to sell my clinic
and live out on the street.

72
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,219
I'm in too.

73
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,154
Okay.

74
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,423
Then, we'll proceed with the preparations.

75
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,158
By the way…

76
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,729
Mr. Takaoka, do you know this man?

77
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,500
He was the president of Green Estate
when Mr. Hyuga was deceived.

78
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,235
No, I don't know him.

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,836
I see.

80
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,447
We might be jumping the gun,
but should we just file the lawsuit?

81
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:18,218
No! We don't have enough evidence to prove
that those two are connected.

82
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,188
Yeah. You haven't stopped me like that
in a while.

83
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,089
Alright!

84
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,125
What's wrong?

85
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,293
What's up?

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,597
Huh? Oh, I'm just happy
I get to be a part of this atmosphere.

87
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,699
"This atmosphere"?

88
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,599
Yes.

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,402
Your positions are different
but you're equal.

90
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,539
I've never seen that
in a workplace before.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,710
I'll make sure to get into
such a company next time.

92
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,978
Alright! Do your best.

93
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:45,879
I will!

94
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,215
But you have bad luck with companies.

95
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,651
Yeah, really. That's the problem.

96
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,819
-I'm home.
-Why…

97
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,257
Dad! Where have you been?

98
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,560
I was investigating.

99
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,627
For the fraud?

100
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,563
Yeah, can I sit first?

101
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,164
I'll tell you everything.

102
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,065
Is it your back?

103
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,301
No, it's my lower hip this time.

104
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,303
<i>Let me confirm.</i>

105
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,838
<i>For the past six months,</i>

106
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,908
<i>you've been going to the bar owned by</i>
<i>Yotsuboshi Housing's President Sakakibara</i>

107
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:19,213
<i>for information and became a regular,</i>
<i>while hiding your identity.</i>

108
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,214
<i>That's right.</i>

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,916
<i>The other day, the bartender told you that</i>

110
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,053
<i>President Sakakibara</i>
<i>often went to Ishikawa and Toyama</i>

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,355
<i>for business trips last year.</i>

112
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,825
<i>In hopes of finding evidence of him</i>
<i>purchasing old properties at low prices</i>

113
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,463
<i>and anything that could lead to fraud,</i>
<i>you went to those locations.</i>

114
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,664
<i>That's right.</i>

115
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:42,469
I bought their local specialty,
rosy seabass.

116
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,372
And they said this is good.
It's oil blotting paper.

117
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,807
You should've just told us.

118
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,412
Well, I knew it wouldn't be easy
to gather evidence.

119
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,884
And I thought you'd nag me and
tell me not to take the bullet train and--

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,952
I wouldn't say that.

121
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,322
Really? You wouldn't tell me to
take the overnight bus instead?

122
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,191
-She definitely would.
-I wouldn't.

123
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,393
And did you find something?

124
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,929
Well, you know. It's not that easy to--

125
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,063
Wasted expense.

126
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:14,935
Oh, by the way,
have you heard of Mr. Mikogami?

127
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,937
-The investor.
-Yes.

128
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:22,409
You know, Mr. Mikogami is a regular
at Mr. Sakakibara's bar.

129
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,947
So, I got to meet him
and he gave me advice on things.

130
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:30,083
And I saw his photo in Ishikawa.

131
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,320
Could you take a look?
This is Mr. Sakakibara, right?

132
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,724
And this guy. The one in the mirror.

133
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,360
If I zoom in, see?

134
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,662
-Oh.
-You're right.

135
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,864
-That's Mr. Mikogami, right?
-Oh!

136
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,866
This one is President Tone.

137
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,767
What?

138
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,036
I'm sure. With the vest and everything.

139
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,103
We got him!

140
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,539
Tone and Sakakibara are connected!

141
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,175
What does Mr. Mikogami
have to do with this?

142
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,645
We'll figure that out
after we file the lawsuit. Okay?

143
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,649
<i>Good job, me.</i>

144
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,220
A job well done!

145
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,323
It's an indisputable fact
that carbon neutrality must be implemented

146
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,893
as a weather change measure.

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,761
However!

148
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:19,700
Most people think that our country
and big companies will do it for us.

149
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,869
Through policymaking,

150
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,539
we need to change
the mindset of people and society.

151
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,382
AO

152
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,325
I filed the lawsuit.

153
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,361
Good job. Thanks.

154
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,864
But the more we look into it,
the more complex this fraud gets.

155
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,101
Yeah, they're skillfully using
the loopholes in the law.

156
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,869
I didn't know it was so clever.

157
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,338
Oba.

158
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,239
Yes.

159
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:03,443
Say you have more than enough savings
and you decide to buy an apartment.

160
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,344
Okay.

161
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,247
You'd want to
take a look at the rooms, right?

162
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,181
Of course.

163
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,316
So, you go and see it

164
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,320
and you found a fully renovated,
clean and stylish room.

165
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,122
The room of your dreams.

166
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,992
You can't see the other rooms
because it's currently occupied,

167
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,094
but of course they've been renovated too.

168
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:25,432
And if they say it's very popular,
so you need to sign the contract now

169
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,467
or you won't be able to buy it…

170
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,303
-I'll buy it.
-Wrong! Bad decision.

171
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,771
-Why?
-Bad decision.

172
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,740
Changing just one tatami mat
can be considered a renovation.

173
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,641
What?

174
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,376
You mean other than the nice room I saw,

175
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,079
others only had one tatami mat changed
and are in shambles?

176
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,814
-Yes.
-That's fraud.

177
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,918
But the police would blame you for
not checking and they won't do anything.

178
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:45,919
That's not fair.

179
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,756
There will always be cunning crooks
who exploit people.

180
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,526
I wonder if the contractor in Ishikawa

181
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,729
that renovated those two properties
is in on it.

182
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:56,897
That's the thing.

183
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:01,234
I doubt Green Estate nor Yotsuboshi
would do something risky like that.

184
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,570
If we were to attack,
it's that contractor.

185
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,707
But they're not picking up.

186
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,774
I see.

187
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:12,145
AYA HYUGA

188
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,046
<i>Hello.</i>

189
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,849
I'm thinking of withdrawing the lawsuit.

190
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,985
<i>Why is that?</i>

191
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,055
I've been getting harassing phone calls
from strangers.

192
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,660
<i>Saying, "It's your fault for investing,"</i>
<i>and "You brought this on yourself."</i>

193
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,164
When people ask me
if I'm not ashamed of making a scene,

194
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,200
I think that maybe I should be.

195
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,542
Ma'am, you should continue this trial.

196
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,145
You didn't make a bad investment.

197
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,947
<i>You were deceived.</i>

198
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:47,848
<i>Excuse me.</i>

199
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,484
We'll investigate the harassment
right away.

200
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,553
But…

201
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,454
<i>Um…</i>

202
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:59,393
Those people who are irresponsibly
criticizing you will not save you.

203
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,431
Please protect yourself by speaking up.

204
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,934
That way, we can be there for you.

205
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,141
Right.

206
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,210
<i>I'm sorry for being weak.</i>

207
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,145
It's fine.

208
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,481
Okay.

209
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,651
Despite the way I look, I also get weak--

210
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,787
S-She hung up.

211
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,721
So, it's this.

212
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,825
SENOO ARSON MURDER
BEREAVED FAMILY FACES CRITICISM

213
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,028
Oh, that might be our opponent's doing.

214
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:35,962
<i>What?</i>

215
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,232
<i>There's a lawyer named Inuzuka</i>
<i>on the defendant's team.</i>

216
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,967
<i>He's the boss of a big firm.</i>

217
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,172
<i>He's the type</i>
<i>who would do anything to win.</i>

218
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,873
He should quit already.

219
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,078
I hope she gets her smile back.

220
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,681
<i>Like it said in Mr. Hyuga's letter.</i>

221
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,350
Yeah.

222
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,757
Oh, there you are. The next meeting
is at the Prime Minister's office.

223
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,226
The Deputy Minister will be there too.

224
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,461
Okay.

225
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,103
No. This is bad. So bad.

226
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,338
I don't feel like we can win at all.

227
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,706
We can hear you.

228
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,243
But if we postpone the trial,
Mr. Takaoka will be in trouble.

229
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,879
Right.
We have to do something by tomorrow.

230
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,748
Tomorrow? Come on--

231
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,182
Let's calm down.

232
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,051
Inhale.

233
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,792
Haneo. One more time.

234
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,763
<i>Yeah?</i>

235
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,699
Huh? Oh, uh…

236
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,602
<i>Who is this? Stop calling.</i>

237
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,372
-Hello! Is this Mr. Akiyama--
-Ouch! Ow…

238
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,341
TRIAL DAY

239
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,079
So, you do own a suit.

240
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,680
Of course I do.

241
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,449
-Shall we?
-Yes.

242
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,287
Shoko will make it in time.

243
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,655
Yes.

244
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,527
ISHIKAWA PREFECTURE

245
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,427
ASUNARO REFORM

246
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,196
I think you knew it was fraud.

247
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,097
No comment.

248
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,634
-Sorry.
-Hey, be careful!

249
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,769
Um…

250
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,340
Your son got into medical school, right?

251
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,510
I saw it on social media.

252
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,445
So?

253
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,681
I understand that

254
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,484
you have your reasons
and things you want to protect.

255
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,054
But the people who bought the apartment…

256
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,422
Thank you very much.

257
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,724
<i>…also have their reasons…</i>

258
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,625
Special sale!

259
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,128
<i>…and lives they want to protect.</i>

260
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,499
If this case is ruled as fraud
in the civil trial,

261
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,135
it will eventually become a criminal case.

262
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,939
If that happens, you will be punished.

263
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,840
What?

264
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,046
If there's something you want to protect,
please help us.

265
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,517
Don't you think your actions here
will affect you and your son's future?

266
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,686
I don't know anything.

267
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,556
Please! I'm begging you.

268
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,792
Please!

269
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,128
Please!

270
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,364
Please.

271
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,543
Oh, Yoshio.

272
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:38,912
Oh.

273
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:44,117
Starting this April,
I've been appointed presiding judge.

274
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,353
-Is that so.
-Yup.

275
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,222
That fraud case.

276
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,026
I'll be taking over from today.

277
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,798
The predecessor suddenly had to retire.

278
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,805
I'm proceeding with your firm transfer.

279
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:06,706
Dad--

280
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,810
Once you meet them,
you'll change your mind.

281
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,947
I'm looking forward to seeing you work.

282
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,866
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

283
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,073
I made a reservation in Akasaka.
That's better for you, right?

284
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,042
Did you prefer Ginza?

285
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,145
You're just gonna get drunk anyway.

286
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,481
The apartment was fully occupied
at the time of purchase.

287
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,250
However, the fact that…

288
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,090
um… all the tenants had moved out
within the next six months

289
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,493
is clearly a sign that
a fraudulent act had taken place.

290
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:10,070
The tenants moving out
was due to their own personal reasons

291
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:14,441
and we believe it's difficult
to hold the company responsible.

292
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,845
Regarding the argument
about disguising it as fully occupied,

293
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:23,350
there is no clear evidence that
the defendants, as brokers, were involved

294
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,052
and we believe it is a groundless claim.

295
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:33,093
Plaintiff's counsel,
do you have anything to say to that?

296
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,163
Yes. Um, let me see.

297
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,265
C-Could you repeat that again please?

298
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:53,747
Um, therefore we believe--

299
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,515
Enough already!

300
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,719
Your Honor.
It's pointless to continue this.

301
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,290
What do you think a courtroom is?

302
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,693
I'm sure that as a tiny, tiny firm,

303
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,296
you have your reasons
like a lack of experience in court.

304
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,201
But we'd like you to come
a little bit more prepared.

305
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,604
My apologies, Mr. Inuzuka.

306
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:23,810
By our next trial, we will come prepared
so as not to cause you any inconvenience.

307
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,744
Your Honor.

308
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,013
-Yes.
-I have plans. May we?

309
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,149
I see.

310
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,750
Is that alright?

311
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,454
-No…
-The court is adjourned.

312
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,256
Good work everyone.

313
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,765
Anything?

314
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,333
I can't reach her.

315
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,669
I wonder what happened.

316
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,073
Oh, she's calling.

317
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:58,144
<i>The president of the renovation company</i>
<i>recorded the meeting with Mr. Tone.</i>

318
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,214
<i>And when I was heading back</i>
<i>with that voice recorder…</i>

319
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,985
Huh? What?

320
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,321
Hey! What's going on?!

321
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,789
No!

322
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,432
The police are investigating it, but…

323
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,469
Are you really okay?

324
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,171
I'm sorry. The evidence…

325
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,040
That doesn't matter.

326
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,676
You're lucky you got away
with a minor injury.

327
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,212
Why didn't you just let go?

328
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,447
I couldn't.
It was an important piece of evidence!

329
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,683
You're more important to me, Shoko.

330
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,118
Unforgivable.

331
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't think a lawyer would do this.

332
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,858
It's only a hunch, but…

333
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,162
When I went to see the president,
someone was watching me.

334
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,398
I don't know if it's him
who attacked me though.

335
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,402
-Anyone in here?
-No, it's not them.

336
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,272
-It's not them.
-Not in here?

337
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,876
-No.
-Anyone in this one?

338
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,244
-No.
-No.

339
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,946
Oh, it's him!

340
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:08,915
This man.

341
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,255
Oh, I've seen him in that bar.

342
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,023
He's Mr. Mikogami's secretary.

343
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,159
So, Mikogami had him do it?

344
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,996
Give me 24 hours.

345
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,667
I'll memorize everything about him.

346
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:14,732
Welcome back, sir.

347
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,801
Mr. Mikogami,
I've been watching your videos.

348
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:18,769
Thank you.

349
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,537
You smoke cigarettes?

350
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,006
Please keep it a secret.

351
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,575
I often get questioned like that
in smoking areas.

352
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:27,344
I knew we could find you here.

353
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,916
Four years ago,
on November 8th, you posted

354
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:35,085
"Living in a hotel. No point
renting a room." on your Instagram.

355
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,156
And two months ago on January 15th, "I've
lived in a hotel for four years now."

356
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:42,693
I identified this hotel
from the background of your online videos

357
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,995
that you always stream from your room.

358
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,030
You're scaring me.

359
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:48,232
Let me get to the point.

360
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:54,238
We think that you are deeply involved
in a real estate investment fraud case.

361
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:58,309
I'm Haneoka, the plaintiff's counsel.

362
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,177
I'm Ishida, a paralegal.

363
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:01,312
I'm not following.

364
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:05,082
Didn't you get someone to attack her
and steal the evidence?

365
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:06,417
I'm not following.

366
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:09,186
We will prove your crime no matter what.

367
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,389
The number of laws keeps increasing
because of people like you,

368
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,658
who try to go through
loopholes in the law.

369
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,061
The law changes every year
to crack them down,

370
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:19,863
but there are those like you,
who still get away.

371
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,231
It's a cat-and-mouse game.

372
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:27,237
I don't know what this is about,
but do you know who created the law?

373
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:30,207
-Who?
-It's the powerful people.

374
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:33,110
People with great power and influence.

375
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:37,114
These are rules they created
to make the world a better place.

376
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:39,416
However…

377
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:44,388
Because of that, it's designed for them
to never lose no matter what happens.

378
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:45,723
Take casinos for example.

379
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,692
It's designed
for the gambling house to win.

380
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,131
The law is not designed
for the weak to win either.

381
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,636
Maybe this topic is a little difficult
for local lawyers.

382
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,906
Oh, you're not even a lawyer yet.

383
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:20,657
Could you please testify in court
about the contents of the voice recorder?

384
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,793
<i>I told you that I'm not talking!</i>

385
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,931
They got to him first.

386
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,900
Geez…

387
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:33,003
I'm off.

388
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:40,377
What should we buy today?

389
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,446
I need to pee.

390
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:45,682
That's why I told you to go earlier.

391
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:47,484
Hey, it's not green yet.

392
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:49,219
But…

393
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,354
You can't hold it in?

394
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:51,822
No, I can't.

395
00:22:58,695 --> 00:23:00,297
AO

396
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:07,271
Ao! It's green!

397
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,073
It's red!

398
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,942
Report it to the police.

399
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,211
Yes, I'm on my way!

400
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:16,747
You think we can get him now?

401
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:20,350
Yes. If he's the one who set the fire,
he'll be investigated for fraud too.

402
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,252
<i>I'll let the police know.</i>

403
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,620
Thank you very much!

404
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:25,122
<i>Well done!</i>

405
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,424
Thank you very much!

406
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,426
SEVEN DAYS LATER
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

407
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:33,697
Come in.

408
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm sorry to barge in.

409
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:42,243
This character in my name is "Ao."

410
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,348
But I thought maybe Taku meant
the color "Ao," so I asked him.

411
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:47,716
And I was right.

412
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,486
He was talking about a blue
that is very close to green.

413
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:58,793
So, the lighter was green and not blue?!

414
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,431
And I remembered someone
who owned a green lighter.

415
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,537
Mr. Tone, please take a seat.

416
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,441
Did you set Mr. Hyuga on fire?

417
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:17,445
I didn't.
I've already told you many times.

418
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:20,815
What's your shoe size?

419
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:21,716
Huh?

420
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:23,018
How many centimeters?

421
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:25,754
Twenty-seven.

422
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,057
You have leather shoes
from a brand called Consensus, right?

423
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,493
Do you?

424
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:33,228
I do. And?

425
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,498
Footprints were collected
from the crime scene.

426
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:38,667
They were the same size as your shoe--

427
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:41,469
So what?

428
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:44,372
Does that prove that it was me?

429
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,442
That's the problem.

430
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:49,544
These shoes are sold publicly,

431
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:54,449
so that alone doesn't prove
that you were at the park that day.

432
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,888
Now, let me ask you about the lighter
that was left at the crime scene.

433
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,223
You're a smoker, right?
Do you use a lighter?

434
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,958
I do. So what?

435
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:06,594
Wasn't it your lighter
that was left at the scene?

436
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:09,998
That's the reason you're suspicious of me?

437
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:14,335
You're treating me like a criminal
just because I smoke?

438
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:18,373
You know,
this isn't a deciding factor either.

439
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,078
That lighter's color and shape
are also common.

440
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,680
But I won't give up.

441
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:30,051
I find you suspicious.
I will prove that the lighter--

442
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:33,154
It's the same as those shoes
you mentioned.

443
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,724
There are tons of
green lighters out there.

444
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,660
What?

445
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,734
Did I mention that the lighter was green?

446
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:48,236
The eyewitness testified that

447
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:52,207
another person
started the fire with a green lighter.

448
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:54,109
But it's burnt black.

449
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:56,411
You knew it was green because you did it.

450
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:58,113
No! It was a guess.

451
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,415
You own a green lighter. Correct?

452
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:02,917
A booby prize for
your company's golf competition

453
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:04,486
and the only one in the world.

454
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:10,291
You will be prosecuted.

455
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:13,762
In that trial, we'll of course uncover
the cause of this case,

456
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:17,098
the real estate investment fraud case.

457
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:20,702
Can't you imagine that
confessing to everything now

458
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,472
and showing remorse will have
a huge impact on your judgment?

459
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,447
These are the complaints that Mr. Hyuga

460
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:35,583
repeatedly sent from your home PC
to Green Estate.

461
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:39,954
The last one was sent
the day before he passed away.

462
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,991
"President Oba, I can't do this anymore."

463
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:46,294
"If the law can't punish you,
I'll have to do it myself."

464
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:49,230
"I'll show you
something shocking tomorrow."

465
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:53,568
Tone thought
this "something shocking" was evidence

466
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,905
<i>and he followed Mr. Hyuga that day.</i>

467
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:05,647
<i>He watched, hoping that</i>
<i>Mr. Hyuga would end his own life.</i>

468
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:08,583
<i>But when Mr. Hyuga failed to do so,</i>

469
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,352
<i>he set him on fire.</i>

470
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:28,570
Tone is also starting to confess

471
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:32,507
who came up with
the real estate investment fraud.

472
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:34,776
SECOND ORAL PROCEEDINGS

473
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:36,578
"This real estate investment fraud

474
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:41,015
was planned entirely by Mr. Kyo Mikogami

475
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:45,720
and both mine and Mr. Sakakibara's
companies were only following orders."

476
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:50,892
<i>"Mr. Mikogami told me not to worry</i>
<i>as no evidence will be found,</i>

477
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,229
which is how I ended up
taking part in fraudulent activities."

478
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:57,799
That was Mr. Tone's testimony we obtained

479
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,501
with permission
from the defendant's representative.

480
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:05,039
Defendant's counsel, your response?

481
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:07,342
Oh…

482
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:11,312
Right.

483
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:18,486
Basically, I think

484
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,590
we would like to
acknowledge the plaintiff's claim.

485
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:27,896
Your Honor. May I?

486
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,465
I'll allow you to speak.

487
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,969
Thank you very much for your advice
the other day.

488
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:39,107
As you said, our tiny, tiny firm

489
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:43,077
worked very hard to prepare
and we were able to win.

490
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:46,681
I'd like to express my deepest gratitude.

491
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,688
The court is now adjourned.

492
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:08,303
Thank you very much!

493
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:10,672
I'm happy for you, Mr. Takaoka.

494
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:12,173
I'm glad I believed in you!

495
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,608
Thank you for everything.

496
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:15,043
Likewise.

497
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:17,445
I'm so glad I got to meet you.

498
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:21,582
I'm happy to hear that.

499
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:37,932
-Thank you very much.
-I'm happy for you.

500
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,834
I'm so relieved.

501
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,369
I can't thank you enough.

502
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,072
Ouch! Ow, ow.

503
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,151
Good job today.

504
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,755
Dad.

505
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,394
I…

506
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,699
I'm an unreliable lawyer.

507
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:13,634
As you have seen,

508
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:17,705
I get agitated
and I can't even put up a brave front.

509
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:24,145
I can't even utilize
my memorizing ability on my own.

510
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:26,314
You're right.

511
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:31,352
You're not capable at all.

512
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:34,856
Honestly, I couldn't bear to watch you
in the previous trial.

513
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,625
I'm sorry,
but I can't refer you to that firm.

514
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,928
It's my reputation on the line.

515
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,367
I won't help you from now on.

516
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:47,368
Got it?

517
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:49,037
Yes!

518
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:55,043
I truly am sorry
that I can't live up to your expectations.

519
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,312
But you finally saw who I really am.

520
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,548
That makes me happy.

521
00:31:01,883 --> 00:31:04,352
Hm. We have…

522
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:07,455
different ideals.

523
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,759
Well, I guess you have things
you want to do.

524
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:13,861
Right?

525
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:16,697
Yes.

526
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,934
Do your best.

527
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:21,669
Yes, sir.

528
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,295
You're always watching, huh?

529
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:52,633
I'm guessing they're almost done too.

530
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,569
Mr. Mikogami?

531
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:55,903
Yeah.

532
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,807
-Yes.
-Mr. Mikogami.

533
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:03,978
Sure. Understood.

534
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:06,581
Okay, I'll see you later.

535
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,651
<i>Why wasn't he arrested?</i>

536
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:14,388
Mikogami claimed
that the facts are groundless.

537
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:18,025
That Tone blamed him in his testimony
out of desperation.

538
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:19,660
But there must have been evidence.

539
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:21,996
They don't have anything left!

540
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:25,066
-There you are.
-Sorry to make you worry.

541
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:28,469
<i>Instructions to Tone and Sakakibara</i>
<i>were sent from burner accounts.</i>

542
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:29,604
I'm safe.

543
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,505
Mr. Yonekura.

544
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:33,174
<i>They're sent through many people</i>
<i>all over the world</i>

545
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,343
<i>so they can't trace it back to Mikogami.</i>

546
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,244
Let's go.

547
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,912
No way…

548
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,248
<i>The money seems to be laundered through</i>

549
00:32:40,314 --> 00:32:43,251
<i>an offshore company,</i>
<i>so they can't get to the bottom of it.</i>

550
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:46,354
Man, this is good.

551
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,490
Excuse me, champagne please.

552
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:51,692
So, we have to give up?

553
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:54,896
This is the limit of local lawyers, huh?

554
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,165
Thank you.

555
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,699
Hi there.

556
00:32:58,766 --> 00:32:59,634
We didn't--

557
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,237
It's not that.
Do you have time for a consultation?

558
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,907
That regular of mine
wants you to hear her out.

559
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,942
Ah, sure. Oh!

560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,411
-Go ahead.
-Um, yeah.

561
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:14,615
However much we clean up,
passersby keep littering.

562
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:15,516
It's endless.

563
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,018
That's awful.

564
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:20,354
Is she the one you keep whining about?
The regular who talks a lot--

565
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,890
You know, littering is a crime.

566
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:27,228
Yes.
So, I want to sue everyone who litters.

567
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:29,864
Well, everyone might be a little…

568
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,004
CHIGASAKI, YOKOHAMA, MEGURO, SHINJUKU,
EBISU, SHIBUYA, MOTOMACHI

569
00:33:38,706 --> 00:33:39,574
Oh!

570
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,042
Oh! Huh?

571
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:42,810
-You scared me.
-Huh?

572
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,447
Whoa! Why? What?

573
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,816
-Okay! What is it?
-Thank you.

574
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:51,152
-Sure?
-I saw the light.

575
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:52,653
The light?

576
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,489
This will take time though.

577
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:57,792
What is it?

578
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:01,829
I see!

579
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:02,997
Huh?

580
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:08,402
Let's show them
what local lawyers are made of.

581
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:10,271
Yes.

582
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,874
Huh? What's going on?

583
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,880
Excuse me, sir.

584
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,184
You just threw your cigarette away, right?

585
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:02,790
Right? I'm arresting you on the spot
for violation of the Waste Disposal Act.

586
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:04,925
What? You're overreacting.

587
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:07,895
No, no.
We'll talk at the police station. Okay?

588
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:12,266
Oh dear. You messed up, Mr. Mikogami.

589
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,802
-Thank you for your cooperation.
-Sure.

590
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:16,404
You can't arrest me for this.

591
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:21,509
We'll just warn you if it's once or twice,
but you're a habitual offender.

592
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,184
We've been watching you
for the past month.

593
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:35,156
<i>You littered 53 times</i>
<i>and we collected every single one of them.</i>

594
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:53,641
A DNA test will prove that
they belong to you.

595
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,476
Even so…

596
00:35:55,543 --> 00:36:00,915
Cigarette littering is a very
malicious crime, which could lead to fire.

597
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,683
So, I pressed charges.

598
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:06,520
And the police accepted it.

599
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:08,989
Let's go.

600
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,093
May I have a moment with him?

601
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:19,400
You said that the law is created

602
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:24,238
for the powerful people only.

603
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:26,874
I disagree.

604
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,778
Many of the laws,
which increase in number every year,

605
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:34,415
are created to empathize
with the appeals of the weaker people.

606
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:39,253
<i>It's a history of them speaking up.</i>

607
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,158
<i>It's a necessary rule</i>

608
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:48,996
<i>for the powerful and the weak</i>
<i>to live equally in the same world.</i>

609
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:55,369
I believe
that's what the law is created for.

610
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,371
And?

611
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:03,043
Even so, weak people will always be weak.

612
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:16,924
What's wrong with being weak anyway?

613
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:17,858
Huh?

614
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:25,466
Most of those you call the weak
probably don't want to be powerful.

615
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:30,337
<i>They are the kind of people</i>
<i>who want to live their lives peacefully</i>

616
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:33,874
<i>without bothering</i>
<i>nor be bothered by others.</i>

617
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:38,012
<i>And those people</i>
<i>are the backbone of our society.</i>

618
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:42,583
As ones who practice law,

619
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:49,457
we will continue to stand by and fight
for those who live earnestly.

620
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:52,760
As local lawyers.

621
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,097
Fine.

622
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,301
You can fight all you want.

623
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:05,039
But I'll be released immediately
for a crime like this.

624
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,575
In the end, that's all you could do.

625
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,682
I wonder if that's true.

626
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,464
<i>The suspect arrested on the spot</i>
<i>for suspicion of</i>

627
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:34,235
<i>violation of the Waste Disposal Act</i>
<i>was Kyo Mikogami, an investor.</i>

628
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:37,204
<i>Mikogami is denying some of the charges</i>

629
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,742

<i>and he shouldn't be arrested for it.</i>

630
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:46,280
Hello.

631
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,582
MIKOGAMI WAS FIRED FROM
CARBON NEUTRALITY BOARD

632
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:49,783
Um…

633
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,821
I see. Okay.

634
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:56,290
HE'S FIRED. LOL

635
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:58,692
Stop the car. Stop it!

636
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,928
I HEARD MIKOGAMI WAS DISMISSED. OH WELL.

637
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:04,598
Damn it! It's only littering!

638
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:05,866
MIKOGAMI IS SO LAME.

639
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:07,768
I DIDN'T LIKE HIS COMMENTS ANYWAY.

640
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,270
ARRESTED FOR LITTERING. LOL

641
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:14,241
<i>Special fraud damage</i>
<i>is increasing every year.</i>

642
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:16,310
<i>Their methods are getting more…</i>

643
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:20,347
<i>The total damage of refund fraud in 2020</i>
<i>is more than 17 billion yen.</i>

644
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:24,652
<i>Their methods are changing every year</i>
<i>raising the total cost of damage.</i>

645
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:27,321
Thank you very much. You have a case?

646
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:30,190
<i>Yes. I saw the news on investment fraud</i>

647
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:32,660
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>maybe we're being scammed too.</i>

648
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:33,661
Right.

649
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:34,962
You need consultation?

650
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:37,665
<i>I want to press charges</i>
<i>against my last workplace.</i>

651
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:40,367
You want to press charges.
Just a moment please.

652
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:41,969
Haneo, she's pressing charge!

653
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:43,070
What is this, a ramen shop?

654
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:44,672
I'll make the tea.

655
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:45,573
Thanks.

656
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,473
Sure.

657
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,209
Oh, Shoko.

658
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:50,144
Yeah?

659
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:54,248
Life is shorter than you think.

660
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:03,057
There's no life without regrets.

661
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:06,694
But isn't it better to have less of it?

662
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,676
Isn't Taku coming today?

663
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:25,412
No. He doesn't like to go out.

664
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:29,550
It's beautiful.

665
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:30,985
It is.

666
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:34,421
CLEAR SKY

667
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,428
<i>You and Mr. Haneoka</i>

668
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:45,566
cleared me and Taku of suspicion.

669
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:49,837
I think
that's what inspired him to write this.

670
00:40:52,706 --> 00:40:54,308
If the sky is always clear,

671
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,844
we wouldn't need an umbrella.

672
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:13,193
Oh.

673
00:41:15,462 --> 00:41:17,197
I missed the chance to say this.

674
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:18,899
Yes?

675
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:23,537
I couldn't do it by myself after all.

676
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,373
The last trial.

677
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:33,047
I felt that I wasn't a full-fledged lawyer
or even a half-fledged one.

678
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,520
But when you're with me,

679
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:43,223
it feels like I can be double-fledged
or even more than that.

680
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,127
So…

681
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:54,568
Please continue to stay by my side.

682
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:57,137
What? Eww!

683
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:00,507
No!

684
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:01,775
What's your problem?!

685
00:42:03,277 --> 00:42:04,311
What is this?

686
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:07,414
I went out of my character
to tell you that

687
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:10,551
I'd like to have you by my side
as a partner and a paralegal.

688
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:12,386
But you ruined it. Forget it.

689
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:16,390
I decline.

690
00:42:16,457 --> 00:42:17,357
You decline?!

691
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,926
Forget it.

692
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:22,963
I…

693
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:28,569
I've decided to take the bar exam.

694
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:32,106
Seriously?

695
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:34,975
I felt that

696
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:38,645
I want to be a lawyer
and be of more help to the clients.

697
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:43,817
It's thanks to you.

698
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:45,619
Me?

699
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:49,356
I think we can be so much more than
double-fledged too.

700
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,158
So…

701
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,628
I'll be by your side

702
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:58,465
as your lawyer partner.

703
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:03,437
But isn't the application period over?

704
00:43:03,504 --> 00:43:04,671
Oh.

705
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:08,308
Dad had applied for me.

706
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,943
Oh, my.

707
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,916
I'm going to stop giving up

708
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:18,352
on trying.

709
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:25,092
BAR EXAMINATION VENUE

710
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:42,342
Please move away!

711
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:43,544
Are you alright?

712
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,327
Man, it's another hot day.

713
00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:04,264
Summer in Japan is becoming crazy, huh?

714
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,272
Again?

715
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:13,173
"Again"?

716
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:16,176
You showed up with such perfect timing.

717
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:17,678
Oh, could it be that

718
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:20,848
you were hiding behind the pillar
waiting for me?

719
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:22,950
You seem better than I thought.

720
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:25,018
What pillar?

721
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,188
Go and pass the exam.

722
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:34,294
I'll be off.
