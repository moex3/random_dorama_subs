1
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>Once upon a time, once upon a place,</i>

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>there was a monstrous lumberjack.</i>

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,673
<i>A monster who pretended</i>
<i>to be a lumberjack,</i>

4
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>and lived among people.</i>

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>It hid its big ears and sharp fangs,</i>

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,687
<i>so no one realized the lumberjack</i>
<i>was a monster.</i>

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,495
Can I help you?

8
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,371
Mr. Kazuo Toma?

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,584
We have a court-issued warrant
to search your home.

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,128
Where is your wife?

11
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,174
Midori! It's the cops! Run!

12
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,678
No! Midori!

13
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,805
Midori!

14
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,972
"Mr. Lumberjack, Mr. Lumberjack."

15
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,766
"Chop some wood for me,"

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,854
"said the old lady baker."

17
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,606
"Sure."

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,401
"I'll chop wood for you."

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,071
"So let me into your house, won't you?"

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,324
"Come in, come in."

21
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,619
"Please come in any time you like."

22
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,290
"The old lady led the way,

23
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,836
and the monstrous lumberjack
entered the old lady's house."

24
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,380
Midori Toma?!

25
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,727
"Then, as soon as it entered,

26
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,397
it hit her head with its axe."

27
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,988
What did you do to him?

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,449
Oh dear.

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,827
You're only worried about him?

30
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,080
Where are the other kids?!

31
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,965
Where could they be?

32
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,511
"Munch, munch, gulp."

33
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,181
"The monstrous lumberjack

34
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,392
ate the old lady."

35
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,936
Kitajima!

36
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,899
The next room…

37
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,735
What about it?

38
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,904
In the next room…

39
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,198
Children…

40
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,995
The bodies of children…

41
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,998
-What?
-Possibly…

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,793
<i>Fifteen bodies…</i>

43
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,848
Step away from that boy.

44
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,477
Don't!

45
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:53,209
<i>LUMBERJACK THE MONSTER</i>

46
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,215
Uh-oh.

47
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,384
You alright?

48
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,473
Sugitani's hospital…

49
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,438
General Affairs?

50
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,732
Call an ambulance… please…

51
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,279
Why did you tail me?

52
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,784
I found forged death certificates…

53
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,661
Several of them…

54
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
So…

55
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:41,002
I realized Sugitani was dumping bodies…

56
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,338
Why not take it to police first?

57
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,552
I thought I could make some money!

58
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,096
But why did you tail me?

59
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,267
You're close with Sugitani…

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,856
You were on a security camera
when certificates were issued.

61
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,151
I figured you were involved!

62
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,029
Aha.

63
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:13,493
That sharp eye of yours
proved to be fatal, huh?

64
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,746
"Fatal"?

65
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,248
Got a dashcam?

66
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,002
You should.

67
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,922
Road rage is the new normal.

68
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,510
Help me…

69
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,678
Please!

70
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,390
I'm begging you, Mr. Ninomiya!

71
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,565
Why are you crying?

72
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,485
Are you crazy?!

73
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,321
You're a lawyer!

74
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,701
Hey… What are you… Hey!

75
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,789
No!

76
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,165
No!

77
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,232
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

78
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,569
-Oops.
-Sorry!

79
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,448
Thank you.

80
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,784
Excuse me.

81
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,707
Take care now.

82
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,395
From the Metro Police Analysis Center.

83
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,191
Not because of you, Akira.

84
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,280
Serial murders in Tokyo.

85
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,825
They asked if it could be a psychopath.

86
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,662
Anyway, what brings you here?

87
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,498
That Yabe?

88
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,750
Yeah.

89
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,461
Kind of a gloomy guy.

90
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,715
He was misusing funds.
Dad was going to fire him.

91
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:37,345
He tried to blackmail us,
then your name came up.

92
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,271
What about me?

93
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,564
Well,

94
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,318
you've eliminated so many,
it was inevitable.

95
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,032
Your so-called "experiments"

96
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,826
on live humans are much worse.

97
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,329
Medical progress requires it.

98
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,289
I mean,

99
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,376
I got tired of cats, you know?

100
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,304
I'll delete the security footage
of you. You're safe.

101
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,224
Sugitani.

102
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,273
I'm here because I'm not safe.

103
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>Three days have passed</i>
<i>since Saburo Iwata, 36,</i>

<i>might be connected…</i>

108
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,800
What the hell…?

109
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,649
Want money?

110
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,194
I'll give you all I have.

111
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,157
Monsters like you…

112
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,493
deserve to die.

113
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,953
Huh?

114
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,240
Help!

115
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,038
What did I do to you?

116
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,744
That freak…

117
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,124
is gonna fucking die.

118
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,692
Attention!

119
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,696
Salute!

120
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,491
At ease.

121
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,701
At ease!

122
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,958
In response to
the two head trauma murders,

123
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,961
we've set up an investigation team.

124
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,007
It seems they were
committed by the same perp,

125
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,385
so we'll treat them as serial killings.

126
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,597
Unit Chief Hirose, share your intel.

127
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,309
The media are unaware

128
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,145
"head trauma" is an understatement.

129
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,274
Both victims were hit
repeatedly with an axe-like weapon,

130
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,944
and had their brains removed.

131
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,949
The first victim.
Masumi Ishikawa, 39, female.

132
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,702
A housewife and former hostess,

133
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,289
whose pyramid schemes ruined many lives.

134
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,835
Even her neighbors speak ill of her.

135
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,546
The latest victim is Saburo Iwata.

136
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,383
36, male, unemployed.

137
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,719
Four convictions. Injury, rape…

138
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,429
Hated by many.

139
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,725
We're checking alibis,
but there are no suspects as yet.

140
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,729
No signs of struggle at either scene.

141
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,651
The perp waited in their homes,
and attacked from behind.

142
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,945
No valuables were taken.

143
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,115
The perp's most likely the same person,

144
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,034
but the victims were unconnected.

145
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,954
SSBC Analyst and Inspector Toshiro.

146
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,124
Is it possible we have a lust killer?

147
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,713
I'd say that's unlikely.

148
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,716
Lust killers tend

149
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,761
to attack similar victims
due to sexual impulses,

150
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,016
but Ishikawa and Iwata
share no similarities.

151
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,978
The MO seems impulsive,
but it was systematic.

152
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,522
A route was plotted beforehand

153
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,858
to avoid security cameras.

154
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:10,320
Ambushes require patience,
and no evidence was left.

155
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,530
Which suggests,

156
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,409
the perp had a specific motive
for killing these two.

157
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,829
However, there was no hesitation.

158
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,874
A clear sign of psychopathic tendencies.

159
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,253
The victims must be connected somehow.

160
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,298
We need to figure that out.

161
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,302
Unless we catch the killer,

162
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,180
these killings won't ever stop.

163
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,148
<i>Tell me about this brain thief.</i>

164
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,817
"Brain thief"?

165
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,737
If you say so.

166
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,744
Methodical, yet has
the brute strength to swing an axe.

167
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,496
Probably,

168
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,000
an ordinary-looking,
relatively intelligent male.

169
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,419
Killing at different times

170
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,756
suggests a flexible work schedule,

171
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,299
or unemployment.

172
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,927
Inui.

173
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:20,390
Look into this profiler's notion
of an unseen connection.

174
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,063
"Brain thief" might be good for the media,

175
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,525
but it trivializes this case.

176
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,862
You sure?

177
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,324
If it wasn't lust or a grudge,
it was theft.

178
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,833
All good I'd say.

179
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,253
Mr. Ninomiya,

180
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,340
a possible epidural hematoma
was a concern,

181
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:58,345
but six hours have passed safely,
so you should be fine.

182
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,766
Heavy intracerebral bleeding
worsens hematomas.

183
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,352
It could've been more serious.

184
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,438
I'm not in pain,

185
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,732
but I feel strange.

186
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,733
Is that so?

187
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,071
At any rate, stay with us for a few days.

188
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,907
I have urgent business,

189
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,410
so I can't…

190
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,163
Then again, in your case,

191
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,040
besides your head trauma,

192
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,127
I'm concerned about your neuro chip.

193
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,089
It's fragile,
and has been in there a while.

194
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,758
I recommend a thorough checkup.

195
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,220
"Neuro chip"?

196
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,763
Yes.

197
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,140
As you know,

198
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,352
it's against our code of ethics,
so we can't do anything.

199
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,940
When you're discharged,
visit a specialist hospital.

200
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,320
What is…

201
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,947
a neuro chip?

202
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,784
This is it.

203
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,538
This vague pale shadow here.

204
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
You mean…

205
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
you didn't know that

206
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,349
you have a neuro chip in your brain?

207
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,186
Oh.

208
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,104
That.

209
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,274
That's what you were on about.

210
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,779
I know what that is.

211
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,908
There are many names for it.

212
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,244
I'll contact my usual hospital.

213
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,663
-Please do.
-Sure.

214
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,957
Alright then.

215
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,754
If you feel pain, let us know.

216
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,880
I will.

217
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,382
Thank you.

218
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,816
QUADRIPLEGIC MAN REHABILITATED
BY NEURO CHIP

219
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,486
Why do I have one…?

220
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,455
Hey, you don't look so bad.

221
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,041
Emi, you came.

222
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,544
You're fine.

223
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,504
I worried for nothing.

224
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,881
You worried about me?

225
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,175
Any pain?

226
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,636
No, fortunately.

227
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,762
Oh.

228
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,266
This is a good time then.

229
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,519
Don't force yourself to be with me.

230
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,231
My dad wanted us to be together so much,

231
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
but he's gone now.

232
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,069
Don't be silly, Emi.

233
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,282
My feelings for you won't ever change.

234
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,456
Yeah? Glad to hear it.

235
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,211
Mr. Ninomiya, the police are here.

236
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,922
I'd better go.

237
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,717
I'm on a break from rehearsals.

238
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,929
I know you're busy. Thank you.

239
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,139
It's okay.

240
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,740
<i>Victim 1.</i>

241
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>Masumi Ishikawa, 39, female.</i>

242
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,748
<i>Former hostess.</i>
<i>Housewife at the time of death.</i>

243
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:59,127
<i>Her pyramid schemes ruined many lives.</i>

244
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,547
<i>The perp was waiting in her home,</i>

245
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,383
<i>and attacked her from behind.</i>

246
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,677
<i>No signs of struggle.</i>

247
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,891
<i>Hit repeatedly with an axe-like weapon,</i>

248
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,893
<i>and had her brain…</i>

249
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,728
<i>removed.</i>

250
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,441
Toshiro, what's your take?

251
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,736
A third victim will be on you.

252
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,037
In Behavioral Science at the academy,

253
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:39,501
we were taught that
if a serial killer murders three times,

254
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,586
the police are also to blame.

255
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,175
That's harsh.

256
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,641
You were right. There's a connection.

257
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,645
Both victims grew up at an orphanage.

258
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,357
An orphanage?

259
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,528
The thing is,
they were different orphanages.

260
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,116
If it were the same,
it could be bullying revenge,

261
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,952
or some other simple motive.

262
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,829
Ishikawa's was in Adachi,

263
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,248
and Iwata's was in Tachikawa.

264
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,751
They were both dumped outside orphanages.

265
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,464
This just got more complicated.

266
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,601
That detective…

267
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,561
What?

268
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,481
Can't tell if he's dumb or smart.

269
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,985
Assistant Inspector Inui.

270
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,403
He's good.

271
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,072
For a cop,

272
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,992
his sense of justice is too strong.

273
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,704
Just kidding.

274
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,498
He was elite,

275
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,753
but caused trouble
and got shunted to Shinagawa.

276
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,795
Trouble?

277
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,216
<i>That insurance murder two years ago.</i>

278
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,845
<i>A housewife fell down stairs and died.</i>

279
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,514
<i>Her husband cried for the cameras,</i>

280
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,601
<i>but got a 50 million insurance payout.</i>

281
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:25,106
<i>Well, he was most certainly guilty.</i>

282
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,905
But there was no evidence or witnesses,
so Kenmochi got off.

283
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,906
Then…

284
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,618
Hey, don't go. Come on!

285
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,829
At least, apologize at Saki's grave.

286
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,957
Before I die!

287
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,962
It was only 50 mil,
so quit your damn whining.

288
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,591
You should say sorry
for her dying suspiciously.

289
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,551
You're her father. Apologize.

290
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,643
Give me a break. Apologize.

291
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,145
Apologize, dammit.

292
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,940
What the fuck?

293
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,528
<i>Inui kept investigating on his own,</i>

294
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,697
<i>and they crossed paths.</i>

295
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,285
<i>Kenmochi's a lowlife,</i>

296
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,121
<i>so he sued the police for injury.</i>

297
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>Inui couldn't avoid a demotion.</i>

298
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
<i>That Kenmochi guy</i>

299
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,923
sounds like a typical psychopath.

300
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,551
<i>A neuro chip, huh…</i>

301
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,304
Yours is an old model.

302
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,850
What's it doing in my head?

303
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,727
Lately,

304
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,731
AI-equipped neuro-chip research is
on the rise.

305
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,150
In the beginning,

306
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,154
they were created to
stimulate paralyzed limbs.

307
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,157
As the technology advanced,

308
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,744
they were also used to suppress emotions.

309
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,996
But before long,

310
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,667
criminals and others
seen as mentally disturbed

311
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,170
were operated on without consent.

312
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,508
Neuro chips were described as
modern-day lobotomies.

313
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,218
About 30 years ago,

314
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,138
their use was banned worldwide.

315
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,477
When were you left at that orphanage?

316
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,522
About that long ago.

317
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,693
Then, you were operated on before that.

318
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,404
In your case, this…

319
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,868
This is your brain's morality
and empathy center.

320
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,663
Morality and empathy…

321
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,128
Why implant a neuro chip there?

322
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,632
Maybe, to suppress abnormal behavior,

323
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,386
your orbital cortex and amygdala activity

324
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,472
were stimulated with this neuro chip.

325
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,725
Knowing the procedure was illegal.

326
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,106
Did they honestly think I'd change?

327
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,234
Your parents asked for it,

328
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,195
but no change made them dump you.

329
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,030
That's just a guess.

330
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,161
Excluding our kind,
the world's full of idiots.

331
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,375
We psychopaths are the chosen ones.

332
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,544
We follow no one.

333
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,922
We don't fear risk. We make history.

334
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,970
History views Oda Nobunaga
and Peter the Great as heroes.

335
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:47,183
Medical research would
thrive without pathetic ethics.

336
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,311
Like the stem cell ban…

337
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,646
That's him!

338
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,733
The masked man who attacked me.

339
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,447
"Lumberjack the Monster"?

340
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,785
MUNCH, MUNCH, GULP.

341
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,958
"Lumberjack the Monster."

342
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,381
Some movie based on
a picture book, apparently.

343
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,928
Where next?

344
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,222
I've got to beat the police…

345
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,351
to finding that masked monster.

346
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,603
Why?

347
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,023
He said,

348
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,487
"Monsters like you deserve to die."

349
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,364
He knows what I've done.

350
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,243
Who knows what he'll tell the cops.

351
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,705
"Monsters like you"?

352
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,126
Such as me?

353
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,462
Maybe.

354
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,965
But you don't look like one.

355
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,483
<i>LUMBERJACK THE MONSTER</i>

356
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,361
<i>"Munch, munch, gulp."</i>

357
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,780
<i>"The monstrous lumberjack</i>

358
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,991
<i>ate Helena the florist next."</i>

359
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,161
<i>"However, no one noticed."</i>

360
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,165
<i>"Munch, munch, gulp."</i>

361
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,918
<i>"The monstrous lumberjack</i>

362
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,921
<i>ate Thomas the blacksmith next."</i>

363
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,133
<i>"However, no one noticed."</i>

364
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,554
<i>"The lumberjack-mimicking monster</i>

365
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>could eat as many people as it liked."</i>

366
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,270
<i>"And so, the monstrous lumberjack</i>

367
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>lived very happily in the village."</i>

368
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,164
You slumming it, Miss Profiler?

369
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,001
Excuse me.

370
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,844
The latest victim is Yoshio Mitsuta.

371
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,013
A freelance photographer.

372
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,766
Coroner says he died over four days ago.

373
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,478
Like the others, his brain's been removed.

374
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,357
He was famous for
invading people's privacy.

375
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,526
Had mob links too.

376
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,946
Maintained a bad rep in his industry.

377
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,825
Grew up in Sagamihara, at an orphanage.

378
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,787
Another orphanage…

379
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,167
That's not the only connection.

380
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,128
They were all pariahs.

381
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,641
Thankfully, I've been discharged.

382
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,103
So Emi, about your father's law firm.

383
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,690
Before Mr. Hasumi passed away,

384
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:28,529
he said I should take over,
and our advisors and partners agree,

385
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,989
but what do you think?

386
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,866
Why not?

387
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,788
You always wanted to be
a senior partner at Hasumi Law.

388
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,830
<i>Emi.</i>

389
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,918
If you're against it,

390
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,670
I'll turn them down.

391
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,756
I…

392
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,343
can't get over my father's death.

393
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,304
<i>He was headstrong and shrewd…</i>

394
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,017
<i>He wouldn't kill himself.</i>

395
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,571
<i>You take care of his firm.</i>

396
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,827
I want to retain the name
Hasumi Law Office.

397
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,913
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

398
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,268
Move it. Quit lagging behind.

399
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,103
Move your ass.

400
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,647
Hey.

401
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,566
Hey.

402
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,569
Hey, shut the hell up.

403
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,032
Quit crying.

404
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,659
Hey. Quit crying already.

405
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,828
Hey.

406
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,705
Quit crying, dammit.

407
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,999
Quit crying.

408
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,547
<i>Akira, run!</i>

409
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,923
Run!

410
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,156
What?!

411
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,368
What the fuck?!

412
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,604
Show me your face.

413
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,261
Who the hell…

414
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,181
are you?

415
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,448
The victim is Mitsuhiko Kobayashi, 37.

416
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,782
Bank liaison.

417
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,578
Widely hated for harsh credit retraction.

418
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,954
Same MO.

419
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,040
He grew up

420
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,167
in an orphanage too.

421
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,340
Killing out in the open now.

422
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,887
Taking the risk of being seen,
killing outside,

423
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,971
taking the brain.

424
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,015
Why do you think?

425
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,063
The perp…

426
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,482
is rushing.

427
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,570
At first, there were
a few days between hits,

428
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,073
but this was after a 10-day gap.

429
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,493
The perp wants every target dead.

430
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,953
But,

431
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,623
for some reason, time is running out.

432
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,252
Perhaps Kobayashi was killed recklessly…

433
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,262
due to a prior failed kill?

434
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,515
Two weeks ago, in a parking garage,

435
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,060
a lawyer sustained a head injury
in an attack.

436
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,854
A skull fracture, requiring 25 stitches.

437
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,815
He's out now though.

438
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,149
That man…

439
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,118
This victim had money stolen.

440
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,703
Weapon unknown.

441
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,039
If it was a mugging, it's unrelated.

442
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,791
Hey, Toshiro!

443
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,460
Don't go alone!

444
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,463
Inui, babysit her.

445
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,103
Emi?

446
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,029
I thought you could use some food…

447
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,537
Okay, I'd better go.

448
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,586
If you'd like, want to come over?

449
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,300
Come in.

450
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,362
Your hand…

451
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,114
I fell while jogging.

452
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,660
I didn't want you to think I'm clumsy.

453
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,372
Don't be silly.

454
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,999
Your bandage is undone. Show me.

455
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:55,017
You don't have to
hide your weaknesses from me.

456
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,073
What's wrong?

457
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,600
We met at Dr. Sugitani's hospital.

458
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,646
We did. How do you know him?

459
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:44,567
He gave medical advice for a case of mine.

460
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,778
What can I do for you?

461
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,867
I told the detective in charge
all I remember.

462
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,578
I've read the report.

463
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,832
I'd like to ask you
some further questions.

464
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,377
If you say so, I'm happy to help.

465
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,713
Thank you.

466
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,757
First of all,

467
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,345
do you think you might have
brought this on?

468
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,808
Hey. Aren't you being rude?

469
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,436
He's a victim of a mugging.

470
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,898
Excuse me, who is she?

471
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,609
My fiancée.

472
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,282
If you're not his wife, please leave us.

473
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,743
This is a crucial investigation.

474
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,246
I'm sorry.

475
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,874
You're just doing your job.

476
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,252
Akira, take care of yourself.

477
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,506
Thank you.

478
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,687
Perhaps she's jealous of your beauty.

479
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,273
Please forgive her.

480
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,909
I've done nothing to incite an attack.

481
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,453
I said that last time too.

482
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,467
Mr. Ninomiya.

483
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,846
Was your assailant's weapon an axe?

484
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,892
An axe?

485
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,274
I was attacked from behind,

486
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,109
so I didn't see.

487
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,236
It could've been an axe?

488
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,365
Leading questions?

489
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:03,038
Why are you so determined
to make it an axe?

490
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,630
Know any of these people?

491
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,260
Is one of them the mugger who attacked me?

492
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,138
Please answer the question.

493
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,441
Aren't these people…?

494
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:37,031
There's that "brain thief."
The serial killer who takes brains.

495
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,743
These are the victims, aren't they?

496
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,706
Talk of a serial killer
is media speculation.

497
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,634
I don't know any of them.

498
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,723
If they're case witnesses,
or clients' relatives,

499
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,476
I wouldn't remember them all.

500
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,811
I see.

501
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,690
For clarity's sake,

502
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,735
you grew up in an orphanage, no?

503
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,865
Why…

504
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,826
are you asking me that?

505
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,745
Well,

506
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,291
you rose from hardship
to succeed as a lawyer.

507
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,710
That's very admirable.

508
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,088
Is that…

509
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,299
relevant to this case?

510
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,929
We're not ruling it out.

511
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,475
If you're truly willing to cooperate,

512
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,269
I can share more information.

513
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,566
Nice effort, fake glasses and all.

514
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,027
But with that attitude,

515
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,780
forget about getting promoted.

516
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,367
You there.

517
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,993
Say something.

518
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,248
Sorry, but she actually outranks me.

519
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,667
Question time's over now.

520
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,585
Toshiro, let's go.

521
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,175
Anyway, please take care.

522
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,137
Even if it was a mugging,

523
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,639
your assailant might try again.

524
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,246
I know who attacked me.

525
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:53,208
That serial killer. The brain thief.

526
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,172
Other victims grew up
in orphanages, like me.

527
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,007
The killer's after…

528
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,428
the neuro chips.

529
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,602
Disable a security camera
to strip a wallet?

530
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,646
A little overcautious for a mugger.

531
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:22,571
That slick lawyer knows
more than he's letting on.

532
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,992
Let's visit his doctor.

533
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,580
-He's absent?
-Yes.

534
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,958
He has appointments, but he's unreachable.

535
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:41,131
Have you told anyone about my neuro chip?

536
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,260
No one at all!

537
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,306
What'll you do to me?!

538
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,849
If he hasn't talked,

539
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,810
don't worry about your CT scan.

540
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,981
Oh.

541
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,692
I'm all for killing him too.

542
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,986
Killing me?!

543
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,988
Are you two insane?!

544
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,199
After all,

545
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,701
why's your chip a problem?

546
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,912
No idea.

547
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,541
Ask the guy who attacked me.

548
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,334
This is bullshit!

549
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,840
My phone's GPS will show I'm here.

550
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,469
If you kill me, you're both finished!

551
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,846
Nice try.

552
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,932
Problem is,

553
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,477
this is your phone.

554
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,359
This isn't my first time.

555
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,078
You owe me!

556
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,664
I saved your life!

557
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,390
Why stop?

558
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,435
Strange…

559
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,773
I feel ill.

560
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,152
So you should!

561
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,821
You tried to kill me.

562
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,907
Could be intracerebral bleeding.

563
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,409
Let me take a look!

564
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,078
I'm a specialist.

565
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,080
Take him to hospital…

566
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,560
Smartphones really are
bad for your health.

567
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,856
I'd like to see a patient's records.

568
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,234
I'm sorry, I don't have the authority…

569
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,654
I see.

570
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,572
Sorry to bother you.

571
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,826
Oh no!

572
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,580
Please, don't touch that!
I'll clean it up.

573
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,837
NINOMIYA

574
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,507

575
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,716

00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,843
-Hey…
-As a suspect-beating outcast.

577
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,554
You should shut your mouth.

578
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,556
I didn't say anything.

579
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,016
AKIRA NINOMIYA

580
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,018

581
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,144
SHOW CT

582
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,826
Excuse me…

583
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,330
A fracture of the right temporal region.

584
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,083
No hematomas, apparently.

585
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,044
A blow from a blunt instrument.

586
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,422
Not an axe?

587
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,466
An axe's butt is blunt enough.

588
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,760
Can't say for sure though.

589
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,596
The butt…

590
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,350
What's really intriguing is
this neuro chip.

591
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,062
Neuro chip?

592
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,649
Banned a long time ago though.

593
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,609
How old is he?

594
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,986
Thirty-five.

595
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,362
Thirty-five…

596
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,950
Clearly a non-voluntary illegal procedure.

597
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,202
Still…

598
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,954
Is he doing alright?

599
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,622
What do you mean?

600
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,876
Neuro chips are fragile.

601
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,212
If the blow fractured his skull,

602
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,008
who knows what else it did?

603
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,321
<i>If neuro chips are the target,</i>

604
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,406
<i>it all makes sense.</i>

605
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,285
The brains were torn out
to get to the chips,

606
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:24,664
and smashing skulls
would hide signs of craniotomies.

607
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,419
Hirose,

608
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,089
get X-rays of the victims' brains
before death.

609
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,883
Even just one or two.

610
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,807
Perhaps…

611
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,103
at long last,

612
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,065
my neuro chip is starting to work.

613
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,484
Maybe the opposite.

614
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,655
The opposite?

615
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,032
I found something fascinating.

616
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:04,371
A suppressed incident
that's legendary in neurosurgery circles.

617
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,206
Toshiro.

618
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,210
Victim 1 was in
a car accident three years ago.

619
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,546
I got her X-ray.

620
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:17,008
Surprisingly, she had a neuro chip,

621
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,095
and it seems she knew nothing about it.

622
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,097
A neuro chip…

623
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,058
So presumably,

624
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,102
not just victim 1,

625
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,480
but all the victims had neuro chips.

626
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,691
How did you find out?

627
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,367
I'm a profiler.

628
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,745
Right.

629
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,833
So, when did victim 1 receive the chip?

630
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,252
The orphanage says

631
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,630
she had an operation scar when she came.

632
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,341
Counting back from then,

633
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,303
it would've been over 31 years ago.

634
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,807
Thirty-one years ago…

635
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,851
Which suggests,

636
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:12,981
children operated on illegally
were left at orphanages.

637
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,525
In all likelihood,

638
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,820
if we look into prior abduction cases…

639
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,073
The Shizuoka serial child abductions.

640
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,327
That's got to be it.

641
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,997
AKA, the Toma case.

642
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,625
The Toma case?

643
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,792
Most likely,

644
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,838
you're an unknown survivor
of that incident.

645
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,107
This is Kitajima. He led
the Shizuoka Police investigation.

646
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:02,489
He's retired now. Works in traffic safety.

647
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,908
I'm Kitajima.

648
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,661
This way, sir.

649
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,293
Long time no see, Inui.

650
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,466
It started with one missing child.

651
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,680
When a couple returned
to their car after shopping…

652
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,141
their son Takeshi

653
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:34,104
wasn't waiting in their car. He was gone.

654
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,523
Takeshi?

655
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,525
Takeshi?

656
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:42,028
Abduction wasn't ruled out,

657
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:46,616
but without a ransom demand,
we couldn't take action.

658
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,995
After that,

659
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,416
children started going missing
in the greater Tokyo area.

660
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,336
Eventually,

661
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,132
an actual abduction was witnessed,

662
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,301
and it became a serial abduction case.

663
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:10,056
Based on the witness report,

664
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,184
we found the vehicle that was used,

665
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,729
and the owner.

666
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,231
Kazuo Toma.

667
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:22,610
We were sure he
and his wife Midori were guilty.

668
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,155
<i>We got a search warrant,</i>

669
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,451
<i>and headed for their home in Shizuoka.</i>

670
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:35,457
<i>We stormed the place,</i>
<i>and what we saw inside…</i>

671
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,211
<i>was hell on earth.</i>

672
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,257
Midori Toma

673
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,428
opened up the heads of
the abducted children,

674
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:53,224
and experimented on them with neuro chips.

675
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,146
Inside their mansion,

676
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,984
we found 15 children
who'd died from the surgery,

677
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,447
and one child who survived.

678
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,578
The first child they abducted, Takeshi.

679
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,917
Kazuo testified in court that

680
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:25,507
Takeshi, the oldest abductee,
was their only successful test subject.

681
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,512
To protect Takeshi's privacy,

682
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,182
the neuro chip matter was kept secret.

683
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:40,063
However, Takeshi wasn't the only one.

684
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,524
There were others,

685
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,443
who were scattered across the region.

686
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:52,242
What on earth were the Tomas trying to do?

687
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:00,375
Trying to turn children into psychopaths.

688
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:08,216
You're saying they created psychopaths?

689
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,928
<i>The Tomas' son was a psychopath.</i>

690
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,099
He left animals dead and dismembered,

691
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,810
treated docile friends like slaves,

692
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,188
and fractured their bones repeatedly.

693
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:26,526
The neuro chip was developed to cure him.

694
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,321
Kazuo Toma said so in his testimony.

695
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:36,035
Why not develop surgery
to cure psychopathy?

696
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,621
They couldn't find enough

697
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,125
test subjects
with psychopathic tendencies.

698
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,129
If you can break it,

699
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,757
you can unbreak it, huh?

700
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,387
So, they tampered with my brain,

701
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,808
to find a way to cure psychopathy…

702
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,728
Revenge is impossible.

703
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:06,065
Midori Toma killed herself upon arrest.

704
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,860
Kazuo has already died in prison.

705
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,697
Their son died at the age of ten.

706
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,869
They could break other kids.
Couldn't fix their son.

707
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,331
<i>What'll become of me now?</i>

708
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,125
<i>If your neuro chip's broken…</i>

709
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,171
and you leave it,

710
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,758
maybe it'll make you normal?

711
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,346
You'll suddenly get an urge
to adopt a puppy.

712
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,559
Can the chip be repaired?

713
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:45,647
You'd need another one, and your old data.

714
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,817
It's your most delicate area,
so caution is imperative.

715
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,821
I'll have to catch the masked monster.

716
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:58,243
If he has a list, he'll have my data.

717
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,620
You don't…

718
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,706
want to be normal again?

719
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,794
If I were…

720
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,756
would that be a good thing?

721
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,426
How the heck would I know?

722
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,929
You're asking the wrong guy.

723
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,890
Whatever.

724
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,686
Hey.

725
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,356
I'll send you info on Toma,

726
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,984
but me and you share the same fate.

727
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:35,989
Even if you became normal,
your sins wouldn't vanish.

728
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:44,163
What are you afraid of, Sugitani?

729
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,669
You just don't get it.

730
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,505
<i>What happened to the survivor?</i>

731
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,008
Takeshi, you mean?

732
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,470
If he was turned into a psychopath…

733
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,184
Unfortunately,
Toma's procedure was a success.

734
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,980
His behavior's been problematic,

735
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,149
so there's no doubt.

736
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,446
Isn't that so, Inui?

737
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,745
Takeshi is Kenmochi.

738
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,956
The reason I got demoted.

739
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,541
<i>Takeshi Kenmochi.</i>

740
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,959
Damn piece of shit!

741
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:35,006
Hey! What the fuck is up with this?!

742
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,091
The prosecution knew?

743
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:41,763
Rejected as evidence
of a defective personality.

744
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,392
We'll bring him in.

745
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,062
Other survivors might exist.

746
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,980
He'll be targeted.

747
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,065
Inui!

748
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,195
Stand down. Stay away from Kenmochi.

749
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,405
But I know him best!

750
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,157
Don't blow your cool.

751
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,079
With Kitajima's help,
talk to the Tomas' accomplices.

752
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,205
Be thorough.

753
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,814
Classy place to drink.

754
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,611
Hirose said you come here
on days like this.

755
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,279
What can I get you?

756
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,073
Ah, oolong tea.

757
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,283
One oolong tea!

758
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,994
What do you want?

759
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,085
Your opinion on protecting Kenmochi.

760
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,004
Hey.

761
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,675
If somebody's hunting psychopaths,

762
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,468
why stop them?

763
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,014
Are you serious?

764
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,604
Never mind that, what about Ninomiya?

765
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,238
I'm sure he has psychopathic tendencies.

766
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,701
He's narcissistic,
and constantly unshakeable.

767
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,288
Lies fluently to get what he wants.

768
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,416
Sometimes arrogant and pompous.

769
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,835
Sounds more like you.

770
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,422
I'm not a psychopath.

771
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,090
Here you go.

772
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,175
Thanks.

773
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,302
So?

774
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:52,185
If we keep our eyes on Ninomiya,
the killer will turn up,

775
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,772
now that attacking Kenmochi is too risky.

776
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:00,693
I doubt Kenmochi wants our protection.

777
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:02,945
Huh?

778
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,283
Scum like him will never change.

779
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,878
I'm joining you.

780
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,464
-Huh?
-No, that's…

781
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,967
Listen…

782
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,891
Who are you assholes?

783
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,061
Mr. Kenmochi.

784
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,938
May we talk with you?

785
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,272
What for?

786
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,234
It's possible you're in danger.

787
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,902
We'll protect you.

788
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,196
Bullshit.

789
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,782
You want to keep tabs on me,

790
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:51,410
to pin Saki's death on me, am I right?

791
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,664
That's the kind of shit you'd pull.

792
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,796
If anybody wants me dead,

793
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,592
it's… that detective, Inui.

794
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,303
Nobody's more suspicious.

795
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,559
Mr. Kenmochi.

796
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,437
Did you know your brain has a neuro chip?

797
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,940
So what?

798
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,318
Doc said removing it was too risky,

799
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,320
so I left it in.

800
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,738
Other survivors?

801
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,824
Like I'd know.

802
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,201
Get this.

803
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,621
Stay the hell away from me.

804
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,960
If that "brain thief" shows up,
I'll rip their head off.

805
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,213
It'd be self-defense.

806
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,801
No need to make it look accidental.

807
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,681
What does that mean?

808
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,391
It's a joke.

809
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,518
There you go again.

810
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,771
You still think I killed her.

811
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,064
Right?

812
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,652
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,113
Piss off, dickwads.

814
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,656
Move your asses.

815
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,116
Go fuck yourselves.

816
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,326
Mr. Kenmochi!

817
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,586
Hello?

818
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,339
What?!

819
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,731
Don't do this…

820
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:44,982
Don't do this!

821
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,203
Akira?

822
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,123
Why are you here?

823
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,545
Your father…

824
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,217
I just can't forget.

825
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,113
I…

826
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:35,408
guess I had you all wrong.

827
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,746
When he introduced you to me,

828
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,958
something didn't feel right.

829
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,546
It seemed you were always acting.

830
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,344
Even after my father died,

831
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:59,140
I thought you only cared
about taking over.

832
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,185
But now I know…

833
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,273
you're truly mourning for him.

834
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,653
Thank you.

835
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,717
That's Kaneki, an accomplice of the Tomas.

836
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,805
He kept silent in court,

837
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,891
so his sentence for abetting was heavy.

838
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:10,354
He's been dead for more than three months.

839
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,816
Look.

840
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:19,446
The brain thief must've
stolen his victims list,

841
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,907
and is using it to kill.

842
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,582
There goes our last lead on the killer…

843
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,883
I might have another.

844
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,391
Ninomiya has a neuro chip too.

845
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,604
How did you find out? Explain yourself.

846
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,440
I saw his hospital records.

847
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,150
You what?!

848
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,236
Without a warrant?! He's a lawyer!

849
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,823
His attending neurosurgeon's disappeared.

850
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,617
The victims, Kenmochi,

851
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,620
and Ninomiya could be connected.

852
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,538
Trace his movements.

853
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,750
Proof of involvement in the disappearance?

854
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,504
-None yet.
-Connected to what crime?

855
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:21,675
-Possibly…
-Was Ninomiya last to get a chip?

856
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:24,929
I don't know.

857
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:27,806
Toshiro.

858
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:33,687
Illegal viewing of records
is a matter for Internal Affairs.

859
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:34,772
Stand down.

860
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:35,689
But…

861
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:40,277
I accept that Ninomiya
is important to the case.

862
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:44,240
Whether we track him or not
is up to the chief.

863
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:06,804
Hey.

864
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:09,807
Are you sure I should join you?

865
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,186
You said you wanted to.

866
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,063
Sure, but…

867
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,068
Akira?!

868
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,697
It's been so long!

869
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:30,327
Your first visit since you graduated.

870
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:34,665
I heard you're doing well as a lawyer.

871
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,751
You've worked so hard.

872
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:41,547
You used to be such a big bully.

873
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,424
Akira was a bully?

874
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,050
He was.

875
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,761
He always sang the same song.

876
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,263
How did it go?

877
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,187
Please don't dredge up the past.

878
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,397
So?

879
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,858
Come to announce your wedding?

880
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,484
Ms. Ryoko…

881
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,281
Do you mind?

882
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,701
Er, may I take a look around?

883
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:14,330
Please do. The children will love it.

884
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:32,723
Was I dumped

885
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,184
by this couple?

886
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,062
As I told you before,

887
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:41,607
you were four when you were left here.

888
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,609
No one saw it.

889
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:49,156
We sometimes received
anonymous phone calls though.

890
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,908
About what?

891
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:54,787
They asked rather strange questions.

892
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,915
"Is he a smooth talker?"

893
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:00,250
"Is he full of himself?"

894
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,420
"Is he not bothered by bullying?"

895
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:07,174
Then the calls suddenly stopped.

896
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,552
As if they were describing me.

897
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,513
So true.

898
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,598
I wonder why?

899
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:19,103
A PCL-R psychopathy test.

900
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,939
It's like…

901
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,108
a personality assessment.

902
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,026
Is that right?

903
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,612
You really are a lawyer now.

904
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,697
You know everything.

905
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,745
You're a lot softer and kinder.

906
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,956
Must be thanks to her.

907
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,667
Thank you.

908
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,043
Take care.

909
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,169
See you.

910
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,761
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

911
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,638
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

912
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,306
<i>Let it shine on the little rock</i>

913
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,100
<i>Let it shine on the little rock</i>

914
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,519
<i>Let the heat of the sunlight</i>

915
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:04,398
<i>Warm up the rock plenty</i>

916
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:11,447
<i>When I was sitting down</i>
<i>Next to the little rock</i>

917
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:17,369
<i>Funny thing is I became a little rock too</i>

918
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:23,333
<i>And my heart got warm inside bit by bit</i>

919
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:29,214
<i>It made me so happy</i>
<i>That I wanted to sing out loud</i>

920
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,925
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

921
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,594
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

922
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,262
<i>Let it shine on me too</i>

923
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,014
<i>Let it shine on me too</i>

924
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:39,475
<i>Let the heat of the sunlight</i>

925
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,978
<i>Warm me up plenty</i>

926
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,022
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

927
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,940
<i>Let the sunshine in</i>

928
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,609
<i>Let it shine on me too</i>

929
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,319
<i>Let it shine on me too</i>

930
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:53,030
<i>Let the heat of the sunlight</i>

931
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:57,326
<i>Warm me up plenty</i>

932
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,293
What's wrong?

933
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,004
Nothing…

934
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,943
It's your first time coming back.

935
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:41,119
<i>Munch, munch, gulp.</i>

936
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:45,999
<i>The monstrous lumberjack ate Hans.</i>

937
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,419
<i>When its stomach became full,</i>

938
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:50,796
<i>it finally realized.</i>

939
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,632
<i>"Wait…"</i>

940
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,343
<i>"What Hans said is true."</i>

941
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:01,306
<i>"I spend more time</i>
<i>as a lumberjack than a monster."</i>

942
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:04,142
<i>"Am I not a monster,</i>

943
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,562
<i>but just a mere lumberjack?"</i>

944
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,773
<i>"The monstrous lumberjack</i>

945
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:13,902
<i>suddenly became confused</i>
<i>about its true identity."</i>

946
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,283
So that's it…

947
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,536
I know who it is…

948
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,318
What is this, Sugitani?

949
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,904
Why pretend to be the monster?

950
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,157
You really can't kill now.

951
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,203
I knew it, but it's a letdown.

952
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,759
Did you think I'd sell you out?

953
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,970
Don't worry.

954
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,765
I know who the monster is.

955
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,476
I'll have my data soon.

956
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:31,938
So, we're still a team?

957
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,066
Yeah.

958
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:38,612
Prepare for the surgery.

959
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:40,906
What a relief.

960
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,241
If you really mean that…

961
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,744
Of course, you becoming normal

962
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,246
would've been a fun experiment.

963
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:53,126
Pathetic morality
probably would've been your downfall.

964
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,523
Everything alright?

965
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,413
Ms. Ranko Toshiro, correct?

966
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:16,168
You have a PhD from MIT.

967
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,879
Why be a poorly paid cop?

968
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,674
You looked me up.

969
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:28,847
Over 20 years ago,

970
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,267
a man entered an elementary school,

971
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,605
and slaughtered nine young children.

972
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,399
All just to…

973
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,445
receive a death sentence.

974
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,243
My older brother

975
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,498
was one of that selfish man's victims.

976
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,417
I see.

977
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,630
You want revenge in a roundabout way?

978
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,599
A psychopath would see it like that.

979
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,085
What are you insinuating?

980
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:45,757
Mr. Ninomiya.

981
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,553
There's a neuro chip in your head?

982
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,729
Aha.

983
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,775
You checked my records without a warrant?

984
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,113
To get to the truth, I stop at nothing.

985
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,659
Whatever's in my brain,

986
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:16,413
it might make me more sane than you.

987
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:25,046
Being a psychopath isn't a crime.

988
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,550
Don't judge a person on their personality.

989
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,011
Judge their actions.

990
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,267
Why…

991
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,854
did you come alone?

992
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,983
Because…

993
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,903
Your illegal search got you dismissed.

994
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,530
So,

995
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,243
whatever happens to you here,

996
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,622
no one will know.

997
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,260
I won't take your bait.

998
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,349
I'm sure you're recording
audio or video of me.

999
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,555
-Hello?
<i>-Did you say anything to Inui?</i>

1000
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,556
Inui?

1001
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,392
<i>Why, sir?</i>

1002
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,978
Kenmochi got away.

1003
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,522
<i>He's gone missing.</i>

1004
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:07,148
<i>Listen.</i>

1005
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,776
Did you get Inui to

1006
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,736
<i>act on your behalf?</i>

1007
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,198
<i>Hey.</i>

1008
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:19,160
If somebody's hunting psychopaths,

1009
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,787
why stop them?

1010
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,833
Are you serious?

1011
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,168
That detective, Inui.

1012
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,879
Nobody's more suspicious.

1013
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:34,342
Scum like him will never change.

1014
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,806
<i>For caution's sake,</i>

1015
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,935
does Inui fit your profile?

1016
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,315
Give me his address.

1017
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,275
FROM: EMI HASUMI

1018
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:40,241
COME TO THE TOMAS' MANSION

1019
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:55,381
<i>Now the monstrous lumberjack</i>

1020
01:24:55,965 --> 01:25:00,303
<i>had no friends left that it could talk to.</i>

1021
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:04,390
<i>"What should I do?"</i>

1022
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,817
<i>Upset, the monstrous lumberjack</i>

1023
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,278
<i>decided to go and make new friends</i>

1024
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>in another village.</i>

1025
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:32,919
<i>Upon arriving in the new village,</i>

1026
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:36,965
<i>it snuck into the house</i>
<i>of the local lumberjack.</i>

1027
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:39,467
<i>Then,</i>

1028
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:44,305
<i>it took a baby there,</i>
<i>stretched its ears to make them big,</i>

1029
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:49,060
<i>and used a stone to</i>
<i>sharpen its teeth into fangs.</i>

1030
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:54,399
<i>"Now this child is</i>
<i>a monstrous lumberjack too."</i>

1031
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,055
<i>Akira, run!</i>

1032
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,600
<i>Run!</i>

1033
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,797
Inui?

1034
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:02,425
Inui?!

1035
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:26,241
<i>And so, the monstrous lumberjack</i>

1036
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:32,247
<i>visited many new villages,</i>
<i>and made many new friends.</i>

1037
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:37,085
<i>It hoped that one day,</i>
<i>its friends would teach it</i>

1038
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,296
<i>whether it is a monster,</i>

1039
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,091
<i>or a mere lumberjack.</i>

1040
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:50,556
<i>The monstrous lumberjack</i>
<i>made many new friends.</i>

1041
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:40,565
Inui?

1042
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:03,046
Whoa, what's all this?

1043
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,131
Inui…

1044
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,804
You didn't have to bust my door.

1045
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,682
Inui…

1046
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,518
You thought I was the killer?

1047
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:21,230
What a joke. Don't waste your time.

1048
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,108
Why not answer our calls?

1049
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:32,784
Oh, I muted my phone
while I was visiting a grave.

1050
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:37,580
This isn't my case anymore,
so get off my back.

1051
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,207
Whose grave?

1052
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,085
Saki Kenmochi.

1053
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:44,837
Died two years ago today.

1054
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:50,802
Oddly enough, pretty flowers
had been laid there.

1055
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,596
Her relatives are all gone.

1056
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,687
You lose.

1057
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,273
Then…

1058
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,652
why not take off that stupid mask?

1059
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,781
After all,

1060
01:30:11,864 --> 01:30:14,700
I know who you are.

1061
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,916
Behavior modification…

1062
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:26,254
Damn, I should've known!

1063
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:31,843
Where…?!

1064
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,490
How did you know?

1065
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,411
I know…

1066
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:04,000
that for some reason,

1067
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,210
your neuro chip broke.

1068
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:27,773
You can empathize again.

1069
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:31,402
You can feel guilt for what you've done.

1070
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:35,239
So you started hunting psychopaths.

1071
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,035
Hey! Toshiro!

1072
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,502
Can't let them kill each other.

1073
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,050
Two years ago,

1074
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,012
that Rottweiler cop hit me,

1075
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,309
I've been changing, little by little.

1076
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,942
I'd only lived
for self-gratification and rage, then,

1077
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,444
out of the blue…

1078
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:20,618
different emotions rose up.

1079
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,165
Pain and shock.

1080
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:30,795
Joy and sadness.

1081
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,175
I could feel what other people felt…

1082
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:42,765
and something welled up inside me.

1083
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:51,148
I came to my senses.

1084
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,697
I found a reason to live
outside of myself.

1085
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:03,286
But that…

1086
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,874
brought despair as well.

1087
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:17,091
I once had a wife who trusted me.

1088
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,596
She was all I had.

1089
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,730
I killed her with my bare hands.

1090
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,783
If so…

1091
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,164
please let this woman go.

1092
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,210
There's…

1093
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,756
nothing I can do now.

1094
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:21,989
Akira!

1095
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,077
At first,

1096
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:30,498
I wanted to reform
you manmade psychopaths.

1097
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:32,416
But,

1098
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,127
as I investigated your kind,

1099
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,047
I found out that

1100
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:43,010
many people around you died,
with no consequences.

1101
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:49,016
That woman's father was one of them.

1102
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,311
I'm sure…

1103
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:56,357
you shoved him off that building.

1104
01:35:02,696 --> 01:35:04,657
He's lying, right?

1105
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,450
Akira?

1106
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,499
Erasing your kind from existence

1107
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:18,546
is the only way I can repay Saki.

1108
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:22,466
From now on,

1109
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,680
I won't let your kind kill again.

1110
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:32,435
Please don't!

1111
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,164
So that's it…

1112
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,625
So that's why

1113
01:35:56,709 --> 01:36:01,046
you let that witness go
who saw you at the parking lot.

1114
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,465
I know why.

1115
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,510
You can only kill us psychopaths.

1116
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:15,352
Now,

1117
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:18,272
this woman's not your hostage.

1118
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:20,983
She's mine.

1119
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:24,111
Akira…?

1120
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:26,113
Damn you…

1121
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:32,286
I was going to play along, but no more.

1122
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:35,664
Give me the data, or else

1123
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,666
I'll kill this woman.

1124
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,128
Don't do it.

1125
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:46,217
It's true.

1126
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:50,221
I killed your father.

1127
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,894
And you're next.

1128
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,980
Killed by the man you love. How romantic.

1129
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,482
Akira!

1130
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:03,776
Please, don't do this!

1131
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,112
Don't do it.

1132
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,326
Don't do it, dammit!

1133
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,830
The one you wanted to kill most

1134
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,500
is yourself.

1135
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:49,298
How did you guess?

1136
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:56,138
<i>Just like you,</i>

1137
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,183
<i>in that moment,</i>

1138
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,354
<i>my neuro chip must've broken too.</i>

1139
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,857
You mean, you're…

1140
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,415
The data's in here?

1141
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,626
Photos of it.

1142
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,757
Of our families before our abductions too.

1143
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:35,969
Yours was also…

1144
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:39,890
a family free of violence and crime,

1145
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:42,810
who raised you lovingly.

1146
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,646
You were a crybaby,

1147
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:50,442
but you watched out for
kids smaller than you.

1148
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,448
Even after being brought here,

1149
01:39:57,991 --> 01:40:02,287
you cried at the thought of
your dad and mom worrying.

1150
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:21,432
How will you use the data?

1151
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,601
For surgery,

1152
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,813
to make you a monster again?

1153
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:33,819
I…

1154
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:38,240
owe her…

1155
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:48,876
for teaching me
not all emotions are a burden.

1156
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:55,674
So…

1157
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,936
No surgery for me.

1158
01:41:12,816 --> 01:41:14,526
Really…

1159
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,906
That means, just now…

1160
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:24,411
you had me totally fooled.

1161
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,001
But I…

1162
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:35,964
can't live with this pain anymore.

1163
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:41,637
Can you?

1164
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,767
Pain, as in guilt?

1165
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:53,732
I find that intriguing.

1166
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,944
Living with guilt, as you described.

1167
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,740
Really…

1168
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,348
Not just that.

1169
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:31,019
Now I'm human, I'm invincible.

1170
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:34,731
To find the meaning of life,

1171
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,275
I'll…

1172
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:39,736
outlive you all.

1173
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:52,040
That's where we differ…

1174
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:57,546
Akira.

1175
01:43:14,187 --> 01:43:15,355
Leave him alone!

1176
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,983
Get off me, Takeshi!

1177
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:19,693
Akira, run!

1178
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,194
Run!

1179
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,835
-Stop! Takeshi! No!
-Akira!

1180
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,256
Takeshi…?

1181
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:47,262
You remember, huh?

1182
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:57,856
I couldn't save you…

1183
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,487
Forgive me.

1184
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:20,212
Good luck with being human…

1185
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:26,134
Akira.

1186
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:18,872
Kenmochi!

1187
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,256
Toshiro! Stay back!

1188
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:37,307
Kenmochi! Don't die!

1189
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:56,034
Kenmochi!

1190
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,090
You can't just go in!

1191
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:13,593
I'm sorry, she barged in…

1192
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,095
It's fine.

1193
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:27,607
Ms. Toshiro. What is it now?

1194
01:47:29,025 --> 01:47:31,403
Why did you make me go there?

1195
01:47:32,445 --> 01:47:34,906
You knew about the tracker.

1196
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:37,784
It was discarded at the mansion.

1197
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,414
Why…

1198
01:47:43,915 --> 01:47:45,542
do you think?

1199
01:47:48,336 --> 01:47:51,548
In case you couldn't defeat the monster.

1200
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:53,091
You used me.

1201
01:47:57,804 --> 01:48:01,433
We're confirming
the brain thief was Kenmochi.

1202
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:05,145
He killed other manmade psychopaths

1203
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:07,314
as penance for his sins.

1204
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:13,778
And you killed him before he killed you.

1205
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,699
Mr. Ninomiya.

1206
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:21,203
You're a victim of the Tomas too.

1207
01:48:22,704 --> 01:48:26,249
You'll live with a sin
that wasn't your own?

1208
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:31,963
Ms. Toshiro.

1209
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,763
No one can escape from themselves.

1210
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:45,352
I won't make excuses for the way I live.

1211
01:48:57,447 --> 01:49:00,367
Excuse me, I should take this.

1212
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:11,753
Mr. Ninomiya.

1213
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:18,134
I'm going to take you down.

1214
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:24,266
Till then, don't die on me.

1215
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:37,779
What does he mean, no surgery?

1216
01:49:39,197 --> 01:49:41,366
Akira's such a liar.

1217
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,035
You're awake.

1218
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,706
Better take it easy.

1219
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:33,877
Akira…

1220
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:37,172
I…

1221
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:54,481
It's all over.

1222
01:50:57,901 --> 01:51:00,403
I'll explain what happened.

1223
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,709
I scared you.

1224
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,129
Forgive me.

1225
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:53,248
Not just for my father…

1226
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:57,502
You only ever wanted to use me!

1227
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:01,798
You didn't care how I felt at all!

1228
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:06,136
I won't forgive you! How could I ever?!

1229
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,142
Now it's self-defense.

1230
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,273
Go…

1231
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,818
to that female cop.

1232
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,788
Akira?

1233
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,165
I…

1234
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:19,542
Just go.

1235
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:22,212
Go!

1236
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:03,586
The monstrous lumberjack…

1237
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:10,260
made many…

1238
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:14,889
new friends…

1239
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,364
