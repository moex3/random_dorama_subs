1
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,903
Nishikata! Good morning!

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,655
Takagi-san! Good morning.

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,408
I'm on class duty today
so I'll go first, okay?

4
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,617
Okay.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,120
Are you gonna be late again today?

6
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,789
Again? I still have plenty of time.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,417
Well, see you at school!

8
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:44,961
See you.

9
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,345
<i>I'm always getting teased by Takagi-san.</i>

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>But today's the day</i>
<i>I'm gonna get her back!</i>

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,856
<i>This is what I spent everyday thinking.</i>

12
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>A record of my second year of junior high.</i>

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,028
<i>Or rather, my memories.</i>

14
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>You'd better watch your back,</i>

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>Takagi-san!</i>

16
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,721
Okay, lesson three.

17
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,307
Today, we'll be discussing
the future tense.

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,852
There are two main types of future tense.

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,357
Expressions using "will"
and those using "be going to."

20
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,943
We'll go through them one at a time.

21
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,279
Starting with expressions using "will."

22
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,951
Let's start with a review.

23
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,369
Hey, Nishikata.

24
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,620
What is it?

25
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,996
What are you doing?

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,374
Nothing really, why?

27
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,877
No reason.

28
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,047
All right, let's talk about
the future tense using "will."

29
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,664
Whoa!

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,586
Yes! This is perfect!

31
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,921
I'll use this to get back at Takagi-san!

32
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,176
Just like in Japanese,

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:03,224
"Watch", "run", "eat"
words that express actions are verbs.

34
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,143
For example…

35
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,855
What's wrong?

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,108
It's just my pencil case won't open.

37
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,235
I wonder if it got bent?

38
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,447
Can you open it for me?

39
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,365
Yeah, I guess.

40
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,662
Whoa!

41
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,332
Keep it down, Nishikata!

42
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,875
Sorry!

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,794
Nishikata, your reactions are priceless!

44
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>Damn it, she got me.</i>

45
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,513
<i>And with the trick I had planned!</i>

46
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,854
<i>Takagi-san asking for my help</i>
<i>in the first place is strange.</i>

47
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
<i>I should have known better!</i>

48
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,243
Hey!

49
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
What? Are you gonna tease me again?

50
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,497
No.

51
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,291
Lend me your eraser, I forgot mine.

52
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,461
You're clumsier than I thought,
Takagi-san.

53
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,671
Maybe I am.

54
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,466
I've got another one.
You can keep it for today if you want.

55
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,343
Really? Thanks!

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,728
By the way, do you remember
that thing in elementary school,

57
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,482
where if you write your crush's name
on an eraser and you use it all up,

58
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,150
that person will like you back?

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,527
Yeah, I remember that.

60
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,780
Thinking back, that was so childish!

61
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,115
Childish?

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,285
Yeah. There's no way that could be true.

63
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,286
Don't you think?

64
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,039
I don't think that, but…

65
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,792
You never tried it?

66
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,336
No way, I don't have a crush anyway.

67
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,508
What about when you're stuck
on your homework?

68
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,554
Didn't you ever just start writing
your crush's name?

69
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,514
No way, not me.

70
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,101
Huh? Really?

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,980
What? It doesn't say anything!

72
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,148
I see…

73
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,983
I guess you're right.

74
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,110
It's so childish.

75
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,739
No way. Is there something written on it?

76
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
Hmm? What's wrong?

77
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,619
Even if there is,
someone's just playing a trick!

78
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,788
Just give it back!

79
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,542
Didn't you say I could keep it all day?

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,710
Here.

81
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,216
Nothing's written on it!

82
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,677
I didn't say there was.

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:56,689
When using "be going to,"
we use the verb in its original form…

84
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,193
Please remember this.

85
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,987
You had your own the whole time!

86
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,655
I told you to keep it down!

87
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,698
Sorry!

88
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,578
You're making me laugh so much.
Give me a break!

89
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,913
That's my line!

90
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,793
And so, the question is…

91
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,295
Excuse me, may I go to the restroom?

92
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,214
Go ahead.

93
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,177
So, to make the sentence,

94
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,263
"Are you going to visit
your friend tomorrow?"

95
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,727
Damn it… just you wait.

96
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,487
That's it!

97
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,450
<i>I'll write someone's name on her eraser</i>

98
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,204
<i>and trick her when she gets back</i>
<i>from the restroom!</i>

99
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,085
But who's name do I write?

100
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,048
<i>What?</i>

101
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,593
<i>I really shouldn't look.</i>

102
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,180
<i>Well, maybe just a peek.</i>

103
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,143
RO

104
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,479
<i>"Ro"? So it's not my name…</i>

105
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,025
<i>And it can't be anyone</i>
<i>in this class, either.</i>

106
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,612
<i>What? Then who is it?</i>

107
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>Whatever! I'm gonna look!</i>

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,787
ROUKAMIRO

109
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,791
"Roukamiro"?

110
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,585
What?

111
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,254
Look at the hallway?

112
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,343
Ah!

113
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,109
Nishikata, you really are the best.

114
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,155
This is exactly why
I can't stop teasing you.

115
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,741
Damn it.

116
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,785
Just you wait.
I'm gonna get you back someday.

117
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,289
I doubt it.

118
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,626
You missed out on a great chance!

119
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,754
Missed? What do you mean?

120
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,298
Oh, nothing.

121
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,161
Look carefully at your partner
while you draw.

122
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,093
Nishikata, stop moving so much.
Look at me.

123
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,074
Okay! Switch places when you're done.

124
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,523
Here.

125
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,692
Thank you.

126
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,030
We've been staring and staring.
You and me.

127
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,909
Only because to draw we…

128
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,212
I'm just doing the assignment.

129
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,603
What will you do when you get home?

130
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,773
A lot happened today so,
maybe I'll go for a run.

131
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,774
"A lot"?

132
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,318
What do you mean "a lot"?

133
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,612
A lot is a lot.

134
00:10:55,404 --> 00:11:00,785
Right. Like being teased by me
and beaten at everything?

135
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,038
No, it's not that!

136
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, yeah?

137
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,543
So, you want to run to cheer up.
Like that?

138
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,048
Can you run pretty far?

139
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,050
Who knows?

140
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,052
The other day, I ran to the Tada coast.

141
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,969
Really?

142
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,929
I sure did.

143
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,557
That's pretty far away, isn't it?

144
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,394
Are you sure?

145
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,395
I'm not lying!

146
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,771
Hmm?

147
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,357
That's pretty amazing if true.

148
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,443
Good luck! See you tomorrow!

149
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,120
Damn it.

150
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,831
She doesn't believe me at all!

151
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,542
All right.

152
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,086
I'll do it now and send
a picture to prove it!

153
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,727
Almost there!

154
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
I made it!

155
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,745
I feel amazing!

156
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,938
More importantly, I gotta
send a picture to Takagi-san!

157
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,272
All right.

158
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,500
Listen up, Takagi-san!

159
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,461
Witness my leg strength!

160
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,837
Send!

161
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,654
PRETTY SUNSET, THANKS

162
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,532
What? "Sunset"?

163
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,496
Not that! I want her to know
how awesome it is that I ran here!

164
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,334
Oh, you didn't want to show me the sunset?

165
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,461
That's right, not the sunset…

166
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,714
Huh?

167
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,426
What? Huh?

168
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,845
Takagi-san? What are you doing here?

169
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,054
Huh?

170
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,642
Talking to you before
made me want to see the sunset.

171
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,067
Do you want a drink?

172
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,029
Thanks.

173
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,563
I'm really happy.

174
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:45,319
You ran all the way here
to send me a picture of the sunset.

175
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,196
It's not like that…

176
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,156
It's not?

177
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,242
It's just…

178
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,244
That I…

179
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,040
You know, I ran all the way--

180
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,458
Nishikata!

181
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,376
What?

182
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,463
It's so red, isn't it?

183
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,299
Red? Am I blushing?

184
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,347
A beautiful red sunset!

185
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
So pretty!

186
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,225
Huh?

187
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh, the sunset!

188
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,148
Yeah, it sure is.

189
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,651
It is a sunset, after all.

190
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,112
Well, it's not as red as you.

191
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,780
What?

192
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,496
I'm glad I followed you here, Nishikata.

193
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,045
I even got to see the sunset with you.

194
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
Huh?

195
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,692
It's amazing.

196
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,777
You actually ran all the way here!

197
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,404
You're amazing, Nishikata.

198
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,948
It's not that big a deal.

199
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,616
It's not?

200
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:19,997
So, you didn't send me a picture
so I'd think you're awesome?

201
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,206
Of course not!

202
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,916
So, why did you?

203
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,878
To show me the pretty sunset?

204
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,673
No, not that either.

205
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,468
I mean, yes! That's it.

206
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,012
I just wanted to share the pretty sunset.

207
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,806
I thought maybe you'd want to see it.

208
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,475
The sunset.

209
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,061
I see!

210
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,940
So, you saw the pretty sunset
and wanted me to see it too.

211
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,068
Yes! Just like that.

212
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,362
It's kind of…

213
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,532
It's like we're lovers.

214
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,160
What? Really?

215
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,788
Wow! You're turning red again!

216
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,414
No, I'm not!

217
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,416
It's because of the sunset!

218
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,510
Can I have a sip?

219
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Here.

220
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
Don't you want some?

221
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,630
I'm not thirsty.

222
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,353
Are you going to walk home?

223
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,397
Or do you plan on running again?

224
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,774
Hmm… Good question.

225
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,235
I guess I'll walk.

226
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,653
Yeah?

227
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,532
Wanna ride together?

228
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,618
No, no it's fine! It's your bike.

229
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,956
Could it be…
you can't pedal with two people?

230
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,876
No! I can but it's dangerous and…

231
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,586
I'll just walk, okay?

232
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,715
Oh, I know! Could it be you're just
embarrassed of being seen?

233
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,300
No!

234
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:45,517
The last guy who gave me a ride
was so strong and cool!

235
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,561
What?

236
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,106
Well, I'll be going now.

237
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,570
Hey, wait!

238
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,448
I'll pedal.

239
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,409
Really? Can you pedal?

240
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,577
Of course I can.

241
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,130
I'm ready.

242
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
Okay, here we go.

243
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,592
Thank you!

244
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,141
Are you okay?

245
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,559
Of course, I'm okay!

246
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,410
It was my dad!

247
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,787
What?

248
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,958
The last person who gave me a ride,
it was my dad.

249
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,627
It was?

250
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,671
Are you relieved?

251
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,589
Say what?

252
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,383
Say what?

253
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,218
Cut it out!

254
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,080
Dinner's ready!

255
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
Coming!

256
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:43,927
NISHI

257
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:21,274
