1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,591
Can you open it for me?

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,385
Yeah, I guess.

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,805
Whoa!

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,849
Keep it down, Nishikata!

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,017
Sorry!

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,603
You're making me laugh so much.
Give me a break!

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,980
That's my line!

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,568
<i>I'm always getting teased by Takagi-san.</i>

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,239
If you write your crush's name
on an eraser and you use it all up,

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,491
that person will like you back?

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,287
"Roukamiro"?

12
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,467
Here.

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,510
Thank you.

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,639
We've been staring and staring.
You and me.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,391
Only because to draw we…

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,901
You ran all the way here
to send me a picture of the sunset.

17
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,569
It's not like that…

18
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,696
It's so red, isn't it?

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,491
Red? Am I blushing?

20
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,660
A beautiful red sunset!

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,329
So pretty!

22
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,747
Oh, the sunset!

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,542
Yeah, it sure is.

24
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,505
<i>You'd better watch your back,</i>

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,673
<i>Takagi-san!</i>

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,227
There's gotta be some way
to trick Takagi-san.

27
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,564
Some competition, I can beat her at…

28
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,983
Morning, Nishikata!

29
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,735
Morning.

30
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,903
Let's go together.

31
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,865
What about your bike?

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,991
My bike?

33
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,912
Well, today…

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,250
I wanted to go to school
while holding hands with you.

35
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,044
So, I left it at home.

36
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,505
Really?

37
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,215
-You think so?
-No!

38
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,008
Of course not!

39
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,263
<i>Takagi-san, you always do this!</i>

40
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,849
<i>Oh!</i>

41
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,517
<i>That's it!</i>

42
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,686
<i>That will work!</i>

43
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,813
-Actually, about my bike--
-Wait!

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,110
How about if I can guess the reason,
I'm the winner.

45
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,487
All of a sudden?

46
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,114
A competition?

47
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,201
Sure! Guess away.

48
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:41,953
<i>Yes!</i>

49
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,456
<i>I didn't miss what you said, Takagi-san!</i>

50
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,837
<i>The words you casually spoke</i>
<i>on our way home yesterday</i>…

51
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,722
I think something's wrong with the brakes.

52
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,227
<i>To think I could win so easily!</i>

53
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,814
-The answer is your br--
-Wait!

54
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,650
One more rule.

55
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,237
If you guess the wrong answer,
you immediately lose the game.

56
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,240
If I'm wrong, I lose?

57
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,700
Yes.

58
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,744
So? What's your guess?

59
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,789
Well, then…

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,125
Let me think about it some more.

61
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>Brakes?</i>

62
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>Is it not the brakes?</i>

63
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,028
Hey, Nishikata.

64
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,280
Want to go this way?

65
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,241
Yeah, I guess.

66
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>Stairs?</i>

67
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>You can't take the stairs with a bike.</i>

68
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>That's it! It's because</i>
<i>she wanted to go this way.</i>

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,752
Takagi-san.

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,504
Yeah?

71
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,505
<i>Hold on!</i>

72
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>This might be one of her traps!</i>

73
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,176
Nothing.

74
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:27,058
Without a bike,
we can take all sorts of new roads.

75
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,944
<i>So, it must be the stairs.</i>

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,154
<i>No, think this through!</i>

77
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,824
<i>I'll lose if I'm wrong.</i>

78
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>Wait a minute…</i>

79
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,376
Takagi-san.

80
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,462
I don't think this competition is fair.

81
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,630
Why?

82
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:02,385
Even if I'm right, you could say
I'm wrong and I'd still lose.

83
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,888
Oh… don't worry about that!

84
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,142
I wouldn't lie to you.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,769
Really?

86
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,479
Really.

87
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:18,568
I've never even once lied to you before.

88
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,456
What?

89
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,137
I saw this cat
the last time I came this way too.

90
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,764
Isn't it cute?

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,475
It's so cute.

92
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,938
It's not scared at all!

93
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,983
<i>That's it!</i>

94
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,777
<i>Now, I've got it!</i>

95
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,613
Takagi-san, can I guess now?

96
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
Oh, you figured it out?

97
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,700
Go ahead.

98
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,789
The reason you're walking to school today…

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,958
is because your brakes are busted!

100
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,002
Brakes?

101
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,464
Stairs, and now a cat…

102
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:27,053
You've tried to mislead me with
things you couldn't do on a bike,

103
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,847
but you've made a grave mistake!

104
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,980
You were trying to make me forget about
when you mentioned your brakes yesterday.

105
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,691
But I saw right through it!

106
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,654
Well, Takagi-san, am I right?

107
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,865
No! That's incorrect!

108
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,534
What?

109
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,536
The answer is…

110
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,207
I just wanted to see you
get flustered about it.

111
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,752
That's really the answer?
You didn't change it?

112
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,462
It sure is.

113
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,673
If that's true…

114
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,177
I lost the second
I proposed the competition.

115
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,476
I had two reasons,
and you still didn't get it.

116
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,311
Too bad.

117
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,898
Two? So what's the other reason?

118
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,821
I don't think you could guess
that one either.

119
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,407
What do you mean? Tell me.

120
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,118
You already lost,
so it doesn't matter, right?

121
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,043
I already told you the second answer
when I saw you this morning.

122
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,379
What?

123
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,132
Nothing!

124
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,344
Come on, tell me!

125
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,347
It's the brakes, right?

126
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,850
Yeah, sure, the brakes.

127
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,977
"Yeah, sure"? What does that mean?

128
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,605
-Secret.
-Huh?

129
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,816
<i>What?</i>

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,199
Ready? Okay?

131
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,409
You good? Look at each other.

132
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,660
Ready?

133
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,620
Go!

134
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,372
Oh, no!

135
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,169
The winner is Nakai!

136
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,964
He's too strong.
You didn't stand a chance.

137
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,134
Hamaguchi you should be able to take.

138
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,180
-Let's go. All right!
-You're going to regret this.

139
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,057
Ready, go!

140
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,435
Oh, not bad! Keep going!

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,437
Oh you're in trouble!

142
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,355
It's bad!

143
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,149
Hamaguchi wins!

144
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,275
What?!

145
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,987
I understand losing to Nakai,
but Takao and Hamaguchi too?

146
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,907
-Nice.
-He was actually pretty strong.

147
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,535
Hey! Let me try!

148
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,163
Who will you challenge, Takagi-san?

149
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,000
The weakest person, I guess.

150
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,294
So, Nishikata?

151
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,214
You can do it!

152
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,799
It's just Takagi-san.

153
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,843
-She's a girl.
-You got this! You can do it!

154
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,811
-What?
-Nothing.

155
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,022
Okay.

156
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,857
-Ready--
-Wait!

157
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,986
-What?
-I just…

158
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,864
It's nothing.

159
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,491
Sorry! Let's do it.

160
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,786
Okay, then…

161
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,455
Ready, go!

162
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,583
You can do it Takagi-san!

163
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,335
<i>I totally got this.</i>

164
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,547
<i>Are girls really this weak?</i>

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,179
Takagi-san, what were you about to say?

166
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,556
Say?

167
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,813
I was thinking about how Nishikata
and I are holding hands.

168
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,856
What?

169
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,692
The winner is, Takagi-san!

170
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,068
Yay!

171
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,196
Don't sweat it, Nishikata.

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,156
H-Huh?

173
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,658
Looks like I'm the winner.

174
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,245
No worries. Can't win them all.

175
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,877
Damn it.

176
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,255
How can I beat Takagi-san? How?

177
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,467
Nishikata!

178
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,885
What are you doing?

179
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,637
Don't scare me like that, Nakai.

180
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,764
I'm just going to the toilet.

181
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,100
Are you practicing cool poses
in the mirror?

182
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,103
-Of course not!
-Funny faces then?

183
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,401
<i>Funny faces? That's it!</i>

184
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,157
<i>Hey, this is actually pretty funny!</i>

185
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
<i>Like this?</i>

186
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,664
<i>Or this?</i>

187
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,919
You and Takagi-san are pretty close, huh?

188
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,464
You don't, like, you know…

189
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,678
Dodging the question like that,
you definitely do.

190
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,306
Nishikata? You definitely lik--

191
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,432
What did you say?

192
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,769
What kind of face is that?

193
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,188
Cut it out!

194
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,147
Perfect!

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,858
-This will do it!
-Do what?

196
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,533
Let's check the answers.

197
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,203
Today, we'll be covering the basics--

198
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,290
<i>Laugh at my funny face and</i>
<i>feel the wrath of the teacher, Takagi-san!</i>

199
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,212
<i>I have to wait patiently</i>
<i>until she talks to me.</i>

200
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,673
Playing soccer…

201
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,842
Hey, Nishikata.

202
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,677
<i>Now! Take this!</i>

203
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,011
What's up?

204
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
We can turn a verb into a noun.

205
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,521
This is called a gerund.

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,608
-Hey! Nishikata!
-Sorry!

207
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,869
I thought you'd do something,
but a funny face?

208
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,037
How boring!

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,835
Hey!

210
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,883
If you're making a funny face,
you need to do this with your eyebrows.

211
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,385
Like this?

212
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,931
And pinch your cheeks like this.

213
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,099
Like this?

214
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,395
Yeah, that's great!
Way better than before.

215
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,647
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-</i>And then…

216
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,776
<i>The person I was trying to make laugh</i>
<i>is teaching me how to be funny.</i>

217
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,363
<i>How humiliating.</i>

218
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,073
Make it more wrinkly.

219
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,742
<i>It doesn't matter!</i>

220
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>As long as she laughs and gets in trouble!</i>

221
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,456
Is this pretty good?

222
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,334
It's great! Way better.

223
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,502
Then laugh.

224
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,215
I think it might be funnier from the side.

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,176
From the side, it will be hilarious.

226
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,761
It will?

227
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,304
Okay.

228
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,556
Take this side face!

229
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,909
-What the hell are you doing, Nishikata?
-Sorry!

230
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,205
Jeez!

231
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
That's enough, pipe down.

232
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,253
We're still in class.

233
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,299
<i>Curse you, Takagi-san!</i>

234
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
My tummy aches!

235
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,564
<i>She's finally laughing,</i>
<i>but this is all wrong.</i>

236
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,566
<i>It wasn't supposed to be like this.</i>

237
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,121
Hey, Nishikata.

238
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,082
What?

239
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,168
Hey!

240
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,505
<i>I can't do it anymore.</i>

241
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,550
<i>If Mr. Tanabe gets angry again…</i>

242
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,470
<i>I've got to ignore</i>
<i>Takagi-san in class today.</i>

243
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,893
Hey, I'm talking to you.

244
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,478
What?

245
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,736
What is it?

246
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,115
You finally looked.

247
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,917
<i>Let's have a staring contest</i>

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>The first to laugh loses</i>

249
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,795
<i>Here I go</i>

250
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,424
What's with that face!

251
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,384
Hey! Nishikata!

252
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,594
Sorry!

253
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,192
Listen up.

254
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,445
You've been disruptive in class.

255
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,572
Get your act together.

256
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,075
Sorry.

257
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,788
As a punishment, you'll be cleaning
the science lab after school.

258
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,623
-What?
-Don't "what" me!

259
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,166
Got it?

260
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,626
Yes!

261
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,303
It's Takagi-san's fault I got in trouble.

262
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,313
Why do I have to do this by myself?

263
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,568
I'll just get it over with and go home.

264
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,116
What?

265
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,411
You're such a scaredy cat, Nishikata!

266
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,412
Takagi-san?!

267
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,498
That was so worth the wait!

268
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,877
Wait, you're being punished too?

269
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,008
-Okay! Let's quickly get this over with!
-What are you talking about?

270
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,967
Here.

271
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
Hey, Nishikata.

272
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,562
Open the window.

273
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,604
What?

274
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,912
Nishikata!

275
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,707
What are you two doing in there?

276
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,003
We have to clean as a punishment
for being loud in class.

277
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
That's rough!

278
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,964
How about you?

279
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,302
I'm just wandering around.

280
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,763
-You are?
-Yes.

281
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,639
Sorry to keep you waiting.

282
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,185
Hi.

283
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,936
Hi!

284
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,065
Let's not get in the way.

285
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,274
Huh? In the way?

286
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,694
Oh, you mean these two.

287
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,237
You're right.

288
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,530
I'll be going then.

289
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,699
Okay. See you.

290
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,785
Oh! Nishikata.

291
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,328
Good luck!

292
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,080
What?

293
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,463
Sorry, Takagi-san!

294
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,132
It's okay! See you!

295
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,593
Let's go.

296
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,564
Nakai's not just wandering around.

297
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,150
I think they're headed to the roof.

298
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,780
From his reaction
I bet it was Mano who invited him.

299
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,782
The roof?

300
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,575
Yeah.

301
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,204
I bet they're up there now,
just the two of them.

302
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,253
You were thinking something naughty!

303
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,046
I was not!

304
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,381
I was not!

305
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,342
-Let's clean!
-Right!

306
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,220
Right! Let's clean.
We have to get this over with.

307
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433
How romantic.

308
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,935
Romantic?

309
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,104
Those two.

310
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,606
I wonder what it must be like.

311
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,733
What?

312
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,237
Young love.

313
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,201
Yeah.

314
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,289
Let's finish this up!

315
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,759
Takagi-san, did you learn your lesson?
Stop teasing me, okay?

316
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,554
Yes. I'll behave a bit more.

317
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,558
You haven't learned anything.
We're going to get stuck cleaning again.

318
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,979
Nobody told me I had to clean.

319
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,189
What? Really?

320
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,232
So why did you…

321
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,028
You were hiding just to tease me?

322
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,239
That's part of it, I guess.

323
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,158
So, why?

324
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,287
Because I also
want to experience young love.

325
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,997
What?

326
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:14,254
I know! To thank me for helping you clean,
buy me juice on the way home.

327
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,589
What? Why?

328
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,216
Thanks!

329
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,301
"Thanks"? You've got it backward.

330
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
I'm the one who deserves a juice.

331
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,474
I wonder what flavor I should get.

332
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,862
