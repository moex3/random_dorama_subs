1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,299
<i>Let's have a staring contest</i>

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,677
<i>The first to laugh loses</i>

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>Here I go</i>

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,682
What's with that face!

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,600
Hey! Nishikata!

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,601
Sorry!

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,571
You're such a scaredy cat, Nishikata!

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,864
Damn it.

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,409
How can I beat Takagi-san? How?

10
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,456
I was thinking about how Nishikata
and I are holding hands.

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,498
What?

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,502
Looks like I'm the winner.

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,129
-No worries.
-H-Huh?

14
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>You'd better watch your back</i>…

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,094
<i>Takagi-san!</i>

16
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:03,438
This concludes the morning announcements.
Now the teachers will…

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:09,069
You must have stayed up late watching
last weeks <i>Hyaku Kata </i>on repeat.

18
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,570
Did not.

19
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>Hyaku Kata</i>…
that's <i>100% Unrequited Love</i>, right?

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,039
You haven't seen it,
but you know its abbreviation?

21
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,377
Got it?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,379
Nishikata and Takagi.

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,923
What?

24
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,466
Don't "what" me.

25
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,969
Starting today, Nishikata and Takagi

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,182
will be working reception in the library
every Thursday during the lunch break.

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,099
Got it?

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,768
Yes!

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,353
Pardon?

30
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,896
Don't "pardon" me!

31
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,856
Do you understand?

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,983
Yes.

33
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,115
LIBRARY

34
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,784
This book is so funny!

35
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,452
Hey!

36
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,499
We're losing a lunch break
a week for this.

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,461
It will go by in a flash if we read books.

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,046
Books…

39
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,216
Do you read a lot, Takagi-san?

40
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,467
Yeah.

41
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,303
You don't seem like you read much.

42
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,974
That feels like being told I'm stupid.

43
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,144
How about manga?

44
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,896
What do you read besides <i>Hyaku Kata</i>?

45
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,357
Why do you assume I read that?

46
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:36,072
Boys reading girly comic books
is totally fine by me.

47
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,535
I've read it but I don't really
know much about it.

48
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,417
We might as well grab some books.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,766
I don't really read books.

50
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,438
I only joined the library committee
because it sounded easy.

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,819
DINOSAURS

52
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,862
Wow.

53
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,123
Did you find something, Nishikata?

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,541
Not yet.

55
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,173
Since we're here.

56
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,218
Why don't we choose a book for each other?

57
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,011
I guess we could.

58
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,554
Okay, so let's do it.

59
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,943
Three, two, one, go!

60
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:55,860
What?!

61
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,821
You looked interested in it.

62
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,157
You saw me?

63
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,661
I like encyclopedias too.

64
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,247
Here.

65
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,083
BRIAN BY TOMOKO MIZUKAMI

66
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,169
Huh… I've never read this one.

67
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,546
I wonder what it's about?

68
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,633
Have you read this?

69
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,720
No, but I thought it looked good.

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>I just grabbed it at random.</i>

71
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>I hope it's good.</i>

72
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,364
<i>Takagi-san sure looks good with a book.</i>

73
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,368
What's that?

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,453
Were you looking at me?

75
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,830
No, I wasn't.

76
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, I know.

77
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:57,255
You were thinking about
how to tease me since we're all alone.

78
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,174
Yeah, maybe I was.

79
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,722
PREHISTORIC TITANOSAURS

80
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,684
EVOLVED TITANOSAURS

81
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,987
I'm enamored.

82
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,905
What?

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,326
I'm in love.

84
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,661
With those honest eyes.

85
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,290
-Like the heart of a young boy.
-What?

86
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,500
What?

87
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,544
What?

88
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,966
"When the young girl spoke those words,
Tanaka dropped his glass of orange juice.

89
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,220
Even the sight of the spill
was beautiful."

90
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,389
<i>I see.</i>

91
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,141
<i>She was just reading aloud.</i>

92
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,061
What's wrong?

93
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,271
Nothing.

94
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,776
Oh! This is, um…

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,322
It's called an Argentinosaurus.

96
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,909
-It's a type of dinosaur.
-Yeah.

97
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,412
It's 36 meters in length.

98
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,581
-Really?
-It's long, right?

99
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,084
Super long.

100
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,716
We didn't get any visitors.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,801
You're right.

102
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,719
Hopefully next week too.

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,971
So, we can be alone?

104
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,890
No! Because it's easy.

105
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,561
You should try reading a novel next week.

106
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,398
A novel? Do you have any recommendations?

107
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,318
Let's see…

108
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,573
Besides the one you brought me today,
anything is okay.

109
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,284
Huh? Was it really that bad?

110
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,371
Sorry, I chose it without checking.

111
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,414
No, it was good.

112
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,876
But I wouldn't recommend it to you.

113
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,129
What do you mean?

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,716
Because you'll realize I made up
the lines that I read to you.

115
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,635
What did you say?

116
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,178
Nothing.

117
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,222
What?

118
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,765
What did you say?

119
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,772
Forty-five…

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,817
Forty-six…

121
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,403
Forty-seven…

122
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,658
<i>Including the walk home</i>
<i>I was teased twelve times today.</i>

123
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,909

124
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,370
<i>And twelve times five…</i>

125
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>is sixty.</i>

00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,833

<i>Takagi-san teases me that day.</i>

128
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>Self-punishment</i>
<i>for always falling for her tricks.</i>

129
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,093
Fifty-six…

130
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>To avoid going through this again,</i>

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
<i>I've got to keep my guard up,</i>
<i>starting tomorrow.</i>

132

Fifty-nine…

133
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,729
Sixty!

134
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,360
Brace yourself, Takagi-san!

00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,912
Takagi-san? What are you doing here?

170
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,749
You bought it, didn't you? The new volume.

171
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,666
What?

172
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,710
It came out today, right?

173
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,922
And this one comes
with a special postcard.

174
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,049
Show me.

175
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,595
Oh, yeah, it did come with a card.

176
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,055
Is this it?

177
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,432
Lucky you!

178
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,435
Isn't she so cute?

179
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,604
Well…

180
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,232
I guess it's cute,
but I read it because it's funny.

181
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,820
Then can I have it?

182
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,738
No way.

183
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,746
The intro of the anime changed too.

184
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,499
You were singing it, right?

185
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,959
But in the chorus…

186
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,921
<i>Unrequited love, mutual love</i>

187
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>Love's getting closer</i>

188
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,548
It's actually…

189
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,093
<i>Unrequited love, mutual love</i>

190
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,427
<i>Love's getting closer</i>

191
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,387
Right?

192
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,596
No, I was right.

193
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,265
<i>Unrequited love, mutual love</i>

194
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,975
<i>Love's getting closer</i>

195
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,935
That's not it.

196
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,852
I think it's…

197
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,313
<i>Unrequited love, mutual love</i>

198
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,272
That's it.

199
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,151
"<i>Unrequited love, mutual love</i>"
That's how it goes.

200
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,655
Why don't we listen
and get to the bottom of it?

201
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,031
What?

202
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,724
It's so pretty.

203
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,184
Yeah.

204
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,940
Let's sit there.

205
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,899
Okay.

206
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,220
Okay.

207
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,146
I bought the song yesterday.

208
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,314
Really?

209
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,483
<i>I'll buy it later.</i>

210
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,864
Here, use this.

211
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,324
What?

212
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,202
Why don't you just play it?

213
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,830
We can hear better this way.

214
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,500
The waves are loud too.

215
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,044
We should have just gone somewhere else.

216
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,672
Are you getting embarrassed?

217
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,841
Not really.

218
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,968
Then, here.

219
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,284
I'll play the song now.

220
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,997
LOVE'S GETTING CLOSER!!

221
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,168
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i>

222
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>Our eyes meet after school</i>
<i>And the usual…</i>

223
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,883
The beginning is so great.

224
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,635
Don't you think so?

225
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,264
Yeah, it sure is.

226
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,850
<i>Takagi-san is sitting so close.</i>

227
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,936
<i>I can't pay attention to the song.</i>

228
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,358
If it's "<i>Unrequited love, mutual love,"</i>
then you're right.

229
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,071
and if it's <i>"Unrequited love, mutual love"</i>
then I'm right.

230
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,156
Okay.

231
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,450
…<i>I like you, I love you</i>…

232
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,952
<i>I've got to concentrate!</i>

<i>Where is it now? Love's</i>…

236
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,502
Nishikata.

237
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,545
What?!

238
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,798
Nishikata, you're too concentrated!

239
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,050
Who cares if I'm concentrating?

240
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,678
Are you done? The chorus is next.

241
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,596
What?

242
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:50,973
Um…

243
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,271
I knew it!

244
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,357
It was <i>"Unrequited love, mutual love."</i>

245
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,609
Really?

246
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,112
I missed it. Play the chorus again.

247
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,780
What?

248
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,075
I'd rather listen again
from the beginning.

249
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>Huh!</i>

250
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,996
<i>All right, Takagi-san.</i>

251
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,499
<i>I bet you know I'm right</i>
<i>and you're going to tease me</i>

252
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,835
<i>so I can't hear the chorus.</i>

253
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,213
Do you want to listen?

254
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay, from the beginning.

255
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,889
<i>I got you now, Takagi-san!</i>

<i>Oh, no! A surprise</i>…

264
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,628
Here comes the chorus.

265
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,754
You're right.

266
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,839
<i>Boom boom goes my beating heart</i>

267
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,550
<i>The love meter is about to blow</i>

268
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,222
<i>Just try and tease me.</i>
<i>You won't get me this time.</i>

00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,996
I knew it.

277
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,999
It's<i> "Unrequited love, mutual love,"</i>
right?

278
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,751
You're right.

279
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,254
Looks like I was right.

280
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,716
<i>I was mistaken this whole time.</i>

281

00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,179
Okay.

283
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,307
What?

284
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,435
Is something wrong?

285
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,480
I was worried you'd try to tease me again.

286
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,983
How mean.

287
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,778
Have I teased you today?

288
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,655
What?

289
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,787
I just wanted to listen
to the song with you.

290
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,999
Really? If that's the case…

291
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,795
<i>Come to think of it, she didn't</i>
<i>even mention a competition.</i>

292
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,176
<i>Maybe she didn't plan</i>
<i>on teasing me after all.</i>

293
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,722
<i>And when her face was close,</i>
<i>I was just embarrassed.</i>

294
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,310
<i>So, she really does</i>
<i>just want to listen with me again?</i>

295
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,896
I'll play it now.

296
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,606
Wait.

297
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,068

What?

304
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,046
Huh? Did you want to
share headphones again?

305
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,172
Not really.

306
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,051
Why didn't you just say so?

307
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,719
I see.

308
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,475
You wanted to listen while sharing
a set of headphones with me.

309
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,185
No, not that.

310
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,272
It's just… You said it was
hard to hear with the waves.

311
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,609
That was so we could
figure out the rhythm.

312
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,445
Yeah, but something's not right.

313
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,033
Nishikata, put the earphone in.

314
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,910
It's fine.

315
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,286
Just play the song.

316
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,873
What? You want me
to put it on you that badly?

317
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
I didn't say that.
