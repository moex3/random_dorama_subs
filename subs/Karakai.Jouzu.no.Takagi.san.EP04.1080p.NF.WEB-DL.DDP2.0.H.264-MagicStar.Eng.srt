1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,840
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,639
Did you think I was sleeping, Takagi-san?

3
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,225
Oh!

4
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,102
You're up late.

5
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,356
I knew you were going to trick me

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,485
by sneakily putting a present
beside my pillow.

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,447
Too bad, you're busted.

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,079
Well, here.

9
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,663
It's for you.

10
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,540
Merry Christmas.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,667
Do you admit defeat?

12
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,505
Yes. You can be the winner this time.

13
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,592
Yes!

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,219
I finally beat Takagi-san!

15
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,013
How does it feel?

16
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
To finally lose to me?

17
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,066
Is it so bad you can't even talk?

18
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,068
No.

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,487
This is only a dream anyway.

20
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,030
What?

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,699
Merry Christmas!

22
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,425
Damn it. She even got me in my dreams.

23
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,143
I'll return these.

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,102
Okay.

25
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,312
Third year class one. Number 24.

26
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,568
One, two.

27
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,819
Thank you.

28
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,862
Thank you.

29
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,904
LAST DAY TO BORROW BOOKS

30
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,239
Hey!

31
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,158
-Hey!
-Number 21, please.

32
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,576
-Number 21.
-Okay.

33
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>Today is the last day of second semester.</i>

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,501
<i>I've got to finish this year</i>…

35
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>with a win.</i>

36
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,091
You can crochet?

37
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,636
I just started recently.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,931
Do you want to try?

39
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,516
Huh?

40
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,311
I have an extra needle.

41
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,148
No, that's okay. It looks difficult.

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,733
I'll pass.

43
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,780
First, you do this.

44
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,283
Wrap it around here.

45
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,993
Do this, and this.

46
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,120
I see.

47
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,166
Like this…

48
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,418
This…

49
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,631
Put it in through the bottom like this.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,051
Like this?

51
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,096
It's tough to explain.

52
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,682
Right here.

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,393
Then you go like this…

54
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,687
and this.

55
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,023
One more time.

56
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,776
Wrap it around here…

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,277
I'm done. It's too hard.

58
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,571
Really?

59
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,545
Is that a scarf?

60
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
It's to keep out the cold.

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,677
I see.

62
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,390
Shall I make one for you too?

63
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,433
What? No that's okay.

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,604
This is actually a present.

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,898
A present?

66
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,150
Yes.

67
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,529
For a 15-year-old boy.

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,491
Really?

69
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,869
I hope he likes it.

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,999
<i>15-year-old?</i>

71
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,001
<i>A boy?</i>

72
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,640
-Hey, Nishikata.
-What?

73
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,730
That's Taro from the candy shop right?

74
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,732
Did something happen to him?

75
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,733
This is him.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,318
Huh?

77
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,653
The 15-year-old boy.

78
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,616
His owner said she
wants to dress him up to keep warm

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,244
because he's very old for a dog.

80
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,664
So, I said I would make something for him.

81
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,126
I see.

82
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,671
What? What's the matter?

83
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,672
Nothing.

84
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,591
Dogs sure are cute.

85
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,052
So cute.

86
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,887
You're funny.

87
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,188
Who did you think it was?

88
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,107
Taro.

89
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,193
Really?

90
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,820
100 percent sure.

91
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,625
<i>My last chance this year</i>
<i>to beat Takagi-san.</i>

92
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,128
<i>I've got to think of something.</i>

93
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,553
I'll be going this way.

94
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,182
-Okay. See you.
-Yeah.

95
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,269
Takagi-san.

96
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,480
Yeah?

97
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,399
Shall we have a year-end competition?

98
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,111
Sure.

99
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,821
What kind?

100
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,657
Um…

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,370
In that case can I choose?

102
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,455
-What?
-No?

103
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,958
I guess that's fine.

104
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,545
What should it be?

105
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,966
<i>I couldn't think of anything myself,</i>
<i>so I guess it's fine.</i>

106
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>It feels like a disadvantage though.</i>

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,554
<i>Too late now.</i>

108
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,015
I've got it!

109
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,227
How about whoever makes
the other happiest, wins?

110
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,145
What?

111
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,316
Starting from now, we'll think
of how to make each other happy

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,235
and in 30 minutes we compete.

113
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,030
How do we decide who wins or loses?

114
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,410
How about a point system?

115
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,828
That's so random.

116
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,538
What do you think?

117
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I think I have a chance at this one.</i>

118
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
Okay.

119
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
Great. It's decided.

120
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:49,177
<i>All I have to do is pretend</i>
<i>not to be happy and I'll win.</i>

121
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,431
<i>You're ending the year with a big mistake</i>…

122
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,099
<i>Takagi-san!</i>

123
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,061
Let's meet at Osaki Shrine in 30 minutes.

124
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,522
Okay. See you there.

125
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,818
<i>Maybe I'll just grab a pinecone</i>
<i>and wait at the shrine.</i>

126
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,571
I'm looking forward to it.

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,264
<i>Maybe I should take this</i>
<i>a bit more seriously.</i>

128
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,811
<i>What would make Takagi-san happy?</i>

129
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,317
When does she usually look happy?

130
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,295
TEASING TICKET
GOOD FOR ONE DAY OF TEASING

131
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,549
This is all wrong.

132
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,260
She'll tease me without this anyway.

133
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,732
Something that will make Nishikata happy…

134
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,735
This is harder than I thought.

135
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:51,924
CANDY SHOP

136
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,098
Hello.

137
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,850
Oh, Nishikata.

138
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,767
What?

139
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,768
Takagi-san?

140
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,563
What a coincidence.

141
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,445
You thought a present would make me happy
but you don't have much money.

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,491
So, you thought you could get me
juice or some candy here, right?

143
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,704
Bingo.

144
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,583
Me too.

145
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,286
-Wow.
-No peeking.

146
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,317
Did we have to come all the way here?

147
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,612
Those were the rules.

148
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,329
I'll go first.

149
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,044
-Merry Christmas!
-Huh?

150
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,338
That's what this is?

151
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,341
It's almost Christmas, right?

152
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,301
I guess.

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,804
Here.

154
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,848
Thanks.

155
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,357
<i>I wasn't this embarrassed in my dream.</i>

156
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,362
Okay, here's mine.

157
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,741
Merry Christmas.

158
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,160
Thank you.

159
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,790
Wow!

160
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,043
You remembered my favorite juice.

161
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,671
You're always drinking it.

162
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,596
The vegetable Hanako snacks too!

163
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,182
I saw you eating that once.

164
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,226
Thanks.

165
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,230
Hey.

166
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,274
So, who's the winner?

167
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,486
Whoever makes the other happiest, wins?

168
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,946
In that case…

169
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,032
-Maybe I was…
-Takagi-san.

170
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,575
What?

171
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,994
How about we make it a tie?

172
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,954
Are you sure?

173
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,414
Yeah.

174
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,708
I was happy too.

175
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,836
Getting a Christmas present from you.

176
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,340
Thank you.

177
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
Hmm?

178
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,601
It's nothing.

179
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,857
How do I open this thing?

180
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,694
Will it open?

181
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:42,947
Yeah.

182
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,742
-Wow.
-It looks so yummy.

183
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
You gave me so much.

184
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,087
<i>I hope that Takagi-san</i>
<i>won't tease me this year.</i>

185
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,011
-Nishikata.
-Woah!

186
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,146
Happy New Year.

187
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,772
Happy New Year.

188
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,901
-Did you come here alone?
-No. With my family.

189
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,944
They ran into someone they know.

190
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,821
Same here.

191
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,574
Let's walk around together.

192
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,826
-I guess.
-Hooray!

193
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,621
Let's get our fortunes.

194
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,755
What did you wish for Nishikata?

195
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,548
It's a secret.

196
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
How about whoever guesses is the winner?

197
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,678
The first competition of the year?

198
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,846
Yeah.

199
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,181
Let's see.

200
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,268
Maybe, "I hope
I don't get teased by Takagi-san"?

201
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,186
What?

202
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,938
I knew it.

203
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,858
Damn it. She got me already.

204
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,820
Now it's your turn. What's your guess?

205
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,199
I bet you hoped to tease me, right?

206
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,116
No way.

207
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,453
That will come true without wishing.

208
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,871
You're right.

209
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,165
"I'm right"?

210
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,504
Thank you.

211
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,799
Want to have a fortune competition?

212
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,968
The second competition of the year.

213
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,886
One, please.

214
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,599
<i>This one is all luck.</i>

215
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,559
<i>A 50-50 chance of winning.</i>

216
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,812
-One, please.
-Okay.

217
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,231
I'll get a good one and win!

218
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
Number four.

219
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,904
-Number 27.
-Okay.

220
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,701
Here you are.

221
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,994
Thank you.

222
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,579
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

223
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,500
-One, please.
-Yes.

224
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,669
Ready, go!

225
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,004
GOOD LUCK / EXCELLENT LUCK

226
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
-"Excellent luck"?
-Hooray!

227
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm the winner.

228
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,885
Come on, even her luck beats mine?

229
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,268
Be careful, it's hot.

230
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,728
-Thank you.
-Here.

231
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,980
-One more for you.
-Thank you.

232
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,068
AMAZAKE

233
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,613
-It's delicious.
-It is.

234
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,001
It's so yummy.

235
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,171
What's wrong?

236
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,298
Thinking about something?

237
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,843
Was it, "I wish for good health"?

238
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,765
Oh, my wish.

239
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,267
You're still thinking about it?

240
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah. If I get it right it's a tie, right?

241
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,023
You didn't say how many guesses we get.

242
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,484
Wrong.

243
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,612
I don't think you'll get it.

244
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,364
<i>Damn it.</i>

245
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,201
<i>I can't start the year on a losing streak.</i>

246
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,620
<i>I want to get this one right.</i>

247
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,625
It seems like…

248
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,836
it's all families and couples here.

249
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,096
You're right.

250
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,225
I wonder if other people…

251
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,560
think we're a couple too?

252
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,448
It's my mom.

253
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,243
Hello?

254
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,704
I'm drinking <i>amazake</i> now.

255
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,209
Okay.

256
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,256
Sorry, I got to go.

257
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,466
Okay.

258
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,051
Well…

259
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,303
What?

260
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,763
Don't you want me to go?

261
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,391
No! I just wanted
to have guessed your wish.

262
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,393
I'm only joking.

263
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,521
I even won the fortune competition.

264
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,356
I'm glad I saw you, Nishikata.

265
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,483
See you later.

266
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,865
Takagi-san.

267
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,160
My fortune will win next year.

268
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,289
Are you inviting me
to join you again next year?

269
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,126
No, only if we meet by chance.

270
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,839
I hope we can go together next year.

271
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,049
Okay. Next year.

272
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,052
I'm sure my parents will be busy chatting.

273
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,141
What?

274
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,187
It's nothing. I was just thinking
how it already came true.

275
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,730
My wish.

276
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,482
-Your wish?
-Yes.

277
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,735
The truth is…

278
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,989
I wished to be asked on a date by you.

279
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,033
That's not what it was!

280
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,119
You're lying!
You're just teasing me again.

281
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,461
A whole year from now…

282
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,050
I hope we can go together.

283
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,637
Yeah.

284
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,682
Okay.

285
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,434
Let's make it a great year.

286
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,673
