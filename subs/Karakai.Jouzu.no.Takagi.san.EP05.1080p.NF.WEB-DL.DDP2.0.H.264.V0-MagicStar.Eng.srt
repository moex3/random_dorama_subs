1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,883
<i>Today is February 14th.</i>

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>Valentine's Day!</i>

3
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>I'm strangely excited about it.</i>

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>But if I let my guard down,</i>
<i>I'll be teased by Takagi-san.</i>

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>I've got to stay calm.</i>

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>I've got to stay calm!</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,737
-Hey, Nishikata.
-What?

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,322
It sure is cold today.

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,700
Sure is.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,084
Everyone!

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,880
I made a ton of chocolate
for Valentine's day.

12
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,798
Help yourself if you'd like.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,259
-First come, first serve.
-I'll take one.

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,552
Me too.

15
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,636
-Thanks.
-Here.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,637
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,514
-Here.
-Thank you.

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,974
Here.

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,102
-Here.
-Thank you.

20
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,901
Aren't you going to get some?

21
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,653
No way I can go up there alone!

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,489
Totally.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,533
But if this continues…

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,453
It'll be zero chocolate for us again!

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,704
You're right.

26
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,668
Hibino. Give me some too.

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,338
-You traitor! Wait up!
-Thank you. Ouch!

28
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,339
Hibino.

29
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,090
-Still some for me?
-Of course.

30
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,717
-Here you are.
-Come on.

31
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,891
Any chocolate will be confiscated.

32
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,560
Didn't I tell you that, Hibino?

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,272
Confiscated.

34
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,192
Forgive me!

35
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,110
Give it here.

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,695
-Okay.
-Confiscated.

37
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,323
Sorry.

38
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,533
Confiscated!

39
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,701
Teacher!

40
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,789
Please forgive us!

41
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:09,879
NISHIKATA

42
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,096
What's wrong?

43
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,556
Oh, nothing.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,150
Down to Yangzhou
in the flowery mist of March…

45
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>Stay calm.</i>

46
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>Just stay calm.</i>

47
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,575
…only to see it flowing
into the horizon of the Yangtze River.

48
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,784
Hey, Nishikata.

49
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,744
Yeah?

50
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,455
Can I borrow your eraser?

51
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,668
Okay.

52
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,050
Thanks.

53
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,052
Sure.

54
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,390
<i>Damn it.</i>

55
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:07,020
<i>For a second I thought she might</i>
<i>just casually give me chocolates.</i>

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,773
<i>But during class? Not a chance.</i>

57
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,864
Hey, Nishikata.

58
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,532
What?

59
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,204
<i>Yikes. That was close.</i>

60
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>I would have been told off again.</i>

61
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,838
<i>Damn it.</i>

62
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,758
<i>Can't get my hopes up.</i>
<i>Don't expect anything.</i>

63
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,682
Mano, did you make that?

64
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,395
Yeah. But I can't find
the timing to give it to him.

65
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,147
I see.

66
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,193
But I'm sure Nakai is waiting for you.

67
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,655
Looking for a chance to be alone with you.

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,116
Yeah. I hope so.

69
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,247
-Did you get any chocolate?
-I did!

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,292
I got some from Hibino.
We almost got busted though.

71
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,545
It almost got taken away by Mr. Tanabe.

72
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,381
He's terrifying when he's angry.

73
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,845
You're so lucky, Nakai.
She's here to give you chocolate.

74
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,765
I'm so jealous of you and Mano.

75
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,100
You are?

76
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,479
Hey.

77
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,189
Nakai.

78
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,025
What's up?

79
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,488
Nothing.

80
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,457
Right when I finally get the courage
to ask Hibino for chocolate…

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,418
…it gets confiscated.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,963
How about you?

83
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,798
Did you get any?

84
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,342
No, I only want it from one person anyway.

85
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,762
-Hojo?
-Well, yeah.

86
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,722
What?!

87
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,641
You? From Hojo?

88
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,769
There's no way.

89
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,479
Hamaguchi.

90
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,025
Be a man and face the facts.

91
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,984
Never.

92
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,278
I know she'll come through.

93
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,909
And you? I'm sure you got some
from Takagi-san, right?

94
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,161
Well, I, um…

95
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,580
I don't want to hear it!

96
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,081
Don't do this to us!

97
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,799
Come on.

98
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,260
Go!

99
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,437
-Hamaguchi.
-Oh, Hojo. What is it?

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,064
Do you want some chocolate?

101
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,107
Chocolate?

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,818
Oh, that's right. It's Valentine's Day.

103
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,361
I guess if you have some…

104
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,530
I see.

105
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,574
Here.

106
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,122
Hurry up and take it.

107
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,208
The teacher will see us.

108
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,628
Thanks.

109
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,506
You're welcome.

110
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,092
See you.

111
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,351
Lucky you, Hamaguchi.

112
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,019
Yeah.

113
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,897
Huh? What's wrong?

114
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,232
It's just…

115
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,984
This isn't handmade.

116
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,320
What? Are you trying to start a fight?

117
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,323
You're lucky to have gotten anything.

118
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,492
-It's Hojo!
-That's not it.

119
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,120
I saw her at the supermarket yesterday.

120
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,037
What?

121
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,624
I saw her buying ingredients
to make homemade chocolate.

122
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,668
What?

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,838
That means I'm not her crush.

124
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,881
Hamaguchi.

125
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,469
Hate to see it, Hamaguchi.

126
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,597
Maybe she likes one of us instead.

127
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,391
No way. I'm 100 percent sure.

128
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,602
100 is too much. More like 90 percent?

129
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,354
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
If I didn't get them,
there's no way you will.

131
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,024
What now?

132
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,746
Hey.

133
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,498
What's wrong?

134
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,295
I promised Kimura and the guys
I'd play soccer during the break.

135
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,006
You did?

136
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,259
That's fine. Go ahead.

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,470
Okay then.

138
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,396
It's impossible.

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,025
What's with you?
You know I'm going to give you chocolate.

140
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,818
You big dummy!

141
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,992
Maybe he doesn't want my chocolate.

142
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,874
Mano.

143
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,168
What do you want?

144
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,131
Mano, are you angry or something?

145
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,634
You blockhead.

146
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,511
"Blockhead"?

147
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,515
Oh! Is this about Valentine's Day?

148
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,728
Would you like the chocolate I made?

149
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,105
Do you want it?

150
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,234
Of course I do.

151
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,278
Okay then.

152
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,032
Here.

153
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,200
Thank you.

154
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,202
Sure.

155
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,882
You're going to eat it here?

156
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,592
Is that bad?

157
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,723
This is great. What's in it?

158
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,560
You dummy.

159
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,812
I'm off to play soccer now.

160
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,440
Dummy!

161
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,153
-Nakai.
-Yes?

162
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,199
Nakai.

163
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
Are you hiding something?

164
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
Pardon?

165
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,461
Oh, you mean this?

166
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,172
It's the book I lent to Mano.

167
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,882
She just gave it back to me.

168
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,264
A book, huh?

169
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,351
Small paperback perhaps?

170
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,980
Very well.

171
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,904
Good thing I ate it
before it got confiscated.

172
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,905
Dummy.

173
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,331
Forget soccer.

174
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,832
Don't go.

175
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,668
-I'm going.
-Why?

176
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>You are here</i>

177
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>I am here</i>

178
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>And when I turn around</i>

179
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,977
<i>I see you smiling</i>

180
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,647
<i>The cherry blossoms bloom</i>

181
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,025
<i>The seasons changed…</i>

182
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,694
Eyes on the mirror everyone. Open wide.

183
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,489
<i>…But you remained</i>

184
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:01,535
<i>Far, far in the distance</i>

185
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>On the slope shimmering with heat</i>

186
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,797
<i>Even if the scenery were to change</i>

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,301
<i>There are things that remain unchanged</i>

188
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,930
<i>Inside our hearts</i>

189
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>The happiness I receive</i>

190
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,561
<i>From meeting you</i>

191
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,980
<i>Let's walk together</i>

192
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,983
<i>And reflect upon it</i>

193
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,736
<i>In a year from now</i>

194
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,155
<i>In 10 years from now</i>

195
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:43,327
<i>Our memories remain the same</i>

196
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:50,960
<i>From now until forever</i>

197
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,212
The sky sure is pretty.

198
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,552
-Hey, Hamaguchi.
-Woah.

199
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,846
Oh, Hojo.

200
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,392
You shouldn't walk with your head back
and sigh with you're mouth open.

201
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,020
It's scary, you look like a zombie.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,397
Okay.

203
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,234
So, why were you so down in the dumps?

204
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,944
I'm not.

205
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm fine.

206
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,072
Liar.

207
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,035
I heard you let out a big deep sigh.

208
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,040
I know.

209
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,627
You didn't receive enough chocolates.

210
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,505
You're upset about the amount.

211
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
Boys are so childish.

212
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,720
So?

213
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,138
How many did you get?

214
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,098
One.

215
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,099
I guess.

216
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,227
What?

217
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,188
Only from me?

218
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,941
Yeah.

219
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,283
Well, you should be happy
to get one from me.

220
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,786
That's better than getting a bunch, right?

221
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,955
Yeah, it is.

222
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,959
-How about you?
-Me?

223
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,627
How'd it go?

224
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,420
How'd what go?

225
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,966
Did you give the chocolates to your crush?

226
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,095
My crush?

227
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,972
You don't have to hide it.

228
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,307
You made chocolates yesterday, right?

229
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,562
H-How do you know that?

230
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,316
I happened to see you
buying ingredients at the store.

231
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,240
Those were…

232
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,368
I burnt them all.

233
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,289
I took my eyes off them for one second.

234
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,333
Huh? Really?

235
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,340
Besides, what do you mean by "crush"?

236
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,928
Chocolate is chocolate.
It's just a gift. Nothing special.

237
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,722
Nothing to do with a "crush."

238
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,848
And also…

239
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,185
I only give them to those I want to.

240
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,146
What?

241
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,357
Does that mean…?

242
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,693
Only I got one?

243
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,197
Yeah, so what?

244
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,451
It's just…

245
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,244
It's nothing.

246
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,580
Thank you.

247
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,250
For the chocolate.

248
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:30,304
You have to pay me back
with something fancy on White Day.

249
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,817
Sorry to keep you waiting!

250
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
No way!

251
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>Nothing ended up happening.</i>

252
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:54,745
<i>But I didn't get teased on</i>
<i>Valentine's Day so today's a big win.</i>

253
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,037
This has got to be chocolate--

254
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,288
-Nishikata!
-Woah!

255
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,084
-What's that?
-What's what?

256
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,337
Oh, this?

257
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,716
It looks like some kind of box.

258
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,676
Oh?

259
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,972
It must be Kimura
playing some kind of trick.

260
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,224
No, it isn't.

261
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,309
How do you know?

262
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,147
Because I know who put it there.

263
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,400
You do?

264
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,359
Yeah.

265
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,986
Who do you think it was?

266
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,699
I think it's someone
who's close to you right now.

267
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,369
<i>It must be Takagi-san.</i>

268
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>But how embarrassing if I'm wrong.</i>

269
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,625
<i>But</i>…

270
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,420
<i>There's no one else it could be.</i>

271
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,132
Do you have an idea, Nishikata?

272
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,052
Any idea who it could be?

273
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
I have no idea.

274
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,682
And I don't want to know.

275
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,434
Oh?

276
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,188
You know what day it is, don't you?

277
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,316
Valentine's Day.

278
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,318
What's that?

279
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,778
Valentine's Day.

280
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,404
Bingo!

281
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,073
Here's some chocolate.

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,574
Huh?

283
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,117
Here.

284
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,621
What's wrong?

285
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,538
Don't want it?

286
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,875
It's not that.

287
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,002
Here.

288
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,005
Thanks.

289
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,092
As a friend.

290
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,843
I know that.

291
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,931
The big box looks like
it's for someone's crush.

292
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,516
What?

293
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,351
Well…

294
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,062
Who could it be from?

295
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,980
I don't know.

296
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,736
Nishikata.

297
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,822
This one is just as friends.

298
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,991
Just that one…

299
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,786
"Just that one"?

300
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,127
Huh?

301
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,337
What?

302
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,549
Come on, Nishikata. Let's go home.

303
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,300
Okay.

304
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,992
Yes?

305
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,457
When you finish your homework,
come downstairs, please.

306
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,003
Okay. Will do.

307
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,727
So…

308
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,730
We talked about this on New Year's Eve

309
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,983
about how we might have to move
for your father's work.

310
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,445
Well it's been officially decided.

311
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,198
At the end of March.

312
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,743
I see.

313
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,996
I understand.

314
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,666
Where will we move?

315
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,587
Paris.

316
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,005
In France.

317
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,968
Paris?

318
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,222
Pretty far.

319
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,268
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,020
It's selfish of me.

321
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,022
No.

322
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,273
It's not your fault.

323
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,108
It's your job.

324
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,718
