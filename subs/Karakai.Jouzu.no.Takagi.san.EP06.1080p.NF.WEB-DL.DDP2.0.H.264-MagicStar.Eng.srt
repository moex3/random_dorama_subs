1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,717
Okay. Let's do it.

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,428
You're gonna regret this.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,806
All good? Here we go!

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,266
Ready! Go!

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,686
Whoa! That was fast.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,271
-Every time!
-Next!

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,482
That was faster than yesterday. Brutal.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,359
I'm up.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,445
You got to win this time.

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,530
-You got this, Takao.
-Okay?

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,115
Ready! Go!

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,325
-All right!
-Wow!

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
You can take Nakai.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,123
-Yeah but Nakai is super strong.
-Takao!

15
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,042
Still too much for Nishikata.
He's almost there.

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,335
You got this, Nakai.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,087
Still too much for you.

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,922
Okay?

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,925
Let's do it. Ready! Go!

20
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,885
Nakai.

21
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,013
Oh? Could it be?

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,560
All right!

23
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,353
Wow.

24
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,606
Seriously? That was incredible.

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,987
You're arm wrestling was impressive.
You've gotten stronger.

26
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,782
I've been training everyday.

27
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,287
It must be from all those push-ups
you do after being teased by me.

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,623
What? How do you know about that?

29
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,710
I know everything about you, Nishikata.

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,426
Are you okay? Did you catch a cold?

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,471
I'm fine.
Someone must be talking about me.

32
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:44,270
The girls in our class have been gossiping
about if you and I are dating.

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,730
Dating?

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,732
You and me?

35
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,275
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,902
Is that bad?

37
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,656
No, it's just…

38
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,285
So, you don't like
people saying we're dating.

39
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,413
No, it's not that.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,375
It's just that we aren't dating.

41
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,628
So, you wouldn't mind it if it were true.

42
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,755
Then…

43
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,049
Do you wanna date?

44
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,136
Wait a second.

45
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,847
Why are you saying that? Cut it out.

46
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,475
Looks like more push-ups for you.

47
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,156
Nishikata, you're burning up.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,826
And you're a little red.

49
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,871
Might be a cold.

50
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,754
Are you okay?

51
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,804
How about me?

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,558
You're a little hot too.

53
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,686
Maybe I got a cold too.

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,897
Let's be careful.

55
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,149
Yeah. Both of us.

56
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
GRADUATION CEREMONY

57
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,056
I was shocked to hear about Takagi-san.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,809
Takagi-san? Did something happen?

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,437
You didn't hear she's moving?

60
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,147
What?

61
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,651
She's moving at the end of March.

62
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,529
I thought you would have heard
considering how close you guys are.

63
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,573
Sorry to be the one to tell you.

64
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,491
Just forget it.

65
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,286
Forget it?

66
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,498
Are you being serious?

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,416
Yeah.

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,837
I heard from Mano.
But a lot of our classmates already know.

69
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,964
The guys too.

70
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,445
<i>You are here</i>

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,156
<i>I am here</i>

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,325
<i>And when I turn around</i>

73
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,704
<i>I see you smiling</i>

74
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>The cherry blossoms bloom</i>

75
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>The seasons changed</i>

76
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>But you remained</i>

77
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:04,554
<i>Far, far in the distance</i>

78
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,809
<i>On the slope shimmering with heat</i>

79
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>Even if the scenery were to change</i>

80
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:20,028
<i>There are things that remain unchanged</i>

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,573
<i>Inside our hearts</i>

82
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,243
<i>The happiness I receive</i>

83
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,204
<i>From meeting you</i>

84
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,623
<i>Let's walk together</i>

85
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,752
<i>And reflect upon it</i>

86
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>In a year from now</i>

87
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>In 10 years from now</i>

88
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,845
<i>From now until forever</i>

89
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,432
<i>The happiness I receive</i>

90
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>From meeting you</i>

91
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,645
<i>Let's walk together</i>

92
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,523
<i>And reflect upon it</i>

93
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>In a year from now</i>

94
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
<i>In 10 years from now</i>

95
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,700
<i>Our memories remain the same</i>

96
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:15,625
<i>From now until forever</i>

97
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,650
I'm beat.

98
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,236
What a moving performance.

99
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,657
But, man, the principal talked forever.

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,200
-Tell me about it.
-Right?

101
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,535
Was that necessary?

102
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,122
-No way.
-My back hurts.

103
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,331
Thanks.

104
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,127
Hey.

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,629
Someone carry these to the classroom.

106
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,341
Nishikata, you got a spare hand?

107
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,843
Carry these for me.

108
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,636
What?

109
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,263
Don't "what" me.

110
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,056
Yes!

111
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,062
Sorry.

112
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,565
-I'll help too.
-Off you go.

113
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,237
Let's go.

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,159
GRADUATION CEREMONY HALL

115
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,286
What did you think of the ceremony?

116
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,456
I don't know.

117
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,251
That will be us next year.

118
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,005
It will go by in a flash I'm sure.

119
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,800
Will you be sad to graduate?

120
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:49,927
I wonder.

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,180
How about you?

122
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:53,890
What?

123
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,851
Will you be sad?

124
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,603
To graduate.

125
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,230
Me?

126
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,194
Yeah. I wonder.

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,785
What?

128
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,381
Thank you.

129
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,716
I'm so happy.

130
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,385
She got his second button.

131
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,764
His second button?

132
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
I'm beat.

133
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,785
Overreacting as usual, Nishikata.

134
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,927
Nishikata, if someone
asked for your second button…

135
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,763
Would you give it to them?

136
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,559
Who knows?
I don't think I'd be asked anyway.

137
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,228
I see.

138
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,108
What?

139
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,823
What?

140
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,409
Can I have it?

141
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,830
Fine.

142
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,331
You can have it.

143
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,208
I can?

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,627
Thanks. I'll take it.

145
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,965
Oh. The chair.

146
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,342
Of course. What did you think?

147
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,177
Nothing.

148
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,016
Did you think I meant your second button?

149
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
Of course not.

150
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,730
But I mean it.

151
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,692
I wanted to receive your second button.

152
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,819
What?

153
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,492
I wish I could graduate with you.

154
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,829
What? Can't you?

155
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,831
Yeah.

156
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,834
It's my father's job.

157
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,088
After the closing ceremony, we're moving.

158
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,385
So, it was true.

159
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,263
Did someone else already tell you?

160
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,599
Not everything.

161
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,060
So that's why.

162
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,770
I see.

163
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,606
TUESDAY MARCH 18TH

164
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,025
But the closing ceremony is really soon.

165
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,234
It's all so sudden.

166
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,612
Yeah.

167
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,911
Where are you moving?

168
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:03,996
Hmm?

169
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,083
Where will you go?

170
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,919
Close by? Far away?

171
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,631
Paris.

172
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,717
Paris? France?

173
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,095
You're kidding right?

174
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,681
You're just teasing me again.

175
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,436
I wish that were the case.

176
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:40,449
As some of you may have heard,
because of her father's job,

177
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,537
Takagi-san will be moving
at the end of the third semester.

178
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,006
It will be the closing ceremony soon,
so let's send her off cheerfully.

179
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,883
Okay!

180
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:15,276
His middle years, changing from
the destructive lifestyle of his past…

181
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>So, Takagi-san really is leaving</i>
<i>this island soon.</i>

182
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,954
Nishikata, where's your textbook?

183
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,747
Oh, right.

184
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,754
And in the final years of Dazai's life…

185
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
Did you forget it?

186
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,759
Want to put our desks together?

187
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,512
…and unchanging even after the war…

188
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,763
Yeah.

189
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,681
Thanks.

190
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,252
<i>Isn't this hard for her?</i>

191
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,465
<i>She seems to be having more fun than ever.</i>

192
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,692
THIS IS FUN

193
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,110
What?

194
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:58,921
BECAUSE I'M CLOSER TO YOU THAN EVER

195
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,552
<i>Wait, no way.</i>
<i>This is Takagi-san after all.</i>

196
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,887
<i>She's trying to tease me again.</i>

197
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,476
<i>What?</i>

198
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,688
<i>She isn't teasing me?</i>

199
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,940
<i>It's for real?</i>

200
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,248
AND I CAN TEASE YOU MORE THAN EVER

201
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,041
Damn it!

202
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,424
<i>She can "tease me."</i>

203
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:31,347
-LET'S WALK HOME TOGETHER TODAY
-OKAY

204
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,962
Where's your umbrella, Takagi-san?

205
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,005
I forgot it.

206
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,843
You didn't know
it was supposed to rain today?

207
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,261
Yeah.

208
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,388
I didn't know.

209
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,100
So, can I?

210
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
Can you what?

211
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,604
That.

212
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,564
Can I share yours?

213
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,149
What?

214
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,278
I don't mind.

215
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,685
Isn't your shoulder getting wet?
Are you even under the umbrella?

216
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm fine.

217
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,106
You're all wet.

218
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,400
You'll catch a cold.

219
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:31,300
We don't have many more chances
to go home together like this.

220
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,552
I guess so.

221
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,474
The truth is…

222
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,309
I knew it all along.

223
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,352
Knew what?

224
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,773
That it would rain today.

225
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,649
You did?

226
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,402
Then why didn't you bring an umbrella?

227
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,324
Because I knew yours
was big enough for two.

228
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,867
What?

229
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,707
Just like how you pretended
to forget your textbook today.

230
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,376
You knew that?

231
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,798
I was wondering
why you didn't take it out.

232
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,307
By the way, Takagi-san…

233
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,601
Yeah? What is it?

234
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,937
<i>That you're moving…</i>

235
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,606
<i>Why didn't you tell me first?</i>

236
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,691
It's nothing.

237
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>I wanted to hear it from you.</i>

238
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,199
<i>Such an important thing.</i>

239
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,286
I love the rain.

240
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,998
The sound of rain on an umbrella.

241
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,877
All the different sounds mixing together.

242
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,965
The smell of rain.

243
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,596
It's so peaceful.

244
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,443
<i>All right. I've decided.</i>

245
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,197
<i>I promise not to look sad</i>
<i>in front of her until she leaves.</i>

246
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>Just like always.</i>

247
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,661
<i>I'll act the way I always do.</i>

248
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,960
<i>There are things that remain unchanged</i>

249
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,755
<i>Inside our hearts</i>

250
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,342
<i>The happiness I receive</i>

251
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>From meeting you</i>

252
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>Let's walk together</i>

253
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,142
<i>And reflect upon it</i>

254
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,270
<i>In a year from now</i>

255
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,939
<i>In 10 years from now</i>

256
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,694
<i>Our memories remain the same</i>

257
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:03,535
<i>From now until forever</i>

258
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:40,632
