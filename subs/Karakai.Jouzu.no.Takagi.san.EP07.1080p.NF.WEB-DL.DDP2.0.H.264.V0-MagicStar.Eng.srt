1
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,744
So this is my last day with Takagi-san.

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:50,258
MOMOMI JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

3
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>Takagi-san?</i>

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>She's not on duty.</i>
<i>What's she doing here already?</i>

5
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>What?</i>

6
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>This is strange. No one's here.</i>

7
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>No…</i>

8
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,280
<i>She's here.</i>

9
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,243
<i>I can feel it. Takagi-san's presence.</i>

10
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,330
<i>She's gotta be hiding somewhere.</i>

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,056
<i>Nice try, Takagi-san.</i>

12
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,855
Well, guess I'll just go use the toilet.

13
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>I've learned your ways, Takagi-san.</i>

14
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>I know your tricks.</i>

15
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,080
Here!

16
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,918
No way…

17
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:12,817
<i>Hiding under the desk and waiting</i>
<i>to strike while I clean the chalkboard?</i>

18
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>Well, too bad for you, Takagi-san.</i>

19
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>I can see your shoes!</i>

20
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,583
Being on class duty is such a pain.

21
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,836
No one will notice
if I don't clean the chalkboard…

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,463
I guess I'll skip it.

23
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,547
Gotcha!

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,258
What?

25
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,805
What? Where is she?

26
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,184
<i>Where the heck is she?</i>

27
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,441
<i>Did she already move or something?</i>

28
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,506
<i>Is this what it will feel like</i>
<i>once Takagi-san is gone?</i>

29
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,105
Good morning, Nishikata.

30
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,816
Good morning, Takagi-san.

31
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,235
Huh? Where were you?

32
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
So easy to surprise, Nishikata!

33
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,451
Oh. The veranda.

34
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,206
The curtains were wide open.

35
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,083
You should have seen me.

36
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,336
So, you were watching me the whole time?

37
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,799
I knew you were on class duty today.

38
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,093
This was worth waking up early for.

39
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,973
My shoe trap was a great success.

40
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,722
-Hey.
-Hey, Nishikata.

41
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,224
What?

42
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,480
When it's just the two of us
in this empty classroom,

43
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,026
it feels like we're the only
two people on earth, don't you think?

44
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,115
What?

45
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,163
I wish no one else would come.

46
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,459
Honestly.

47
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,365
Takagi-san.

48
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,368
What is it?

49
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,995
Good morning!

50
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,664
Someone's excited this morning.

51
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,750
It's the last day of school
and spring break starts tomorrow.

52
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,002
-Of course I'm excited.
-You're right.

53
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,254
Yeah.

54
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,673
Good morning.

55
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,176
The last day of second year.

56
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,678
Yeah.

57
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,431
And your last day, Takagi-san.

58
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,307
That's right.

59
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,517
How lonely.

60
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,145
Let's enjoy our time together.

61
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,104
Okay.

62
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,565
Here you are, Takagi-san.

63
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,316
Wow.

64
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,901
Did you all make this?

65
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,861
Yeah.

66
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
THANK YOU TAKAGI-SAN

67
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:26,904
Thank you.

68
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,994
Even if you leave this island,
we'll always be friends.

69
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,579
Yeah.

70
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,289
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

71
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,584
Let's meet again when you come back.

72
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,626
Let's!

73
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,672
I've never even been to Tokyo.

74
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,717
It's not a vacation, dummy.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,051
She's moving.

76
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,428
Good morning, Takagi-san.

77
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,304
Good morning.

78
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,015
I know, but Paris?
That sounds too amazing.

79
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,726
You write something too.

80
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,810
Okay.

81
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,687
-Write one for me too.
-Okay.

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
So, you're not coming back to the island?

83
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't know yet.

84
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,494
Will you be in Paris forever?

85
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,123
I don't know that either.

86
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,463
Will you go to high school there?

87
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,799
<i>The only two people</i>…

88
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,886
<i>on earth.</i>

89
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,911
What are you thinking about?

90
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,416
I wanted to be the first to know.

91
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,544
Takagi-san.

92
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,064
Excuse me.

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,487
Okay. This and the documents.

94
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,531
Take these to class.

95
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
Please excuse me.

96
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,120
What's wrong, Nishikata?

97
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
Why the long face?

98
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,001
Is it about Takagi-san?

99
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,712
No, it's nothing.

100
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,757
I heard Nakai told you the news.

101
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,931
You must be thinking,
"Why did he know first?"

102
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,476
"Why did everyone know before me?"

103
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,398
I…

104
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,736
I thought we were close friends…

105
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,955
Nishikata.

106
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,166
Listen.

107
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,544
Have you ever been in love?

108
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,380
-Love?
-Yeah.

109
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,761
I don't really know.

110
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,223
If that's hard for you to tell then…

111
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,267
Wanting to see someone.

112
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,978
Wanting to hear their voice.

113
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,066
Enjoying being around them.

114
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,901
How about that?

115
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,612
You must have felt that.

116
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,949
When you put it like that I guess I have.

117
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,995
Nishikata.

118
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:09,794
It can be difficult to say things to
the people that are most important to us.

119
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,258
Maybe you're just that important to her.

120
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,643
How wonderful to be young and in love.

121
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,604
Take it all in.

122
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,481
All of it.

123
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,326
-Tosaka.
-Yes.

124
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,459
-Nakai.
-Yes.

125
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,799
Big improvement in Math and English.

126
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,843
Thank you.

127
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,179
-Nakamura.
-Yes.

128
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,020
-Keep going in third year.
-I will.

129
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,774
-Nishikata.
-Yes.

130
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,325
Great improvement in PE.

131
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,162
Good luck.

132
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,627
-Nomura.
-Yes.

133
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,884
You worked hard this semester, Nomura.

134
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,598
All right.
You're all third years from April.

135
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:50,311
Today is your last day in this class.
Don't forget anything, okay?

136
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,062
Yes, sir.

137
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,108
Before we go,
let's all take a photo with Takagi-san.

138
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,360
Push the desks back and come forward.

139
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,862
Okay.

140
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,289
Okay. Here we go.

141
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
THANK YOU SECOND YEAR CLASS THREE!

142
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,005
Hey, Nishikata.
You're standing out of the frame.

143
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,306
Not there.

144
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,849
Hey.

145
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,602
Take a seat.

146
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,522
Here.

147
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,610
Perfect.

148
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,654
Here we go.

149
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,656
I'll stand there.

150
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,283
We'll count from ten.

151
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,660
Ready…

152
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,702
Ten…

153
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,912
Nine…

154
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,913
Eight…

155
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,914
Seven…

156
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,998
Six…

157
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,958
Five…

158
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,875
Four…

159
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,043
Three…

160
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,086
Two…

161
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,337
One…

162
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,549
THANK YOU SECOND YEAR CLASS THREE!

163
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,581
Hey.

164
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,042
Let's walk together.

165
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,903
What about your bike, Takagi-san?

166
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,113
Well…

167
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,531
I left it at home today.

168
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,700
I see.

169
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,788
Nishikata.

170
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,916
Wanna make a side trip?

171
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,126
I guess.

172
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,086
Where to?

173
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,012
Here?

174
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,765
Yes. Let's climb to the top.

175
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,771
Is there something up there?

176
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,648
You'll find out.

177
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,025
I'll find out?

178
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,363
Wait up.

179
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,989
Are you okay?

180
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,676
It goes on forever.

181
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,137
How many stairs are there?

182
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,224
Total of 415.

183
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,268
That many?!

184
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,237
Wait for me.

185
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,676
We made it.

186
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,932
You okay? Tired?

187
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,185
Never been better.

188
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,191
Hey. Come here.

189
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,289
I wanted to see this view with you.

190
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,875
It's beautiful.

191
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,254
Hey, did you know?

192
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,718
If you come here with your crush,
they say that you'll end up together.

193
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,637
What?

194
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:23,227
There are "415" steps,
which sounds like "<i>yo-i-koi."</i>

195
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,436
"True love."

196
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,605
"True love."

197
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
I see.

198
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,989
How did you know that?

199
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,783
Hm?

200
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,827
Came here with someone before?

201
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,079
No.

202
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,997
I heard it from Mano.

203
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,960
She said she came here with Nakai.

204
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,170
Really?

205
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,506
<i>Wait. What?</i>

206
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,968
<i>What does she mean?</i>

207
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,723
Were you thinking about me just now?

208
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,559
About you?

209
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
I was not. Why?

210
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,026
You're the only thing I ever think about.

211
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,611
What?

212
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,698
-You're blushing!
-I am not.

213
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,163
You're just thinking
of how you can tease me next.

214
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,458
That's quite the accusation.

215
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,337
Well when you've been teased
as much as I have…

216
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,138
But I mean it.

217
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,057
I wish I could have teased you more.

218
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,029
Hey, Nishikata.

219
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,991
Would you rather
I move and not tease you anymore…

220
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:06,205
or I stay here
and you live a life of teasing?

221
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,041
What kind of choices are those?

222
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,584
Which one would you choose?

223
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,422
Well…

224
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,801
Of course it's the second one.

225
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,970
The second one?

226
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,307
The teasing one.

227
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,852
Is that so?

228
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,356
So, you want me to stay here with you.

229
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,399
It's better than you going away.

230
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,693
I wouldn't be able to get you back.

231
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,490
You want me to stay close to you
so you can get me back.

232
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,493
That's right. One day, I'll get you good.

233
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,371
Get me good?

234
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,249
I would have loved to see that.

235
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,500
Sounds real scary.

236
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,126
You're just making fun of me now.

237
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,379
I'm not.

238
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,465
I'm not.

239
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,905
Here.

240
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,158
What is it?

241
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,537
Here.

242
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,865
What's wrong, Takagi-san?

243
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,827
Are you okay?

244
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,583
That face again!

245
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,836
Don't cry.

246
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
Smile.

247
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,759
I want you to keep smiling.

248
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,678
I want you to be happy.

249
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,103
I can't tease you
if you're not in a good mood.

250
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,105
Always about the teasing.

251
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,701
This is hard.

252
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,286
For me too.

253
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,335
Not being able to tease you anymore.

254
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,253
It stinks.

255
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,217
Takagi-san.

256
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,186
Let's come here again sometime.

257
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,275
Yeah.

258
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,925
