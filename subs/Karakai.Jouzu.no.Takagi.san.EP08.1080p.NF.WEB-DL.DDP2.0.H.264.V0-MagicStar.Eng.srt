1
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,204
Hello?

2
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>Good morning.</i>

3
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,542
Good morning.

4
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
<i>The new school year starts today.</i>

5
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,925
Yeah.

6
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>You're an upperclassman now.</i>
<i>Everyone else is your junior.</i>

7
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,433
<i>Nishikata-senpai!</i>

8
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,311
Don't tease me.

9
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,529
So?

10
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>What?</i>

11
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,910
Why did you call?

12
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,042
<i>I was worried you might be bummed</i>
<i>since I'm not there.</i>

13
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,714
I'm doing just fine.
I even did 100 push-ups this morning.

14
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,176
<i>Even though I haven't teased you?</i>

15
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,179
I guess so.

16
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,182
<i>I see.</i>

17
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,727
<i>So you're totally fine without me.</i>

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,983
Yeah well, that doesn't mean
I'm not lonely.

19
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,527
<i>So, you are lonely.</i>

20
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,447
But I still have my friends.

21
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,368
You must be the one who's lonely.

22
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,375
<i>I am.</i>

23
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,879
What?

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,677
So lonely that
I don't want to go to school today.

25
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,472
What?

26
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,437
Would you come see me if I said that?

27
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,232
Cut it out! I was being serious.

28
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,445
I feel much better after teasing you.

29
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,574
You feel better too, don't you?

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,367
No way.

31
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,619
Why would I?

32
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,339
Are you not going to be late?

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,884
It's fine. I still have time.

34
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,719
You?

35
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:47,560
Paris is seven hours behind,
so it must be around midnight there.

36
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,650
<i>You even looked up the time difference?</i>

37
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,654
No way! It's just…

38
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,699
It was in my homework the other day.

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,868
<i>Is that so?</i>

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,245
<i>Nice timing.</i>

41
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,585
By the way, Nishikata.

42
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,588
<i>What is it?</i>

43
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,550
I have something to tell you.

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,595
Something super embarrassing happened.

45
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,848
<i>Embarrassing?</i>

46
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,850
Yeah.

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,562
Oh! You should try and guess.

48
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:38,152
If you can get it in three tries,
I'll do anything you say.

49
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,113
Anything?

50
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,156
<i>Yes. Anything.</i>

51
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,201
Anything at all?

52
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,955
Yes. Anything at all.

53
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,126
I'll make whatever you want
the most come true.

54
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,463
"What I want the most"?

55
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,511
<i>Oh, but… That might be the answer.</i>

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,431
<i>Oh, well.</i>

57
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>Have a guess.</i>

58
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,187
"Something embarrassing"?

59
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,398
Is that what you said?

60
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,278
Um…

61
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,490
<i>You're not thinking something weird,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,367
No way.

63
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,953
What could it be?

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,248
<i>Hurry up.</i>

65
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,501
Okay…

66
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,922
You were late on your first day of school.

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,760
I wouldn't do that.

68
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,261
I'm not like you.

69
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,638
I'm only late sometimes.

70
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,517
<i>Two more tries.</i>

71
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,644
Um…

72
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,940
Give me a hint.

73
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,654
Is it something
that I would be embarrassed by?

74
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,950
Yeah. Super embarrassed.

75
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,119
<i>Really?</i>

76
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,789
<i>I have no idea.</i>

77
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,918
Let's hear your second guess.

78
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,003
<i>What?</i>

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,422
<i>Something I'd be embarrassed by?</i>

80
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,257
Yes.

81
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,805
<i>Well…</i>

82
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:33,267
<i>You got so nervous at your new school</i>
<i>that you farted in front of everyone?</i>

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,315
I wouldn't do that!

84
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,652
Is that what you did?

85
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,029
No way.

86
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,699
Of course, she wouldn't do that!

87
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,620
I wasted a guess.

88
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,750
<i>Hey, Nishikata.</i>

89
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,752
<i>Are you even trying?</i>

90
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,670
I am.

91
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,173
What is it…

92
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,512
Give me a hint. This is too hard.

93
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,014
A hint?

94
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,852
Okay.

95
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,690
It's embarrassing
but also something happy.

96
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,278
What? Embarrassing but happy?

97
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,364
<i>That's right.</i>

98
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,536
Something happy for you?

99
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,913
Yeah.

100
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,376
But it might make you happy too.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,503
Make me happy?

102
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,756
I have no idea.

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,051
Is there such a thing?

104
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,636
It's usually the opposite.

105
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,765
Embarrassing things are not happy.

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,603
How can I put it?

107
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,439
If you heard the answer,

108
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,817
you'd think it was
a pretty shocking confession.

109
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,154
You wouldn't believe it.

110
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,406
The most unlikely thing.

111
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,161
I think you'd be surprised.

112
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,831
The most unlikely thing?

113
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,585
A "shocking confession"?

114
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,004
Come on.

115
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,340
A shocking…

116
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,424
A confession?

117
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,513
What?

118
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,227
<i>What's wrong Takagi-san?</i>

119
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,025
Did you just say, a confession?

120
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
Yeah, I guess I did.

121
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,366
Wait a minute.

122
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:58,621
Did you think I called to confess
my feelings for you?

123
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,998
What?

124
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,667
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,877
What?

126
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,547
You're confessing your feelings for me?

127
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,091
Well…

128
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,387
Is that your last guess?

129
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,639
Wait a second. Hold up.

130
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,350
What?

131
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,062
She's confessing her feelings for me?

132
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,105
There's no way.

133
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,106
Huh?!

134
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,361
She did say it was something unlikely.

135
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,949
And also…

136
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,036
it was embarrassing but happy.

137
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,208
What?

138
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,003
How do I answer?

139
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,509
<i>Hello?</i>

140
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,391
Hello.

141
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,895
Hey.

142
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,856
Is that your final answer?

143
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,528
That you think I'm confessing
my feelings for you?

144
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,823
Um…

145
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,201
Yes. That's my final answer.

146
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,132
Is that right?
I'll be so embarrassed if I'm wrong.

147
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,595
Wrong.

148
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,098
Not even close. You're hilarious.

149
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,850
-What were you thinking?
-Oh, no.

150
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,645
I don't know. I give up. I have no idea.

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,650
What was it?

152
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,401
What was the answer?

153
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,570
I see.

154
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:59,825
If I were to confess my feelings for you,
you'd be embarrassed…

155
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,244
but also happy.

156
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,332
It's not like that.
You said it was something unlikely.

157
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,253
You mean you'd be happy to go out with me?

158
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:17,385
Or, that if I confessed and you said yes,

159
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,512
I'd be the happy one.

160
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,184
Either way, are you saying you like me?

161
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,478
I didn't say that!

162
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,483
<i>It feels so good teasing you.</i>

163
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,442
<i>Thanks.</i>

164
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,404
"Thanks"? I didn't do anything.

165
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,117
So what was the right answer?

166
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,621
<i>I'll tell you next time.</i>

167
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,791
I have to know. Tell me.

168
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,505
Isn't it almost time to go to school?

169
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,175
You're right.

170
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,510
I got to go.

171
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,096
<i>Okay.</i>

172
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
<i>Bye then. Talk to you soon.</i>

173
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,060
You have to tell me next time.

174
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,895
Okay.

175
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,896
Next time.

176
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,482
Bye.

177
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,778
Bye.

178
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,525
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

179
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,279
Thank goodness I made it on time.

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,909
We're second-year students
and you haven't changed a bit.

181
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,660
That's not true.

182
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,953
I'm a <i>senpai </i>now.

183
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,415
<i>Senpai?</i>

184
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:17,296
I'm not in any club activities,
so I doubt anyone will call me that.

185
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,050
Nishikata-senpai.

186
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,551
What?

187
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,055
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

188
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,681
-Do you like it?
-No.

189
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,101
You sure look happy, Nishikata-senpai.

190
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,061
How is it?

191
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,021
How does it feel to be a <i>senpai?</i>

192
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,856
Cut it out.

193
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,487
A <i>senpai</i>…

194
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:47,451
There is that, but it's the class change
that really matters to me.

195
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,078
That's right.

196
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,623
It will determine our lives
for the next year.

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,500
Right.

198
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,087
I hope I'm in the same class as you.

199
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,673
What?

200
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,800
No, it's just…

201
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,096
If we're in the same class
I'll have more chances to beat you.

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
Oh?

203
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,183
So you want to be in the same class as me.

204
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,643
I said no!

205
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,186
That's not what I meant.

206
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,652
I hope we're in the same class again.

207
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,906
Yeah.

208
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,369
Oh?

209
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,664
Your face is turning red,
Nishikata-senpai.

210
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,874
Is something wrong?

211
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,917
Cut it out.

212
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,025
-I'm curious.
-Right, which class will we be in?

213
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,221
Yay! We're in the same class!

214
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,059
CONGRATULATIONS! 2014 CLASS LIST

215
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,062
-Oh, I'm in class three.
-Me too!

216
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,813
-You're right! I'm glad.
-Let's get along.

217
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,856
What about you?

218
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,487
NISHIKATA

219
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
So I'm in class three.

220
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,534
Same as Nakai.

221
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,245
All right.

222
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,250
I'm in class three too.

223
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,170
We're together again, Nishikata.

224
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,006
Oh, you're in my class too.

225
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,091
Let's get along.

226
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,760
What?

227
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,844
Takagi-san?

228
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,930
What are you doing here?

229
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,475
That's too big a reaction, Nishikata!

230
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,268
W-What about Paris?

231
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,939
Why? You went to Paris.

232
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,943
Let's get along again, Nishikata.

233
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,618
THIRD YEAR CLASS THREE

234
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,620
Good morning.

235
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,249
Good morning.

236
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,709
Good morning.

237
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,211
-Good morning.
-Takagi-san?

238
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,796
Huh? Good morning.

239
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,755
-Morning.
-What?

240
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,465
Didn't you go to Paris?

241
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,260
Good morning.

242
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,053
What are you doing here?

243
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,976
My dad's company
decided to postpone the move.

244
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,936
Really?

245
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,689
-Yeah.
-Let's make third year a good one.

246
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,315
-Thanks!
-Yes!

247
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,485
-Takagi-san, good morning.
-Good morning.

248
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,509
This is the embarrassing thing
you were talking about.

249
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,094
That's right.

250
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,472
The move got postponed.

251
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,475
Isn't that embarrassing?

252
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,936
After everything everyone did for me.

253
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm so embarrassed.

254
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,819
We get to go to the same school again.

255
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,614
Yes. Just like I said.

256
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,784
Something embarrassing, but happy.

257
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,624
It makes me happy
and I thought you would be too.

258
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,960
Didn't you want this?

259
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,962
Well…

260
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,380
I did but…

261
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,886
In other words,
I get to keep on teasing you.

262
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,930
Isn't that great?

263
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,014
Not at all.

264
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,437
Takagi-san.

265
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,106
Yeah?

266
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:31,985
Thanks.

267
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,488
For what?

268
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,242
For calling me this morning.

269
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,954
I was actually going to call you too.

270
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,123
You were?

271
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,458
How come?

272
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,169
You wanted to hear my voice that bad?

273
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,839
No, it's not like that.

274
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,466
I just thought you might be lonely.

275
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,343
Is that so?

276
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,888
So you wanted to hear my voice.

277
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,974
It's kind of like…

278
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
we're a couple.

279
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,602
What?

280
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,062
It's not!

281
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,605
I was just worried.

282
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,607
Worried?

283
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,485
That sounds like we're a couple too.

284
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,781
You even looked up the time difference.

285
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,701
But that was just your homework right?

286
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,660
Seriously…

287
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,245
Just cut it out.

288
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,629
Once more for good measure,
let's get along again, Nishikata.

289
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,090
I look forward to it.

290
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,676
Why so formal?

291
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,597
Lay off.

292
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,441
Huh?

293
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,902
-It's so pretty.
-What is?

294
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,114
-It is pretty I guess.
-Yeah.

295
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,284
The sea is sparkling.

296
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,296
I wonder if we can see anything.

297
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,924
Far away.

298
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,387
"Far away, it is not"

299
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,641
became, "It is not far away"
as the language changed.

300
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,268
And so the negative form…

301
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>Takagi-san is next to me.</i>

302
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,606
<i>That alone makes me so happy.</i>

303
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,204
Here.

304
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,498
Thanks.

305
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,836
That eraser.

306
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,630
Do you remember?

307
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,218
If you write your crush's name
and use it all up,

308
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,303
that person will like you back.

309
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,647
LOOK AT THE HALLWAY

310
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,282
This is the one you teased me with before.

311
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,079
When I told you before,
you said you didn't believe in it.

312
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,624
But some things really do come true.

313
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,001
What?

314
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,627
What do you mean?

315
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,006
Erasers…

316
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,092
have a front and back right?

317
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,636
What?

318
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,266
<i>No way…</i>

319
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,144
<i>Could my name be on the back?</i>

320
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,692
LOOK AT THE HALLWAY

321
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,528
It doesn't say anything.

322
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,616
Oh?
Did you think your name would be on it?

323
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,743
No way.

324
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,665
This isn't the same eraser as last time.

325
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,501
What do you mean?

326
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,883
I may have used that one all up.

327
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,760
What?

328
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,179
Nothing.

329
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,741
<i>Three months later.</i>
<i>During summer vacation.</i>

330
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,243
<i>Takagi-san</i>…

331
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,704
<i>ended up moving after all.</i>

332
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,084
<i>It was postponed for a bit.</i>

333
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,131
<i>But because of her father's work</i>
<i>she ended up moving to Paris.</i>

334
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,052
-Bye for now.
-Take care<i>.</i>

335
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,386
Takagi-san!

336
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,806
Goodbye!

337
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,517
Nishikata!

338
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,144
Let me tease you when I get back!

339
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,854
