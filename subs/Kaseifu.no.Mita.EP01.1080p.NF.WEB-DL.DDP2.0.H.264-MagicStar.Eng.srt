<i>How is the weather today?</i>

7
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,490
<i>Good morning.</i>

8
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,061
<i>Today will be a sunny day.
Not a single cloud in sight.</i>

00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,997
<i>It may feel a little warm
with the sunlight,</i>

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,435
<i>but the temperature today
will just be at 13 degrees Celsius.</i>

00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,004
<i>When the wind blows from the north…</i>

12
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,115
Good morning.

00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>Here is today's news.</i>

14
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,984
Morning.

15
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,853
Kaito, have you washed your face?

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,688
Fine, I will.

SHOPPING LIST

18
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,036
Hey, there's no butter.

19
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,439
You could have bought some instead.

20
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,041
So scary!

21
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,512
Kii! You'll be late for school
if you don't wake up now.

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,547
I don't want to go.

23
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,316
Hurry up and get ready.

24
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,884
Oh, come on…

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,852
Yui!

26
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,688
You washed my uniform
without softener again, didn't you?

27
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,590
It's so stiff that it's gross!

28
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,558
My socks aren't as white as before, too.

29
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,027
Learn how to use
the washing machine yourself, then.

30
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,630
Seriously. And you call yourself
the eldest child?

31
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,571
Hey, Kakeru!

32
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,508
Haven't I told you not to drink the milk
directly from the box?

33
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,612
Oh, right! I've been wanting to use
the washroom the entire time.

34
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,813
Who's taking so long?

35
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,587
Dad! Just how long
are you going to stay inside?

36
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,090
I'm going to leak anytime!

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,592
Oh, sorry! I'll be out in a moment.

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,033
All right.

39
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,139
Sorry. Actually, there's something
I want to tell everyone.

40
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,875
-Just how long were you going to take?
-What?

41
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,712
I'll wait until you're done, then!

42
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,450
Oh, Yui. It looks like
we've run out of toilet paper.

43
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,921
When will you remember?

44
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,390
Didn't I tell you
I placed some right here…

45
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,326
Seriously!

46
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,065
Oh, it's fine. I'll buy them
on my way back from work.

47
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,734
Mommy is going to help you
wear your dress.

48
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,337
You'll really be late
if you don't hurry, Kii.

49
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,774
How's school, Kaito?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,511
You don't have to ask me
such a vague question.

51
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,047
Well, you're right.

52
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,791
Breakfast time!

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,495
Wait, Kakeru. Have you washed your hands?

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,463
What?

55
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,600
How unhygienic. I can't believe you!

56
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,668
Don't be so annoyed!

57
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,170
Come on, now.

58
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,039
Actually, there's something
I want to tell everyone.

59
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,342
-Eat properly, Kii.
-Don't spill your food.

60
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,144
-Shut up! It didn't spill onto you.
-It's dirty.

61
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,647
Everyone, will you listen to me?

62
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,382
Actually, today…

63
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,286
Who's here this early?

64
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll open the door!

65
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,688
Coming!

66
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,927
This is Suzuka Transport!
We're here to deliver your items.

67
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,463
Sorry, it's a little cluttered here.

68
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,398
Come here, Kii. It's dangerous.

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,332
Let's go.

70
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,500
Please pardon us.

71
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,969
Where should we put this?

72
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,472
Oh, on top of the dresser
in the tatami room.

73
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,674
We'll remove the packaging here, then.

74
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,051
Hey, what's that?

75
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,819
A Buddhist altar. Can't you see?

76
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,688
What's a Buddhist altar, Daddy?

77
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,191
What? Well, that's…

78
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,894
-Your signature and seal here, please.
-Sure.

79
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,330
-Hey, what's a Buddhist altar?
-What?

80
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,302
From today onwards,
imagine that Mommy is right in there.

81
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,203
-We'll pray to it every day.
-Thank you!

82
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,672
Oh, thank you.

83
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,377
But why? Mommy isn't in there!

84
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,247
What? Like I said…

85
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,849
Why would you buy
something like that, Dad?

86
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,019
Well, your mom's 49th day is already over.

87
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,656
-We can't wallow in sadness forever.
-What's the "49th day"?

88
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,526
What? Well…

89
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,461
So… It's…

90
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,897
<i>It is almost 7 a.m. now.</i>

91
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,333
<i>We continue to strive
to bring you the latest news.</i>

92
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,734
Let's eat.

93
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,438
Who is it this time?

94
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,906
I'll get the door!

95
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,074
Coming!

96
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,379
Kii!

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,083
I'm Mita, your housekeeper.

98
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,685
I am here on behalf of
Harumi Housekeeping Agency.

99
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,154
What?

100
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,458
Oh… Hello.

101
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,693
May I enter?

102
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,964
Sure. Sorry, it's a little messy here.

103
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,969
Well, I thought they would have sent
someone who looks the part.

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,037
Oh, your slippers.

105
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,638
-Don't worry.
-What?

106
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,374
I have my own pair.

107
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,517
Let's see.
That's Yui, the eldest daughter.

108
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,154
This is Kakeru, the eldest son.
That's Kaito, my second son.

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,756
And this is Kii, the youngest.

110
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,795
I'm Mita, your housekeeper.

111
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,030
Hey. What's a housekeeper?

112
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,599
Well…

113
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,800
Starting today,

114
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,901
Mita will be

115
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,670
cleaning the house, washing our clothes

116
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,840
and cooking our food for the entire day.

117
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,242
What?

118
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,676
I didn't hear about this.

119
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,711
You knew, Yui?

120
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,746
Well, I guess.

121
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,249
Why didn't you tell us
such an important thing?

122
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,985
Sorry. That was my fault, Kakeru.

123
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,319
Isn't this fine?

124
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,889
We don't have someone
who can do household chores here.

125
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,925
Are you fine letting a stranger
enter our house all of a sudden?

126
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,894
The service must be costly, too, right?

127
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,096
Don't worry, it will all work out.

128
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,566
Remember? We had money
from your mom's insurance…

129
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,438
I mean, the 49th day is already over.

130
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,241
Hey, so what's this "49th day"?

131
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,644
Well, that's…

132
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,112
Well…

133
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,281
Can someone explain it to her?

134
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,085
The 49th day refers to the day
when the deceased's soul,

135
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,221
which was lingering in this world
for 49 days,

136
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,890
travels to the other world.

137
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,094
So you say your goodbyes
and forget about that person.

138
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,198
It's a day selfishly decided
by the living.

139
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,303
But Mommy is still here!

140
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,306
Mommy is still right beside me!

141
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,311
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,313
They lost their mother suddenly,

143
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,782
so they haven't really accepted it yet.

144
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,218
She drowned in a nearby river.

145
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,688
So?

146
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,022
What?

147
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,225
What should I start with, sir?

148
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,829
Oh, for now…

149
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,798
Either tidy up the house
or do the laundry.

150
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,900
Just anything you feel necessary.

151
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,836
May I take a look around the house?

152
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,705
Yes, of course.

153
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,242
After I send Kii to school by 9 a.m.,

154
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,211
I will do the laundry
and hang up the blankets to dry.

155
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,649
Looks like mold is growing
in the bathroom and washroom,

156
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,717
so I will clean it up.

157
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,522
Softener, toilet paper.

158
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,890
Butter.

159
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,858
Shampoo, garbage bags…

160
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,993
You do not have those.

161
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,462
After I pick up Kii at 3 p.m.,

162
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,865
I will buy them
when I'm out grocery shopping.

163
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,434
I will change the light bulb here.

164
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,104
How should I tidy up the children's rooms?

165
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,539
What?

166
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,307
Well…

167
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,844
For now, I will try to tidy up the rooms
without making any changes

168
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,178
as much as possible.

169
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,480
Is that all right?

170
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,116
Yes.

171
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,884
Understood.

172
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,055
I will water and fertilize
the potted plants.

173
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,390
The windows seem dirty,

174
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,824
so I will wipe them clean.

175
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,796
What would you like to have for dinner?

176
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,665
Oh, well…

177
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,701
I'll leave it up to you.

178
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,236
One last thing.

179
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,637
Yes?

180
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,075
What should I do with that room?

181
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,746
Right…

182
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,384
I did think about cleaning up
the room eventually…

183
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,789
You don't have to clean that room!

184
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,291
Then, are you planning to just leave
the things there?

185
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,393
-You want them thrown away?
-I didn't say that!

186
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,629
-Stop it.
-What do you think, Yui?

187
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,064
What?

188
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,933
Could you leave the room as it is for now?

189
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,036
As you wish.

190
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,439
I will begin my work now.

191
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,290
Yui has to take the 7:52 a.m. bus.

192
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,826
Kakeru and Kaito will be late

193
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,427
if they do not leave by 8 a.m.,

194
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,762
so you two should get ready.

195
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,133
I suggest you leave earlier than usual,
Mr. Asuda.

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,936
It was reported in the news

197
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,438
that the traffic will be congested today.

198
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,007
Oh, okay.

199
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,378
-Oh, no!
-Yikes!

200
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,191
-Hurry up!
-I know!

201
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,192
Oh, no!

202
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,297
Have a safe trip.

203
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,969
Mita. Here is the house key,
and the grocery allowance for now.

204
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,004
-Mr. Asuda.
-Yes?

205
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,272
Your necktie is crooked.

206
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,415
Good morning.

207
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,817
Good morning.

208
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,153
This is Ms. Minagawa, our neighbor.

209
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,021
Well, this is…

210
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,457
I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

211
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,586
Yui! Got a minute?

212
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,156
I told you not to talk to me in school.

213
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,126
People would misunderstand
if they know I'm related to a teacher.

214
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,029
Sorry. Anyway, I want to go cook
at your house today.

215
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,630
Tell me what you ate yesterday.

216
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,332
You wouldn't want the same thing--

217
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,234
-We're fine.
-What?

218
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,103
We have a housekeeper starting today.

219
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,971
No way! I didn't hear about that!

220
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,973
Why did Keiichi do that?

221
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,908
I could help with the household chores!

222
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,277
In any case, the matter is settled.

223
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,880
You don't have to come over.
Don't you dare!

224
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,884
<i>Putting safety into consideration,</i>

225
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:36,021
we decided on curved paths
to control the driving speed.

226
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,457
And by hiding
the utility poles underneath,

227
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,460
we were able to create
a beautiful town landscape.

228
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,896
These are the landscape planning
key points

229
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,498
we discussed in our last meeting.

230
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you have anything to add, Chief?

231
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,069
What?

232
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:51,871
Right…

233
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,374
As the person in charge
of this important project,

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,177
I'm glad to have reliable subordinates
like all of you.

235
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,380
There you go again.
You're so good at flattery, Chief.

236
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,918
-Let's do our best.
-Yes, let's do this.

237
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,487
-Give me a minute.
-Okay.

238
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,991
Kazama.

239
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,730
What is it?

240
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,199
Well…

241
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,867
I…

242
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,235
How should I say this?

243
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,210
Hey! Wait!

244
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,848
Oh, hello? Sorry to call
while you're busy.

245
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:40,953
I am Harumi
from Harumi Housekeeping Agency.

246
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,255
Oh, hello.

247
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,924
So what is the matter?

248
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,827
Mita should have made a trip

249
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,696
to your house today.

250
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,400
So I was wondering
if you're thinking about that.

251
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,336
What? What do you mean?

252
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,975
Well, it's nothing too serious.

253
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,778
Depending on the situation,

254
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,979
we do have

255
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,983
a fair amount of customers

256
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,485
requesting to have
the housekeeper changed.

257
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,688
I see…

258
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,124
I was a little surprised
since she didn't look like a housekeeper,

259
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,293
but she's pretty and she doesn't say much.

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,695
<i>Exactly.</i>

261
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,664
That lady doesn't really smile,

262
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,268
and she never says anything else
other than what's necessary.

263
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,436
I see.

264
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,670
Is that so?

265
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,571
<i>But…</i>

266
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,609
she is definitely top-notch
when it comes to her work.

267
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,979
She'll get all the basic things
done perfectly!

268
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,248
I see. I have to go now.

269
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,849
Wait, one more thing!

270
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,517
What is it?

271
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:49,555
<i>She will do anything you ask.</i>

272
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,224
<i>Could you please be careful with that?</i>

273
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,728
Excuse me, but may I know
what the problem with that is?

274
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,597
To put it in extreme terms…

275
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,468
If you tell her to kill someone…

276
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,739
She will really do it.

277
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,109
What?

278
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,447
Don't worry about it!

279
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,616
I mean,

280
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,320
you don't seem like the type
who would tell her to do that!

281
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,489
<i>Please excuse me!</i>

282
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,941
Okay.

283
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,543
I'm home!

284
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,696
Welcome home.

285
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,130
Hey…

286
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,398
I'm home.

287
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,101
Shall I help you get undressed?

288
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,602
What?

289
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,205
No, you don't have to do that!

290
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,935
Oh, sorry. I wanted to get some water.

291
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,179
<i>If you tell her to kill someone…</i>

292
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,216
<i>She will really do it.</i>

293
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,919
I'm sorry, but could you please
not stand behind me?

294
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,855
What?

295
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,657
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,727
It's just that the house
looks too different, so I was surprised.

297
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,863
-Daddy!
-What is it?

298
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,165
The washroom and bathroom
are sparkling clean!

299
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,133
Really?

300
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,139
You're right.

301
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,908
It smells good, too.

302
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,180
What's wrong, Yui?

303
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,648
There's a cockroach!

304
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,417
-What? Where?
-It's running around!

305
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,420
-Where is it?
-Hey! What are you guys doing?

306
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,455
What's up? It's time to study--

307
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,990
There it is!

308
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,312
Dinner is ready.

309
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,416
They look delicious.

310
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,620
Excuse me. Was the money enough?

311
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,491
Don't worry. Here is the receipt.

312
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,826
Right…

313
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,327
Thank you very much.

314
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,997
Well then, shall we eat?

315
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,768
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

316
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,005
So good!

317
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,775
We haven't had any proper food
for two months, after all.

318
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:30,943
-Shut up.
-But still,

319
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,345
this is a little bland
compared to our usual.

320
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,483
Just now you were so happy
that your uniform feels fluffy.

321
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,620
Shut up! You should stop studying
when it's time to eat!

322
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,691
-I agree, Kaito.
-But I couldn't solve this question.

323
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,392
Right. Do you know the answer, Dad?

324
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,829
It's a question set for the middle school
that I'm applying for.

325
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:51,830
Let's see.

326
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,466
Well, this question…

327
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,835
Want to answer it, Yui?

328
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,170
Don't throw it to me.

329
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,638
So no one knows the answer?

330
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,674
7y over 3 plus two.

331
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,982
Oh, wow. She's right.

332
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,852
Mita also remembers
all the names of AKB48!

333
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,220
No way! Say it.

334
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,123
Atsuko Maeda, Yuko Oshima, Yuki Kashiwagi,

335
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,359
Mariko Shinoda, Mayu Watanabe,

336
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,995
-I'll get it!
-Haruna Kojima, Minami Takahashi,

337
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,130
-Tomomi Itano…
-You can stop now, Mita.

338
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,766
-Who's here this late?
-Don't tell me…

339
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
Sorry that I'm late, everyone!

340
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,070
I was buying groceries at the supermarket,

341
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,373
and I left my wallet back in school…

342
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,874
Well…

343
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,944
You don't need to worry about
our dinner, Urara.

344
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,647
Seems like it.

345
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:44,816
Right.

346
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,452
This is Mita.
She will be with us starting today.

347
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,453
Mita.

348
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,454
This is Urara,

349
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,256
the younger sister of my late wife.

350
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,891
I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

351
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,394
Hello, I'm Urara Yuki.

352
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,129
I'm 12 years younger than my sister,

353
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,897
so we don't really seem like sisters.

354
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,266
I teach PE in Yui's school.

355
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,167
Excuse me…

356
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,770
It will be a waste to throw these,
so please use them.

357
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,071
I understand.

358
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,041
Hey…

359
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,576
Why don't you join us, Urara?

360
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,377
What? Really…

361
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,647
Oh, but I'll feel bad.

362
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,383
-Also, there are things to do at home.
-I see.

363
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,384
And…

364
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,020
You don't have to see me off.
Continue your dinner!

365
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,522
It's fine! See you!

366
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,627
I'm glad she went back immediately.

367
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,829
Things always get messy when Urara comes.

368
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,297
Isn't that going overboard?

369
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,500
Everyone! Sorry,
but I forgot something important!

370
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,603
Kii's birthday is in two days, right?

371
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,338
Why don't we all celebrate together?

372
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,078
It's fine, but…

373
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,881
We're not really in the mood for it.

374
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,318
Also, there's no one
organizing it this year…

375
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,124
Don't say that.
Let's have a party together!

376
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,861
Who was the one who couldn't make it
to the party because of work last year?

377
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,631
I'll come home early for sure this year.

378
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,867
Right. Is there any birthday present
you want, Kii?

379
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,435
Just say anything you want.

380
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,971
-Really?
-Yes. Just say it.

381
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,008
Mommy!

382
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,310
What?

383
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,450
I… I want Mommy. I want Mommy to be here!

384
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,955
Well, that's a little…

385
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,923
Don't say strange things, Kii.

386
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,593
What about a panda stuffed toy?
Didn't you want that?

387
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,297
No. I want Mommy!

388
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:39,998
Don't act like a baby.

389
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:44,036
No! I want Mommy.

390
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,438
I want to see Mommy!

391
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,140
Don't cry, Kii!

392
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,207
Man.

393
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,145
It's all because someone mentioned
having a birthday party.

394
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,414
Oh, I get it!

395
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,317
Kii! I'll let you meet Mommy.

396
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,452
Really?

397
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,788
Yes! So look forward to your birthday.

398
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,624
-Thanks, Urara!
-Count on me!

399
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,127
Urara said she'll let me meet Mommy!

400
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:13,298
Urara. Are you sure
it's fine to make that promise?

401
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,666
Well…

402
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,736
It will all be fine! Just leave it to me!

403
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,006
Bye! See you. I'll come visit again!

404
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,308
This is definitely not going to end well.

405
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,410
I have a bad feeling about this.

406
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,447
Things really get messy
when Urara is around.

407
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,848
What now, Dad?

408
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,083
What?

409
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,951
Oh… Okay.

410
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,176
Mr. Asuda. I will leave the house now
if there is nothing else.

411
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,244
Okay…

412
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,313
Sure.

413
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,915
Good work today.

414
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,895
Excuse me, Mita.

415
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,734
It's about Urara.

416
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,603
What do you think I should do?

417
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,037
What do you mean by that?

418
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,038
I mean…

419
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,108
She's bright and she tries her best
in everything.

420
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,713
I'm grateful that she's been with us
ever since my wife passed away.

421
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,616
But whenever she tries
to do something to help us,

422
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,285
things always tend to backfire instead.

423
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,687
It's pretty troublesome.

424
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,856
Oh, for example…

425
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,627
She invited the kids out for a drive
to cheer them up,

426
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,329
but she got a flat tire
in the middle of a mountain.

427
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,999
When Urara tried to pitch a tent
at a campsite,

428
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,702
tons of bugs and insects appeared
all of a sudden.

429
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,573
Well…

430
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,642
What I mean is…

431
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,811
I'm really sorry to ask you
for this favor,

432
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,346
but could you ask her

433
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,549
and see what she's planning to do?

434
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,619
Well, you see…

435
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,022
It will be really bad

436
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,624
if Kii gets injured or something.

437
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,198
This is Urara's address.

438
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,005
I mean, I know that I should be
the one making the trip.

439
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,175
But I just don't get along
with her father.

440
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,212
Even if I were really there,

441
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,415
he would just say things like,
"I don't even want to see your face!"

442
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,885
Is this an order?

443
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,153
What?

444
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,989
Well, yes.

445
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,024
Understood.

446
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,068
YUKI RESIDENCE

447
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,208
What do you want
this early in the morning?

448
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,115
Who are you?

449
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,484
I'm Mita, a housekeeper.

450
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,521
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

451
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,627
So you're the housekeeper Urara mentioned?

452
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,794
Yes.

453
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,364
So? What do you want?

454
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,468
Mr. Asuda ordered me to check

455
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,837
what Ms. Urara's plans are.

456
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,806
What do you mean?

457
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,642
Explain yourself clearly.

458
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,576
Yesterday,

459
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,111
Ms. Urara visited the residence

460
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,947
and suggested to hold
a birthday party for Kii.

461
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,349
Kii was asked what birthday present
she would like,

462
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,852
and she replied, "I want to see Mommy."

463
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,121
Everyone was extremely troubled.

464
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,025
But Ms. Urara promised to let Kii
see her mother.

465
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,428
Kii believed her words
and is looking forward to her birthday.

466
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,430
Mr. Asuda is worried,

467
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,166
and he would like to know
what Ms. Urara has in mind.

468
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,435
But he is bad at dealing with you.

469
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,637
If he had come,
he said you would shout at him,

470
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,639
"I don't even want to see your face!"

471
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,708
So he asked me to make the trip over.

472
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,779
What was that?

473
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,448
Hey, Urara!

474
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,152
Urara! Come over!

475
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,489
I've had enough of that man!

476
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,993
He should come over himself
if he has something to ask!

477
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,661
That coward!

478
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,232
If only Nagiko hadn't been deceived
by that man

479
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,501
and had a shotgun marriage with him,

480
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,538
she wouldn't have drowned herself
in the river!

481
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,875
What, Dad? I have to leave soon.
I won't make it in time!

482
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,978
Pardon my intrusion.

483
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,414
Urara. Just what did you do?

484
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,217
How could you promise to let a kid
meet someone who died?

485
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,221
Shut up. Could you not scold me
like you did when you were a principal?

486
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,424
You don't seem to know
your responsibility as a teacher!

487
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,660
How could you make
an empty promise to a child?

488
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,262
That's the last thing
you should do as a teacher!

489
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,064
Also,

490
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,133
I told you to never visit that home again!

491
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,169
I'm free to do that!

492
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,672
Why don't you show more love
for your grandchildren?

493
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,708
You always frown and lecture them.
No wonder they dislike you!

494
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,445
You could also stop being so prejudiced
against Keiichi and be more accepting!

495
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,847
Shut up!

496
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,651
No matter what,

497
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,120
I will never forgive that man!

498
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,022
Like I said, stop getting angry!

499
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,891
I'm not getting angry at you!

500
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,063
Jeez! He always runs away
when things don't look good for him!

501
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,801
Sorry that you had to see that.

502
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,571
What?

503
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,008
You told him everything?

504
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,476
Yes.

505
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,212
So…

506
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,447
<i>What did he say?</i>

507
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,083
"He should come over himself
if he has something to ask!"

508
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,685
"That coward!"

509
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,886
That was what he said.

510
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,855
I see.

511
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,760
So… What did Urara say?

512
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:20,165
"I came up with a great idea
which will let Kii meet with her mother,

513
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,033
so don't worry!"

514
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,268
That was what she said.

515
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,904
What is that idea she came up with?

516
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,240
Apparently, she's keeping it a secret
until the day itself.

517
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,809
I see.

518
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,613
It is almost time to pick Kii up,
so may I end the call here?

519
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,017
Yes. I understand.

520
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,692
MISAWA KINDERGARTEN

521
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,666
It hurts…

522
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,202
How are you planning
to take responsibility?

523
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,306
At this rate, I can't let my child
attend this kindergarten safely.

524
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,308
I am really sorry!

525
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,581
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

526
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,849
What is it?

527
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,252
Kii made Tsubasa cry.

528
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,522
She told him that she's meeting
her mother on her birthday,

529
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,023
and Tsubasa told her

530
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,793
that she can't meet her mother
since she died.

531
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,828
You…

532
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,331
You're the housekeeper
at the Asuda residence, right?

533
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,801
Just how does he raise his kids?

534
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,071
She was so mean to Tsubasa.

535
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,677
There's no point discussing this with you,

536
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,914
so could you tell her father to come
to our house and apologize?

537
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,350
Understood.

538
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,686
Let's head home, Tsubasa.

539
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,633
Let's go home.

540
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,952
Can we hold hands?

541
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,888
Yes.

542
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,694
Why are your hands so cold?

543
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,964
I'm sorry.

544
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,732
Hey.

545
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,869
Is it true that I can meet Mommy if I die?

546
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,973
Tsubasa told me that.

547
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,210
"Your mommy is in heaven,

548
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,079
so you have to die
if you want to meet her."

549
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,016
Some people believe in that.

550
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,197
Then…

551
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,933
Could we both go together?

552
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,870
Let's meet Mommy.

553
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,137
As you wish.

554
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,953
Hey, what are you two doing?

555
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,523
Hey, hold up!

556
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,225
Hey!

557
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,731
What were you planning to do
with my little sister?

558
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,935
Kii! Are you all right, Kii?

559
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,839
Hey, Kaito! That housekeeper is bad news!

560
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,175
She was definitely trying to die!

561
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,878
And that was where Mom drowned, too!

562
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,313
Weren't you just imagining it?

563
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,380
He's right.

564
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,883
Didn't Kii also say
she was just picking up stones?

565
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,885
What are you saying?

566
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,255
You're the eldest, so why don't you show
more concern for your sister?

567
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,959
And you're just a kid, so could you stop
boasting that you're the eldest son?

568
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,395
Then what should we do?
Kii's birthday is tomorrow!

569
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,598
I wonder how Urara
will mess things up this time.

570
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,200
It will be fine.

571
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,938
Not even Urara is capable
of summoning Mom's spirit.

572
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,274
I'm sure even Kii understands

573
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,576
that it's not possible to see Mom.

574
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,113
INBOX
TAKUYA OZAWA

575
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,581
What? Was that your boyfriend?

576
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,516
What? No way, seriously?

577
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,718
Don't look at my phone.

578
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,320
Hey! Our conversation isn't over yet.

579
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,324
If you're that worried,
why don't you tell Dad about it?

580
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,665
I brought you your washed clothes.

581
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,034
Right…

582
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,769
Thank you very much.

583
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,872
Mita.

584
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,876
Excuse me…

585
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,114
What do you think I should do?

586
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,182
About the birthday party tomorrow.

587
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,584
That is…

588
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,920
something you should decide for yourself.

589
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,382
MOM: I'M SORRY, YUI.

590
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,588
EISEI ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL

591
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,290
PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB

592
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,872
Hey. What are you doing?

593
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,808
Oh, it's nothing.

594
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,079
Those guys left the camera here again.

595
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,988
You know…

596
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,724
Shall we go somewhere today
if you're free?

597
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,493
-What?
-Well…

598
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,697
We haven't had a good talk
ever since your mom passed away.

599
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,532
Right…

600
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,270
-I'm sorry.
-No, I wasn't trying to blame you.

601
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,541
Besides, it's hard for us
to be alone in school.

602
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,812
You're right.

603
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,766
Who is it?

604
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,469
It's my younger brother.

605
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,438
Please excuse me!

606
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,809
Hello?

607
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,444
Where are you now, Yui?

608
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,412
I'm still in school. What is it?

609
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,548
Things are getting really bad here!

610
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,116
What do you mean?

611
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,819
It's a mess all because of Urara!

612
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,287
Just come home quickly!

613
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,389
Hey! Hello?

614
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,206
Excuse me…

615
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,743
What are you doing, Mita?

616
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,480
I was told that I do not need
to prepare dinner today.

617
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,915
Did Urara tell you that?

618
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:24,949
Yes.

619
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,155
What? What's going on?

620
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,437
Urara?

621
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,307
Welcome home!
Dinner will be done in a while.

622
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,277
Jeez, that hurt!

623
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,216
Hey, what's going on?

624
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,651
She brought a photo
of last year's birthday party,

625
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,820
and she is preparing the same food!

626
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,857
She thinks doing that will make Kii happy
since it will just be like seeing Mom!

627
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,895
On top of that, she's wearing
the same clothing Mom wore last year.

628
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,131
She was wearing the same apron as Mom.

629
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,500
I just can't believe her.

630
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,735
Wait, where's Dad?

631
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,605
Pretty sure
he's going to be home late again.

632
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,111
Here, it's all done!

633
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,447
Come sit down, everyone!

634
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,882
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kii! Let's eat.

635
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,518
Come on. Sit down, everyone.

636
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,455
Your father is running late,
so we should start first.

637
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,924
What do you want to eat, Kii?

638
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,793
How about some salad? Here you go.

639
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,264
-I don't want any.
-What? Why?

640
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,499
-Here you go.
-Kii dislikes cherry tomatoes.

641
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,670
Really? I'm sorry. But look…

642
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,573
Your mom made these last year.

643
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,875
Then…

644
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,076
Have some fried chicken.

645
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,412
I'm sure it will taste
just like your mom's.

646
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,116
These aren't Mom's cooking at all!

647
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,453
Kii. Apologize to Urara.

648
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,921
It's fine!

649
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,457
Then, shall we order takeout?

650
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,794
What do you want? Pizza, or maybe sushi?

651
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,763
I don't care.

652
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,464
I want to see Mommy!

653
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,933
Let me meet Mommy!

654
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,834
Right,

655
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,371
so you can think of me as your mommy!

656
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,141
You're not Mommy, Urara!

657
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,444
Don't sit here!

658
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,447
This is Mommy's seat!

659
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,017
Sorry. Actually…

660
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,954
Sorry.

661
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,956
Seriously, what are you doing?

662
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,159
I'll clean it up.

663
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,860
I'm sorry.

664
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,265
-Come on, Kii.
-Let's go, Kaito.

665
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,403
Kii.

666
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,108
I'm home.

667
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,677
Sorry, I just couldn't leave work early…

668
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,346
What?

669
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,947
What happened?

670
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,750
-I'm sorry, Keiichi.
-What?

671
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,652
It's all my fault.

672
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,355
I'll go home.

673
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,322
Wait, what?

674
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,057
Urara? Wait…

675
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,898
What's the matter, Kii?

676
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,235
Come on, cheer up.

677
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,269
That's right.

678
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,205
I got you a present!

679
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,375
Here you go.

680
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,945
It's the panda stuffed toy
that you wanted!

681
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,714
-See?
-Wow, awesome!

682
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,816
Aren't you happy, Kii?

683
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,254
I wanted this, too!

684
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,756
I don't need things like this!

685
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,594
You better stop it, Kii.

686
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,661
I won't.

687
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,798
I want to see Mommy!

688
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,667
I want to see Mommy!

689
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,704
Mommy!

690
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,541
I want to see Mommy!

691
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,544
I want to see Mom, too!

692
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,681
But…

693
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,049
She died.

694
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,286
She's no longer with us.

695
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,923
Tomorrow, the day after,
or even the day after that…

696
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,759
We can't see Mom again!

697
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,395
No matter how much you want to see her,

698
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,797
it's impossible!

699
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,131
Forever!

700
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,633
Yui.

701
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,535
You didn't have to take it that far…

702
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:43,274
Then, why don't you let her meet Mom?

703
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,616
It's all because we leave her things
lying around here.

704
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,452
Mita.

705
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,220
Will you throw all her things away?

706
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,825
As you wish.

707
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,995
Wait. Mita…

708
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,035
Hey…

709
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,439
What are you doing?
You've got to be kidding me!

710
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,876
Hey…

711
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,311
Stop it already!

712
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,914
Just throw all of them away.

713
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,859
-Stop it!
-Burn all of them!

714
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,163
Why don't you say something, Dad?

715
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,765
What? Well…

716
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,769
You also think
we're better off doing this, right?

717
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,840
That's not what I think…

718
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:50,975
Yui?

719
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,746
Even if we keep them,

720
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,082
Mom will never come back to life!

721
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,984
-Yui!
-Move!

722
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,356
We don't need this, nor this!

723
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,576
I used to think that…

724
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:34,051
I'm a good older sister.

725
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,087
But…

726
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,360
I realized something after Mom died.

727
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,864
In reality…

728
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,468
I couldn't do anything
an elder sister can do.

729
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,339
Not cooking, not doing the laundry.

730
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,541
Not tidying,
nor even taking care of siblings.

731
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,943
I couldn't do them at all!

732
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,945
I have to get myself together.

733
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,148
I know I have to do my best!

734
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,916
But it's just impossible for me!

735
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:11,388
I don't even feel like taking photos,
which I used to love!

736
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,140
Hey, what are you doing?

737
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,291
Damn you, stop that right now!

738
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,394
Why are you doing this?

739
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,063
Why?

740
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,799
-Damn it!
-Hey!

741
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,036
-Why?
-Kakeru!

742
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:02,106
Are you guys fine
with Mom's belongings being gone?

743
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,307
Kakeru!

744
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,142
Then burn that thing too!

745
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,708
I'm the worst.

746
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,514
You know…

747
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,986
When I try to remember Mom…

748
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,489
I only remember her nagging
and reprimanding me…

749
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,659
and me saying things like,
"You're annoying!"

750
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,562
Or "Just leave me alone already!"

751
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,199
I should have been nicer to her.

752
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,502
I should have thanked her.

753
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,638
I should have been grateful
for her existence!

754
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,676
I should have told her,
"I'm sorry I was mean."

755
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,313
I should have apologized to her!

756
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,950
What the hell should I do now?

757
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,490
What's with this turn of events?

758
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,428
Everyone is here crying.

759
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,465
Aren't you sad?

760
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,401
You…

761
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,537
You still call yourself Mom's kid?

762
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,874
Of course, I want to cry, too!

763
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,142
But…

764
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,115
What am I supposed to do
when she died all of a sudden?

765
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,451
Even if I tried my best
and entered a private school,

766
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,020
she's not here anymore to praise me!

767
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,257
I wanted to have Mom all to myself.

768
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,595
I wanted to tell her
all about my future and my dreams!

769
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,530
But I can't do it anymore!

770
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:12,136
I have no idea what Mom was thinking!

771
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,606
Why did she go off and die on her own?

772
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,409
What did she think of me?

773
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,613
Mom!

774
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,551
It's my fault.

775
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,962
Mommy died because of me!

776
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,701
What are you talking about, Kii?

777
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:48,605
I hate tomatoes.

778
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,342
Mom was angry and told me to eat it.

779
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,379
And I told her,

780
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,881
"I hope you die, Mommy!"

781
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:03,287
Then, Mommy really died.

782
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,725
I'm sorry, Mommy!

783
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,995
I'm sorry!

784
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,734
Kii…

785
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,438
Is that why you wanted to meet Mom?

786
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,615
It's not your fault, Kii.

787
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,122
You know that Mommy loves you, Kii.

788
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,558
Daddy…

789
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,102
Hey!

790
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,672
What are you guys doing?

791
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,641
What will you do
if our house catches fire?

792
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,843
Oh, I'm sorry.

793
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,447
Please put out the fire, Mita.

794
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,982
As you wish.

795
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,521
I understand things are tough
since your lost your wife,

796
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,891
but isn't this ridiculous?

797
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:18,295
No wonder Kii would hit other kids
in school.

798
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,396
I'm sorry.

799
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:23,867
If you don't educate Kii properly,
she's going to be led astray.

800
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,670
What will you do
if she causes more problems?

801
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,805
Without a mother in the household,

802
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,641
your family is hardly normal anymore--

803
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,309
Stop!

804
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:36,313
I just didn't want your house
to be caught on fire.

805
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,551
Ms. Minagawa…

806
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,620
Your makeup is totally melting.

807
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,059
I won't take this lying down.

808
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,895
I'll bring this up at the next
neighborhood council meeting.

809
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:00,704
What's this?

810
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,707
It's hot!

811
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,908
Are you all right?

812
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,081
Wait, Mita…

813
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,517
Hey, isn't it hot?

814
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,287
What are these?

815
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,229
Your mom was really proud of these.

816
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,333
She said she went to the river with Kii,

817
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,069
and received these beautiful stones.

818
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,942
It's the first present
she received from Kii,

819
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,878
so she said she'll treasure it forever.

820
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,021
Didn't I tell you?

821
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,924
Mommy…

822
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,360
Mommy loves you, Kii.

823
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,097
Yes!

824
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,102
All right!

825
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,570
Let's have the birthday party!

826
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,772
Just like how we did
when Mom was still around.

827
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,641
But what about all the food?

828
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,276
Oh, right.

829
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,579
Mita.

830
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,381
Could you whip up something?

831
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,515
Sure.

832
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,750
All right.

833
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,852
Oh, what about a cake?

834
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,489
We have one. Ms. Urara brought one.

835
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,358
Oh, wow!

836
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:29,960
This is awesome.

837
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,062
Urara forgot about the candles.

838
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,767
Mita. I don't suppose
you have candles, do you?

839
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,502
I do.

840
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,144
-Oh, wow…
-Oh, wow…

841
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,879
Exactly six of them, too.

842
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,347
All right, I'll light them up.

843
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,486
Okay.

844
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,357
You always sing it, Kakeru.

845
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,393
I couldn't help it!
Mom always made me sing it.

846
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,395
Dad and you guys should join me! Come on!

847
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,897
Three, go!

848
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,804
I'm out of sync.

849
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,353
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday, Kii!

850
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,457
Isn't Kaito supposed to
give her the card next?

851
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:37,661
I didn't prepare one.
I only made them because Mom made me.

852
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,335
Mita. What about a card…

853
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,506
I have one.

854
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,949
Here you go.

855
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,618
Weren't you supposed to give
the presents, Yui?

856
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:05,222
Oh, sorry. I didn't prepare one this year.

857
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,523
Give me a moment.

858
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:10,494
You look stiff, Dad!
You should smile wider, too, Kakeru.

859
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,062
Say cheese!

860
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,698
-Smile!
-Got it.

861
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,003
I'll compile these
into an album for you, Kii.

862
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,271
-Really?
-Yes.

863
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,141
Didn't you say you don't want
to take any photos?

864
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,343
-You sure look excited.
-Shut up.

865
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,145
Have you written the card?

866
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,147
Ta-dah!

867
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:34,184
"Next time, give the old hag
from the next door a good punch, too!"

868
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,052
Got it. I'll do my best!

869
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,722
Hey, give me a break!

870
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,658
-No, that old hag--
-Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

871
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,096
It's stewed meat and potatoes!

872
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,064
-We're digging in!
-Thank you for the food.

873
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,408
This taste…

874
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,713
It tastes just like Mom's cooking.

875
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,385
Mita. How did you make this?

876
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,923
It is the responsibility of a housekeeper
to remember the household's taste buds.

877
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,460
Mom's cooking…

878
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,731
It tasted this good.

879
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,252
It's tasty!

880
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,789
Wow, Kii! You ate it!

881
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,258
Tomatoes contain lycopene
and helps prevent cancer.

882
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,893
Who cares about that?

883
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,961
Isn't it tasty?

884
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,563
-Well done, Kii!
-You're doing great, Kii!

885
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,443
Mr. Asuda.

886
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,379
May I leave for the day?

887
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,313
Right…

888
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,581
Yes.

889
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:15,252
Mita…

890
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,821
Thank you for everything today.

891
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,891
About what?

892
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,460
Oh, well…

893
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,095
Thanks to you,

894
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,266
it felt as if the kids were able
to pour out

895
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,468
all the feelings they bottled up

896
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,271
ever since their mother passed away.

897
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,677
This is the invoice.

898
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:42,912
What?

899
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,650
I will need to charge you
for two hours of overtime work today.

900
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,785
Oh…

901
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,220
Okay.

902
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,989
Please excuse me.

903
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,062
Mita!

904
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,235
My wife didn't die in an accident.

905
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,939
She committed suicide.

906
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,177
She died because of me.

907
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,883
I wonder when he'll be back.

908
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,754
What are you doing?

909
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:58,822
Nothing.

910
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,114
You loved apples, didn't you?

911
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,387
Is that all you have to say?

912
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,256
What?

913
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,525
Please excuse me.

914
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,782
<i>Why was Mom at the river that day?</i>

915
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,184
<i>You're not being bullied, are you?</i>

916
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,754
<i>-Will you do everything we ask, Mita?</i>
-If it is something within my means.

917
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,523
What are you doing to a child?

918
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,191
<i>I was trying to punish him.</i>

919
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,492
Could you kill him for me?

920
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,560
As you wish.

921
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,066
