1
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>Mita!</i>

2
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,932
My wife didn't die in an accident.

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,934
She committed suicide.

4
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,536
She died because of me.

5
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,709
Good morning.

6
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,345
Good morning.

7
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,015
Excuse me, Mita.

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,119
I'm sorry,

9
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,821
but could you not tell the kids

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,489
what I told you yesterday?

11
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,795
Everyone thinks that their mother
just drowned in the river.

12
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,297
They would be shocked
if they knew she killed herself,

13
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,466
and I wouldn't know what to do.

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,471
Of course, I know that eventually…

15
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,840
Or rather, I know I should tell them soon.

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,909
I'll tell them myself.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,445
As you wish.

18
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,383
Good morning.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,585
Today is for incombustible trash.

20
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,187
You made a mistake the other day.

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,122
Sorry about that.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,038
Good morning.

23
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,474
Good morning.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,554
Morning.

25
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,557
Man!

26
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,260
It feels great to release it all
early in the morning!

27
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,695
Good morning.

28
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,330
Good morning.

29
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,401
Kakeru. Remember I told you
to stop doing this?

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,138
Seriously, stop nagging at everything!

31
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,212
-Here you go.
-Right…

32
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,547
Oh, thanks.

33
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,787
Why are you admiring her?

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,689
Stupid! What are you saying?

35
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,625
I told you not to hit my head!

36
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,692
Hey, good morning.

37
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,828
-Morning.
-Morning.

38
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,862
Look, Daddy!

39
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,097
-What is it?
-Kii!

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm going to put all my treasures here,

41
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,636
together with the stones I gave Mom.

42
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,671
There's the photo that Yui took,

43
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,140
and the card that Kaito wrote.

44
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,310
Also, the origami that I made with Mom!

45
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,985
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes?

46
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,490
Why was Mom at the river that day?

47
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,027
She always told us not to go there

48
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,896
since the river current is fast
and it's dangerous.

49
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,365
Besides, Mom never knew how to swim.

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,201
Right…

51
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,303
You're right.

52
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,538
That does seem strange.

53
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,078
Breakfast is ready.

54
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,284
Oh, wow.

55
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,888
-It looks like hotel breakfast.
<i>-Here is today's news.</i>

56
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,789
I'm digging in.

57
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,359
<i>Yesterday, an elementary student
committed suicide due to bullying.</i>

58
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,194
<i>The school acknowledged</i>

59
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:52,699
<i>-the bullying case, and apologized.</i>
-Kaito. You're not being bullied, are you?

60
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,634
Of course not.

61
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>It is also said that the bullies
threw his bag around.</i>

62
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,239
Everyone, listen to me.

63
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,007
What's bullying, Daddy?

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,644
Oh, it means…

65
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,912
How should I explain it?

66
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,813
Yui.

67
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,415
Stop throwing these questions at me!

68
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,420
Listen.

69
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,089
Bullying means

70
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,626
you play pranks on your friends
and make them cry.

71
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,227
Why would you do that?

72
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,329
What? That's, well…

73
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,866
Mita! Why do people bully others?

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,068
That is because…

75
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,504
humans are weak creatures.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,976
If someone is weaker than them,
they beat that person down.

77
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,546
And if someone is stronger than them,
they get scared and run off.

78
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,149
That is the true nature of humans.

79
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,385
Mita.

80
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,720
You didn't have to say it that way.

81
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,761
If there is nothing else,
I will take the trash out now.

82
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,798
Oh, sure. Thanks.

83
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,675
Hey.

84
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,978
Don't you think that lady is really weird?

85
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,815
She doesn't smile at all,
and I don't even know what she's thinking.

86
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,650
When she looks at me with those eyes,

87
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,020
it feels like she can see
what I'm thinking.

88
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,557
Why is she a housekeeper
in the first place?

89
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,826
Is she not married? Does she have no kids?

90
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,595
Hey, Dad. Do you know anything about her?

91
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,032
Not really.

92
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,901
But…

93
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,638
The housekeeping agency told me something.

94
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,906
What is it?

95
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,344
She said that Mita will do
anything we ask,

96
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,546
so we should be careful about that.

97
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,115
What? What does that mean?

98
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,685
So in an extreme case…

99
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,189
If you ask her to kill someone,

100
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,224
she will do it.

101
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,593
No way…

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,862
She's really bad news!

103
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,565
She also burned Mom's belongings
the other day, too.

104
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,972
Hey. Don't you think
we should know more about her, Dad?

105
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,775
What? Right…

106
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,210
You're right.

107
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, wow!

108
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,346
This is good! So good!

109
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,183
-Give me yours.
-Will you do everything we ask, Mita?

110
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,819
If it is something within my means.

111
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:31,090
Then, could you juggle beanbags?

112
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,425
As you wish.

113
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,936
-You're awesome, Mita!
-Oh, wow!

114
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,505
Oh, wow…

115
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,950
YOKOHAMA MUNICIPALITY
FUJIGAOKA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

116
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,252
You stink!

117
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,954
You're so smelly!

118
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,792
Why were you even born in the first place?

119
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,593
Come on, tell us!

120
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,633
-Hey!
-Just tell us already!

121
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,809
Why do you look so upset?

122
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,513
I'm counting on you again today,
Class President.

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,649
What? What do you mean?

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,221
I mean the test, of course. Make sure
to give me all the correct answers again.

125
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,560
But it will be bad
if the teachers find out.

126
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,628
I think we should stop that today…

127
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,933
Don't worry about it.
Our teacher is slow to notice it.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,043
We'll begin the test now.

129
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,178
Put away everything that's on your desk.

130
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,294
Kai!

131
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,667
I went grocery shopping with Mita.

132
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,269
Is that so?

133
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,670
Welcome back.

134
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,672
Thanks.

135
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,140
Let's go!

136
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,613
<i>After climbing up this slope</i>

137
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,149
<i>There's a tree to the right</i>

138
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,518
Sing with me, Mita.

139
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,219
Mom always sings this song for me

140
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,255
when we walk up this slope.

141
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,523
<i>After climbing up</i>

142
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,424
After climbing up.

143
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,026
<i>This slope</i>

144
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,861
This slope.

145
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,763
<i>There's a tree</i>

146
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,331
There's a tree.

147
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,166
<i>To the right</i>

148
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,035
To the right.

149
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,303
Kai!

150
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,907
-Mita really can do everything.
-What?

151
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,042
When she was paying at the cashier,

152
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,679
she already knew how much the total was
before the cashier told her.

153
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:11,017
She also remembered
all my friends' names at the school!

154
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,184
Really?

155
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,087
Her lunchboxes taste really good, too.

156
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,257
Why don't you ask her if you need help?

157
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,259
What?

158
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,727
Oh, okay.

159
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,364
Mita. Do you know
all the characters in Anpanman?

160
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,666
I do.

161
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,870
Anpanman, Baikinman, Melonpanna, Rollpanna

162
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:35,207
Creampanda, Tendonman, Katsudonman,
Kamameshidon,

163
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,410
-Omusubiman…
-You can stop now, Mita.

164
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,152
What's wrong?

165
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,058
Oh, sorry. And I even asked you
to accompany me.

166
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,328
Why did you want to come here?

167
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,497
This was where…

168
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,366
my mother drowned.

169
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:07,807
I thought that I may find out something
if I came here.

170
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:13,379
For example,
how she was feeling back then.

171
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,161
-Hey!
-Hey!

172
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,466
Oh, my! Yui! What a coincidence!
What are you doing out here?

173
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,069
You say that, but I'm sure
you followed me from school!

174
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,337
Sorry about the other day.

175
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,140
I messed up Kii's birthday party.

176
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,341
Don't worry about it.

177
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,909
Help me apologize to them, too.

178
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,446
You know that things always get messy
when I'm around.

179
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,450
I won't ever go to your house again.

180
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,486
See you.

181
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,057
It's fine if you just visit us
occasionally.

182
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,525
Really? I can go your house?

183
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,559
Just occasionally!

184
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,295
Thank goodness! I found a place
that sells good meat buns.

185
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,032
So I'll buy some for everyone next time!
See you!

186
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,869
Ozawa, I won't let you off if you do
weird things to my cute niece! Bye!

187
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,783
Kazama.

188
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,220
I would like to ask something
about the accounts.

189
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,655
Do you have time?

190
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,894
What is it?

191
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,199
Please, could we have another proper talk?

192
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,369
Haven't we talked enough already?

193
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,272
I told you that our only choice
is to break up.

194
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,810
So you don't like me at all?

195
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,079
That's not it.

196
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,516
Your wife…

197
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,986
She passed away the day
you submitted the divorce papers.

198
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,025
You can't leave your kids, too, right?

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,695
I'm really sorry,

200
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,100
but there's no way I can be
a mother to four children.

201
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,970
I understand. But I still like you, Mie--

202
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,371
Stop this already.

203
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,808
What will you do
if the company knows about this?

204
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,946
You're in charge
of an important project now, right?

205
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,250
Please excuse me.

206
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,919
Wait, I…

207
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,830
TO KEIICHI

208
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,407
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

209
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,133
Okay. Let's get back.

210
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,382
This is the Asuda residence.

211
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,386
Oh, hello, Mita?

212
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,390
I will be home late today,
so I'll have dinner outside.

213
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,559
Understood.

214
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,028
Excuse me,

215
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,198
but is there anything wrong
with the kids' behavior?

216
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,700
Not at all.

217
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,502
Would you like to talk to them?

218
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,337
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

219
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,774
Well, please apologize to the kids
on my behalf.

220
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,787
Mr. Asuda will be late tonight.

221
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,923
"Please apologize to the kids
on my behalf."

222
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,292
That was his message.

223
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,560
Got it.

224
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,366
Why are you staring at her?

225
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,168
Are you having dirty thoughts?

226
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,502
Stop that.

227
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,238
That's not it!

228
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,142
Anyway, have you guys realized?
The bathroom seems strange.

229
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,644
Strange?

230
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,980
I was the third one who used it today,

231
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,916
but it was sparkling clean
as if I was the first one to use it.

232
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,184
Now that you mention it…

233
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,052
It was clean when I entered, too.

234
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,889
Then, when did Mita clean it?

235
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,391
Mita can do everything.

236
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,332
Will she really do anything…

237
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,401
if we ask her to?

238
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,007
Pretty sure you're having dirty thoughts
right now.

239
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,508
Shut up!

240
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,911
I told you not to hit my head!

241
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,717
This is the Asuda residence.

242
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,555
You have a call from your friend, Kaito.

243
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,957
What?

244
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,025
Who is it?

245
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,227
He called himself Furuta.

246
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,295
What?

247
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,031
Tell him I'm not around.

248
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,169
"Tell him I'm not around."
That's his message for you.

249
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,939
Hey! Stop that!

250
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,676
Hello?

251
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,246
Thanks for the help during the test today,
Class President!

252
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,850
Don't mention it… I guess.

253
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,486
Why don't you come get an air gun
with us tomorrow?

254
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,325
But I don't have money.

255
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,995
Don't worry. Just go without paying.

256
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,665
Are you telling me to shoplift?

257
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,702
<i>It's harder to get caught
when there are more people around.</i>

258
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,305
But I have cram school.

259
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,543
You know what's going to happen
if you run away, right?

260
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,647
Kaito?

261
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,948
What's wrong?

262
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,451
Nothing.

263
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,288
"Choco, Apple, Lemon,

264
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,990
and Mochi."

265
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,693
"The four birds grew up
gradually and happily."

266
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,587
Come in.

267
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,791
It is almost time for me to leave.

268
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,093
Is there anything else for me to do?

269
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,395
Oh, nothing.

270
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,031
I don't need anything, too.

271
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,866
Please excuse me.

272
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,209
Mita.

273
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,546
Yes?

274
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,481
Well…

275
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,586
Will you really do anything I ask?

276
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,089
If it is something within my means.

277
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,692
Actually…

278
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,965
It's about that Furuta who called.

279
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,435
He always bullies the kids in my class.

280
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,570
Everyone is really bothered by him.

281
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,505
He even asked me to cheat on a test.

282
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,109
Just now, he even asked me
to go shoplifting.

283
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,678
If the school knows about this,

284
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,713
I won't be able to attend
a private school.

285
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,850
That guy will never admit he's wrong.

286
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,185
So…

287
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,352
So?

288
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,122
Could you

289
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,859
punish him for me tomorrow?

290
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,230
I learned this in cram school.

291
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,100
"To rake someone over the coals."
That's what this is, right?

292
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,734
Something like that.

293
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,938
As you wish.

294
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,316
Hey, what should we do?

295
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,684
What about this?

296
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,586
-This one?
-Okay.

297
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,464
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

298
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,701
Can I take a look at the model
on that shelf?

299
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,436
Oh, that ship model?

300
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,804
Give me a moment.

301
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,848
Who are you, lady?

302
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,850
I'm Mita, a housekeeper.

303
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,187
What does a housekeeper want with us?

304
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,159
What the hell was that?

305
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,662
That hurt…

306
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,665
Hey!

307
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,200
What are you doing to a child?

308
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,368
Let go!

309
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,836
I said let go!

310
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,937
Don't do this!

311
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,109
What?

312
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,581
Why did you do that, Mita?

313
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,250
Kaito said that Furuta, his classmate,

314
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,187
always bullies the kids in class
and they are bothered by him.

315
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,591
He also threatened him
to cheat in class and shoplift.

316
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,060
If this continues,
he will never learn his mistakes.

317
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,397
So he requested me
to "rake him over the coals."

318
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,834
Did you really ask her to do that, Kaito?

319
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,472
I never thought she would really do it.

320
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,540
Besides,

321
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,977
it's true that everyone is bothered
because of him.

322
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,079
Listen up.

323
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,181
I asked Furuta as well as the other kids,

324
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,383
but they said it wasn't true.

325
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,384
On top of that,

326
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,454
they said there's no way
they would ask him to cheat or shoplift.

327
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,557
Of course, they would say that!

328
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,993
Personally,

329
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,430
I am positive that there is no bullying
occurring in the class.

330
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,166
You're just pretending
that it doesn't exist.

331
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,169
If you really don't know it,
you're just plain stupid.

332
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,505
Kaito. What do you mean by that?

333
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,907
No, I…

334
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,508
I'm really sorry.

335
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,677
I'll give him a good scolding
when we get home.

336
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
I'm truly sorry for the trouble.

337
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,649
You should apologize, too, Kaito.
Stand up.

338
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,196
I heard about it.

339
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,767
First, your youngest daughter
inflicted violence on my Tsubasa.

340
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,938
Now, your son ordered your housekeeper
to punish a classmate.

341
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,541
Just what's wrong with your children?

342
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,643
Right…

343
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,279
I'm really sorry.

344
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,114
Your housekeeper is unbelievable, too.

345
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,715
As long as she's ordered,

346
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,084
she would set a fire
and even abuse children.

347
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,489
Knowing a scary person like her
lives right next to me

348
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,324
makes it hard for me to sleep at night.

349
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,393
You should fire her immediately.
Hear that?

350
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,896
That's why households with no mothers
are so problematic!

351
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,768
Mr. Asuda.

352
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,769
Yes?

353
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,737
What is it?

354
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,607
Should I go ahead and prepare dinner?

355
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,443
Oh, yes.

356
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,049
That hurt!

357
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,251
Hey! I told you to stop hitting my head!

358
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,752
You're the worst!

359
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,255
Why would you ask someone else
to punish a classmate?

360
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
You're a man!

361
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,225
I understand how you feel, Kaito.

362
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,029
But I think you should apologize
to your teacher and classmate for now.

363
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,265
Why do I have to do that?

364
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,167
Hey.

365
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,668
What's up with that attitude?

366
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,470
Why don't we give it a rest?

367
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,472
Kaito knows he's wrong, too.

368
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,940
Right, Kaito?

369
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,977
I will get the door.

370
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,917
Anyway,

371
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,286
why am I in the wrong?

372
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,055
Furuta and Mita were the ones
in the wrong.

373
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,957
Why would she listen to my order?

374
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,992
You don't usually just beat up a kid!

375
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,061
You're right, too.

376
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,930
She does seem a little strange.

377
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,299
Is she really fine, Dad?

378
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,300
What?

379
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,103
Hey. It will be bad
if worse things happen.

380
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,572
So why don't we replace the housekeeper?

381
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,773
What?

382
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,109
Well…

383
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,510
I guess you're right.

384
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,711
No!

385
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,247
I want Mita!

386
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,415
I see…

387
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,184
Hey, Keiichi! I heard about Kaito
from the lady next door.

388
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,086
Seems like something bad happened to him!

389
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,389
Oh, Urara. Why are you here today?

390
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,290
Right. I bought some good meat buns.

391
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,359
But I was careless
and I slipped on a puddle.

392
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,828
On top of that,
a bicycle passed by and ran over it.

393
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,597
Anyway, are you all right, Kaito?

394
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,032
You should reflect on your mistakes.

395
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,136
But I think the one
who started the bullying is in the wrong.

396
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,105
Besides, why didn't you
talk to me about it in the first place?

397
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,274
Could you leave me alone?
You're bothering me.

398
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,609
Hey, Kaito.

399
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,043
You shouldn't say that!

400
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,412
It's fine, Keiichi.

401
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,413
Anyway,

402
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,114
just leave Kaito to me.

403
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,618
-I'll do something about it!
-Wait, Urara! That's…

404
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,654
Don't worry! I'm a teacher,
so I'm used to situations like this.

405
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,357
Also, I caused some trouble
to everyone the other day.

406
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,226
So you could consider this
a way for me to make up for that.

407
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,494
-Well then!
-Wait, Urara!

408
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,765
What are you planning to do this time?

409
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,769
Jeez! Why does she always come
at times like these?

410
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,039
It's going to get even more complicated
now that Urara is involved.

411
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,809
Dinner is ready.

412
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,616
That must have been tough for you.

413
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,885
Oh, right.

414
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,455
I have some good <i>monaka</i> here.

415
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,490
They make really good <i>monaka</i>, so have one.

416
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,424
Thank you.

417
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,994
So about Mita…

418
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:28,033
She did a really good job
with the household chores,

419
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,802
but my neighbor is concerned about her.

420
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,637
Is it possible to replace her?

421
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,073
I understand. Please give me a moment.

422
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,642
Let's take a look…

423
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,077
Wait.

424
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,379
Don't you have work today, Mr. Asuda?

425
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:45,250
Oh, I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.
I work in the architectural industry.

426
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,318
No way!

427
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,353
That's the first time I've heard of it.

428
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,756
Do you work on the weekends?

429
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,093
So you have probably

430
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,630
never taken your kids out
to play, have you?

431
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,698
Yes.

432
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,902
My wife often complained about that, too.

433
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,374
Here you go.

434
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,042
Is this person fine?

435
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,811
I see…

436
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,146
She's a little old,

437
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,383
but she's extremely experienced.

438
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,318
-I would recommend her.
-I see.

439
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,486
Okay, that's fine.

440
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,822
I see. Then, I'll tell her to go tomorrow.

441
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,057
Thank you so much.

442
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,792
-Well then, please excuse me.
-Sure.

443
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,501
Excuse me, about Mita…

444
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,903
Don't worry.

445
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,972
I'll explain the situation to her.

446
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,675
No, actually…

447
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,444
May I know what kind of person she is?

448
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,512
Excuse me?

449
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,016
The thing is, my children
are quite interested in her.

450
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,450
She has never smiled,

451
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,121
so they wondered
what could have happened to her.

452
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,089
I'm sorry.

453
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,794
I can't tell you that,
since it's a little…

454
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,296
You mean, it's confidential?

455
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,598
-Right! That's it.
-Yes.

456
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,900
-I see.
-Yes.

457
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,503
But…

458
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,706
That girl…

459
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,209
It's not that she doesn't smile.

460
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,312
She can't smile.

461
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,917
She decided that she cannot smile.

462
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,221
What do you mean by that?

463
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,324
Oh, my!

464
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,927
I said something unnecessary again.
Me and my mouth.

465
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,798
-I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.
-Oh, okay.

466
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,066
Huh?

467
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,870
Hello?

468
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,807
Mr. Asuda, would you
please stop it already?

469
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,808
<i>What?</i>

470
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,142
<i>What do you mean?</i>

471
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,477
<i>This is serious.</i>

472
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,579
<i>Kaito's aunt came to school today.</i>

473
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,480
What?

474
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,414
Urara?

475
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,516
Attention, everyone!

476
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,853
-Sorry everyone.
-Who are you?

477
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,356
-I'll be done. Could you cooperate?
-What's going on?

478
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,493
It's true that Kaito
is in the wrong this time.

479
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,962
But I understand his feelings

480
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,865
since I'm his aunt!

481
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:18,069
Kaito wanted the bullies to stop!

482
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,741
You guys feel uncomfortable
when someone is being bullied too, right?

483
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,509
You're all in the same class,

484
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,045
and you're going to graduate
in just six months!

485
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,448
Let's all get along
and make good memories together!

486
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,117
Are you our classmate?

487
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,285
I mean, when there's bullying in a class,

488
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,222
everyone stops smiling.

489
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,425
Don't you feel sad?
Don't you think it's such a shame?

490
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,261
If there's bullying in class,

491
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,664
could you tell
your homeroom teacher about it?

492
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,734
If everyone musters their courage
and cooperate,

493
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,103
I'm sure that the bullying will stop!

494
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,840
I want everyone to like each other,

495
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,308
not hate each other.

496
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,312
No more anger and crying.
I want everyone to always smile!

497
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:05,216
Asuda. First was your housekeeper,
and now your aunt?

498
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,486
-You're the worst.
-No, you guys got it wrong.

499
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,855
What's your deal, old hag?

500
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,659
There's no bullying in this class
in the first place.

501
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,662
Right, everyone?

502
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,435
-Go home!
-Go home!

503
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,704
-Go home!
-Go home!

504
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,906
-Go home!
-Go home!

505
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,409
-Go home!
-Go home!

506
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,144
-Go home!
-Hold on, everyone.

507
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,112
-Go home!
-Go home!

508
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,581
-Go home!
-Hold on, everyone.

509
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,650
Where are you going, Kaito?

510
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,552
Wait for me!

511
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:52,530
YOU'RE GROSS
DIE, PRETENTIOUS MORON!

512
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,104
Kaito! Where's Urara?

513
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,305
Kaito!

514
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,420
Come on out, Kai!

515
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,324
I know that what Urara did
might have backfired,

516
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,526
and it was probably embarrassing.

517
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,661
But she was concerned about you.

518
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,929
It's my fault, too.

519
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,099
Urara looked really down the other day,

520
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,068
so I said it's fine to come visit us.

521
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,804
Anyway, you better stop this!

522
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,973
I can't get in the room now!

523
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,474
Hey!

524
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,009
Kaito!

525
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,845
Just open the door!

526
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,915
-I'm leaving.
-What? Where are you going?

527
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,818
Cram school, of course.

528
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,319
I won't go to school anymore.

529
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,555
-What?
-Since it's a public school,

530
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,924
I can graduate even if I miss school.

531
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,192
I can focus on the exams

532
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,361
if I study at cram school.

533
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,262
Hey!

534
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,197
Are you serious about that, Kaito?

535
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,366
I'm different from you, Kakeru.

536
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,434
I'm going to enter a private school,

537
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,970
and get into a university
that is as good as Dad's.

538
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:10,041
I can't be bothered
with all those stupid kids in class.

539
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,111
Hey, wait! What do you mean by that?

540
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,280
-Hey!
-Just forget it for today.

541
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,143
Today, we'll look at question four.

542
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,447
This problem involves finding speed.

543
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,015
It's from that person.

544
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,190
COME TO THE GYM WAREHOUSE AFTER THIS
RAT US OUT AND WE'LL KILL YOU

545
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,587
It was a short while,

546
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,056
but thank you for everything.

547
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,291
What?

548
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,694
Mr. Asuda has relieved me of my duties.

549
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,029
What?

550
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,297
You're quitting?

551
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,798
Yes.

552
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,800
Please excuse me.

553
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,783
Wait a minute!

554
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,723
I got into serious trouble because of you!

555
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,725
Take responsibility!

556
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,929
What would you like me to do?

557
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,865
That Furuta said

558
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,534
he's going to kill me,

559
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,070
and he's waiting for me in school.

560
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,974
Could you kill him for me?

561
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,210
Guys like him

562
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,680
only cause trouble for others
while they're alive.

563
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,081
It's obvious

564
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,684
that he'll commit crimes when he grows up!

565
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,855
Why are guys like him alive,
while Mom is dead?

566
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,891
Don't you think that's strange?

567
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,361
Guys like him should die
for the sake of this world!

568
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,867
As you wish.

569
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,114
No! Why did Mita leave?

570
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,350
Don't cry, Kii.

571
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,051
-No!
-Come on.

572
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,553
Welcome home.

573
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,557
What's wrong, Kii?

574
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,860
She's crying because Mita quit.

575
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,162
-I don't like this!
-Kii got really close to her.

576
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,700
Go wash your hands now.

577
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,103
Mita made this for us before she left.

578
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,439
Daddy! Get Mita back here!

579
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,441
We'll get a new housekeeper tomorrow--

580
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,144
No! I want Mita!

581
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,445
Stop crying.

582
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,249
Wow, it's so cool.

583
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,652
That guy is sure taking his time.

584
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,133
What the heck…

585
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,535
You again?

586
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,508
What's your deal?

587
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,246
I'm seriously going to kill you, too!

588
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,381
What…

589
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,217
What's wrong with you?

590
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,621
You creep me out! Don't come closer!

591
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:20,591
Stop coming closer to me!

592
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,793
Back off!

593
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,402
Stop it…

594
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,251
Stop!

595
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,291
I'm begging you.

596
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,859
Please stop!

597
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,866
What will you do if he really dies?

598
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,503
You might get a death sentence!

599
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,906
I don't really care.

600
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,676
Let's go.

601
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,912
Are you running away?

602
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,714
You coward!

603
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,853
You're the worst,

604
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,289
asking your housekeeper to help again…

605
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,661
You act like a good kid…

606
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,866
But what you're doing

607
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,368
is exactly the same as what we do!

608
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,106
No matter how much you try to run…

609
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,908
I'll definitely kill you!

610
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,450
What should I do?

611
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,822
That is…

612
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,927
something you should decide for yourself.

613
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,198
What will you do?

614
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,335
You weakling!

615
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,107
Have you ever been hit by someone, Mita?

616
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,342
Yes.

617
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,378
Did it hurt?

618
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,846
It hurt.

619
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,015
But…

620
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,451
Is it better than…

621
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,887
just running away?

622
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:39,931
What?

623
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,170
Just what can you do?

624
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,714
What's your deal?

625
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,689
Why do you bully the other kids?

626
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,425
Why do you hurt our classmates?

627
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,098
What will you do if that person dies?

628
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,833
No matter how sorry you are,

629
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,002
you can never see them again!

630
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,975
No matter how much you regret it,

631
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,210
you can never make up for your sins!

632
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,484
It's a really big deal when someone dies!

633
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,221
You get so sad, so hurt, and so angry…

634
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:43,060
That disgusting feeling
will stay with you forever!

635
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,329
Do you even understand it?

636
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:56,040
Do you understand that?

637
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,054
What's wrong with you guys?

638
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,845
I'm the worst.

639
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,820
Personally…

640
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,961
I believe you did great.

641
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,757
I understand.

642
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,326
Thank you so much.

643
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,367
Well then, please excuse me.

644
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,616
Dad.

645
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,657
Please don't let Mita quit.

646
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,097
The one at fault…

647
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,832
is me.

648
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,367
It's all my fault.

649
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,006
Daddy.

650
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,309
I'm asking you this, too.

651
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,245
Well…

652
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,425
What? Mita?

653
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,929
You have a visitor.

654
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,931
What?

655
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,133
What? Father-in-law?

656
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:37,902
I heard about it.

657
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,304
That housekeeper…

658
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,540
She inflicted violence on children!

659
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,875
-Stop it, Dad!
-You keep quiet!

660
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,580
How dare you sneak into someone's school
and embarrass yourself!

661
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,248
Aren't you ashamed as an educator?

662
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,418
I told you that I'm reflecting!

663
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,020
Hey.

664
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,721
Why is Kaito injured now?

665
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,591
Did you do this, too?

666
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,294
Oh, you got it wrong, Father-in-law.

667
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,031
Are you aware

668
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,233
of your responsibilities as a father?

669
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,771
Why did you let a woman like her
into the house?

670
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,639
Nagiko is already gone.

671
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,676
Are you going to turn this house
into a complete mess?

672
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,912
Fire that housekeeper now!

673
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,726
I will not let Mita quit.

674
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,529
What?

675
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,271
If anything happens to this family,

676
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,674
I will take full responsibility
as the father.

677
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,912
Grandpa.

678
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,715
It's sleep time for Kii already.

679
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,086
I'm sorry, everyone.
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

680
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,055
I can tell.

681
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,026
You have no right to be their father!

682
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,398
I will expose your true nature.

683
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,169
Just give it a break already, Dad!

684
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,638
Come on, let's go!

685
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,118
<i>The time is almost 7:45 a.m.</i>

686
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,853
Oh, no!

687
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,454
I'm leaving!

688
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,923
Me, too!

689
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,759
-I'm leaving!
-Have a safe trip.

690
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:42,993
Have a safe trip!

691
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,637
I'm leaving.

692
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,309
Okay.

693
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,658
Have a safe trip.

694
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,643
I'm leaving.

695
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,755
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

696
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:45,823
DIVORCE REGISTRATION

697
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,468
Mr. Asuda. You should leave for work soon.

698
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,537
Oh, okay.

699
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:03,774
Mita!

700
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,581
I have a favor to ask.

701
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,250
What is it?

702
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,354
This letter…

703
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,357
Could you burn it?

704
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,503
You may think I'm a coward…

705
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,005
But I've decided

706
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,308
that I won't talk about
what happened to my wife to the kids.

707
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,115
When I think about how shocked
they would be

708
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,118
when they find out
their mother committed suicide,

709
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,487
I think keeping it a secret

710
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,457
would be better for them.

711
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:58,762
I understand.

712
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,680
Stop!

713
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,918
Yui?

714
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,253
What did you just say, Dad?

715
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,791
You… Why are you here?

716
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,094
What did you say?

717
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,701
You chose your mistress over us!

718
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,670
What do you think we should do?

719
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,473
I do not have the right to comment
on other people's lives.

720
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,642
-Could you expose everything he did?
-As you wish.

721
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,345
Keiichi Asuda is having an affair
since last year…

722
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,881
-Stop it, Mita!
-Because of that…

723
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,817
<i>She went through a lot of things
when she was younger.</i>

724
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,652
Could you bathe with me today?

725
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,054
As you wish.

726
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,524
Shut up!

727
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,593
Don't hit Daddy!

728
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,827
Mita…

729
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,362
Help me.

730
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:11,869
