1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,502
Mita!

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,473
I have a favor to ask.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,075
What is it?

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,711
This letter…

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,246
Could you burn it?

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,454
DIVORCE REGISTRATION

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,789
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,397
Oh, no. I forgot my phone!

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,835
You may think I'm a coward…

10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,504
But I've decided

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,340
that I won't talk about
what happened to my wife to the kids.

12
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,310
When I think about how shocked
they would be

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,347
when they find out
their mother committed suicide,

14
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,516
I think keeping it a secret

15
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,318
would be better for them.

16
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,355
I understand.

17
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,430
Stop!

18
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,166
Yui?

19
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,542
What did you just say, Dad?

20
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,412
-Aren't you supposed to be at school?
-Who cares about that now?

21
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,885
What is this?

22
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,656
What is going on?

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,660
Say something, Dad!

24
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,533
Mr. Asuda.

25
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,169
What? Oh, yes?

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,371
If there is nothing else,

27
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,440
I would like to continue with my work.

28
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,442
Right…

29
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,178
Yes, please.

30
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,391
It was about a year ago.

31
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,128
I found someone I love.

32
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,965
Who is that person?

33
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,401
It's my subordinate at the company.

34
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,873
I just couldn't live without her.

35
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,511
So I asked your mother
if we can have a divorce.

36
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,813
Then,

37
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,749
she left this letter in my bag
the next day.

38
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,285
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,787
Then…

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,994
Did Mom commit suicide
because of you, Dad?

41
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,366
You even tried to abandon us.

42
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,768
-You call yourself a father?
-You've got it wrong…

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,006
I intended to fork out the alimony
and pay for all your school expenses.

44
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,110
-But you chose your mistress over us!
-That's not what I…

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,212
You killed Mom!

46
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,182
Yet you continued living with us
as if nothing is wrong!

47
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,652
If this wasn't exposed,
you planned to hide it forever!

48
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,221
No, that's because I was thinking of you…

49
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,589
I…

50
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,624
Mom used to tell me…

51
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,194
"Your father must be having an affair."

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,063
"He's pretentious and he acts cold to me."

53
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,033
But I always tried

54
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,303
to believe otherwise.

55
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,407
But now…

56
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,977
I will never believe you again!

57
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,046
Please, Yui!

58
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,851
Could you not let Kakeru and the others
know about this?

59
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,022
They are still young.

60
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,758
If Kii finds out that her mom
committed suicide…

61
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,360
I don't know what she will do.

62
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,695
Do me this favor, okay?

63
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,234
Dad…

64
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,637
You're dirty.

65
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,573
You're dirty…

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,041
You should be ashamed!

67
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,983
Have a safe trip.

68
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,554
Mita.

69
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,025
How could you burn something
this important as if you didn't care?

70
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,563
It's because I'm a housekeeper.

71
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,601
It is my job to do

72
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,937
what my master instructs me to.

73
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,949
EISEI ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL

74
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:01,801
It's rare to see you late, Asuda.

75
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,469
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,772
Did something happen?

77
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,343
She probably stayed overnight somewhere.

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,047
She's flirting with one of our seniors
recently, too.

79
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,987
What the hell are you doing?

80
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,122
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,258
Stop it right now!

82
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,028
I understand that you must be suffering

83
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,630
because your mother just died.

84
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,066
But you have to get yourself
together soon!

85
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,201
You didn't do well
in your last test either.

86
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,404
I heard you're in a relationship
with Ozawa from Photography Club.

87
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,139
Is that true?

88
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,175
I hope you are not involved
in indecent acts

89
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,644
-unbefitting of a high school student--
-We're not!

90
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,012
Excuse me!

91
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,648
Ms. Amano. I'll talk to Yui…

92
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,551
I mean, I'll talk to Asuda about this.

93
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,019
Could you forgive her?

94
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,787
Please!

95
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,964
CONTACTS

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,065
YUI

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,518
Chief.

98
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,987
We decided that

99
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,457
this will be our slogan.

100
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,892
CREATING A TOWN
TO PROTECT YOUR BELOVED FAMILY

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,895
Oh, this one looks good.

102
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,096
All right.

103
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,032
Let's do our best
for tomorrow's presentation.

104
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,934
-Shall we have a drink tonight?
-Oh, wow!

105
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,969
My treat, of course.

106
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,905
-Oh, wow!
-Thank you for your treat, Chief.

107
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,940
I'll go make a phone call first.

108
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,311
<i>This is the Asuda residence.</i>

109
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,514
Mita?

110
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,549
It's me.

111
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,617
Excuse me,

112
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,485
but how are the kids?

113
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,489
Kakeru is on his 13th consecutive loss
playing basketball against the TV.

114
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,293
Kaito is taking a nap after struggling
to solve a math question from cram school.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,796
Kii is folding origami as she is unable

116
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,898
to get her brothers to play with her.

117
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:12,932
I got it!

118
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,834
PANDA

119
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,403
Is that so?

120
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,372
Excuse me…

121
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,474
What about Yui?

122
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,043
<i>She is not home yet.</i>

123
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,648
So Kakeru and the others

124
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,917
are still not aware of that matter?

125
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,986
What are you referring to?

126
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,354
Right…

127
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,956
No, never mind.

128
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,126
Well, please let the kids know
that I will be home late tonight.

129
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,729
Understood.

130
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,797
Thanks.

131
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,137
Wow, it looks so good!

132
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,806
I really wanted to have a hamburger steak!

133
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,874
No way. Me, too.

134
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,842
Me, too!

135
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,544
How did you know we wanted
to eat hamburger steak

136
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,246
when you didn't even ask us?

137
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,749
That is my job as a housekeeper.

138
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,751
I'm digging in!

139
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,020
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

140
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,826
No way.

141
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,927
What's wrong?

142
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,529
-Let me try yours!
-Why should I?

143
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,597
Just let me try it!

144
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,466
So hot!

145
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,701
What's wrong with you?

146
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,837
My miso soup isn't hot at all!

147
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,738
What?

148
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,942
You're right.

149
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,444
No way!

150
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,613
You realized that I can't eat hot stuff?

151
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,349
That is my job as a housekeeper.

152
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,284
Mita can do everything.

153
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,652
Hey.

154
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,621
Can you fold a panda origami?

155
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,356
I can.

156
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,340
Wow, this is incredible!

157
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,276
Teach me how to do it!

158
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,810
As you wish.

159
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,845
Seconds, please!

160
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,913
Understood.

161
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,150
Hey.

162
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,921
You guys think she's married?

163
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,889
Why don't you ask if you're interested?

164
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,057
You do it!

165
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,259
Hey. Are you married, Mita?

166
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,861
Hey!

167
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,968
I apologize,

168
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,704
but I can't reveal
any personal information.

169
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,843
Oh, thank you.

170
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,514
-Kakeru.
-Yes?

171
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,450
Could you take off your shorts later?

172
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,451
What?

173
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,355
The button is about to come undone,
so I will sew it back up.

174
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,426
Oh, sorry about that.

175
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,261
Why are you getting embarrassed?

176
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,662
Shut up!

177
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,730
Mita.

178
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,532
Could you bathe with me today?

179
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,767
As you wish.

180
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,273
<i>-After climbing up</i>
-After climbing up.

181
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,109
<i>-This slope</i>
-This slope.

182
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,144
<i>There's a tree</i>

183
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,846
-There's a tree.
-What are you doing?

184
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,981
<i>To the right</i>

185
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,782
No, nothing.

186
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,119
We're supposed to ask that!
Why are you back so late?

187
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,823
Hey! Are you ignoring me?

188
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,259
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

189
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,163
Come in.

190
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,234
Welcome home.

191
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,235
Hey.

192
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,304
What will you have for dinner?

193
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,306
I'm fine, I had dinner already.

194
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:45,144
If that is the case,
I will leave once I put Kii to bed.

195
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,146
Excuse me.

196
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,781
Where's Dad?

197
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,183
He will be home late.

198
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,118
I see.

199
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,124
Hey.

200
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,692
What do you think, Yui?

201
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,427
What? About what?

202
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,895
About Mita!

203
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,330
You think she's married?

204
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,465
You think she has children?

205
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,868
How should I know? Why are you asking?

206
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,238
I mean, we just can't tell
what's on her mind at all!

207
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,940
She does everything we ask
without any hesitation.

208
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,542
It's really odd!

209
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,810
The other day,

210
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,112
she told me that she doesn't care
if she dies.

211
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,548
I was planning to tail her

212
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,784
and check out where she lives.

213
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,453
Hey, what does "tail" mean?

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,488
I'll explain it to you later.

215
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,556
Sorry,

216
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,392
but I don't have time to play along
with this ridiculous plan.

217
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,560
Hey…

218
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,628
What's with that?

219
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,997
Will you guys leave already?
I'm going to change.

220
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,166
What's with that cold attitude?

221
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,368
Maybe she got dumped by her boyfriend.

222
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,870
Stop talking nonsense!

223
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,505
You guys don't even know anything.

224
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,740
What do you mean?

225
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,442
We don't know anything?

226
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,743
What's that?

227
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,279
That's…

228
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,218
I'm not a kid,

229
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,686
unlike you guys.

230
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,022
So I have a lot on my mind!

231
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,392
Just go sleep already. Hurry up.

232
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,735
"Thank you very much."

233
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,189
Dad is still not back yet?

234
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,657
Yes.

235
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,332
Could you please give this to Mr. Asuda?

236
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,270
It's the invoice
for today's overtime hours.

237
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,906
Oh, okay.

238
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,241
Please excuse me.

239
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,545
Don't you think that…

240
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,847
Dad is cruel, Mita?

241
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,986
You may be a housekeeper,

242
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,587
but you're human.

243
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,491
You should have your own opinion, right?

244
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:20,166
I do not have the right to comment
on other people's lives.

245
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,136
Fine.

246
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,473
Then I have a request for you,
as our housekeeper.

247
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,577
Could you go to Dad's company tomorrow,

248
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,147
and check out who Dad's mistress is?

249
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,118
That person
should take responsibility, too.

250
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,921
I want to know

251
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,789
how that person is feeling right now.

252
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,729
I'm sorry,
but I cannot accept that request.

253
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,331
What?

254
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,866
Why?

255
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,335
Don't you do everything we ask?

256
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,540
I am on leave tomorrow.

257
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,173
Good morning.

258
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,208
Oh, sorry.

259
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,710
Did I wake you up?

260
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,280
You don't need to go to school today,
so you can sleep in.

261
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,214
Daddy.

262
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,218
Why are you going to work
when it's a holiday?

263
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,453
Didn't I tell you?

264
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,190
I don't work on Tuesdays
and Wednesdays. Come on.

265
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,127
Oh… Good morning.

266
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,403
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

267
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,805
I'm hungry, Yui.

268
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,173
Is there anything to eat?

269
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,182
Scary.

270
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,920
She has been in a bad mood
since yesterday.

271
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,888
Do you know anything, Dad?

272
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:23,822
What?

273
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,498
Oh… I don't really know.

274
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,900
It feels

275
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,536
as if things were back to how it was
before Mita came.

276
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,040
You should have Mita make something
for us next time, Dad.

277
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,943
What? Oh, yes. You're right.

278
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,813
Right. Dad, do you know
anything about Mita?

279
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,881
What?

280
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,416
What do you mean?

281
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,750
Like her address,

282
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,152
or whether she's married.

283
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,287
Right…

284
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,256
They can't reveal her information.

285
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,925
-They have a duty of confidentiality.
-I see.

286
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,331
But the boss of the housekeeping agency
told me something.

287
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,902
It's not that she doesn't smile.

288
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,871
She just thinks that she can't smile.

289
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,340
What did she mean by that?

290
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,443
Could she have been involved in an affair?

291
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,112
And is that why she's so gloomy?

292
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,214
Daddy, what's an affair?

293
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,216
What?

294
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,886
Tsubasa who lives next door
told me about it.

295
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,855
He said,

296
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,324
"My dad is having an affair."

297
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,859
Kii.

298
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,894
An affair

299
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,397
is when a man with wife and kids
gets involved

300
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,366
in a relationship with another woman,

301
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,234
and betrays his family.

302
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,269
Really?

303
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,139
I feel so bad for Tsubasa.

304
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,609
I wonder what's going to happen
if the lady next door

305
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,745
dies from the shock.

306
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,214
You won't do that. Right, Daddy?

307
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,415
What?

308
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,485
Oh… Yes.

309
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,221
Oh, sorry.

310
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,922
I need to go to the bathroom.

311
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,890
What?

312
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,458
Hey, hold on!

313
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,895
I'm about to leak, too!
You're not doing the big one, are you?

314
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,348
MIE KAZAMA

315
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,085
SENDER: MIE KAZAMA

316
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,687
I'M FEELING SCARED ALL OF A SUDDEN
SINCE YOUR WIFE DIED

317
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,890
I LOVE YOU
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK UP

318
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,165
I have good <i>monaka</i> here. Want some?

319
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,234
Forget about that.
Will you tell us about Mita?

320
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,970
Please, anything will do.

321
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:56,575
You know, I can't say anything
because of that.

322
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,177
Duty of confidentiality?

323
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,479
Don't say that. Anything minor will do!

324
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,714
I really love Mita!

325
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,150
I love her, too!

326
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,152
Dad told us about it,

327
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,589
but does Mita really think
that she's not allowed to smile?

328
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,124
Well, you see…

329
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,893
She went through a lot.

330
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,128
What do you mean by that?

331
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,729
Actually…

332
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,664
No, I can't!

333
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,600
Could you guys stop
trying to make me talk?

334
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,270
I worked as a housekeeper before, too.

335
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,141
So it's in my nature to prattle on.

336
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,510
Don't say that!

337
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,212
We beg you!

338
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,415
Hey, could you stop it?

339
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,452
It has been a while since a young man
made moves on me.

340
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,288
My heart is beating so fast!

341
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,590
Please!

342
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,592
Why is Mita working as a housekeeper?

343
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,027
You can ask her that yourself!

344
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,430
She's about to come here soon.

345
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,867
She is really punctual,
so she'll be here right on time.

346
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,568
-Ten…
-What?

347
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,870
-Nine…
-Hurry up!

348
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,340
-Sorry, don't tell Mita we're here!
-We don't want her getting angry.

349
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,274
I know.

350
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,242
Five,

351
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,446
four, three, two, one.

352
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,684
Oh, my, Akari. What's the matter?

353
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,156
This is the referral commission
for this month.

354
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,057
Thank you as usual.

355
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,593
You always give me yours punctually.

356
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,295
Please excuse me.

357
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,297
Wait, why don't you have some <i>monaka</i>?

358
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,700
Isn't that your favorite? Here, have one.

359
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,903
No,

360
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,104
I'm fine.

361
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,773
Wait, Akari.

362
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,709
Do you have any issues

363
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,179
with the household
you're currently working in?

364
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,515
With the children, perhaps.

365
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,486
No,

366
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,954
not really.

367
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,663
Come on out now. She has left already.

368
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,231
Hurry and chase after her.

369
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,402
If you hurry, you might be able
to find out where she lives.

370
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,538
-Thank you so much!
-Don't mention it.

371
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,240
HARUMI HOUSEKEEPING AGENCY

372
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,509
All the best.

373
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,992
An amusement park?

374
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:27,926
Why?

375
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,102
Okay. Let's go!

376
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,971
-Did you bring any money?
-What?

377
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,305
I brought some!

378
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,849
Excuse me. I'm Kazama
from Accounting Department.

379
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,051
Your visitor is over there.

380
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:03,996
Hello,

381
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,064
I'm Kazama.

382
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,701
Could you be Chief's daughter?

383
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,371
Yes.

384
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,844
Do you need anything from me?

385
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,848
There's something I would like you to see.

386
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,726
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

387
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,664
What do you think of this?

388
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,701
Could you tell me…

389
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,170
how you're feeling now?

390
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,909
You should also take responsibility
for Mom's death!

391
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,912
Yui!

392
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,685
-Did you tell him I'm coming?
-I'm sorry.

393
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,921
What are you doing, Yui?

394
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,956
Let go! Don't touch me!

395
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,559
Anyway, let's go out and talk.

396
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,272
What are you doing? Let's go.

397
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,607
Welcome. Good afternoon!

398
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,644
CHILDREN STAR LAND

399
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,417
Thank you so much.

400
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,222
Is she planning to eat all that
by herself?

401
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,403
Hey…

402
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,639
What is Mita doing?

403
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,508
There are two cups of cola,

404
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,044
so maybe she's waiting for someone?

405
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,479
What?

406
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,948
So she has a boyfriend?

407
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,128
She didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,564
It's all my fault.

409
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,101
If you have something to say,

410
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,170
why don't you just tell me
about it directly?

411
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,345
It's fine if you don't want to talk to me.

412
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,649
If I get fired from the company,

413
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,519
I won't be able
to take care of all of you.

414
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,188
Do you understand that?

415
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,292
Just do whatever you like.

416
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,394
What?

417
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,463
That woman is probably

418
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,399
more important to you
compared to us, right?

419
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,702
No, I don't really…

420
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,404
Hey!

421
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,287
Just what is going on?

422
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,621
Anyway,

423
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,725
she hasn't even moved an inch
all this time.

424
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>We will be closing soon.</i>

425
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,566
She moved!

426
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,602
Wake up, Kakeru!

427
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,004
I'll do it.

428
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,873
Thank you.

429
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,180
Let's go, Kakeru! Hurry up!

430
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,023
She made a turn!

431
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,863
What?

432
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,641
-Daddy!
-Welcome home.

433
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,176
What's up? You're early today.

434
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,911
Oh, I guess.

435
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,412
Where have you guys been?

436
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,181
We were tailing Mita.

437
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,249
-What?
-Kii!

438
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,752
Well, the thing is we happened to see her.

439
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,854
But we lost her immediately,

440
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,856
so we couldn't find out about anything.

441
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,459
Anyway, where's Yui?

442
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,660
What?

443
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,732
Oh… It seems like she's not back yet.

444
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,035
-Did something happen between you and Yui?
-What?

445
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,540
-What makes you say that?
-Yui was acting strange this morning.

446
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,009
Nothing happened between us.

447
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,110
Forget that.

448
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,011
I ordered sushi,

449
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,345
so go and wash your hands.

450
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,381
-Looks so good!
-They look delicious!

451
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,118
-All right!
-Wait, I want to go first!

452
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,893
Hello? Is it Yui?

453
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,129
<i>Oh, sorry. It's me.</i>

454
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,898
Oh, Urara.

455
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,100
Did something happen to Yui?

456
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,168
What?

457
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,237
No, not really.

458
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,139
<i>Could you tell me if there's anything?</i>

459
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,808
Yui was acting strange in school
the other day, too.

460
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,911
<i>She was disrespectful towards her teacher.</i>

461
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,713
Is that so?

462
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,116
<i>Just let me know
if there's anything I can do!</i>

463
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,153
<i>I mean, things must be hard on you
ever since Nagiko has gone.</i>

464
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,355
Sorry, but there's really nothing wrong.

465
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,830
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

466
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,866
Don't scare me, Dad!

467
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,768
Why are you making a call secretly?

468
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,304
I wasn't being secretive!

469
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,674
Why do you keep poking your nose
into that family's business?

470
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,411
It's because we're relatives, of course!

471
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,980
Don't tell me…

472
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,984
You don't have any strange feelings
for that man, do you?

473
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,920
What kind of nonsense is that?

474
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,255
Give me a break already!

475
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,126
MOM: I'M SORRY, YUI.

476
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,996
This is the last text your mom sent you?

477
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,469
Until now…

478
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,139
I thought she was apologizing

479
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,776
<i>for the fight we had
the day before she died.</i>

480
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,816
I'M SORRY, YUI.

481
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,694
<i>Mom killed herself</i>

482
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,562
<i>after she sent me this text.</i>

483
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,501
If only

484
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,171
I had replied to her immediately…

485
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,877
Maybe Mom wouldn't have died.

486
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,248
Mom always called me "my daughter".

487
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,785
But this time,

488
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,653
she called me by my name.

489
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,458
I did think it was odd.

490
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,929
But because we just had a fight…

491
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,801
I was annoyed…

492
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,804
I…

493
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:54,899
<i>Asuda…</i>

494
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:00,038
Yui.

495
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,407
Thanks, Daddy!

496
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,115
Daddy.

497
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,883
Do you love me?

498
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,218
What?

499
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,820
Oh… Yes, of course.

500
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,456
I love you the most in the world, too!

501
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,103
Don't worry.

502
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,439
My parents aren't home today.

503
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,066
Hey!

504
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,469
Good morning.

505
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,506
Oh, good morning.

506
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:12,877
Mita.

507
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,512
Sorry, but…

508
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,749
Do you have some sort of hangover pills?

509
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,751
I do.

510
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,960
Mita.

511
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,028
Where's Yui?

512
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,635
Yui.

513
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:40,939
Yui!

514
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:43,975
Hey.

515
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,444
Where did you sleep yesterday?

516
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,687
My boyfriend's house.

517
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,189
What?

518
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,061
I'm just doing

519
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,364
what you always do with your mistress.

520
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,534
Hey.

521
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,669
What's with your attitude?

522
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,071
How about

523
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,939
you stop acting like a father now?

524
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,375
You planned on abandoning us.

525
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,010
-Stop that right--
-Just hit me.

526
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,446
Unlike you,

527
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,182
I did it with the person
I love the most in the world!

528
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,252
I won't love anyone else other than him!

529
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,288
I don't want to talk to anyone else
other than him.

530
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,892
I think it will be wonderful
if I can live with him forever!

531
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,076
What are you two doing?

532
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,050
Something really happened, right?

533
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,955
Dad has been drinking more

534
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,158
compared to usual, too.

535
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,595
Hey, Yui.

536
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,897
Ask that person.

537
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,303
No,

538
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,038
it's nothing.

539
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,107
Mita, I don't need breakfast today.

540
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:27,312
I have an important presentation
at the company, so I have to go early.

541
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,047
Understood.

542
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,894
Mr. Asuda.

543
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,138
Your necktie is crooked.

544
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,277
Thanks.

545
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,347
Have a safe trip.

546
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,049
Okay.

547
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,562
Mita.

548
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,032
I have a request.

549
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,334
What is it?

550
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,039
Could you go to that man's company

551
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,375
and expose everything he did?

552
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,313
I will never forgive him

553
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,583
for always trying to worm his way out.

554
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,890
As you wish.

555
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,594
TO KEIICHI

556
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,906
In times like this,

557
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,509
it is important to reconfirm
our familial bonds.

558
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,346
Thus, we decided on "Creating a town
to protect your beloved family"

559
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,082
as our slogan in promoting
our new town project.

560
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,318
I think this looks good.

561
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,654
Well done putting it together, Asuda.

562
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,655
Thank you.

563
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,990
Chief. A moment, please.

564
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,391
What is it?

565
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,926
Excuse me.

566
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,127
This is bad.

567
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,130
Someone is giving this out in the lobby.

568
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,802
<i>Keiichi Asuda from Business Department
is having an affair</i>

569
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:34,739
with Mie Kazama from Accounting Department
since last year.

570
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:39,043
Because of that, Nagiko,
Keiichi Asuda's wife, killed herself.

571
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,313
In addition, he lied to his kids
that their mother died in an accident.

572
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,949
Hey! What are you doing?

573
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,951
Please don't do this in the building!

574
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,097
Keiichi Asuda from Business Department
is having an affair

575
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:03,267
with Mie Kazama from Accounting Department
since last year.

576
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,636
Because of that, Nagiko,

577
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,206
-Keiichi Asuda's wife, killed herself.
-What's going on?

578
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,576
In addition, he lied to his kids
that their mother died in an accident.

579
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,444
Stop it, Mita!

580
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,850
Excuse me.

581
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,804
Okay, done.

582
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,643
Welcome home.

583
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,523
Thanks to you,
they took me off the project.

584
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,494
I might be transferred to the countryside.

585
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,964
What are you saying, Dad?

586
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,268
What did you do, Yui?

587
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,103
I only

588
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,007
told the people in the company about

589
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,875
this man's true nature.

590
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:18,876
What's that?

591
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,723
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

592
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,194
Mita.

593
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,831
Repeat what you said at the company today.

594
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,840
Keiichi Asuda from Business Department
is having an affair

595
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:54,345
with Mie Kazama from Accounting Department
since last year.

596
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:59,450
Because of that, Nagiko,
Keiichi Asuda's wife, killed herself.

597
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,821
In addition, he lied to his kids
that their mother died in an accident.

598
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,392
What?

599
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,662
What does that mean?

600
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,673
Is that true, Dad?

601
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,446
Answer me!

602
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,656
I'm sorry.

603
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,857
Then,

604
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,261
Mom's death wasn't an accident?

605
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,036
I'm sorry.

606
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,109
You didn't even let the police
see this letter?

607
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,748
If her death was ruled as an accident,

608
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,717
I thought it would be better for everyone.

609
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,055
If you all knew
your mother killed herself,

610
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,523
won't it be tough

611
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,091
to continue living?

612
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,559
Don't blame it on us!

613
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,627
She's right.

614
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,630
You're just trying to protect yourself.

615
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,871
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,607
Just stop apologizing to us already!

617
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,142
I…

618
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,915
I'm tired.

619
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,319
What are you saying?

620
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,187
Ever since your mother died…

621
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,124
I've tried my best to be
a good father to everyone.

622
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,860
But I can't do it anymore.

623
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,796
What are you saying?

624
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,265
It's just like your grandfather said.

625
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,868
-I don't have the right to be your father!
-What the hell are you saying?

626
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:02,006
I don't even have the confidence to say
I've loved your mother!

627
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,507
Shut up!

628
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,376
Stop, Kakeru!

629
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,179
Don't hit Daddy!

630
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,620
Then, what should I do?

631
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,956
You guys…

632
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,793
Are you guys going to forgive him?

633
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,502
Mita…

634
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,745
What do you think we should do?

635
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,219
That is…

636
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,196
something you should decide for yourself.

637
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,440
Everyone…

638
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,777
Let's go.

639
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,844
What?

640
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:18,315
There's nothing we can do
but leave this house.

641
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,755
But what about our belongings?

642
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,562
We can just get them sent to us later.

643
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,230
Come on, Kii. We're leaving.

644
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,099
Why?

645
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,235
You don't want to live with
a man like him, right?

646
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,671
I don't want to leave.

647
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,473
Daddy!

648
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,108
Kii.

649
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,844
That man is no longer our father.

650
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,312
No!

651
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,882
Mita…

652
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,485
Help me.

653
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,889
I cannot do it.

654
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,090
What?

655
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,259
I…

656
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,262
am not your family.

657
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,167
I don't want this!

658
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,906
-Kii. Let's go.
-No!

659
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,543
Hurry up, Kakeru and Kaito.

660
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,545
Let's go, Kii.

661
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,717
You're not even trying to stop us

662
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,719
at a time like this?

663
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,265
CREATING A TOWN
TO PROTECT YOUR BELOVED FAMILY

664
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,135
How dare you act like nothing is wrong
and create homes for others,

665
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,604
you pretentious bastard!

666
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,334
This is from Kii.

667
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:24,241
She has been trying her best to fold it
since yesterday,

668
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,778
saying that she will give it to you first
if she folds a good one.

669
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:46,564
DO YOU LIKE ME, DADDY?
I LOVE YOU, DADDY!

670
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,902
Truth be told…

671
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,206
I didn't want to get married.

672
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,846
But…

673
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,916
She was pregnant with Yui.

674
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,421
My wife threatened me

675
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,557
that if I tell her to have an abortion,

676
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,992
she'll kill herself.

677
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,397
I wasn't sure if I could be a father.

678
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,970
I thought that I might change
if I have my own child,

679
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,973
but nothing changed.

680
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,043
When I come home

681
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,312
and spend time with the kids,

682
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,383
I feel like they could see through
my true self.

683
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,385
It felt so hard to breathe.

684
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,125
I couldn't talk unless I forced myself to,

685
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,928
and the only places I felt at peace
were in the washroom

686
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,231
or in my car.

687
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,176
It's time for me to leave.

688
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,178
Please excuse me.

689
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,683
Wait. Just what's wrong with you?

690
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,020
You don't change your expression
no matter what.

691
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,255
You do everything we ask,

692
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,890
even if it's a ridiculous order.

693
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,561
Don't you have a heart?

694
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,402
I don't.

695
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,672
What?

696
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,744
I lost that somewhere.

697
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,902
You planned to destroy our family
in the first place?

698
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,437
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

699
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,940
I abducted Kii.

700
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,308
What?

701
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:47,611
<i>-Just what is that housekeeper thinking?
-I want to go home.</i>

702
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,513
<i>If you don't agree to my demands,</i>

703
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,014
Kii will die.

704
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,950
<i>Because of you, Kii is kidnapped!</i>

705
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,487
I will never forgive him!
I'll never acknowledge him as our father!

706
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:57,955
If you want her back,

707
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,124
you have to agree to my terms.

708
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,192
<i>Stop this nonsense. Where is Kii?</i>

709
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,260
-Kii!
-Kii!

710
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,969
