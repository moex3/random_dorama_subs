1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,109
You don't want to live with
a man like him, right?

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,012
-That man is no longer our father.
-You pretentious bastard!

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,980
This is from Kii.

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,619
Good morning.

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,424
You should prepare to leave for work soon.

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,430
Right.

7
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,734
I guess you couldn't care less
about what happened yesterday.

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,475
Mr. Asuda.

9
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,077
Yes?

10
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,014
Can I clean up that area over there?

11
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,017
CREATING A TOWN
TO PROTECT YOUR BELOVED FAMILY

12
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,789
Go ahead.

13
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:02,929
Wait…

14
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,717
You have a call from Ms. Urara.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,288
Hello?

16
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,422
<i>Keiichi?</i>

17
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,692
You weren't picking up your phone,
so I sent you a text.

18
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,594
Did you read it?

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,795
<i>What?</i>

20
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,966
URARA: YUI AND THE KIDS ARE WITH ME
DON'T WORRY

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,135
I see…

22
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,004
Just what happened?

23
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,740
I've never heard of you guys
quarreling before.

24
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,676
<i>I was shocked.</i>

25
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,345
You didn't hear anything from the kids?

26
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,281
They just said they didn't want
to be with you anymore.

27
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,749
<i>When I asked why,</i>

28
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,351
<i>they told me to ask you.</i>

29
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,254
Is everything all right, Keiichi?

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,589
I'm a teacher,

31
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,425
so you can rely on me at times like this.

32
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,796
No, it's nothing serious.

33
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,547
<i>Keiichi?</i>

34
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,416
What?

35
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,322
Urara…

36
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,760
Nagiko…

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,131
Your older sister…

38
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,036
She wasn't involved in an accident.

39
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,273
She committed suicide.

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,342
What?

41
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,344
I found someone I love,

42
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,147
and I asked her if we could get a divorce.

43
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,550
And the next day…

44
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,190
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,059
You don't have to apologize to me.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,728
Sorry, I…

47
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,966
I'm a little surprised right now, so…

48
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,569
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,837
For now,

50
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,106
I'll keep it a secret from Dad.

51
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
<i>He might end up killing you, Keiichi.</i>

52
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,713
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,183
Yui and the kids asked me
to bring their luggage over,

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,552
Can I drop by the house after work today?

55
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,955
Of course.

56
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,556
<i>See you later, then.</i>

57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,628
You surprised me, Dad! What is it?

58
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,363
What did he say?

59
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,934
Keiichi was really stressed with work.

60
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,537
Yui and the kids wouldn't listen to him,

61
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,272
so he got angry and shouted at them.

62
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,607
He told them to get out.

63
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,375
Is that really all?

64
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,277
That's right.

65
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,147
It's just the usual fight
between parent and children,

66
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,782
so don't do anything unnecessary.

67
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,256
This looks like a breakfast set
from some luxurious inn.

68
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,760
Thank you for the food.

69
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,671
To be honest,

70
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,675
I prefer having a Japanese breakfast.

71
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,646
But the kids prefer otherwise.

72
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,950
My late wife liked bread, too.

73
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,226
In usual cases,

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,497
the parent would have gone
to take back their children.

75
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,535
But…

76
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,872
I don't know what I should do.

77
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,510
No matter what I say,

78
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm not sure if they will forgive me.

79
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,654
I never wanted any children.

80
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,656
But I married anyway,

81
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,060
and got swept along this far.

82
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,799
"I will protect my children with my life."

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,168
"I love my children

84
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,005
from the bottom of my heart."

85
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,473
I just couldn't say it

86
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,710
like I mean it.

87
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,716
I'm sure

88
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,720
that I lack the parental love

89
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,256
normal people have
towards their own children.

90
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,434
I think you should hurry.

91
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,337
You will be late for work.

92
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,073
Hey…

93
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,943
Why don't you say

94
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,946
how you feel once in a while?

95
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,249
Yesterday, you said
you don't have a heart.

96
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,118
But I'm sure you're human, too!

97
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,255
In the first place,

98
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,425
things turned into this huge mess

99
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,428
because you do everything that we ask!

100
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,063
Wait.

101
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,198
Don't tell me that

102
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,102
you planned
to destroy our family in the first place?

103
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,303
Is that it?

104
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,808
What time will you return today?

105
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,444
What should I prepare for dinner?

106
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,547
Enough already!

107
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,016
The kids are not here.
You don't need to work anymore!

108
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,885
I'll contact the agency!

109
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,191
As you wish.

110
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,130
This is the spare key,

111
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,800
and the remaining grocery allowance.

112
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,136
Also, the invoice for my work so far.

113
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,974
Thanks.

114
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,014
Hey…

115
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,251
Mr. Asuda.

116
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,820
Yes?

117
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,290
It was short,

118
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,758
but thank you for everything.

119
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,306
Hey.

120
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,508
What should we do, Yui?

121
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,010
Are we going to stay with them
from now on?

122
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,779
I can't take it anymore.

123
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,548
Urara's cooking is bad,

124
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,617
and Grandpa is annoying.

125
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,487
I know, but still…

126
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,691
I… I want to go home.

127
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,728
I want to see Daddy!

128
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,731
Didn't I tell you?

129
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,768
That man tried to abandon us
to marry some other woman!

130
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,971
Mom died because of that!

131
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,576
I will never forgive him!

132
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,079
I'll never acknowledge him as our father!

133
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,749
Then are you going to sever
your relationship with Dad?

134
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,084
Of course!

135
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,721
Hey, what does it mean
to "sever your relationship"?

136
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,291
It means we will never meet
that man, ever, even if we die.

137
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,096
Then what about
our school and living expenses?

138
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,665
Are we going to ask Grandpa and Urara
to pay for us?

139
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,135
I still want to attend
a private school, you know.

140
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,337
That's…

141
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,542
Damn it, aren't you mad?

142
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,077
Your real father did something like that!

143
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,849
I'm just trying to work out
our practical problems.

144
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,185
I… I want to go home!

145
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,956
I want to go home!

146
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,091
Don't ask for the impossible, Kii.

147
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,061
Why don't you say something, Yui?

148
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,264
For now,

149
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,533
we have no choice
but to stay with Grandpa.

150
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:28,968
In the meantime,

151
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,138
all of us have to think about what to do.

152
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,608
We have the right to request
child support from that man.

153
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,243
For now? Until when?

154
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,178
We'll have to think about that, too.

155
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,648
Come on, Kii.
I'll take you to school today.

156
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,384
What about going home?
Will Mita come fetch me?

157
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,986
No.

158
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,957
Mita has nothing to do with us anymore.

159
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,925
Then I'll go home alone!

160
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,428
I can't allow that.

161
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,697
What if you get abducted?

162
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,398
What's abducted?

163
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,501
It means that a bad person
might take you to a strange place,

164
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,903
and kill you.

165
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,808
If that happens,
our family will be very sad.

166
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,577
<i>Due to some circumstances,</i>

167
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm no longer in charge of this project.

168
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,949
From now on,

169
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,118
do your best with Natori.

170
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,387
I will support everyone
behind the scenes, too.

171
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,588
It's a shame.

172
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,991
I'm so incompetent compared to you, Chief.

173
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,627
What are you saying? That's not true.

174
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,495
Well then.

175
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,299
That's the person Kazama is involved with?

176
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,203
He's the one having an affair with Kazama?

177
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,744
INCOMING CALL
MIE KAZAMA

178
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,915
Hello?

179
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,621
Is it true that they're transferring you
to the model house exhibition?

180
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,290
I caused such a huge commotion after all.

181
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,394
Keiichi Asuda has been having an affair
with Mie Kazama since last year.

182
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,696
Hey…

183
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,334
Could we meet after work today?

184
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,969
<i>What?</i>

185
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,105
Just a while will do.

186
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,373
I'm begging you.

187
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,875
I can't.

188
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,943
You're the only one I have now.

189
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,379
Don't leave me alone.

190
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,615
Even when I'm home,

191
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,917
I feel like
my wife's photo is condemning me.

192
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,654
I'm in a relationship with someone else.

193
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,523
What?

194
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,193
<i>So please forget about me.</i>

195
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,197
Wait a minute…

196
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,170
You left home? Then what will you do now?

197
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,640
None of us like staying
at our grandfather's house

198
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,509
and we can't survive
without our father's financial support.

199
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,113
But I will never forgive him.

200
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,085
Jeez…

201
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,089
Why do I have to deal with such things?

202
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,658
Cheer up!

203
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,993
I'll do anything I can to help.

204
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,763
Right. Why don't you stay over again?

205
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,133
Oh, I can't today.

206
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,135
I can't leave my siblings alone.

207
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,069
Right.

208
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,270
Yes.

209
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,775
Excuse me.

210
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,478
I received a university recommendation,

211
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,114
and my classmates
wouldn't stop bugging me about it.

212
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,181
Hello?

213
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,550
Come on, it's nothing.

214
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,886
Why don't you attend
my university next year?

215
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:38,157
MISAWA KINDERGARTEN

216
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,171
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kii. Let's go.

217
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,809
What's wrong?

218
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,812
I want to go home!

219
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,280
What?

220
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,349
I don't like Grandpa's house!

221
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,950
I want to go home!

222
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,685
Well…

223
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,890
But if you do that,
Yui and Kakeru will be angry.

224
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,127
Then I'll go meet Mita.

225
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,164
I'll ask Mita to help us!

226
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,999
Well…

227
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,634
But…

228
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,836
Let's go together, Kai!

229
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,876
I heard you kids left home.

230
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,878
I feel so sorry.

231
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,347
Just what happened with your father?

232
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,184
If you're troubled by anything,

233
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,452
I'll hear you out.

234
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,787
No thanks.

235
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,456
We're going to see Mita now.

236
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,129
That housekeeper is fired, you know.

237
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,999
But I'm relieved

238
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,001
that a dangerous person like her is gone.

239
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,272
-Shall we go home, Tsubasa?
-Yes.

240
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,475
I'll make you
your favorite omelet rice today!

241
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,410
All right!

242
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,512
Can I have meat, too?

243
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,248
What should we do, Kai?

244
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,516
Hey!

245
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,253
There she is!

246
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,056
Mita!

247
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,032
Why are you two here?

248
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,769
Oh, we just happened to see you here.

249
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,371
What are you doing here?

250
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,507
Are you waiting for someone?

251
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,178
No.

252
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,480
Then,

253
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,683
why did you buy
extra French fries and cola?

254
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,052
You're not eating them at all.

255
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,655
That is because…

256
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,760
I want to.

257
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,503
Please, Mita!

258
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,074
Help Daddy, Yui and Kakeru make up.

259
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,680
I want to live in that house
with everyone together again.

260
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,821
I'm sorry, but I cannot do that.

261
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,923
Why?

262
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,493
I have been fired,

263
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,963
and I am no longer related to you.

264
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Then I'll pay you!

265
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,887
How much do we need to hire you?

266
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,456
Four thousand yen
for a minimum duration of two hours.

267
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,925
The recommendation fee costs 520 yen,

268
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,760
so it will be 4,520 yen in total.

269
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,129
We don't have that much money!

270
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,231
Please excuse me.

271
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,767
Mita!

272
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,380
PERSONNEL TRANSFER NOTICE
KEIICHI ASUDA

273
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,316
I'll take the children's belongings
with me, Keiichi.

274
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,919
Sorry to cause you trouble, Urara.

275
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,021
It's fine.

276
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,556
But what will you do now?

277
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,759
I told Dad that it's just the usual fight.

278
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,762
This can't go on forever.

279
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,432
What do you think I should do, Urara?

280
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,301
What?

281
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,773
How will the children forgive

282
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,610
a father who caused their mother
to commit suicide?

283
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,480
I think…

284
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,684
You have to talk to them.

285
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,419
"I'm your father!"

286
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,423
"I love all of you the most
in this entire world!"

287
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,027
It will be fine as long as you express
your feelings to them!

288
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,128
In the first place,

289
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,196
Nagiko didn't have to abandon the kids

290
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,399
and kill herself
just because you had an affair!

291
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,802
I also lost my mother
around the same age Yui did,

292
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,439
so I understand how tough it is
for a child to lose their mother.

293
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,044
I don't mind looking after them
in place of their mother, you know?

294
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,347
I didn't mean it in a strange way, but…

295
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,949
Hey, Urara.

296
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,318
Why are you such a nice person?

297
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,620
What?

298
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,088
I mean,

299
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,424
you always say
there's no bad person in this world,

300
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,760
and that you can get by
as long as you have love and smiles.

301
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,296
Humans aren't such simplistic beings.

302
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,499
I can't believe you're a teacher.
Don't your students make fun of you?

303
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,400
Well…

304
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,005
Oh, sorry.

305
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,376
I'm spouting nonsense because I'm tired.

306
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll take you home.

307
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,548
-Near your house, that is.
-It's fine, Keiichi! Bye!

308
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,882
Wait, Urara.

309
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:04,883
Urara?

310
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,127
Your father looked really down.

311
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,164
I understand how you guys feel,
but why don't you forgive him already?

312
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,768
You only have one father in this world!

313
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,738
You see, Nagiko was already married
by the time Mom passed away,

314
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,808
so I've been living alone with Dad
since then.

315
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,977
He nags at me every single day.

316
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,713
I don't think that I want to see his face,

317
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,315
-but…
-Did you say something?

318
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,686
Nothing.
Why don't you go take a bath, Dad?

319
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,087
I'm about to.

320
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,389
You guys should go sleep soon, too.

321
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,891
Got it!

322
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,395
Urara.

323
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,296
What is it?

324
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,165
Our mom…

325
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,102
Why did she marry that man?

326
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,704
Well…

327
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,675
That's because she has been in love
with Keiichi for a long time.

328
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,444
And she was pregnant with you, Yui.

329
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,015
Then I shouldn't have been born.

330
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,885
What are you saying?
Of course that's not true!

331
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,721
Sorry, but I have studying to do.

332
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,656
Let's play another round, Yui.

333
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,258
Hey…

334
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,161
Wait. I still need to talk to you, Kakeru.

335
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,963
I only went along
because you had to take our belongings.

336
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,165
Cut me some slack.

337
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,633
-Me, too, then.
-What?

338
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,801
Don't say that too, Kaito.

339
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,272
You keep drawing the old maid
no matter how many rounds we play, Urara.

340
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,856
I have a favor to ask, Urara.

341
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,458
What is it, Kii? Just say it.

342
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,929
Could you lend me money?

343
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,368
You want to hire Akari?

344
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,436
Yes.

345
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,906
How long can I hire Mita
with this amount of money?

346
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,841
Let's see…

347
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,912
A total of 7,600 yen.

348
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,648
Let's see… Give me a moment.

349
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,689
-Five hours.
-Right.

350
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,124
Seven thousand five hundred yen
gives me five hours!

351
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,292
Wait…

352
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm sorry,

353
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:33,999
but you also need to pay
a referral commission of 975 yen.

354
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,468
What? Please give me a discount.

355
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:41,240
You say that, but this old lady here
needs to make a living as well.

356
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,041
Please!

357
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:47,179
Besides, if I sign a contract
with a young girl like you,

358
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,083
it's not right according to the law.

359
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,119
-Not right?
-Well…

360
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,188
It's just not right.

361
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,358
This is giving me a headache.

362
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,993
You surprised me!

363
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,129
Could you please stop doing that?

364
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:08,267
You know, sometimes you appear
out of nowhere like a ninja.

365
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,003
It's bad for my heart!

366
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,971
My apologies.

367
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,074
What is this urgent matter?

368
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,211
This girl says that she wants to hire you.

369
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,512
For four hours, that is.

370
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,513
Make it five!

371
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,482
Please, Mita!

372
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,484
What do you say?

373
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,321
I don't mind.

374
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,395
So…

375
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,966
What am I supposed to do?

376
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,836
Help Daddy, Yui and Kakeru make up!

377
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,706
I told you before,

378
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,575
that is impossible.

379
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,777
Why?

380
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,380
Only family members

381
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,716
can help each other reconcile.

382
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,921
I thought about it.

383
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,692
In order for us to make up,

384
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,695
we need to meet.

385
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,764
But I don't know what to do

386
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,499
to make that happen.

387
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,241
There is a simple method

388
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,711
to make a separated family come together.

389
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,381
What is it?

390
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,417
It's when someone gets into an accident,

391
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,686
or falls seriously ill.

392
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,089
Otherwise,

393
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,225
people will not gather out of concern.

394
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,762
Then I'll get sick!

395
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,432
It's easy to find out
if someone is pretending to be sick.

396
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,167
Then I'll get into an accident.

397
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,570
It will be very painful.

398
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,771
Are you fine with that?

399
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,273
Then what should I do?

400
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,077
That is…

401
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,950
something you should decide for yourself.

402
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,588
I got it.

403
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,456
I have a request.

404
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,434
Please take your time.

405
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:27,272
-This way.
-I want a huge room like that, Daddy!

406
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,007
Okay, in the future.

407
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,782
DO YOU LIKE ME, DADDY?
I LOVE YOU, DADDY!

408
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,155
MITA

409
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,757
Hello?

410
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,927
<i>I'm Mita, the housekeeper.</i>

411
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,496
Do you need anything?

412
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,035
I abducted Kii.

413
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,438
What?

414
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,808
If you want her back,

415
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,810
you have to agree to my terms.

416
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,078
Just hold on a minute.

417
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,649
If you do not comply,

418
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,352
I cannot guarantee Kii's safety.

419
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,755
Do you know what you're saying?

420
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,091
Besides, you're not even working
for our family anymore.

421
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,430
I'm currently being hired by Kii.

422
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,399
Wait.

423
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,503
Then did Kii tell you to kidnap her?

424
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,606
Kii has a message for you.

425
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,807
What?

426
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,678
"I want to live in the house
with everyone together again."

427
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,049
"If we can't do that, I will die."

428
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,352
What's that?

429
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,556
I relayed the same message
to Yui and the other kids.

430
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,293
So call me back on this phone

431
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,662
once you are ready
to accept my conditions.

432
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,998
Wait a minute! I…

433
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:06,204
Seriously, just what is
that housekeeper thinking?

434
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,974
Hey! What should we do, Yui?

435
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,244
For now,

436
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,646
just pretend to make up with Dad…

437
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,515
I will never do that!

438
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,587
MITA

439
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,591
<i>Hello.</i>

440
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,726
Hello, Mita?

441
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,294
Could you let Kii use the phone?

442
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,229
I'm sorry,

443
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,498
but can you have Mr. Asuda call

444
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,368
if you need anything from me?

445
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,804
Wait! Hello?

446
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,340
Just what's going on?

447
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,042
What did she say?

448
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,444
She said she will only take Dad's calls.

449
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,313
Then what do we do?

450
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,949
We don't have a choice.

451
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,084
For now, let's go look for her.

452
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,619
-Right!
-Hey!

453
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,454
Where are you guys going?

454
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,823
What? Oh… We need to do something.

455
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,559
Where's Kii?

456
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,994
I haven't seen her today.

457
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,598
-What?
-Kii is hanging out at her friend's place.

458
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,601
-We're going to fetch her now.
-Right! We'll be back soon.

459
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,972
Dear me…

460
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,140
What?

461
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,009
Akari abducted someone now?

462
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,980
I'm sorry, but could you tell us
Mita's home address?

463
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,783
Well, I'm sorry.

464
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,251
The thing is…

465
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,420
I have that thing to keep.

466
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,890
-The duty to confidentiality?
-This isn't the time for that!

467
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,193
Hey, could you not be so angry?

468
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,462
Have some <i>monaka</i>. Here you go.

469
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,064
We don't need these!

470
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,765
What?

471
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,702
I'll tell you, then.

472
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,740
Akari's home address is…

473
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,479
She doesn't have one.

474
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,614
-What?
-What?

475
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,548
What?

476
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,384
What do you mean by that?

477
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,452
Well…

478
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,653
You see,

479
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,725
she does have
a residential address written here.

480
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,762
But I also don't know where she lives.

481
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,297
Wait.

482
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:17,335
You kids can't tell anyone about this,
okay?

483
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,971
It's going to be bad
if the town office knows about this.

484
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,339
-So don't do that.
-No way…

485
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,975
Then we have no choice
but to call the police, Yui.

486
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,477
I don't think it's a good idea.

487
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,046
I don't think Mita would really kill Kii.

488
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,081
Are you siding with that housekeeper?

489
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,617
-Stop getting so uptight about everything!
-You guys…

490
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,686
No fighting among siblings!

491
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,391
Oh, so you guys came here, too.

492
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,496
Did you all also come here to ask about
Mita's home address?

493
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,332
-Okay, let's go find Kii.
-Where?

494
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,534
I mean, there's the amusement park!

495
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,836
-I think it's already closed for the day.
-What?

496
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,638
It could be that place!

497
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,407
That place?

498
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,941
The river where Mom died.

499
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,446
Hey! I have a car. Get in!

500
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,351
Hello, Urara?

501
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,553
Hey, wait up!

502
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,556
Sorry, Urara. Did you need anything?

503
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,059
We're having barbecue today.
Why don't you come over?

504
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,460
Don't worry!

505
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,397
Someone bad at cooking like me
will never mess up a barbecue!

506
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,732
Oh!

507
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,036
Sorry, Urara. But I'm busy now!

508
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,239
<i>Yesterday, Kii asked
if she could borrow money from me.</i>

509
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,408
<i>I thought about
what she could be using it for,</i>

510
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,777
<i>but I'm sure she's getting
presents for everyone--</i>

511
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,845
URARA YUKI

512
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,417
-Kii!
-Kii?

513
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,619
-Kii!
-Kii?

514
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,223
The other side!

515
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:51,429
-Is Kii here?
-Did Mita call you?

516
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,765
No, not yet.

517
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,699
I knew it.

518
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,869
We just need to agree
to Kii's condition and make up.

519
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,038
There's no way we can do that!

520
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,841
We were betrayed by this person!

521
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,443
Then what will we tell Mita?

522
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,048
Everyone…

523
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,350
Won't you return to the house?

524
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,621
We also need to resolve this incident.

525
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,089
I'm begging everyone!

526
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,260
I don't care
if you blame everything on me.

527
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,328
Okay?

528
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,497
All right.

529
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,967
So I'll call Mita now.

530
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,536
Do you really want that?

531
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,675
-What?
-Do you want to live with us?

532
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,180
What are you saying?

533
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,649
Of course I want to.

534
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,786
Didn't you tell us before?

535
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,121
You said you weren't sure

536
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,723
if you really loved Mom.

537
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,428
That's, well…

538
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,031
Do you…

539
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,503
really love us?

540
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,043
Of course I do.

541
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,612
More than your mistress?

542
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,348
Can you say we're more important
to you than that person?

543
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,892
This is where Mom died.

544
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,296
Don't you dare lie.

545
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,580
Well, I…

546
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,949
It's from Mita.

547
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,153
Put it on speaker mode,
so we can all hear her.

548
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,225
Hello?

549
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:05,196
<i>Kii is asking
if you will comply with her condition.</i>

550
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:12,503
Tell Kii to stop this ridiculous joke!

551
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>Please give me a moment.</i>

552
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:21,446
<i>Kii says, "I hate you, Yui!"</i>

553
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,084
Tell Kii that everyone
is worried about her!

554
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:32,390
<i>Kii says, "You're annoying, Kakeru,
so shut up!"</i>

555
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,792
Then ask Kii this.

556
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,129
She said she's going to die,
but how is she going to do it?

557
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,567
<i>She says, "I will set the house on fire."</i>

558
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,802
I see.

559
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,037
What?

560
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,006
Hey, where are you going?

561
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,507
Don't you get it?

562
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,710
Kii said that she's going to set
the house on fire!

563
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,212
-Hey!
-Right!

564
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,121
-Kii!
-Kii!

565
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,789
-Kii!
-Kii!

566
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,127
-You guys found her?
-Kii!

567
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,461
Mita!

568
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,799
Where is Kii?

569
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,670
-I cannot answer you.
-What's up with that?

570
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,705
I'll go search the second floor!

571
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,006
-Kii!
-Hey!

572
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,074
Kii!

573
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,142
Kii!

574
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,612
Kii?

575
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,814
Kii!

576
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,790
Maybe she's not here after all.

577
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,092
Hey…

578
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,060
Over there!

579
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,600
Wait.

580
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,536
What are you doing, Kii?

581
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,870
Don't come over!

582
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,206
It's dangerous there, Kii. Get off!

583
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,776
Has everyone made up?

584
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,213
Didn't I tell you

585
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,682
that I'll die if you don't make up?

586
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,017
Don't be ridiculous!

587
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,720
-If you come over, I'll jump down!
-Hey!

588
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,592
Don't keep quiet.

589
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,327
Say something. You're the father!

590
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
Kii.

591
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,873
Go down from there and we'll talk, okay?

592
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,575
No!

593
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,577
I'll go meet Mommy!

594
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,846
Don't say that!

595
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,980
Come on, take my hand!

596
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,448
No!

597
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,855
Wait,

598
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,456
what are you guys doing?

599
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,126
-Kii!
-Kii!

600
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,865
Ouch…

601
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,700
That hurt!

602
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,579
Daddy.

603
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,820
Don't you ever do that again!

604
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,389
Do you know how worried everyone was?

605
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,466
I'm sorry…

606
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,214
You dropped this.

607
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,652
No!

608
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,922
One of the stones I gave Mom is missing!

609
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,833
Kii?

610
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,635
It's just one stone.
I'll get you a new one.

611
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,472
No! That stone represents Daddy!

612
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,675
What?

613
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,446
This is Mommy,

614
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,548
this is Yui,

615
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,550
this is Kakeru,

616
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,652
and this is Kai.

617
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,954
And this is me!

618
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:28,526
So Daddy has to be here, too!

619
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,385
Mita.

620
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,920
Do you have a flashlight?

621
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,788
I do.

622
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,765
Thanks.

623
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,901
Excuse me.

624
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,938
I'll help you, too, Kii!

625
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,041
-Here, I found it!
-This one.

626
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,977
-That's not it!
-Oh, sorry.

627
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,280
I found it this time, Kii!

628
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,183
-No! This isn't it either!
-What?

629
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,051
Oh, wait!

630
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,986
What about this, Kii?

631
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,955
No!

632
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,125
Stop it, Kii!

633
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,162
We don't have a father!

634
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,037
Why are you saying that, Yui?

635
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,507
Just forgive Daddy!

636
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,044
Kakeru.

637
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,948
My kindergarten teacher told me

638
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,583
that if we fight with someone,

639
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,051
we must make up with them.

640
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,118
Kai.

641
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,156
Let's live with Daddy again!

642
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,797
Daddy.

643
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,267
Did you read my letter?

644
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,970
Yes.

645
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,113
DO YOU LIKE ME, DADDY?
I LOVE YOU, DADDY!

646
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,185
I love you, Daddy.

647
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,725
Do you love me, Daddy?

648
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,912
I don't know.

649
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,618
Hey.

650
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,822
What's with that answer?

651
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,496
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,603
That is this man's true nature!

653
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,643
You kids were acting strange,

654
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,447
so I thought something is up.

655
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,583
And this is what happened?

656
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,322
Grandpa!

657
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,058
How could you look at my belongings
without my permission?

658
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,995
You.

659
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,330
Come with me.

660
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,742
What is this?

661
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,217
You did this

662
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,553
because you're scared
of seeing Nagiko, right?

663
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,524
-You bastard!
-Hey! Stop it, Dad!

664
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,259
Stay out of this!

665
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,601
Why did my daughter have to die
because of someone like you?

666
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,640
Why is Nagiko dead,
and you're still alive?

667
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,977
You should have just died!

668
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,849
If you can't kill yourself,

669
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,451
I'll do it for you.

670
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,587
Wait.

671
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,789
Stop this, Dad!

672
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,024
-Stop it!
-Yui!

673
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,526
Dad!

674
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,361
-Dad!
-Grandpa!

675
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:02,199
-Stop it, Grandpa!
-Stop!

676
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,345
I will raise these kids

677
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,548
in Nagiko's place.

678
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,585
I will never hand them to you again!

679
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,662
Okay, everyone. Let's go back.

680
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,397
Come on.

681
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,636
Hey.

682
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,137
What are you all doing?

683
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,038
Hurry up!

684
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,506
Come on, let's go.

685
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,975
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

686
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,678
We'll stay in this house.

687
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,315
-You'll forgive this man?
-That's not it.

688
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,552
But this is our home.

689
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:59,156
We can't have Kii
trying something like this again.

690
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,296
Could you leave this house instead?

691
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,633
It's all your fault, anyway.

692
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,103
Isn't this the least you could do for us?

693
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,442
I'll take care of…

694
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,078
my siblings.

695
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,091
Mita!

696
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,763
I'm sorry,

697
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,167
but my contract with you has expired.

698
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,239
Mita.

699
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,844
Sorry to trouble you,

700
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,515
but could you work for the kids
in this house again?

701
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,653
I'll contact the agency about this.

702
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,556
As you wish.

703
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,228
I will never acknowledge this man!

704
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,264
Let's just go home already, Dad!

705
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,132
-Why don't you say something, too?
-I…

706
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,067
I'm on their side.

707
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,069
Just stop this already!

708
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,170
Let's go home, Dad!

709
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,472
Come on!

710
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,109
Mita…

711
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,614
I'm leaving the kids to you.

712
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,983
Understood.

713
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,128
See you, everyone.

714
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,623
The kids

715
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,759
are finally sick of me.

716
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:51,829
Well,

717
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,898
I guess I deserved it.

718
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,040
I've never hit anyone before,

719
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,077
but I did that to Kii.

720
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,350
As a father,

721
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,620
I should have given her a hug.

722
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,267
When a child does something wrong,

723
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,469
it is a given that you reprimand them.

724
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,138
What?

725
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,174
It's something you should do…

726
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,276
as a father.

727
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,362
<i>It's not normal for children
to live with just their housekeeper.</i>

728
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,731
<i>You do everything we ask?</i>

729
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,099
<i>This is an order.</i>

730
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,167
Could you turn this house upside down?

731
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,602
As you wish.

732
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,839
<i>What are you doing, Mita?</i>

733
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,007
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

734
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,378
<i>What should I do to nurture parental love?</i>

735
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,948
<i>Dad is planning to adopt the kids.</i>

736
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,850
<i>Are you running away, you coward?</i>

737
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,518
Tell me what you think.

738
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,186
<i>You must have your own thoughts.</i>

739
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,355
I have a question for everyone.

740
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:05,062
