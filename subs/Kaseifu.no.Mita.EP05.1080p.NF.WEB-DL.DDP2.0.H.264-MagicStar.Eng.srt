1
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,909
Stop, Mom!

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,812
Please, come back!

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,752
Why? Why are you leaving us?

4
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,324
Hey!

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,126
Ouch!

6
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,827
If you don't wake up soon,

7
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,429
you will be late for school.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,732
Oh, no!

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,469
Mita poured you a glass of milk.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,738
What? You should have said so earlier!

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,007
You always make such a commotion
every morning.

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,743
What are you doing, Kii?
You're not a baby anymore.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,912
She kept insisting to drink
from that bottle.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,480
She wet her bed today, too.

15
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,681
What?

16
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,319
You can't do this, Kii.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,755
You can't drink anything
right before you sleep.

18
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,259
Right. I'll teach you a trick
that will stop you from wetting your bed.

19
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,326
Let's go.

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,298
-Yui. When is Daddy coming home?
-Yes?

21
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,366
What?

22
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:11,938
That's…

23
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,641
Didn't I tell you?

24
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,577
The four of us will live together
from now on.

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,213
So you need to become strong, Kii.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,548
She's right.

27
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,750
We're better off
not having that man around!

28
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,087
From now on, let's work together
and do our best.

29
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,288
Let's get our spirits up!

30
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,791
Yui. The school I'm applying to will be
having a parent-and-teacher meeting.

31
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,992
Oh, is that so?

32
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,029
Kaito. Why don't you give up
applying to a private school?

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,996
What?

34
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,731
What are you trying to say?

35
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,302
Like I said, stop talking
as if everyone is dumber than you!

36
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,404
And like I said, stop hitting my head!

37
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,339
Stop fighting first thing in the morning.

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,075
I have a question for everyone.

39
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,778
What?

40
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,246
What is it?

41
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,751
From now on,
whose order should I prioritize?

42
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,090
Mr. Asuda's orders always came first,

43
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,459
but I cannot get my priorities mixed up

44
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,128
if everyone has different requests.

45
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,863
You could listen to me,

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,664
-since I'm the eldest son.
-What?

47
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,100
Normally it should be Yui,
since she's the eldest.

48
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,102
Shut up! You're just a kid!

49
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,972
What's with your attitude?
You're acting like a father!

50
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,074
Stop it, both of you.

51
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,744
Mita.

52
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,282
If we all have different requests,
we will discuss among ourselves first.

53
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,918
As you wish.

54
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,175
<i> Daddy has to be here, too!</i>

55
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,913
<i>When a child does something wrong,</i>

56
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,348
<i>it is a given that you reprimand them.</i>

57
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,917
It's something you should do…

58
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,219
as a father.

59
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,433
Coming.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,703
-Yikes! It's the old hag next door!
-Hey, wait!

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,804
I'm sorry about that!

62
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,873
What do you need?

63
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,976
I'm here to give you the circular notice!

64
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,581
I thought I should inform you
about the neighborhood council meeting.

65
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,648
Is Mr. Asuda here?

66
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,619
He has been absent from the meetings
ever since his wife passed away.

67
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,222
I'm here to let him know
that he has to attend this week.

68
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,325
Mr. Asuda has left.

69
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,759
What?

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,461
What do you mean?

71
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,565
Last night, Kii said that she will die
if everyone doesn't live together.

72
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,067
There was a huge commotion.

73
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,936
The children are convinced
that their father is at fault,

74
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,772
and persistently asked him
if he really loved them.

75
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,841
-Mr. Asuda…
-That's enough!

76
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,145
Then, it's just you guys living here now?

77
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,448
Seriously.

78
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,984
What's going to happen
if a fire breaks out again?

79
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,252
How troublesome.

80
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,821
Don't worry. We won't cause
any trouble for you.

81
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:19,158
Still, it's not normal for children
to live with just their housekeeper.

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,261
Seriously…

83
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,463
Why am I living next
to a family like this?

84
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,168
That old hag is going to spread rumors
about us again.

85
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,338
No point worrying about it.
Let's go, we're running late!

86
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,940
Have a safe trip.

87
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:34,841
Mita.

88
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,110
Could you go kill that old hag?

89
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,411
As you wish.

90
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,479
Wait!

91
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,147
It's just a joke! Oh…

92
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,884
Sorry.

93
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,256
You're really weird, you know?

94
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,992
You just agree to every request
without any hesitation!

95
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,060
As a housekeeper,

96
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,797
shouldn't you talk more or at least smile?

97
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,466
I heard that you think
you shouldn't smile.

98
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,468
Just what happened to you?

99
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,903
Try smiling now.

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,905
You do everything we ask, right?

101
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,308
This is an order.

102
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,545
I'm sorry,

103
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,546
but I can't do that.

104
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,014
Why?

105
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,718
If you insist that I do it,

106
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,453
I will quit.

107
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,990
Don't mind that.

108
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,494
Have a safe trip.

109
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,149
Hurry up!

110
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,318
Here!

111
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,020
Hey!

112
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,023
Stop repeating the same mistakes!

113
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,958
You guys are all slacking off!

114
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,194
All first-year students, do 100 push-ups!

115
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,095
-Yes!
-Yes!

116
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,930
Hey, Kakeru.

117
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,332
Aren't you being too harsh?

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,901
I just want everyone to do their best!

119
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,371
Even so, you don't normally
go overboard like this.

120
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,271
Normally?

121
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,474
What's that?
Are you saying I'm not normal?

122
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,775
Why are you so irritated?

123
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,578
I know you're enthusiastic
since you just became the captain.

124
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,748
Don't take it out on us
just because your dad left home.

125
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,949
Wait, what?

126
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,617
How did you know that?

127
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,321
That talkative hag lives next to you,
remember?

128
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,401
This far is good enough.

129
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,536
I don't want my siblings to see us,
anyway.

130
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,172
-Got it.
-Thank you so much for taking me home.

131
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,173
See you.

132
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,010
Excuse me, Ozawa…

133
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,046
Hey!

134
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,182
What are you doing here, Yui?

135
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,250
See you.

136
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,317
Okay.

137
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,287
I'm sorry to interrupt while you're busy.

138
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,688
Hey, stop that!

139
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,724
That's my line! What are you doing here?

140
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,426
He just took me home. That's all.

141
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,528
-Is that wrong?
-All of you are the same!

142
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

143
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,832
When you turn at the tree.

144
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,000
<i>And walk further</i>

145
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,601
And walk further.

146
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,471
Oh, Yui and Kakeru!

147
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
Welcome home.

148
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,608
We're home.

149
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,811
Mita!

150
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,812
Yes.

151
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,881
Could you go complain
to the old hag next door?

152
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,617
She has been talking bad about us.

153
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,920
As you wish.

154
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,090
Wait. Stop that, Mita.

155
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,358
Hey!

156
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,229
Just take Kii home.

157
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,433
As you wish.

158
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,102
Kii.

159
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,274
Why did you stop her, Yui?

160
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,611
If you do that,
things are just going to get complicated.

161
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,146
What is it?

162
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,747
Do you need anything with me?

163
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,349
No, it's nothing.

164
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,520
Ms. Minagawa. Could you stop talking about
unnecessary things to others?

165
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,188
Like how our father left home.

166
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,358
Could you not make false accusations?

167
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,361
Also, isn't it true
that your father left home?

168
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,431
Did he perhaps have a mistress?

169
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,500
Or did your mother know about it?

170
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,402
You see,

171
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,005
I sympathize with you kids.

172
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,175
First, your mother died,

173
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,044
and now your father abandoned you.

174
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,646
How pitiful.

175
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,581
Let's go, Tsubasa.

176
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,050
-You'll be late for your violin lessons.
-Okay.

177
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,720
Wait!

178
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,292
We weren't abandoned.

179
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,494
Stop it already.
Sorry to cause you trouble.

180
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,496
Why are you apologizing?

181
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,632
Your husband is having an affair too,
right?

182
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,835
Your kid said it.

183
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,504
What are you saying?

184
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,572
Let's go.

185
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,146
Hey!

186
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,482
Would you stop causing trouble already?

187
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,484
Things are already troublesome as it is!

188
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,153
Then, stop flirting around!

189
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,557
You even bragged to Dad
that you're going to take care of us!

190
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
Oh, thanks.

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,195
I'm telling you not to do anything
that will cause trouble for the family!

192
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,265
Then, are you fine letting that old hag
spout all those nonsense?

193
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,467
Seriously, you guys are so annoying!

194
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,103
If you want to fight, do it outside!

195
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,439
You listen, too.
It involves the whole family.

196
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,608
Sorry, but I have cram school.

197
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,444
I'm counting on you
for the parent-and-teacher meeting, Yui.

198
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,914
Didn't I tell you
not to attend a private school?

199
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,819
-Hey, Yui.
-Yes?

200
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,688
What's a family breakdown?

201
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,622
What?

202
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,524
Why are you asking that, Kii?

203
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,893
Tsubasa told me that.

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,363
"You're having
a family breakdown now, Kii."

205
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,264
Oh…

206
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,966
That means…

207
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,338
A family that has issues and flaws

208
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,540
turns into a complete mess,

209
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,011
and those who have not experienced it
sympathizes and pities you.

210
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,946
That's what a "family breakdown" means.

211
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,649
Mita, go kill them all
together with that hag!

212
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,686
As you wish.

213
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,123
You don't have to go, Mita!

214
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,560
Mita.

215
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,797
Could you prioritize my orders
from now on?

216
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,899
Understood.

217
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,036
Seriously…

218
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,904
What the heck!

219
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,875
You won't have a family breakdown, Ku.

220
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,152
What should I do, Mita?

221
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,656
There's the neighborhood council meeting,
and the parent-and-teacher meeting.

222
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,661
That is something
you should decide for yourself.

223
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,129
That again?

224
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,731
Just tell me what you think.

225
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,334
You must have your own thoughts.

226
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,077
I'm not thinking of anything.

227
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,149
You can always reach me through my phone.

228
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,350
Thank you very much!

229
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,387
-The house was nice, wasn't it?
-Yes.

230
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,956
Chief.

231
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,492
Oh, Natori. What's up?

232
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,230
You seem popular with housewives.

233
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,800
Aren't you more suitable to work here?

234
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,234
-Right?
-Yes.

235
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,004
-You think so?
-Well then.

236
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,206
Do your best to sell more houses.

237
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,141
We'll continue to make good ones too.

238
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,217
MIE KAZAMA

239
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:05,324
<i>The number you have reached
is not available.</i>

240
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,404
Where are you staying now?

241
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,306
Well…

242
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,342
At a business hotel near my company.

243
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,413
Then, what will you do about
Yui and the kids?

244
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,750
This can't go on forever.

245
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,053
I know I have to do something.

246
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,822
Sorry to keep you waiting.

247
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,890
Please excuse me.

248
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,226
Let's eat first!

249
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,461
It looks so good.

250
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,563
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

251
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,165
I'm digging in!

252
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,803
Yuck, again!

253
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,871
-What's wrong?
-Well…

254
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,873
This always happens.

255
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,075
Even if I order the same thing
as someone else,

256
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,277
mine always has insects in it.

257
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,314
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

258
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,450
There's an insect in her food.

259
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,118
Just how do you do things here?

260
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,319
I'm really sorry!

261
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,188
I will have it changed right away.

262
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,290
Seriously…

263
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,328
Right…

264
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,533
So what did you want to talk about?

265
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,270
When Kii asked if you love her,

266
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,605
why did you give her that answer?

267
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,207
I don't know.

268
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,509
What's with that answer?

269
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,848
You could have just said
that you love her!

270
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,617
That's true, but…

271
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,322
If I hadn't married Nagiko

272
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,658
or didn't have children,

273
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,094
I couldn't help but think

274
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,030
how my life would have turned out.

275
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,232
-It's good, Daddy!
-Really?

276
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,201
Mine is good, too.

277
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,403
When I hit Kii that day,

278
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,906
Mita told me that it's a given
to reprimand children

279
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,243
if they did something wrong.

280
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,880
But I don't have the confidence

281
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,316
to tell them that I love them

282
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,651
from the bottom of my heart.

283
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,555
Well… You're being too honest, Keiichi.

284
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,492
Don't all fathers lie and pretend?

285
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,065
I wish that your father
would teach me, Urara.

286
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,936
What should I do to nurture parental love?

287
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,639
What's that?

288
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,308
Dad!

289
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,378
Didn't I tell you not to come
since I'll do something about this?

290
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,312
Shut up.

291
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,915
Nothing will turn out well
if I leave it to you.

292
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,987
I've had enough of your nonsense!

293
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,123
Here.

294
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,160
Hurry up and sign this.

295
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,130
An adoption application form?

296
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,000
-Wait, Dad!
-Stay out of this!

297
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,535
Listen.

298
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,039
Yui can choose to be adopted
on her own will,

299
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,708
but the other three will need
the father's consent

300
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,044
to be adopted by someone else.

301
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,279
Wait, but…

302
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,214
Thanks for waiting. Here is your gratin.

303
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,349
We don't need that! Get lost!

304
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,485
Stop shouting!

305
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,552
Hurry up.

306
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,790
You don't love those kids, right?

307
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,296
I'm sorry,

308
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,730
but please give me some time.

309
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,465
This is too sudden.

310
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,500
He's right, Dad.

311
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,901
Shut up!

312
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,270
To those kids,

313
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:42,875
every single second matters.

314
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,077
Do you even understand that?

315
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,194
I…

316
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,176
I'm sorry!

317
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,911
Wait, Keiichi!

318
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,480
Are you running away, you coward?

319
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,882
Wait!

320
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,020
Dad! Are you all right?

321
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,922
I'm sorry, Urara!

322
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,066
Well, shall we start with running?

323
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,540
Hey.

324
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,275
What are you guys doing?

325
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,911
We can't follow you anymore.

326
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,847
What? What are you talking about?

327
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,415
Could you resign as the captain?

328
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,751
Hey. Are you kidding me?

329
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,787
Say something, the rest of you!

330
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,426
Do whatever you want.

331
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,428
I would rather quit a club like this!

332
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:21,507
MONEY CHANGER

333
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,010
We did it! You actually got it!

334
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,211
Let's play one more time!

335
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,714
You're really good! Let's try it again.

336
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,749
What the hell is wrong with this?

337
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,351
Hey!

338
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,254
-What are you doing?
-Quit bugging me!

339
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,689
Hey!

340
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,492
Hey! Let go of me!

341
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,296
Are you the eldest son?

342
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,964
Any younger siblings?

343
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,402
You're so young, and you're already
invoking your right to remain silent?

344
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,072
Excuse me…

345
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,541
I'm Kakeru Asuda's father.

346
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,209
Oh, I'm sorry.

347
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,211
I told him to contact a guardian,

348
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,247
but your son
called the housekeeper instead.

349
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,683
So I told him he can't leave.

350
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,418
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,489
Well, the arcade employees
want to settle this amicably, too.

352
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,525
Could you give him a stern warning?

353
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,727
No point telling him that.

354
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,963
That man is not a father to me.

355
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,798
Hey, Kakeru!

356
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,736
Sorry. I'll talk some sense into him.

357
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,139
-I'm really sorry about this.
-It's all right.

358
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,444
Hey, Kakeru.

359
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,015
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,951
It's all because of me.

361
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,889
That's not what happened!

362
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,263
Hey, what are you doing?

363
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,432
What?

364
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,500
I…

365
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,901
I'm quitting basketball.

366
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,802
What?

367
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,338
But I thought you loved it.

368
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,039
Who cares about that?

369
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,242
Forget that. Can I have a cigarette?

370
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,278
What are you saying?

371
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,914
Then, I'll buy it myself.

372
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,982
Give me your card.

373
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,486
Don't be ridiculous. You're a minor.

374
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,189
Then tell me!

375
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,125
Why can't a minor smoke?

376
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,193
What?

377
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,329
Well, you see…

378
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,999
That's because…

379
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,800
Smoking as a minor

380
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,670
interferes with your growth
and it deteriorates your brain.

381
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,106
It only helps raise
weak and immature humans

382
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,443
who pretend to be full-fledged adults.

383
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,113
She's right.

384
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,483
Isn't it fine?

385
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,084
I'm stupid in the first place.

386
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,790
Why would someone like you care
how I turn out to be?

387
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,759
"Someone like you"?

388
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,826
What?

389
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,895
You want me to call you "Dad"?

390
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,332
Seriously.

391
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,202
Why did Mom fall in love
with someone like you?

392
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,138
If she hadn't married you,

393
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,806
she would have had a happy life!

394
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,676
Hey.

395
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,778
Seriously…

396
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:20,986
Mita.

397
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,355
Sorry to trouble you,

398
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,823
but please take care of him.

399
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,759
-About what?
-What?

400
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,430
Oh, I mean…

401
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,566
The various aspects
of the children's lives.

402
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,502
What do you mean by "various"?

403
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,072
Well, that's…

404
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,877
Please contact me
if anything happens again.

405
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,514
As you wish.

406
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,823
Kakeru.

407
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,126
Mita.

408
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,996
How did it go with the police?

409
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,798
They agreed to let him go,

410
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,535
on the condition that Mr. Asuda
reprimands him.

411
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,874
What's the meaning of this, Kakeru?

412
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,075
Everyone was worried!

413
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,277
Shut up!

414
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,145
It wasn't my fault!

415
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,214
Hey, Kakeru!

416
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,754
What are you doing?

417
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,755
Why not?

418
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,256
It's a waste to throw it away.

419
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,859
-Just stop this already!
-Let go!

420
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,327
Hey, Kakeru!

421
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,062
I said, let go!

422
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,769
Seriously… What are you doing?

423
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,582
You guys will never understand…

424
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,352
how I feel right now.

425
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,820
Kakeru!

426
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,863
I can't forgive my father,

427
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,835
but I think my siblings
still need someone like him around.

428
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,570
I just don't know what to do.

429
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,506
My head is in a mess now.

430
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,242
Then,

431
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,246
let's give it a good thought together
after school today.

432
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,218
Ozawa.

433
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,022
Do you really love me?

434
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,624
What are you saying?

435
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,692
Of course, I do.

436
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,528
Then, what do you like about me?

437
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,529
What?

438
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,898
Ozawa.

439
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,233
You just accept me

440
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,435
because you can kiss me and stuff, right?

441
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,840
When the person I love is in pain,
I want to be by his side.

442
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,909
I want to do my best to help him.

443
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,379
I think this is what it means
to be in a relationship.

444
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,448
What are you trying to say?

445
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,252
I know that things have been tough
since your mom passed away,

446
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,989
but you've never listened
to what I had to say either.

447
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,226
Like where we should travel,

448
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,827
or about my dreams and my future.

449
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,531
Are we even in a relationship right now?

450
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,704
I'm sorry that I didn't understand
your feelings!

451
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,772
Forget about it.

452
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,373
I'll go to your house.

453
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,842
So don't be mad at me.

454
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,221
What?

455
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,625
Will you nag at me for skipping school?

456
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,760
No.

457
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,096
I'm just wondering
if you need me to do anything.

458
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,734
Then…

459
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,935
Play one round with me.

460
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,271
As you wish.

461
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,214
One more time.

462
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,782
As you wish.

463
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,952
One more time.

464
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,220
As you wish.

465
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,056
-One more time!
-As you wish.

466
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,561
That's enough.

467
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,864
If there is nothing else,

468
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,200
I will resume cleaning.

469
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,173
Wait.

470
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,914
You'll really do anything I ask, right?

471
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,651
If it is within my means.

472
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,887
Then…

473
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,756
Let me do you.

474
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,993
There's no one around.

475
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,895
It's fine, right?

476
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,200
What?

477
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,169
So I guess you can't do things like this.

478
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,638
As you wish.

479
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,373
What?

480
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,946
What should I start with?

481
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,681
What?

482
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,551
Should I kiss you?

483
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,020
Or should I take off my clothes first?

484
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,557
Then…

485
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,625
Take off your clothes.

486
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,460
Understood.

487
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,829
-Stop!
-What are you doing?

488
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,733
Mita?

489
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,069
What's the meaning of this?

490
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,044
Kakeru asked to let him do me.

491
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,445
So I asked

492
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,814
if I should kiss him
or take off my clothes.

493
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,549
He told me to take off my clothes.

494
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,817
Wear your clothes now.

495
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,919
As you wish.

496
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,396
Did you really ask her to do that?

497
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:40,999
Kakeru?

498
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,670
Why can't I?

499
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,107
Just what are you thinking?

500
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,277
Stop messing around with me!

501
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,081
You're not even doing anything
for the family!

502
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,783
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

503
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,088
You've got to be kidding me!

504
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,328
What are you doing, Kakeru?

505
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,832
Stop putting all the blame on me.

506
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,435
This home turned into such a mess

507
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,170
because of Dad.

508
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,108
And because Mom killed herself!

509
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,357
Say, Mita…

510
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,662
What would have happened
if I hadn't appeared on time?

511
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,700
Did you

512
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,603
really intend to do that with Kakeru?

513
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,639
Yes.

514
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,175
Jeez…

515
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,943
What's wrong with this house?

516
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,817
I'll be home late today, Mita.

517
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,652
I might be staying overnight elsewhere.

518
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,057
Understood.

519
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,571
-Were you waiting for me, Chief?
-Well…

520
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,106
Sorry.

521
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,108
I just really wanted to talk to you.

522
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,044
-Please don't act like a stalker!
-No…

523
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,514
I know that something
is wrong with me, too.

524
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,351
But I just don't know
what I should do anymore.

525
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,653
I can't go home,

526
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,255
and I have no one to confide in.

527
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,591
You're the only one

528
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,192
who understands me.

529
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,229
Didn't you tell me

530
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,932
that I don't have to force myself
to act like a good person?

531
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,935
You said I could be myself.

532
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,773
It's the first time
someone ever said that to me.

533
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,376
It's also my first time
to be so deeply in love with someone.

534
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,812
I see.

535
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,114
So that's how it is.

536
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,017
Why are you here?

537
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,791
Don't tell me…

538
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,860
You're going out with him?

539
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,630
I didn't want to say this,

540
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,965
but it was tough on me, too.

541
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,604
Will you give up on me now?

542
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,258
Hey.

543
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,726
What are you doing?

544
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,198
You keep staring at someone else's house.

545
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,901
I hope you're not planning
anything strange.

546
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,837
That's not it!

547
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,438
Wow, so scary.

548
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,640
You can't follow people like him, Tsubasa.

549
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,708
Okay.

550
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,549
That damn old hag.

551
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,359
What is it?

552
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,329
My work for today is done,

553
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,331
so I will excuse myself.

554
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,769
Mita!

555
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,411
I have a request.

556
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,019
Could you turn this house upside down?

557
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,357
Is that…

558
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,825
an order?

559
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,593
Of course.

560
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,096
As you wish.

561
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,241
So what should I do?

562
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,346
You could tear down the building!

563
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,715
I will require a bulldozer for that.

564
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,984
Then,

565
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,986
blow it apart with dynamite!

566
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,223
Where do I get something like that?

567
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,557
Then…

568
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,393
Let's see…

569
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,796
Damn it.

570
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,264
What should I do?

571
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,070
What?

572
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,674
You must think I'm hopeless, right?

573
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,511
Here I am struggling with all my worries,

574
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,846
and yet you look at me
as if you're ridiculing me!

575
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,251
Do you even understand how I'm feeling?

576
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,189
I understand.

577
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,025
What?

578
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,206
Hey!

579
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,541
What are you doing?

580
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,951
Wait, what are you writing?

581
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,694
Hey. What did you mean
when you said you understand my feelings?

582
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,972
I WANT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY

583
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,542
Why…

584
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,915
FAMILY

585
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,087
I WANT TO PROTECT

586
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:51,829
Hey.

587
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,831
What are the both of you up to?

588
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,669
I WANT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY

589
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,543
I WANT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY

590
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,651
I'm sorry that I'm late.

591
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,087
Haven't I asked you to help, sir?

592
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,922
I'm sure I told you to warn your son.

593
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,524
Oh, I'm sorry.

594
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,261
When I asked the housekeeper,
she said it was an order by your son.

595
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,929
Just what's wrong with your family?

596
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,365
Oh, that's…

597
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,699
How should I explain this…

598
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,069
Everything is wrong with this family.

599
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,403
The father is never home,

600
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,005
the housekeeper is unpredictable,

601
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,207
the eldest daughter isn't home
at this hour,

602
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,609
and the eldest son is a delinquent.

603
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,079
I'm so scared
that I can't fall asleep at night.

604
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,716
Why don't you reflect on yourself?

605
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,353
Your late wife in heaven
must be crying now.

606
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,689
Hey. Don't just say
anything you want here!

607
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,658
You were spreading rumors
about our family!

608
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,926
What's with that attitude?

609
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,261
You're not even apologizing
for your wrongdoings.

610
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,264
If that's how you will act,
I'm going to file a victim report.

611
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,133
Calm down, ma'am.

612
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,601
You're neighbors,

613
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,003
and he's just a minor.

614
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,607
-Just talk things through.
-Why should I do that?

615
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,976
Boys like him deserve to be arrested.

616
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,778
It will be safer here without him.

617
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,980
Please take him to the police station now.

618
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,619
Well then, stand up.

619
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,421
Come on, stand up.

620
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,156
Let's go.

621
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,824
Come.

622
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,493
Excuse me…

623
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,560
What?

624
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,430
-You have a complaint?
-No, well…

625
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,715
I'm truly sorry!

626
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,787
It's all my fault.
You can blame everything on me.

627
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,156
I beg you!

628
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,629
But just one thing.

629
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,031
Kakeru is not a delinquent.

630
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,866
As the eldest son,

631
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,501
he's doing his best for everyone.

632
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,104
Ever since their mother died,

633
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,040
he's been trying his best for this family.

634
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,309
His father is hopeless,

635
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,179
so he wants to protect this family
more than anyone else!

636
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,683
My late wife told me this.

637
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,886
"If I caught a cold,

638
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,088
all the kids would be sleeping."

639
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:35,426
"But Kakeru would be awake
the entire night to change my wet towel

640
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,528
and wipe away my sweat."

641
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,131
Kakeru is actually a really nice boy.

642
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,133
He worries about this family,

643
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,834
and hopes for everyone to be happy,

644
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,636
unlike me!

645
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,274
I will take responsibility
and clean your walls.

646
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,044
So please forgive him.

647
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,245
I beg you!

648
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,781
I beg you!

649
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,550
I beg you!

650
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,819
I beg you!

651
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,992
Aren't you glad, Daddy?

652
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,728
They'll forgive him
as long as we clean the walls.

653
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,297
Right.

654
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,365
But…

655
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,369
this won't come off
without special detergent, right?

656
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,773
I have it.

657
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,245
All right. Let's do this.

658
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,247
I'll help, too!

659
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,314
Okay.

660
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,316
Thanks.

661
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,919
I'm supposed to be studying now, you know…

662
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,029
I…

663
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,733
Mom once told me…

664
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,571
"Our family will be fine

665
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,310
as long as you're here, Kakeru."

666
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,812
But…

667
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,052
I don't have the confidence
to meet Mom's expectations.

668
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,757
I want to do something for everyone,

669
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,894
but I have no idea what I should do.

670
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,099
I just know that I have to do something.

671
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,568
I grew more and more anxious,

672
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,905
and things just wouldn't go well.

673
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,645
Kakeru.

674
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,252
I will protect you.

675
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,638
Man…

676
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,375
You ruined the moment.

677
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,442
Mita.

678
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,911
Can you make us some midnight snacks
after this?

679
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,849
I can.

680
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,685
Well then, let's eat.

681
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,153
Thank you for the food.

682
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,192
Oh, wow.

683
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,795
So good.

684
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,199
Aren't you hungry, Kii?

685
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,636
I'll wet my bed
if I eat right before sleeping.

686
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,773
You shouldn't worry about it.

687
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,642
Kakeru wet his bed until third grade.

688
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,046
You didn't have to say that, Dad…

689
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,023
Kaito.

690
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,428
If you don't mind, can I attend
the teacher-and-parent meeting?

691
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,963
I'm fine with it.

692
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,801
Mita.

693
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,669
Could you also let Yui know

694
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,005
that I'll attend
the neighborhood council meeting?

695
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,042
I believe you should tell her that
yourself.

696
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,777
What?

697
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,850
Why are you eating ramen here?

698
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,618
Oh, well…

699
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,654
Who said you can come home?

700
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,989
You've got it wrong, Yui.

701
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,158
Some things happened.

702
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,827
And what is that?

703
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,161
The thing is…

704
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,997
-Because of me--
-It's all right, Kakeru.

705
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,132
But…

706
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,135
Yui.

707
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,337
I'll go home.

708
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,908
Oh, right.

709
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,179
Daddy's stone!

710
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,080
Right.

711
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,183
Mita found it.

712
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,352
This stone…

713
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,788
Can I keep it for now?

714
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,127
I want to put it back
into that box one day.

715
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,531
Sure.

716
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,867
Thanks.

717
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:49,940
See you.

718
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,623
Yes?

719
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,092
Oh, Mita.

720
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,095
I brought you your washed clothes.

721
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,031
Right…

722
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,535
These…

723
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,003
You picked them up for me?

724
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,705
If there is nothing else,

725
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,173
I will excuse myself.

726
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,480
Mita!

727
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,253
I'm sorry about everything.

728
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,723
Also…

729
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,825
Thank you.

730
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,861
I believe…

731
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,432
That is something
you should tell your father.

732
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,135
Also…

733
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,537
What?

734
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,379
This is the invoice
for my overtime hours today.

735
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,348
TO: MR. KEIICHI ASUDA
OVERTIME PAYMENT

736
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,885
Please excuse me.

737
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,714
I'm sorry, everyone!

738
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,951
Will you guys allow me to play
basketball with everyone again?

739
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,588
I don't care even if you make me
run errands!

740
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:48,058
Please! I beg you!

741
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,962
HARUMI HOUSEKEEPING AGENCY

742
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,267
This is the referral commission
for this month.

743
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,437
Sorry to make you do this all the time.

744
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,506
Thanks.

745
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,241
I will excuse myself now.

746
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,944
Oh, one minute.

747
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,746
Here's some <i>monaka</i>.

748
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,349
They're delicious.
It's sweet, so have some.

749
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,218
OGURA <i>MONAKA</i>

750
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,489
No, I'm fine.

751
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,158
You know…

752
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,495
I heard that the eldest son in that family

753
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,929
is a handful to deal with.

754
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,500
No, not really.

755
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,602
But you know,

756
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,671
boys like him are just my cup of tea.

757
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,873
I just love boys like him!

758
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,008
Wait…

759
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,744
If I recall, your son would be
the same age as him

760
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,613
if he were still alive.

761
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,882
Oh…

762
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:49,286
Me and my mouth. Maybe I said
something unnecessary again.

763
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,022
Please excuse me.

764
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,507
Share the cola with Mom.

765
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:11,842
-Okay!
-Here.

766
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,411
Is it good?

767
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,746
Yes, it's good.

768
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,115
-You're such a baby.
-Right.

769
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,335
Just tell him
that you'll be adopted by me!

770
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,437
<i>Are you guys going to forgive that man?</i>

771
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,505
Just leave me alone!

772
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,773
What should we do?

773
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,476
I am not stating my opinion
about your family matters.

774
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,478
<i>She might have been trying
to kill herself.</i>

775
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,445
Mita.

776
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,546
Kill me.

777
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,014
As you wish.

778
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,784
<i>Just ignore me even if I tell you to stop.</i>

779
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,793
Wait….

780
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,963
<i>Please, stop it!</i>

781
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,968
