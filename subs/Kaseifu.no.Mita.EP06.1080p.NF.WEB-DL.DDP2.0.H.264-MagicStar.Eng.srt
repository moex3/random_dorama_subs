1
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,551
Welcome.

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,722
Are you going back?

3
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,091
Yes.

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,962
If only you got into the university
I'm going into

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,830
and started living alone,

6
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,434
we could be together always.

7
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,337
You're right.

8
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,017
Welcome home.

9
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,420
Oh, I'm home.

10
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,487
What about dinner?

11
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,657
I don't need it. I already ate.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,559
Your grandfather is here.

13
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,994
What?

14
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh, Yui!

15
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,070
What are you doing? You're late!

16
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,073
What's the matter, Grandpa?

17
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,407
Have a seat.

18
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,912
I was just talking to Kakeru
and the other kids.

19
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,448
Yui.

20
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,049
Let me adopt you.

21
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,151
What?

22
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,088
This is for the best,
considering your future.

23
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,090
-It's decided.
-Hold on!

24
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,791
You can't just tell us that!

25
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,527
Besides, it's not up to us
to make the decision.

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,796
I've already talked to your father.

27
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,667
What do you think

28
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,001
that man did?

29
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,536
Wait!

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,909
That man just ran off
without giving me a reply.

31
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,247
You guys

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,319
also chased that man out of this house
because you couldn't forgive him

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,388
for causing your mother
to commit suicide, right?

34
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,724
Then,

35
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,795
don't bother getting child support
and living expenses from him.

36
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,031
Just tell him
that you'll be adopted by me!

37
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,901
Grandpa, what's "adopted"?

38
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,006
It means

39
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,208
that you'll become my children.

40
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,944
But you're not my daddy!

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,815
Listen.

42
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,483
Your father…

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,686
abdicated his rights to take care of you!

44
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,156
What's "abdicated"?
Something like household chores?

45
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,624
That's not it!

46
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,561
That man lacks fatherly love.

47
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,429
What's "fatherly love"?

48
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,898
"Fatherly love"

49
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,903
is written with the words
"father" and "love".

50
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,938
Well…

51
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
"Fatherly love"

52
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,374
refers to the kind of love

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,376
a father would normally have
for his child.

54
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,510
But…

55
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,612
there are people who doubt that
this exists

56
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,815
since fathers do not give birth
to the child unlike mothers.

57
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,684
What's with your explanation?

58
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,420
I told you to leave the room!

59
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,022
I'm sorry,

60
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,291
but Ms. Urara is here.

61
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,961
What are you shouting at, Dad?

62
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,796
I told you not to say anything yet

63
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,665
since I will be late!

64
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,135
I should be asking
why you're here so late!

65
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,071
My bicycle tires went flat,
so I took the bus.

66
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,408
When I gave up my seat for an old lady,
her walking stick hit my foot.

67
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,009
I tried to endure it and run,

68
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,878
but I fell from the stairs,
and sprained my ankle.

69
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,614
Just what in the world are you doing?

70
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,082
I told you, stop shouting!

71
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,817
No wonder the children dislike you!

72
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,419
You still don't understand that?

73
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,789
In any case,

74
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,258
tell your father that…

75
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,727
you'll be adopted by me.

76
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,995
What are you saying?

77
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,196
For the children's sake,

78
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,033
the best solution is to let Keiichi
come back to the house!

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,501
Don't worry, everyone.

80
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,237
I'll talk to Keiichi.

81
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,973
I'll tell him to make it clear
he doesn't want you adopted!

82
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,342
That's not what these children want!

83
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,543
Stop being so selfish!

84
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,544
Come on.

85
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,412
-Let's go!
-It hurts!

86
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,881
Ouch! Don't step on my foot!

87
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,918
-You stepped on me!
-And stop tugging me! It hurts!

88
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,786
Let's just hurry and go home!

89
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,789
It's finally quiet now.

90
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,392
What should we do, Yui?

91
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,935
Yui!

92
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,739
Just ignore both of them!

93
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,342
Wait! You can't just say
such irresponsible things and leave!

94
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,878
Don't you think
we should do something, Yui?

95
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,481
So that Urara and Grandpa
won't do anything unnecessary.

96
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,283
Then what do you suggest we do?

97
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,686
We talked about it,

98
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,422
and we think our only choice
is to meet Dad.

99
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,457
What's that?

100
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,525
I mean,

101
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,062
we can't just go on living like this.

102
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,131
Dad attended my parent-and-teacher meeting

103
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,133
and the neighborhood council meeting.

104
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,970
That's because you guys decided it
without letting me know!

105
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,074
Then, would you have gone
if we had asked you?

106
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,077
Are you guys going to forgive that man?

107
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,047
Listen. I won't forgive you guys
if you go meet him.

108
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,049
What would we do
if the geezer comes again?

109
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,685
Could you stop shouting like him?

110
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,020
-Hey! You're the eldest!
-Seriously!

111
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,955
You have to make the decision here!

112
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,058
Stop the fight, Mita!

113
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,797
It's time for me to leave now.

114
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,538
Mita, what do you think we should do?

115
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,607
That is…

116
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,211
Hey, are you going to tell us
to decide it ourselves again?

117
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,414
Don't say that. You should tell us
your opinion once in a while.

118
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,651
What should we do
when we're being asked to be adopted?

119
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,689
No matter what happens…

120
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,465
I am not stating my opinion
about your family matters.

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,055
Mita, I don't need dinner today.

122
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,257
I need to prepare
for the photography exhibit.

123
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,359
Understood.

124
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,397
Yui!

125
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,998
Help me tie up my hair.

126
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,601
-Why don't you ask Mita?
-I want you to do it!

127
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,037
I don't have the time today as I'm busy.
Please help her, Mita.

128
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,906
Have a safe trip.

129
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,015
Mita.

130
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,917
I have a request.

131
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,421
What is it?

132
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,528
I'll head over to your house after work.

133
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,530
Then, I'll whip up something
while waiting.

134
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,265
-Sure.
-See you.

135
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,403
Natori.

136
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,505
Are you really planning to marry her?

137
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,573
Of course not.

138
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,043
She's a little down
since her affair with Chief got exposed,

139
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,045
so I'm just being nice to her.

140
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,881
There's no way I'll go out with her
for real.

141
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,216
I knew it.

142
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,818
Sorry, excuse me.

143
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,586
See you.

144
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,356
Hey!

145
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,225
What is it?

146
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,562
I won't allow you to make Kazama unhappy.

147
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,964
What?

148
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,167
She has always told me

149
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,902
that I can just be who I am.

150
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,939
She's the first person I've ever loved
with all my heart!

151
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,540
What are you saying?

152
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,710
Hey, wait!

153
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,650
You're the last person
I want to hear that from.

154
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,656
Please take your time.

155
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,494
SAWAI RESIDENTIAL HOUSE

156
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,003
MIE KAZAMA

157
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:30,076
<i>The number you have reached
is not available.</i>

158
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,418
Please excuse me.

159
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,857
What?

160
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,905
Excuse me…

161
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,907
Why are you here, Mita?

162
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,142
Kakeru said this.

163
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,080
"Go find Dad and ask him
what he thinks about the adoption."

164
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,817
"Also, keep it a secret from Yui."

165
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,920
Kii said this.

166
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,255
"I don't want to be adopted by Grandpa."

167
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,590
"Hurry up

168
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,193
and put your stone into this box!"

169
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,763
Kaito said this.

170
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,631
"If you don't hurry up,

171
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,502
Urara is going to make a mess
of everything again!"

172
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,515
Want milk, Keiichi?

173
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
Oh, I'm fine.

174
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,650
What about you, Mita?

175
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,385
I'm fine.

176
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,224
Yuck!

177
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,960
The milk is bad!

178
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
Oh, I'll have it changed.

179
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,165
Never mind, this always happens.

180
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,366
Anyway, Keiichi.

181
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,435
You should tell Dad what you think.

182
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,837
Just say that you'll raise
Yui and the kids.

183
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,238
Well…

184
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,306
But…

185
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,508
I wonder if Father-in-law
will listen to me?

186
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,311
Don't worry. I'll be with you, too.

187
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,913
Oh, thanks.

188
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,582
But…

189
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,184
What do you think, Mita?

190
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,356
What do you mean?

191
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,291
This may sound pathetic…

192
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,226
But as I mentioned to Urara,

193
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,562
I don't have the courage
to face my father-in-law.

194
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,165
What are you saying?
A man needs to have guts!

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,269
The kids said that they didn't want
to be with me,

196
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,038
so I don't think I can convince him.

197
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,106
It will be fine!

198
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,708
It is in their best interests
if they stay with you!

199
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,776
Besides,

200
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,112
I still can't forget about her.

201
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,914
I love her.

202
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,783
Are you talking about your mistress?

203
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,185
Even so,

204
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,789
I don't think I can raise them properly

205
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,257
given my circumstances.

206
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,793
I don't want to lie anymore.

207
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,863
Not to myself, nor my children.

208
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,271
Sorry.

209
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,875
I snuck out during lunch break,
so I have to get back now. See you.

210
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,343
Okay, thanks.

211
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,154
Should I just tell Kakeru and the others
about what you said?

212
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,455
What?

213
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,958
"I still can't forget about her.
I love her."

214
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,026
"Even so,

215
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,629
I don't think I can raise you properly
as a father."

216
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,365
Hey! Give me a break, will you?

217
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,367
Then, what should I say?

218
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,569
Well…

219
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,572
Just say I'll do something about it.

220
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,307
That's not it.

221
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,909
Tell them I'll think about it…

222
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,976
That won't work.

223
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,846
"Well… Just say I'll do
something about it. That's not it."

224
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,182
"Tell them I'll think about it…
That won't work."

225
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,651
-Is that it?
-No, that's not what I mean.

226
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,786
I mean…

227
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,656
I feel like the kids will get angry
no matter what I say.

228
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,526
"I mean… I feel like the kids
will get angry no matter what I say."

229
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,128
For now, just don't say anything!

230
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,266
Sorry.

231
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,203
As you wish.

232
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,073
Adoption?

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,408
Yes.

234
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,611
Your family is still going through
all those depressing stuff, I see.

235
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,681
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure
you didn't want to hear this.

236
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,616
No, that's not it.

237
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,685
I'll protect you, Asuda.

238
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,621
Sorry, Yui!

239
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,324
Could you come over
and talk to my dad right now?

240
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,391
What?

241
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,194
Why do I have to do that?

242
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,664
Don't worry.
I'll make sure Dad won't shout!

243
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,999
That's not the problem.

244
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,801
Please! We can't let this go on.

245
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,536
I'm sure you want to do something.

246
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,539
Then, why not tell my dad
what you really think?

247
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,009
YUKI RESIDENCE

248
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
Listen, Dad.

249
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,713
Don't get mad, okay?

250
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,948
Shut up! I know.

251
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,417
You're already getting mad.

252
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,920
Let's just get on with it.

253
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,655
Yui.

254
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,257
Your grandpa may look like this,

255
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,726
but he's actually a really nice person.

256
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,595
So just tell him your honest feelings.

257
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,198
Since you're the eldest,
you represent all your siblings.

258
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,266
That's right.

259
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,002
You should convince your siblings.

260
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,270
Let me adopt you.

261
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,738
Wait, Grandpa!

262
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,940
If you do so, they'll follow suit.

263
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,142
Don't say anything unnecessary, Dad!

264
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,877
I forced Yui to come here

265
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,879
-even though she has a date!
-Hey, Urara!

266
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,283
So…

267
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,353
Just what are you doing
in an illicit sexual relationship

268
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,822
at a time like this?

269
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,557
Could you not say it that way?

270
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,826
I'm serious about him.

271
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,828
What do you mean by that?

272
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,831
Don't tell me…

273
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,166
-You're not pregnant, are you?
-Stop it, Dad!

274
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,634
There's no way Yui would--

275
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,702
I…

276
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,471
I will never let you take care of me.

277
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:00,940
What did you say?

278
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,942
Wait. Calm down, Yui--

279
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,146
I want you and your siblings to be happy
since you're Nagiko's children.

280
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,480
What are you unhappy about?

281
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,682
What about you, Grandpa?

282
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,150
Did you love Mom?

283
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,352
What are you saying?

284
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,553
Of course, I did!

285
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,122
Then, why did Mom complain about you?

286
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,058
She said you always decided everything,

287
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,594
and that you only ever complained
about the family!

288
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,829
No way. Nagiko said that?

289
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,831
Mom told me…

290
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,734
people around you were always suffering.

291
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,371
She said it's your fault
that Grandma died.

292
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,372
Shut up!

293
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,076
Everyone you care about dies!

294
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,046
Hey! Don't do that, Dad!

295
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,315
Wait, Yui!

296
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,783
Wait for me!

297
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,786
Yui! Wait!

298
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,122
Hold on!

299
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,858
Yui! Wait for me, will you…

300
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,727
It hurts…

301
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,897
Sorry that things turned out this way.

302
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,032
But I'll do something about Dad--

303
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,967
Please, just stop meddling already!

304
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,405
Why don't you realize
that you're causing trouble for everyone?

305
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,241
Nothing turns out well
when you interfere, Urara!

306
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,745
Just leave me alone!

307
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,114
Both you and Grandpa should stop!

308
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,058
Sounds like Yui is home.

309
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,327
Mita, please keep it a secret from Yui!

310
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,864
Hey.

311
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,866
What were you guys talking about?

312
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,200
Nothing.

313
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,040
Explain it to me, Mita.

314
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm sorry,

315
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,911
but I'm told to keep it a secret from you.

316
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,616
What are you guys doing in secret?

317
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,352
We weren't being secretive.

318
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,220
You weren't doing anything,

319
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,824
so we just asked Mita to ask
what Dad is thinking.

320
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,159
That's all.

321
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,165
So?

322
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,033
What did he say?

323
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,272
"For now, just don't say anything!"

324
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,340
"Sorry."

325
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,941
That was what he said.

326
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,378
What's that?

327
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,647
I will prepare the bath.

328
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,221
Hey.

329
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,689
What should we do, Yui?

330
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,424
Just do whatever you want!

331
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,760
I don't even care

332
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,195
if you get adopted or not!

333
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,397
How could you say that
as the eldest child?

334
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,000
I didn't want to be the eldest child!

335
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,769
We just happened to share
the same parents, that's all!

336
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,304
What did you say?

337
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,639
Are you serious about that?

338
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,843
Hey. What did Yui mean by that?

339
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,178
That means she doesn't care about us!

340
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,715
No way. That's not true, right, Yui?

341
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,051
What the heck?

342
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,454
And here you are flirting with some guy
late into the night.

343
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,390
What does "flirting" mean?

344
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,724
What?

345
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,725
Like,

346
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,793
when you kiss

347
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,229
-or have sex--
-Don't teach Kii weird things!

348
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,296
Shut up!

349
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,299
-You don't even care about us, right?
-Seriously, stop it!

350
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,903
Stop fighting, the both of you!

351
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,209
What?

352
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,444
What about dinner?

353
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,979
I don't need any.

354
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,715
Also, could you shut them up?

355
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,450
As you wish.

356
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,823
Never mind, stop it!

357
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,862
Just what's wrong
with every single one of you?

358
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,766
Just leave me alone!

YUI ASUDA

363
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,835
I don't want to go back to my home.

364
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,970
What's wrong?

365
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,639
My mom has been really annoying lately.

366
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,442
She doesn't like it
that I invited you over.

367
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,644
She has been nagging nonstop
since yesterday.

368
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,847
I'm not a kid anymore.

369
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,849
Man, I just want to go somewhere.

370
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,650
Then…

371
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,320
Shall we go somewhere far away?

372
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,256
-What?
-I've been thinking about moving out

373
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,327
every time I see
my siblings' faces lately.

374
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,099
It doesn't matter where we go
as long as it's with someone I love.

375
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,769
Shall we be together forever?

376
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,971
Until death do us apart.

377
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,540
Yes, you're right.

378
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,743
Then, I'll go back and pack my stuff.

379
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,437
Are you going out?

380
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,174
I'm leaving this house.

381
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,479
I just want to be with the one I love

382
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,214
without anyone getting in my way.

383
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,517
Besides,

384
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,353
my siblings wouldn't be troubled
without me

385
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,556
since you're here, Mita.

386
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,527

00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,696
I'm waiting for someone.

392
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,432
Scary.

393
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, wow!

394
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,608
The food looks great as usual!

395
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,675
I'm digging in!

396
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
I'm digging in!

397
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,678
Mita.

398
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,014
What's taking Yui so long?

399
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,250
I want her to tie up my hair.

400
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,655
She said that she's leaving this house.

401
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,323
Wait. What was that?

402
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,727
She says that she wants to be with

403
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,397
the person she loves forever
without anyone interfering in her life.

404
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,132
Why didn't you stop her?

405
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,602
I don't have the right to do that.

406
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,137
What should we do?

407
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,106
Kakeru! Kai!

408
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,174
There's nothing much we can do.

409
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,511
Just ignore that irresponsible person!

Sorry. Can we talk for a minute?

413
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,773
Haven't I told you?

414
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,142
Please stop acting like a stalker.

415
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,578
I don't think you should
go out with Natori.

416
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,281
I overheard his conversation
the other day.

417
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,018
He said he wasn't serious about you.

418
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,389
He said that

419
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,459
he was just trying to comfort you
because our affair got exposed--

420
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,861
Please don't ever say that again.

421
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,865
Don't you feel ashamed
of defaming someone else?

422
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:14,866
No,

423
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,069
I just wanted you to be happy--

424
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,670
Please stop this already.

425
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,642
Just where did the Chief I loved go?

426
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,711
Please excuse me.

427
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,621
Dad!

428
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,527
How did it go?

429
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,129
She's not here!

430
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,732
-What about you?
-She's not answering the phone.

431
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,469
Could Yui be on a train already?

432
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,705
Do you know any place she would go, Dad?

433
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,907
No, not at all.

434
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,411
Then, will Yui never return?

435
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,481
That won't happen, Kii.

436
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,549
There's no way Yui will abandon you guys.

437
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,617
Then…

438
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,887
What about you, Dad?

439
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,955
What?

440
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,691
What are you going to do about us?

441
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,061
Are you okay with letting Grandpa
adopt us?

442
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,797
That's not true.

443
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,665
Then, why won't you tell him that?

444
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,668
But I need to consider your feelings, too.

445
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,937
I don't want to be adopted!

446
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:30,142
I have no idea what you're thinking, Dad.

447
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,378
Sorry.

448
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,058
No way! Elope?

449
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,061
Yes. She should know
that there's no way I would do that.

450
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,565
I already have a recommendation
from a university.

451
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,901
Asuda has been acting really dangerous
recently.

452
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,104
I just tried going out with her,
but she's too serious about this.

453
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,473
Then, you should have gone out with me.

454
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,275
Well…

455
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,143
Why don't you come to my house tonight?

456
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,213
Can I? I'll really go, you know.

457
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,414
Sure. I don't mind.

458
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,225
You're the only one I trusted, Ozawa.

459
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,263
I thought you really loved me!

460
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,800
You're the same as my dad!

461
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,002
-That's not it--
-Don't touch me!

462
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,521
Was this how Mom felt?

463
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,159
When she found out that Dad betrayed her.

464
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,901
Sorry. I was following you.

465
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,271
I just couldn't talk to you

466
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,740
since you might think
I'm trying to meddle again.

467
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,112
Let's go home, Yui.

468
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,554
Welcome home.

469
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,756
Oh, Mita. Where's everyone?

470
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,626
They left to find Yui.

471
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,569
I leave Yui to you, Mita.

472
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,373
What do you mean by that?

473
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,509
I mean…

474
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,212
She might have been trying
to kill herself.

475
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,613
Come in.

476
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,952
I brought you your washed clothes.

477
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,887
Just put them away.

478
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,390
As you wish.

479
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,804
I…

480
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,209
When I was young,

481
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,214
I loved Dad the most in this world.

482
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,526
When I entered high school,

483
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,263
someone else took over his place.

484
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,337
But it seems like I'm always betrayed
by the ones I love.

485
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,806
Just like Mom.

486
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,209
I've had enough.

487
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,414
They're all dirty!

488
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,686
I'm most upset at myself!

489
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:10,955
I…

490
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,226
I shouldn't have been born.

491
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,961
If I weren't born,

492
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,164
Mom wouldn't have married that man,

493
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,366
nor would she have killed herself!

494
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:26,905
Mita.

495
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,077
Yes?

496
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,013
Kill me.

497
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,555
As you wish.

498
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,380
Stop!

499
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,123
As you wish.

500
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,148
It was too sudden just then…

501
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,551
So I was surprised.

502
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,655
Just ignore me even if I tell you to stop.

503
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,859
As you wish.

504
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,360
No!

505
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,699
Wait…

506
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,702
Wait a minute!

507
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,739
Please, stop it!

508
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:55,947
Don't come near!

509
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,452
Don't come closer!

510
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,787
Don't come closer!

511
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,478
Please, stop it!

512
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,097
Don't come closer!

513
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,600
I'll really kill you!

514
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,045
Aren't you scared of dying?

515
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,448
I'm not.

516
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,186
Don't tell me…

517
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,723
Have you tried killing yourself before?

518
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,959
I have.

519
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,761
Then, why didn't you die?

520
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,933
Because of Ms. Harumi
from the housekeeping agency.

521
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,305
"I'm sure that there is a reason

522
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,243
God wants you to be alive."

523
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,780
That was what she told me.

524
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,884
Yui!

525
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,755
Hey! What are you doing, Yui?

526
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,289
Don't come close!

527
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,491
What are you doing, Yui?

528
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,493
If you come close, I'll kill myself!

529
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,132
Then, tell me.

530
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,667
Is there a reason for me to be alive?

531
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,040
I don't want to suffer anymore.

532
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:07,745
The ones I love betray me,
and there's nothing I can do about it.

533
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,081
Aren't I better off dead?

534
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,085
That is…

535
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,854
Are you telling me
to decide it for myself again?

536
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,198
That is…

537
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,869
because you are happy.

538
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,008
Just how am I happy?

539
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,912
You…

540
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,048
still have this home.

541
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,752
You still have family members

542
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,887
who love you.

543
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,827
If you were to die…

544
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,698
I'm sure you know…

545
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,936
how hurt they will be.

546
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,371
Yui.

547
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,508
Your mother

548
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,910
gave you your name.

549
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,016
We just graduated from university

550
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,019
when she learned
she was pregnant with you.

551
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,623
Your grandpa was completely against
keeping you,

552
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,959
but…

553
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,095
she said she would give birth to you
no matter what.

554
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,969
Her labor pains were bad,

555
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,304
and it took a long time to deliver you.

556
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,507
I believe your mother
had a really hard time,

557
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,576
but she kept saying this
while she was on labor.

558
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,247
"I'll give birth to this child
no matter what."

559
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,916
"She has to come to this world."

560
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,119
<i>"I'm sure that this child
will bring our family together."</i>

561
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,321
YUI

562
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,725
If you hadn't been born,

563
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,594
Kakeru and the rest
wouldn't have been born, too.

564
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,329
Yui…

565
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,466
If you weren't here,

566
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,535
the family would have fallen apart.

567
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,338
I don't care what happens to me.

568
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,507
But not you.

569
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,944
You can't leave this family.

570
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,613
You have to be everyone's older sister!

571
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,283
You can't leave!

572
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,590
If you weren't here,

573
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,458
who am I supposed to quarrel with?

574
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,529
I want to enter
a better university than yours,

575
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,765
and tease you about it!

576
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,001
I can't have you leave us.

577
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,804
Yui.

578
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,274
Are you not going to tie up my hair again?

579
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,758
Mita.

580
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,361
Do you have a hair tie?

581
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,097
I do.

582
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,248
Come over, Kii.

583
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,250
Okay.

584
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,813
It's done, Kii.

585
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,881
Thanks.

586
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,501
Dad.

587
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,139
Could you reject Grandpa clearly?

588
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,007
About the adoption.

589
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,075
What?

590
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,382
Right…

591
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,450
Okay.

592
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,652
I got it.

593
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,388
Also…

594
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,727
Show us proof that you love us.

595
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,600
Prove that you love us,
more than anyone else in this world.

596
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,340
I don't want to be betrayed anymore.

597
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,477
I don't want to be afraid
of being abandoned anymore.

598
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,681
Prove that you love us.

599
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,451
I want you

600
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,753
to put your stone into the box.

601
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,463
This is…

602
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,932
how we feel.

605
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,992
Kii has fallen asleep,

606
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,727
so I will excuse myself now.

607
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,464
Hey, Mita.

608
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,502
Yes?

609
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,572
Being able

610
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,976
to always sleep on
clean and fluffy bedsheets…

611
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,947
brings such a happy feeling.

612
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,616
Maybe…

613
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,020
Mom always cheered us on
whenever she changed our bedsheets.

614
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,091
"Even if you had a rough day,

615
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,694
it will all be fine
with a good night's sleep."

616
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,665
I wish I had realized this

617
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,201
when Mom was still alive.

618
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,309
Hey, Mita.

619
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,445
You told me

620
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,915
that I still have family members
who love me.

621
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,619
Could it be that…

622
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,789
your family members have passed away?

623
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,328
I'm sorry…

624
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,498
But I cannot reveal personal information.

625
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,234
Don't say that. Just tell me.

626
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,837
Didn't you just express
how you felt for the first time?

Did Mita lose her family members
in an accident or something?

639
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,771
Hey, could you guys give me a break?

640
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,773
I told you I can't.

641
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,842
That's why she stopped smiling, right?

642
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,910
The other day,

643
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,378
I ordered her to smile

644
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,948
and she said that she's going to quit
if I insist on it.

645
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,283
Akari said that?

646
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,352
She said she tried to kill herself, too.

647
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,686
But you told her,

648
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,156
"There is a reason God wants you to live."

649
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,225
Right…

650
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,561
But you see…

651
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,098
That girl

652
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,967
was as good as an empty shell.

653
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,702
Well…

654
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,140
I can't believe that happened.

655
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,042
Oh, no more!

656
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,810
I won't say anything more!

657
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,846
Move aside.

658
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,048
Does she always go to that amusement park

659
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,517
and get a family set
even though she ate none of it

660
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,853
because it was a memorable place for her?

661
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,255
That reminds me.

662
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,724
The three of them
always went there together.

663
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,661
All right, let's go!

664
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,862
What?

665
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,930
Hey, wait…

666
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,532
Hey…

00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,735
Don't tell Akari
that you heard it from me!

668
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,085
I'm sorry…

669
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,955
but could you not stand behind me?

670
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,698
You had a husband and child. Right, Mita?

671
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,436
The amusement park is the one
your family always went to?

672
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,839
Why did your family members pass away?

673
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,409
Please. Tell us, Mita.

674
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,450
I…

675
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,688
killed them.

676
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,736
<i>You would never kill
your family members, Mita.</i>

677
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,705
Could you please not reveal
anything about my past

678
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,307
from now on?

679
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,608
I'm sorry.

680
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,410
It's too late.

681
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,011
We received a warning call.

682
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,279
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

683
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,014
<i>Stop, Mita!</i>

684
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,717
What should I do to prove
that I really love them?

685
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,054
It hurts!

686
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,589
<i>I will tear all of you apart.</i>

687
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,824
Give me back my grandchild!

688
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,159
I should have died.

689
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,627
Damn it!

690
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,968
