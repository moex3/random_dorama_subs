1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,176
What do you want to eat today?

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,782
-What do you want?
-Curry rice!

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,353
Why did your family members pass away?

4
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,257
I...

5
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,326
killed them.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,396
Dear me...

7
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,664
Akari said that?

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,267
That's not true, is it?

9
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,736
We kept asking her after that,

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,638
but she wouldn't tell us anything.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,273
Well... I'm sorry,

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,145
but I can't tell you guys anything today.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,814
Because of <i>that</i>, remember?

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,685
Please tell us! You're the only one
we can rely on, President.

15
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,089
Dear me, could you not
use your charms on me?

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,592
Then you can answer
yes or no questions, right?

17
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,794
What?

18
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,499
What's these? Oh, my!

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:11,471
It's just like a quiz show!
This is interesting!

20
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,106
-Then question one.
-Okay.

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,175
Mita's deceased family members

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,810
are her husband and child, right?

23
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,344
Yes, that's right!

24
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:25,385
Hey, how could you?
That's why I didn't want to say anything.

25
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,986
Just what's wrong?

26
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,723
Oh, there's 20 seconds left.

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,226
-18, 17, 16...
-Wait. What are you doing?

28
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,095
-15, 14...
-Is Mita coming?

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,262
That's right!

30
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,798
-Come on, hide!
-Hurry up!

31
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,635
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

32
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:47,941
six, five, four, three, two, one.

33
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,778
Oh my, Akari.

34
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,381
You're right on time, as always.

35
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,919
What is it? You told me that
there's something you want to tell me.

36
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,222
I'm sorry, but...

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:07,627
Could you please not reveal anything
about my past from now on?

38
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,797
To Yui and the children.

39
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,466
Got it. I'm sorry.

40
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:18,938
Since all of you are here,
let me make myself clear.

41
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,175
From now on,

42
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,880
I do not intend on answering
any questions you may have.

43
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,416
Please excuse me.

44
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,585
Just tell us, please!

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,222
She's right! Of course we'd get curious
if you said something like that!

46
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,724
I searched on the internet,

47
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,226
but I didn't see you listed as a suspect
in any murder cases.

48
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:50,136
If you insist on questioning me,
I will relieve myself of my duties.

49
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,206
Hey. What does it mean
to "relieve myself of my duties"?

50
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,441
Mita means that she's going to quit.

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,177
What? No!

52
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,213
I have an important request for you, Mita!

53
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,017
Fine.

54
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,985
Let's go, everyone.

55
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,628
Akari.

56
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,599
Could you be perhaps...

57
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:25,672
still concerned about
what your husband's parents told you?

58
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,843
Didn't I tell you? That wasn't your fault.

59
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,980
Please excuse me.

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

61
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,044
Do you need anything from me?

62
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,746
Oh, sorry.

63
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:12,185
Right. Kii, didn't you say
you have a request for Mita?

64
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,621
I'm going to be acting
as Dorothy from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>

65
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,624
for our upcoming play performance.

66
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,227
Mita, will you sew me a dress?

67
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,629
As you wish.

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,233
Wow! You're great, Kii.
It's the leading role!

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,738
I see. It's on this coming Saturday.
We have to attend it together.

70
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,773
What's wrong, Kii?

71
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,843
Daddy...

72
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,245
You guys think he'll come?

73
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,613
What?

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,184
He couldn't make it to last year's play
because he had work.

75
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,322
Yui, you think Dad's okay?

76
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,892
He'll do what you asked, right?

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,665
<i>Prove that you love us,
more than anyone else in this world.</i>

78
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,034
<i>Prove that you love us.</i>

79
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,204
<i>I want you to put your stone into the box.</i>

80
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,410
I'm sure he'll be fine.

81
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,111
But...

82
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,180
Doesn't he still love that mistress?

83
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,085
He even tried to abandon us to marry her.

84
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,790
Hey, Yui. Should we really just
do nothing and wait?

85
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,795
Mita. What do you think we should do?

86
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,564
That is...

87
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,034
something all of you
should decide for yourselves.

88
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,071
There you go, pushing the question
back to us again.

89
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,708
Then could you pass a message to Dad?

90
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,644
"You must attend Kii's play,

91
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,181
and let us hear your reply
to my question."

92
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,250
As you wish.

93
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,537
You surprised me...

94
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,240
with that phone call
telling me to save you.

95
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,609
Sorry.

96
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,845
Come in.

97
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,323
Want some coffee?

98
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,494
It was as you said, Chief.

99
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,662
What?

100
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,531
Natori...

101
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,901
He decided to have a blind date
with the director's daughter.

102
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,407
I must be a fool.

103
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,243
I should have realized it earlier.

104
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,047
Natori told me just now.

105
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,452
"Just how long do you plan on
staying in this company?

106
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,624
Everyone wants you to quit.
Why won't you realize it?"

107
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,060
Sorry.

108
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,963
It's all my fault.

109
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,031
Then...

110
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,001
Could you take responsibility?

111
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,639
I only have you left, Keiichi.

112
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,176
Why don't we go somewhere far away

113
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,977
and start all over again?

114
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,518
Well...

115
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,827
I'm joking.
You can't just abandon your kids.

116
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:48,901
I'm returning to the countryside
to have a blind date.

117
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,342
Wait, Mie. Hold on!

118
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,945
You surprised me!

119
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,080
If I remember, you're...

120
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,950
I'm Mita, a housekeeper.

121
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,453
What's wrong, Mita?

122
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,190
I have a message for you from Yui.

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,127
Please excuse me.

124
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,638
I always had to work during the weekends,

125
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,743
so I've never attended her school events.

126
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,379
So?

127
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,981
What?

128
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,551
What should I tell Yui and the children?

129
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,588
Oh, well...

130
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,560
For now, please don't tell them about
that lady just now.

131
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,695
Besides, we weren't
doing anything indecent.

132
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,035
Understood.

133
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,475
Also, about the play...

134
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,648
Of course I'd love to go,

135
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,052
but I still don't know what I should do,
to be honest.

136
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,891
What should I do
to prove my love for them as a father?

137
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,230
Even if I said I love them,

138
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,732
I don't think they would believe it.

139
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,440
What do you think I should do, Mita?

140
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,209
That is...

141
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,778
"Something you should decide
for yourself."

142
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,446
Please don't say that. Help me.

143
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,316
If I mess up this time,
it's all over for me.

144
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,822
I still have work to do,
so please excuse me.

145
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,560
Wait a minute. Hey, Mita! Wait!

146
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,764
It hurts!

147
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,867
I'm sorry...

148
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,571
but could you not stand behind me?

149
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,466
So, what did Dad say?

150
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,136
"I will definitely attend the play,

151
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,641
and prove my love for the kids.
So don't worry."

152
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,709
That was what he said.

153
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,680
He sounds really confident,
but will it be fine?

154
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:52,885
Didn't Dad probably tell you to
say that for now?

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,321
Yes.

156
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,056
What's up with that?

157
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,059
Hey. Did it look like
he's not meeting his mistress already?

158
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,370
It's done.

159
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,608
Wow! It looks like
those being sold in shops!

160
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,744
This is awesome!

161
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,381
Mita avoided our question
for the first time, didn't she?

162
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,917
They couldn't still be
having rendezvous, right?

163
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,318
What's a "rendezvous"?

164
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,622
That means,
a man and woman going to a hotel--

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,257
Don't teach her weird things.

166
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,393
Kii, why don't you try on the dress?

167
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,663
Okay! Then will you guys practice with me?

168
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,799
What? Give me a break!

169
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,170
Please! Daddy's going to watch it,
so I don't want to make a mistake.

170
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,643
Okay. I'll be Dorothy,
Yui will be the Scarecrow,

171
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,281
Kakeru will be the Tin Woodman
and Kai will be the Lion.

172
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,016
Then who will be the Wicked Witch?

173
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,025
Is that an order?

174
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,600
We came here to punish you, Wicked Witch!

175
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,337
I wanted to make all of you my slaves,

176
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,507
but there's no way a tin man,
scarecrow, lion and a small girl like you

177
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,744
will be useful,
so I will tear all of you apart.

178
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,780
You're scary, Mita!

179
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,017
Actually, could you put in more emotion?

180
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,054
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,357
Then let's try again.

182
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,895
We came here to punish you, Wicked Witch!

183
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,397
I wanted to make all of you my slaves,

184
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,967
but there's no way a tin man,
scarecrow, lion and a small girl like you

185
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,870
will be useful,
so I will tear all of you apart.

186
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,241
Hey, it's your line next, Yui!

187
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,442
Sorry, one minute.

188
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,378
What? Your boyfriend again?

189
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,580
TAKUYA OZAWA
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY

190
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,282
"PLEASE, LET'S HAVE A PROPER TALK."

191
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,889
I'm sorry about the other day.

192
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,958
You told me to elope with you,

193
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,394
but I didn't think you'd do it for real.

194
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,397
-What I mean is--
-I'm sorry.

195
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,900
I want to break up with you, Ozawa.

196
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,937
I realized something.

197
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,406
When I was going out with you,

198
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,211
I was just trying to ignore
my selfish side as well as the reality.

199
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,980
I don't want to run away anymore.

200
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,950
I want to become stronger.

201
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,122
Please excuse me.

202
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,632
Urara!

203
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,305
Urara.

204
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,739
What is it?

205
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,244
Thanks for what you did the other day.

206
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,279
What?

207
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,053
<i>Let's go home, Yui.</i>

208
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,289
Oh, I...

209
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,327
That's... Don't mention it!

210
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,598
That's with your strange reaction?

211
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,832
Well...

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,901
This is the first time.

213
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,104
You actually thanked me.

214
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,545
Could you apologize to Grandpa
on my behalf, too?

215
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,282
<i>Everyone you care about dies!</i>

216
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,387
Don't worry. He should get chastised
once in a while.

217
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,391
Besides, Dad's worried about
the slap he gave you.

218
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,762
I'm totally fine. It was all my fault.

219
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,967
What is it?

220
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,370
It feels like you've matured

221
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,405
and become more reliable.

222
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,774
That's not true. What are you saying?

223
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,111
I can't lose to you.
All right, I'm getting pumped up now!

224
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,114
-Sorry!
-Hey, are you all right?

225
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,082
I'm totally fine.

226
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,018
I'm home.

227
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,622
What are you up to, Dad?

228
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,893
Do I smell?

229
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,796
What? What are you saying all of a sudden?

230
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,667
I just remember Yui and the kids
saying that to me in the past.

231
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,169
"You smell, Grandpa!"

232
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,805
That's not true.

233
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,875
Yui also wants to apologize for
the mean remarks the other day.

234
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,246
Come on. I'll do this, so why don't you
go in the bath now?

235
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,314
Okay.

236
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,459
You know...

237
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,430
I'm actually quite happy
living with you, Dad.

238
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,764
Shut up.

239
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:09,601
Right. Kii's playing the main lead
in her upcoming play performance.

240
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,837
I told her that you'll go watch.

241
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,839
She probably doesn't want me there.

242
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,410
Why don't you be honest?

243
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,180
Yui's being considerate of you.

244
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,582
Since when did I ask her
to be considerate?

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,485
You know that's not what I mean.

246
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,922
I will never go!

247
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,824
Don't you go, too!

248
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,202
HOW TO BECOME A GOOD FATHER

249
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,079
MIE KAZAMA: I'M RETURNING
TO THE COUNTRYSIDE THIS SUNDAY.

250
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,247
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

251
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,120
I heard about it.

252
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,455
Congratulations on
your engagement, Natori.

253
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,391
You're jumping the gun.

254
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,127
Honestly, I was interested in you, Natori.

255
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,662
There's no way we'll win
the director's daughter.

256
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,199
We'll count on you forever in work!

257
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,702
Just leave everything to me.

258
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,475
I believe I told you
not to make Kazama unhappy.

259
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,912
Don't make such a scary face.

260
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,013
Hold on.

261
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,883
Just give it a rest already.

262
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,619
Unlike you, I'm someone
important in this company.

263
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,921
I don't have time to
get involved in a woman like her.

264
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,957
Don't mess with me!

265
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:44,096
Then why did you tell her you love her?
She was really happy about it!

266
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,765
Our affair was exposed,
and you told her you loved her.

267
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,435
And you'll abandon her this easily
just for your own career?

268
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,838
Just what is love? Hey, tell me!

269
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,906
What are you saying?

270
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,907
Let go!

271
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,109
I just don't get it!

272
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,546
What should I do to prove that
I really love someone?

273
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,248
Do you just need to tell them that
you love them?

274
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,251
Hey, tell me! What should I do?

275
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,454
I don't know what to do anymore!

276
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,456
I really don't know!

277
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,993
Goodbye, Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Lion.

278
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,995
Thank you for everything.

279
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,098
Don't go, Dorothy!

280
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,335
Hey. It's your line now, Kakeru.

281
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,704
What? Oh, sorry!

282
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,439
Come on, do it properly!

283
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,941
Sorry.

284
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,410
I will get the door.

285
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,379
By the way, I have exams.

286
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,914
I don't have time for this.

287
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,084
It's for our cute little sister.
Come on, one more time.

288
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,420
Don't go, Dorothy.

289
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,455
Hey, I heard you guys were practicing,

290
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,991
so let me do something, too!
I can be the mean stepmother.

291
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,626
Don't worry, Urara.

292
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,995
There's no mean stepmother
in this story, too.

293
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,330
I see.

294
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,999
Right, I bought some food,
so let's share them!

295
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,702
They sell delicious takoyaki!

296
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,339
Look, Urara! Mita made this dress for me!

297
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,974
What?

298
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,577
Oh, sorry!

299
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,046
It's only going to get dirtier
if you rub the stains!

300
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,081
Oh, sorry!

301
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,550
The play's tomorrow!

302
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,553
All because someone butted in again!

303
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,089
Please! Just don't do anything
and stand still!

304
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,257
Sorry.

305
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,393
Stop that!
Urara didn't do that on purpose.

306
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,198
Mita, could you do something about this
before tomorrow?

307
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,133
Don't worry.

308
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,751
Kii, Mita's going to remove the stain
for you, so let's have some takoyaki.

309
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,286
Okay.

310
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,355
Here you go! I'll go get some tea now.

311
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,026
-Yui.
-Yes?

312
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,664
Daddy will come tomorrow, right?

313
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,098
What?

314
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,067
Well, yes.

315
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,835
I think so.

316
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,806
Don't worry!
You should believe in your dad!

317
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,643
Mita. Has Dad contacted you?

318
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,680
No, he hasn't.

319
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,181
Then shall I call him?

320
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,317
No! Don't do anything unnecessary.

321
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,185
Sorry.

322
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,603
This is Mita, the housekeeper.

323
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,838
Mita.

324
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,443
Can I meet you
after you're done with work today?

325
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,080
I'll pay you the overtime fee.

326
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,382
As you wish.

327
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,366
What do you need from me?

328
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,036
Actually...

329
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,673
I've been fired from my company.

330
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:21,546
And I still don't know
how I should prove my love for the kids.

331
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,424
This is the worst.

332
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,060
At this rate,

333
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,563
I'll never have the confidence
to put my stone into Kii's box.

334
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,700
Huh?

335
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,104
It's not here.

336
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,243
I lost the stone Kii gave me!

337
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,785
Wait a minute...

338
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,358
Mita, do you have a torchlight?

339
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,460
I do.

340
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,767
Seriously, when did I drop it?

341
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,738
Oh, there it is!

342
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,476
What with all these similar stones?

343
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,678
Just where did I drop it?

344
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,090
Just what in the world should I do?

345
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,526
Mita.

346
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,497
You'll do everything I ask, right?

347
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,799
If it is within my means.

348
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,804
Then could you let me
return to the company?

349
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,706
I can't.

350
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,241
Could you turn back time?

351
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:57,909
I can't.

352
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,180
I guessed as much. Then...

353
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,650
Right.

354
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,420
Could you stop
the play performance tomorrow?

355
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,723
If the play's postponed,

356
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,993
I might come up with an idea
to earn the kids' forgiveness.

357
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,828
Right! Please do that!

358
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,698
As you wish.

359
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,649
<i>THE WIZARD OF OZ</i>

360
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,718
Stop that!

361
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,888
Why did you hit me?

362
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,290
I'm actually a coward.

363
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,827
I can't sleep because
I'm afraid of the dark.

364
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,630
Will Oz be able to grant me courage?

365
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,665
-Dad's still not here yet?
-I'm sure he will!

366
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,400
-I'm sure he'll be here soon.
-That's right! Why don't you...

367
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,334
Please stop this!

368
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,813
-Mita?
-Mita!

369
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,054
Mita!

370
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,055
Mita!

371
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,825
Hey! Someone call the police!

372
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,660
Stop, Mita!

373
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,496
Hey! What are you doing?

374
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,834
<i>THE WIZARD OF OZ</i>

375
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,734
Stop it!

376
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,675
NOVEMBER 26TH, 10 A.M. TO 2 P.M.
MISAWA KINDERGARTEN

377
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,859
<i>This is Mita, the housekeeper.</i>

378
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,928
Oh, hello? It's me.

379
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,866
Well, about the matter at the kindergarten
I asked yesterday...

380
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,468
Could you forget about that?

381
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,604
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,906
It's too late.

383
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,140
What?

384
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,943
Just what did you do?

385
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,083
Wait, where are you right now?

386
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,186
I cannot answer you.

387
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,855
<i>Hey, Mita!</i>

388
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,293
Just what will happen to the play?

389
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,362
Tsubasa was really looking forward to it!

390
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,932
I'm sorry, but the police
will need to do their investigation first.

391
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,568
Excuse me. What happened here?

392
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,270
We received a warning call.

393
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,038
If we don't cancel the play,

394
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,406
the kindergarten will be bombed.

395
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,507
What?

396
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,708
Don't tell me...

397
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,747
Your housekeeper isn't behind this,
is she?

398
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,256
I'm really sorry about this!

399
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,093
ASAZU POLICE STATION

400
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,705
I'm glad we settled matters
with the kindergarten amicably.

401
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,142
But to be honest, this is a serious crime.

402
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,413
They gave me a harsh reprimand.

403
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,456
Excuse me, but what about the play?

404
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,559
It has ended.

405
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:37,963
I see.

406
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,902
THEATER PLAY
<i>THE WIZARD OF OZ</i>

407
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,338
I wished I could have seen...

408
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,908
Kii's acting in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

409
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,651
You must think I'm being ridiculous.

410
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,713
I'm such a hopeless man.

411
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,926
I should have died instead of my wife.

412
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,998
Damn it!

413
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,206
Daddy!

414
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,711
-Dad!
-Daddy!

415
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,113
Daddy!

416
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,015
Why are they here?

417
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,584
Yui and the kids asked me

418
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,956
why you tried to stop the play.

419
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:16,394
So I told them that you lost your job
as well as the stone Kii gave,

420
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,796
and that you no longer have

421
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,965
the confidence to
prove your love for them.

422
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,767
I told them everything.

423
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,703
-Daddy!
-Dad!

424
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,439
-Dad!
-Don't come over!

425
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,974
You heard from Mita, right?

426
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,612
I don't have the right to be your father!

427
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,954
You guys are better off
being adopted by your grandfather!

428
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,057
I'm sure you'll be happier that way!

429
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,635
We get it already!

430
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,343
Then we have one last request for you.

431
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,313
Daddy!

432
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,849
Watch me act as Dorothy!

433
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,816
In fact,

434
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,586
you must watch it!

435
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,554
The old hag next door complained,

436
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,791
and Kii was removed from her role!

437
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,060
What?

438
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:23,695
Dad!

439
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,033
Our own play performance hasn't ended yet.

440
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,751
Goodbye, Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Lion.

441
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,053
Thank you for everything.

442
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,790
I will never forget all of you!

443
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,392
Don't leave, Dorothy!

444
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,994
If we hadn't met you,

445
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,397
I wouldn't have received
this gentle heart!

446
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,802
I wouldn't have received
this wonderful brain!

447
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,472
And I would have remained as a coward.

448
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,274
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,845
But I have to go home.

450
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,915
I have to go home,
where my beloved family is waiting for me.

451
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,056
All right! Everyone, come sing with me!

452
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:30,395
<i>After climbing up this slope</i>

453
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:34,065
<i>There's a tree to the right</i>

454
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,369
<i>When you turn at the tree
and walk straight</i>

455
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,773
<i>Your beloved home is there waiting for you</i>

456
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,348
What's wrong, Dad?

457
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,219
Well...

458
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:02,360
I wish your mother could have seen this.

459
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,803
I'm sure that...

460
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,175
your mom would have loved to see this,
more than anyone else.

461
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,579
But...

462
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,484
It's all because of me.

463
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,062
Your mother...

464
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:43,635
Unlike me, she was full of love.

465
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,740
Ever since I met her for the first time,

466
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,611
she always cried, got angry, and laughed.

467
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,716
She was always honest to her feelings.

468
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,722
She hated to keep secrets
and worried too much,

469
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,060
but she loved me more than anyone else.

470
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,165
Did you guys know

471
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,101
what she told me when we got married?

472
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,609
"Thank you for granting me my dream."

473
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,115
That was how she is.

474
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,053
I should have loved her more.

475
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,092
I...

476
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,863
I let your beloved mother die!

477
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,505
It's not something
that can be easily forgiven.

478
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,478
But I'm really sorry!

479
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,515
I'm really, really sorry!

480
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,992
You don't have to forgive me.

481
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,161
You don't have to love me.

482
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,364
But I...

483
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,666
I...

484
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,702
I want to love all of you!

485
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,108
I want to continue loving all of you
for the rest of my life!

486
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,014
Unlike other fathers...

487
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,418
I can't say that I love you confidently.

488
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,357
But that's what I feel now. I'm not lying.

489
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,096
I want to love all of you,
as much as possible!

490
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,399
I want us to be together forever!

491
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,736
I want to see you kids grow up,
and watch how you lead your lives!

492
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,806
I want to talk about
a lot of things with you!

493
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,342
I want to tell you guys about your mother!

494
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,077
When you're having a tough time,

495
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,546
I will support you.

496
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,615
I'll do anything I can!

497
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,583
I'll do everything I can to protect you!

498
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,252
So...

499
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,553
So, I...

500
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,358
Could you let me be your father?

501
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,098
I lost Kii's stone,

502
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,402
but let me be your father!

503
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,638
I beg you!

504
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,822
I'm sorry, but I acted out of my place.

505
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:54,926
What?

506
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,503
Mita...

507
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,372
How did you find this?

508
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,877
I thought that you might have lost it
in your company,

509
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,213
so I searched the trash cans there.

510
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,515
Then...

511
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,684
You've been searching since last night?

512
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,388
Don't worry. I will not charge you
any overtime fees.

513
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,796
Thank you so much!

514
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,917
Daddy.

515
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,768
Daddy's finally back.

516
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,039
Mommy!

517
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,220
Stop crying, Dad. You're a man!

518
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,155
Okay.

519
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,025
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,462
Right, Yui. Can we take a photo
to remember this day?

521
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:45,269
Sounds good. Today's the day
our dad revived.

522
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,773
What does that even mean?

523
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,416
Not yet, Yui?

524
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,419
One moment. I need to set the timer.

525
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,254
Join us, Mita.

526
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,690
I'm fine.

527
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,492
Don't say that.

528
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,195
You're just like family to us, Mita.

529
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,731
I'm sorry...

530
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,168
but I'm not your family.

531
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,076
Okay, I'll take one first. Say cheese!

532
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,143
All right!

533
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,812
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

534
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,547
Sorry, everyone!

535
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,416
My student got into some trouble
right at this time and...

536
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,218
-Urara, move!
-How did the play go?

537
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,886
We're taking a photo! Hey!

538
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,588
Oh, sorry!

539
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:43,894
<i>The 7:15 a.m. express bus heading to
Haneda Airport will be departing soon.</i>

540
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,932
<i>We ask that all passengers
board the bus immediately.</i>

541
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:54,372
<i>The 7:15 a.m. express bus heading to
Haneda Airport will be departing soon.</i>

542
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,641
<i>We ask that all passengers
board the bus immediately.</i>

543
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,176
Kazama!

544
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,814
Keiichi...

545
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,485
I...

546
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,988
I still love you now.

547
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,257
What?

548
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,925
I want to marry you.

549
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,595
Are you serious?

550
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,432
If you would become the children's mother.

551
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,773
My kids kept calling me "Dad"
over and over yesterday,

552
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,808
and I finally realized something.

553
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,779
It's such a wonderful feeling
to be called "Father."

554
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,884
I was a fool for not realizing it
the entire time.

555
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,955
Just as my name implies, I've always been
the happiest man in the world.

556
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,564
<i>We are departing soon.
Please board the bus.</i>

557
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,751
Regarding the adoption of the kids...

558
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,455
I would like to officially reject it.

559
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,890
I'm truly sorry.

560
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,198
From now on, I will work hard so that

561
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,168
you and the children will
acknowledge me as their father.

562
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,272
I...

563
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,742
I may be a small boat,

564
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,811
but no matter what storm approaches,

565
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,080
no matter which enemy attacks us,

566
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,915
I will protect the kids

567
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:49,787
and take them to
each of their destinations.

568
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,490
I'm really sorry.

569
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,697
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

570
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,032
I said mean things to you the other day.

571
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,703
It's not that we dislike you.

572
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,305
We just decided to be with Dad.

573
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,040
We don't want to be apart any more.

574
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,077
Please forgive us.

575
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,483
Come on, Dad! Why don't you say something?

576
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,956
Do whatever you want.

577
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,591
What?

578
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,296
I don't care about you guys any longer.

579
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,499
I don't even think
of you as grandchildren.

580
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,409
Wait, Dad? Dad!

581
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,611
Sorry! Dad.

582
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,050
How was Grandpa?

583
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,021
He was mad. He told us to do
whatever we want.

584
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,289
I knew it.

585
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,159
Can't be helped. It's all my fault.

586
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,362
I'll do my best to make him forgive me.

587
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,365
Okay? All right. I'm leaving now.

588
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,934
What? Where are you going?

589
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,969
Right. It's a weekend.

590
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:16,307
I have to find a job quickly,
and make Grandpa acknowledge me.

591
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,147
You should get changed.

592
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,282
Oh, I'm fine like this.

593
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,718
You must have sweated profusely

594
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,354
since you were nervous from
meeting your father-in-law.

595
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,189
What?

596
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,666
Okay.

597
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,768
-What's wrong, Dad?
-What?

598
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,306
No, it's just that
the shirt's just been ironed,

599
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,307
so it feels really good to wear.

600
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,243
Mita.

601
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,911
Thank you.

602
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,680
That is...

603
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,485
something you should tell your late wife.

604
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,192
I am only imitating what your wife did.

605
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,574
Thanks, Nagiko.

606
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,679
I'm sorry that

607
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,782
I've never thanked you
when you were alive.

608
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,887
ASUDA RESIDENCE

609
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:37,955
KEIICHI, NAGIKO,
YUI, KAKERU, KAITO, KII

610
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:41,792
Well then, I'm leaving.

611
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,861
-Have a safe trip.
-Have a safe trip.

612
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,640
Have a safe trip.

613
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,184
Mita.

614
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,126
We want you to go somewhere with us.

615
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,644
Mita. We thought about this,

616
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,847
but you always come here
because it's a memorable place

617
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,516
for you and your family, right?

618
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,189
You always ordered this
and ate it together, right?

619
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,294
You would never kill
your family members, Mita.

620
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:54,264
I'm sure you just feel responsible
for their deaths. Right?

621
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,935
Hey. Tell us, Mita.

622
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,137
I will protect you!

623
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,018
I need to prepare for dinner.

624
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,658
Hey! Wait! Just wait a minute!

625
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,133
I believe I have said this before.

626
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,971
If you insist on questioning me,
I will relieve myself of my duties.

627
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,096
You killed them!

628
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,101
Give me back my son and grandchild!

629
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,408
Enough with the apologies!

630
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,777
Don't you ever dare smile again...

631
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,146
until you die!

632
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,828
MITA FINALLY COMES CLEAN
ABOUT HER PAST

633
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,530
I tried to smile as much as I could.

634
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,032
He started to stalk me.

635
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,468
He cornered me, over and over.

636
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,236
My husband and son died.

637
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,805
And with that...

638
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,507
My future disappeared from my life.

639
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,677
I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

640
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,011
He chased me out of the house...

641
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,948
I'm sorry!

642
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:54,551
When I first received a <i>monaka</i>
from Ms. Harumi,

643
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,754
I smiled from the bottom of my heart.

644
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,289
My mother grew to hate me even more.

645
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,126
I kept begging for forgiveness,
over and over.

646
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,527
"You don't have to do anything."

647
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,462
"Just don't smile until you die."

648
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:10,901
