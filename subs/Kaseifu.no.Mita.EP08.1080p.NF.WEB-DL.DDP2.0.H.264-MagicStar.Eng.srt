1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,270
I'm home.

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:05,872
Welcome back.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,682
Welcome home.

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,752
Wait. What are you doing, Urara?

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:19,886
I...

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,523
I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,658
What? What are you talking about?

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,994
Urara is here.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,963
What?

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,665
Yui. Sorry but can I stay here?

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,701
Huh? What are you doing, Mita?

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,471
Dad chased me out of the house...

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,940
Sorry.

14
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,709
I'll clean it up.

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,444
Seriously, what are you doing?

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,780
Nothing good happens
when you're here, Urara.

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,615
What are you guys talking about?

18
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,117
This is Mita, and this is Urara. Right?

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,520
Yui!

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,557
You know...

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,261
You're dreaming right now, Yui.

22
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,542
You're Mita, right?

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,178
Urara is here.

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,479
What?

25
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,853
Yui. Sorry but can I stay here?

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,188
What?

27
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,191
Dad chased me out of the house...

28
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,092
Sorry.

29
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,626
I'll clean it up.

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,133
No way.

31
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,469
What are you saying, Yui?

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,207
Well, it's exactly the same as my dream.
No, I mean it's the opposite.

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,476
Are you sleep-talking right now?

34
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,510
I'm home.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,078
Welcome home.

36
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,514
I just came over, Keiichi.

37
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,483
Oh, Urara. What's up?

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,887
The other day when Dad got mad and said
he doesn't care about the grandkids,

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,222
we had a fight.

40
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,958
On top of that, he kept nagging me to
go for blind dates.

41
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,559
Oh, I see.

42
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,597
Hey. Could you say something to my dad?

43
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,699
Tell him that
I don't intend on getting married.

44
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,269
But he probably won't listen to me.

45
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,072
He knows that
I'm looking for a job right now.

46
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,809
Daddy, you still can't find a job?

47
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,513
Well, it's quite difficult
at times like this.

48
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,947
What does "times like this" mean?

49
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,249
What?

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,886
Well, we're in a recession right now.

51
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,821
What's a "recession"?

52
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,189
Well, that's...

53
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,894
Mita, please help me.

54
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,265
Recession refers to a period of time where
business owners only want to earn money

55
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,535
while bureaucrats only want to
protect their own positions.

56
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,538
And since the useless politicians
are unable to do anything about it,

57
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,841
it causes a lot of people to
lose their jobs and become poor.

58
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,444
Will you be fine, Dad?

59
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,147
Well... Don't worry too much.

60
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,950
We'll be able to get by
with my savings for now.

61
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,985
You still have to pay off this house, too.

62
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,389
And if you don't find a job soon,
we won't be able to hire Mita anymore.

63
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,294
Should I get a part-time job?

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,062
I could deliver newspapers.

65
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,866
I could also give up on applying for
a private school, too.

66
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,902
I'll ask my friends in school!

67
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,337
Maybe they know a good job!

68
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,442
Thanks, everyone. But I'll be fine.

69
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,547
Anyway, I'm hungry. Is dinner ready, Mita?

70
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,317
It is done.

71
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,986
Wow!

72
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,554
It looks delicious!

73
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,793
Why don't you join us, Urara?

74
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,394
Dad's right, Urara.

75
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,332
I think I should go home.

76
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,867
Don't say that. Why don't you eat here?

77
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,037
I don't think it's right to freeload here
when you're having a tough time.

78
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:02,775
Besides. I can't sit on Nagiko's seat.
See you!

79
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,649
Let's eat, shall we?

80
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,517
-Thank you for the food.
-I'm digging in.

81
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,586
I wonder if Urara has a place to stay.

82
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,823
I don't think she has a boyfriend, either.

83
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,058
I thought about it, but...

84
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,762
Doesn't Urara like Dad?

85
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,367
What are you saying, Kaito?

86
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,603
I mean, we may be relatives,

87
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,274
but isn't it strange of her
to visit us so frequently?

88
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,410
You're overthinking it.

89
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,846
That's not possible.

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,115
Hey, Dad.

91
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,150
Why don't we get Mita to join us?

92
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,953
Oh, you're right.

93
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,889
Mita. Why don't you join us
once in a while?

94
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,925
I'm fine.

95
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,827
Don't say that.

96
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,664
We feel bad that you're always
just looking at us eat.

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,199
Let's eat together, Mita.

98
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,102
I...

99
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,471
am just a housekeeper.

100
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:11,077
I will never eat with all of you.

101
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:34,200
Mr. Asuda. The bath is ready.

102
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,135
Oh, thanks.

103
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,505
-I'm going in first.
-Okay.

104
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,707
Got it.

105
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,611
Hey. Why don't you play with us, Mita?

106
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,680
Right, let's play together!

107
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,019
Is this an order?

108
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,754
Well, not exactly.

109
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,391
I'm sorry, but from now on,

110
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,728
please do not talk to me
unless it's an order.

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,003
Mita feels even colder than before.

112
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,007
Is it because we kept pressing her
about her late family members?

113
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,543
<i>I believe I have said this before.</i>

114
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,914
<i>If you insist on questioning me,
I will relieve myself of my duties.</i>

115
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,184
What should we do, Yui?

116
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,187
Should we give up asking Mita
all those things?

117
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,956
Actually...

118
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,692
I thought about it, and...

119
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,093
What?

120
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,965
I thought that Mita could be
Mom's reincarnation.

121
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,867
What in the world are you saying?

122
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,437
She's right. Where's your evidence?

123
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,206
-What's "evidence"?
-I'll explain it later.

124
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,676
I mean, Mita came to our house

125
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,813
right after Mom's 49th day was over.

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,283
She even burned Mom's clothes
and Buddhish altar nonchalantly.

127
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,285
Doesn't it make sense?

128
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,646
You guys surprised me! What is it?

129
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,548
We bought some <i>monaka</i>, Yui.

130
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,952
So what? Just let me sleep in.
It's a Saturday!

131
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,222
We want to check if Mita's a ghost.

132
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,290
What?

133
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,559
If she eats this, it means she's a human.

134
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,594
Why don't you guys give it a rest already?

135
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,064
Then you don't care about
Mita's real identity anymore?

136
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,800
That's not true, but...

137
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,048
Mita. Would you like to have a <i>monaka</i>?

138
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,152
Ms. Harumi from the agency
said you like this, right?

139
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,290
Not really. That's not true.

140
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,659
What? Don't say that!

141
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,760
Come on, have one!

142
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,535
What would you like for lunch?

143
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,105
I want hamburg steak. With lots of onions.

144
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,608
What? I prefer omelette rice.

145
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,276
That hurt!

146
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,979
She might tear up if she cuts onions.

147
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,881
I see!

148
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,918
Sorry! Let's have steaks instead!

149
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,319
Understood.

150
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,497
What do you need from me?

151
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,602
Oh, we're just wondering
if you are going to tear up.

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,005
Why so?

153
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,375
That's because...

154
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,877
Are you a ghost, Mita?

155
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,379
Hey, Kii!

156
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,248
Or are you Mom's reincarnation?

157
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,019
I want to know more about you, Mita!

158
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,660
I believe I have told you

159
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,400
not to talk to me unless it's an order.

160
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,338
Then I have an order for you.

161
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,376
What is it?

162
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,477
Let's play scissors, paper, stone.

163
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,315
If I win, tell me more about yourself.

164
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,684
What if I win?

165
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,521
I promise that
I'll never ask about you again!

166
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,792
As you wish.

167
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,961
I'm good at this game.

168
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,197
Let's go. Scissors, paper, stone!

169
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,467
One more time! Scissors, paper, stone!

170
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,271
One last time! Scissors, paper, stone!

171
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,806
Scissors, paper, stone!

172
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,008
Scissors, paper, stone!

173
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,645
Scissors, paper, stone!

174
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,082
No way!

175
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,955
Well,

176
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,224
why don't you have a duel with me?

177
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,026
We'll play with this.

178
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,668
I'm done.

179
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,138
Wow. Fifty-seven seconds.

180
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,206
Wow.

181
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,108
You're awesome, Kai!

182
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,178
Sorry, but I've never lost at this.

183
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,514
Here you go.

184
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,551
All right. Get ready.

185
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,388
Ready, go!

186
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,970
Five seconds.

187
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,607
The person who scores
three points first wins.

188
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,877
Understood.

189
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,414
You can go first. Here you go.

190
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,820
No way.

191
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,221
Kakeru!

192
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,958
That was just a fluke!

193
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,028
I'll score one this time!

194
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,772
I won't be careless anymore!

195
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,984
No way this is happening!

196
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,054
It hurts!

197
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,457
Please be more gentle!

198
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,127
Seriously, what were you doing?
You're so lame.

199
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,528
Shut up.

200
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,934
I will now prepare dinner.

201
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,377
Hey. What do you think is in that bag?

202
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,048
Maybe it contains some hints.

203
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,183
Why don't the two of you stop it?

204
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,352
Then do something, Yui!

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,723
He's right. You want to know
who Mita really is, right?

206
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,292
Personally...

207
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,128
I think maybe...

208
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:48,667
Mita might be like Urara.

209
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,935
What?

210
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,904
That's impossible.

211
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,342
Yui. What is your evidence?

212
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,246
Well, I had a similar dream.

213
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,081
What's that?

214
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,315
I'm home.

215
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,650
Welcome home.

216
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,485
-Welcome home.
-Welcome home.

217
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,455
How is it going with work, Dad?

218
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,357
Are you still in a "recession"?

219
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,625
Well, yes.

220
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,128
-Sit, Dad.
-What is it?

221
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,097
Help us, Dad.

222
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,368
Please! You're the only one
who can help us now!

223
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,438
Okay. Can you just talk to Mita?

224
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,108
We'll take that chance to
look through her bag.

225
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,011
Hey. I don't think we should pry further.

226
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,913
What will you do if she really quits?

227
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,481
Please, Daddy!

228
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,387
Excuse me, Mita.

229
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,624
Yes?

230
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:50,963
One of the lightbulbs in my room went out.
Could you take a look?

231
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,799
As you wish.

232
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,711
-I can't open it!
-What?

233
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,282
Could you move aside? Hurry up.

234
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,151
-Hurry up.
-What are you doing?

235
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,521
-Can someone bring me a screwdriver?
-A screwdriver?

236
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,959
I just need a little more time!

237
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,728
-Dad!
-What?

238
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,731
I'm sorry,

239
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,734
but could you not look at someone else's
belongings without permission?

240
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,737
Oh, sorry.

241
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,509
Besides...

242
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,982
Isn't there something else
all of you should be doing?

243
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,783
What?

244
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,252
What do you mean?

245
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,093
This is the Asuda residence.

246
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,733
Urara is on the phone, Mr. Asuda.

247
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,535
Oh, thanks.

248
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,541
Hello? What's up, Urara?

249
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,512
<i>Sorry, Keiichi!
But something happened to Dad.</i>

250
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,914
What?

251
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,052
Sorry, everyone.

252
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,287
What happened to father-in-law?

253
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,657
He got mad at some students who were
smoking in front of the convenience store,

254
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,592
and he got beat up instead.

255
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,660
What?

256
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,829
Dad.

257
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,765
Keiichi and the kids are here.

258
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,435
I have nothing to say to them!

259
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,637
What are you saying?

260
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,107
Excuse me...
Are you all right, father-in-law?

261
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,877
Don't push yourself. We'll get worried.

262
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,846
I didn't ask you guys
to be worried about me!

263
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,248
Stop saying that!

264
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,616
Shut up!

265
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,850
It hurts...

266
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,156
Hurry up and go on a blind date,
and give me a grandchild!

267
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,659
A well-behaved grandchild,
unlike these kids over here!

268
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,294
Stop raising your voice in the hospital!

269
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,863
I'm not raising my voice at you!

270
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,868
Sorry about this
even though you guys came.

271
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,036
No, it's fine.

272
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,874
Kii. Why don't you show Grandpa
the stones?

273
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,009
Okay.

274
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,511
Grandpa.

275
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,550
These stones represent our family.

276
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,956
This one's me, this one's Kai,

277
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:38,197
this one's Kakeru, this is Yui,
this one's Mommy,

278
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,100
and Daddy put his stone in recently!

279
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,373
Next time, I'll find
yours and Urara's stone

280
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,074
and put it in together.

281
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,076
Your mother's no longer here!

282
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,779
Stop holding on to these useless things!

283
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,647
-Dad!
-What are you doing?

284
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,183
You didn't have to vent it out on Kii.

285
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,153
It's all your fault!

286
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,390
If only you died and Nagiko was alive,

287
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,492
things wouldn't have turned out like this!

288
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,028
Seems like you managed to deceive them.

289
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,629
But it won't work on me!

290
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,774
What do you think we should do?

291
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,576
Mom...

292
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,654
Mita.

293
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,958
I'll help you.

294
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,529
I'm fine. This is my job.

295
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,532
I want to help you. Please.

296
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,636
As you wish.

297
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,845
I used to help Mom with the chores
at times.

298
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,048
Strangely enough,

299
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,584
we could be honest with one another
at times like this.

300
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,622
Hey.

301
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,928
When you said there's something
we should be doing...

302
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,631
You were referring to Grandpa, right?

303
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,236
What should we do?

304
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,406
Kakeru and Kaito said
we should just leave him be.

305
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,442
Kii's totally afraid of Grandpa now, too.

306
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,715
Why does Grandpa always raise his voice?
Was he always like that in the past?

307
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,455
Oh, sorry. I honestly thought
I was talking to Mom just now.

308
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,792
What do you need from me?

309
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,960
What?

310
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,733
You're still staying with this family?

311
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,870
Just when will you quit?

312
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,205
I don't think that's your business,
Ms. Minagawa.

313
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,275
It seems like your father returned, too.

314
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,278
I'm surprised you allowed him to.

315
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,546
He had an affair

316
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,815
and made your mother commit suicide.

317
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,417
Are you sure you have the time

318
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,720
to be saying things like this right now?

319
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,122
Huh? What do you mean?

320
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:22,828
Your husband was talking secretly
on the phone the other day.

321
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,132
"My wife hasn't realized at all,
so it'll be fine.

322
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,836
I'll separate from her soon enough."
That was what he said.

323
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,106
That's none of your business!

324
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,748
All right!

325
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,815
One more round.

326
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,187
Wow, you're amazing.

327
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,356
Try a cat next, Mita.

328
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,431
Everyone! Mita can imitate anything!

329
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,567
Even the lady next door, too!

330
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,069
No way! Try it.

331
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,105
"You're still staying with this family?"

332
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,041
Wow, she's good!

333
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,044
Then can you imitate someone from AKB48?

334
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,245
I can do all of them.

335
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,746
You can imitate all of them?

336
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,848
Then let's start from
the first place girl.

337
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,083
No, the one from
the Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament.

338
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,084
Mita!

339
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,255
I have a request.

340
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:32,231
<i>We came to a nearby park
for a picnic today.</i>

341
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,166
<i>You should smile wider, Mom.</i>

342
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,201
<i>Stop this, it's embarrassing.</i>

343
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,770
<i>-Do it, Mom!
-No way.</i>

344
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,739
<i>-Okay. Ready, go.
-I'm digging in.</i>

345
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,942
Mita. Could you imitate Mom?

346
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,212
I can.

347
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,749
Then could you go to the hospital
and pretend to be Mom's ghost?

348
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,818
What are you talking about, Yui?

349
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,290
If she conveys our feelings
using Mom's voice,

350
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,193
Grandpa might be willing to accept it.

351
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,795
That's not going to work. It's all over
once he sees Mita's face.

352
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,197
It's going to be fine.

353
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,367
If we turn off the lights, it will be dark
and he can't see her face.

354
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:14,940
Please, Mita! I want to
make up with Grandpa somehow.

355
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,780
Is that an order?

356
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,582
Yes.

357
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,518
As you wish.

358
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,232
Dad.

359
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,605
Who's there?

360
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,343
Dad. How's your body?

361
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,148
Is that you, Nagiko?

362
00:21:56,214 --> 00:22:00,218
I'm sorry that I died before you, Dad.

363
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,688
Nagiko!

364
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,989
That hurt...

365
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,161
I...

366
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,598
When Keiichi told me to divorce him,

367
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,969
I thought about how all the efforts
I put in into my marriage life

368
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,204
went down the drain,

369
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,142
and I felt like
I had no reason to live anymore.

370
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,285
But now...

371
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,489
I regret that I left the kids.

372
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,325
Even if he had left me,

373
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,895
I should have taken care of the children.

374
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,133
Why does it seem like
she's not following the script?

375
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:54,940
Could you protect Yui and the kids
in my place?

376
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,177
I understand that you hate Keiichi,

377
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,313
but please forgive him
for the children's sake.

378
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,482
Please.

379
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm scared, Nagiko.

380
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,192
Yui told me, too.

381
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:21,133
She said that all the people
important to me become unhappy.

382
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,605
You and your mother...

383
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,011
And Urara. Being with me
may make you all unhappy.

384
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:38,316
And that thought made me so scared.

385
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:44,523
If I'm going to be haunted by
these thoughts, I think it'll be better

386
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,926
if I was dead first.

387
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,066
Why did you die?

388
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,305
Why did you and your mother die?

389
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,710
Hey, what are you guys doing?

390
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,879
-What?
-Hey, what's going on?

391
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,248
Mita told me that
she came to the hospital.

392
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,683
Why don't we just go in?

393
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,826
What the hell are you doing here?

394
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,564
There's a limit to your jokes!

395
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,266
What are you doing, Dad?

396
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,536
Don't blame Mita, Grandpa!

397
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,906
I was the one who asked her
to pretend to be Mom.

398
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,907
What did you say?

399
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,378
How dare you come up with such a prank.
You think it's funny?

400
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,279
I'm sorry.

401
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,716
I never want to see your face again.
Get out!

402
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,455
You didn't have to take it that far, Dad.

403
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,158
I'm sorry, father-in-law.
I apologize in their place.

404
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,759
Shut up! You get out, too!

405
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,328
Hey, Dad!

406
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,929
Just leave me alone already!

407
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,866
Hey, what are you guys doing?

408
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,635
Visiting hours are already over.

409
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

410
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,310
Everyone. Let's go home for today, okay?

411
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,547
Please excuse us.

412
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,549
Let's go. Hurry.

413
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,054
Mita?

414
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,057
Let's go home.

415
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,095
What are you looking at?

416
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,030
Get out!

417
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,700
It's a lie.

418
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,004
What?

419
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:44,509
The fact that everyone important to you
becomes unhappy

420
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,745
is all a lie.

421
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,414
What did you say?

422
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,884
You simply tried to love your family

423
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,154
using your own method.

424
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,124
You raise your voice

425
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,727
because your feelings don't reach them

426
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,130
and you feel frustrated by that.

427
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,000
In truth, you don't have confidence

428
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,537
and you're scared that it will be exposed.

429
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,041
You are just...

430
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,510
raising your voice at yourself.

431
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,545
Shut up!

432
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,048
What would a housekeeper like you know?

433
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,919
I understand the pain of
losing people important to you.

434
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,827
I understand that empty feeling of
not being able to be with them again.

435
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,632
However, you still have...

436
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,171
the chance to give happiness to
the ones you love.

437
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,282
Grandpa.

438
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,187
I found it.

439
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,324
I found Grandpa and Urara's stones.

440
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,700
Urara.

441
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,404
Will you two place them into this box?

442
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,873
This is yours, Urara.

443
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,844
Thanks.

444
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,785
This is yours, Grandpa.

445
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,054
Dad.

446
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,623
Yui and the kids

447
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,460
want you to get better.

448
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,265
They want to do everything they can
to make up with you.

449
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:54,673
I'll come visit you everyday
until you're discharged, Grandpa.

450
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,810
Me too. The entrance exams are coming,

451
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,080
so you have to help me with revision.

452
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,149
Grandpa.

453
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,886
We're a family.

454
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,761
We're your family, Grandpa. Are we not?

455
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,870
Here you go.

456
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,337
ASUDA RESIDENCE

457
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,008
Don't make that face, Dad!

458
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,111
Keiichi and the kids are going to
take it the wrong way again.

459
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,147
Shut up! I'm born with this face.

460
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:14,252
I got it! It sounds like you're raising
your voice since you tend to talk loudly.

461
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,656
Right. Why don't you end your sentences
in a cute manner?

462
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,557
What do you mean?

463
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,560
Don't say "Shut up!",
but "Shut up, as it were!"

464
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,462
See? It's cute!

465
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,064
Are you dumb? There's no way I'd say that!

466
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,032
Just try it once.

467
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,735
"Shut up, as it were!"

468
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,037
Shut up! Just press the doorbell already!

469
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,706
Jeez...

470
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,987
Nagiko. Dad's finally discharged
from the hospital.

471
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,925
Thanks, Nagiko.

472
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,333
Father-in-law.

473
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,136
I'm sorry that you had to buy
a Buddhist altar for us.

474
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,873
That can't be helped.

475
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,009
I can't let an unemployed man
fork out money!

476
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,577
Hey, Dad!

477
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,445
The children...

478
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,083
They are finally ready to
accept their mother's death.

479
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,454
This morning, they prayed to her
before leaving for school.

480
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,825
Right now...

481
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,662
They are truly growing up by the day.

482
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,632
Father-in-law.

483
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,403
I'm sorry.

484
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,906
Keiichi...

485
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,642
It's my fault that

486
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,013
you weren't able to
give your beloved daughter happiness.

487
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,852
I let her die before you.

488
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,121
Nagiko looked forward to

489
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,058
the children growing up,
more than anyone else.

490
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,228
I'm truly sorry....

491
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
that she couldn't do so.

492
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,740
Keiichi, I planned a party
for Dad's discharge tomorrow.

493
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,548
Okay, I got it.
I'll let the children know.

494
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,083
Okay.

495
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,752
Right. Can Mita join us?

496
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,454
I'm sure the kids will be happy, too.

497
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,624
Yes, of course.

498
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,459
You're okay with it, right Mita?

499
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,362
I will not be going.

500
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,098
Please don't say that.

501
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,200
It's been a while
since the family gathered.

502
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,071
I am not part of the family.

503
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,015
Dad?

504
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,796
I'm sorry about

505
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,366
my harsh actions to you the other day...

506
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,270
as it were.

507
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,472
I really think...

508
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,611
I really think
that you're a good person, as it were.

509
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,117
I want you to come tomorrow, as it were!

510
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,329
HARUMI HOUSEKEEPING AGENCY

511
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,831
This is the referral commission
for this month.

512
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,867
Received with thanks.

513
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,769
Please excuse me.

514
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,540
Hey, I heard about the party
from the kids.

515
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,575
What are you going to do?

516
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,280
Hey, this is not stipulated
in the regulations.

517
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,816
Don't be such a stiff and say that
you're not attending

518
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,618
since housekeepers are
not part of the family.

519
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,488
Akari.

520
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:15,727
Do you remember the first time
I gave you a <i>monaka</i>?

521
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:21,132
I think you were this small.

522
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:26,904
Right? You hid your loneliness
every single day,

523
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,574
and smiled as much as you could.

524
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:34,645
And I became so old in a blink of the eye.

525
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:40,418
So, I want to see your smile once more
before I die.

526
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,854
Haven't you done enough?

527
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,225
It's time you believed in someone
and opened your heart to them.

528
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,695
Right?

529
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,367
I think that family is wonderful.

530
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,106
OGURA MONAKA

531
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,945
When the long winter finally ends
and spring comes...

532
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,983
even ice would melt.

533
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,888
Welcome.

534
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,299
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

535
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,303
Excuse me, we have a reservation
under the name "Yuki".

536
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,871
Please give me a moment.

537
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,675
It's really hard to
get a reservation here.

538
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,811
Wow. Urara really tried her best.

539
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,851
Sorry to keep you waiting.

540
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,921
We indeed have a reservation
under that name for eight people,

541
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,723
but it is supposed to be
on the same date next month.

542
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,992
What?

543
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,630
Wait. Then what about today?

544
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,667
I'm sorry, but we're fully booked today.

545
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,569
What the hell?

546
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,604
I can't connect to
Urara's phone right now.

547
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,174
What? Then what should we do?

548
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,944
Jeez, you can count on Urara
to mess things up.

549
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,650
Just what are you doing?
It's almost time to leave.

550
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,753
Give me a minute. I lost the printed map
for the restaurant,

551
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,423
so I have no idea where it is.

552
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,358
If we don't hurry,
the others are going to reach first.

553
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,559
Oh, no!

554
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,962
What?

555
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,097
The computer froze.

556
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,968
I can't believe you.

557
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,037
You better give them a call.

558
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,140
I know!

559
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,476
I left my phone at school.

560
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,146
Just use the home phone.

561
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,046
I know!

562
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,452
I don't know their number
without my phone.

563
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,988
Just what are you doing, as it were?

564
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,957
You still can't reach Urara?

565
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,259
Yes.

566
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,762
Just what is she doing?

567
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,765
Man... I'm so hungry that
I'm going to die!

568
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,535
I'll cook something now.

569
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,903
Mita.

570
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,376
Why don't we order sushi for today?

571
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,312
Oh, right! Join us, Mita.

572
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,215
No, I'm fine.

573
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,319
Please!

574
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,090
This is a good chance.

575
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,194
Let's have a proper talk.

576
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,800
When I heard what you told Grandpa,

577
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,870
it really felt as if Mom was there.

578
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:51,375
I thought that you might really be
Mom's reincarnation.

579
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,015
I...

580
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,631
I am not your mother.

581
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,534
Then tell us about yourself!

582
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,571
You told Grandpa, didn't you?

583
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,774
That you understand the pain of losing
people important to you,

584
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,944
as well as the empty feeling of
not being able to be with them again.

585
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,015
Please.

586
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,484
I...

587
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,686
I want to protect you!

588
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,694
Mita...

589
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,665
Could you eat with the kids today?

590
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,840
As you wish.

591
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,609
Yay!

592
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,912
Sit here, Mita.

593
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,089
All right!

594
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,834
Right. I'll go order sushi.

595
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,637
Oh, right!

596
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,444
Why don't we have <i>monaka</i>
while we wait for the sushi?

597
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,747
Right. I'm so hungry that
I can't take it anymore.

598
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,983
It looks pretty unassuming,

599
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,219
but it's delicious
with all the bed bean paste.

600
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,988
It sounds just like Mita.

601
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,925
I'm beginning to like <i>monaka</i>!

602
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,629
Oh. Maybe I'll have one, too.

603
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,898
Have one too, Mita.

604
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,436
Have one.

605
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,367
All right!

606
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,670
-Just how many are you going to eat?
-Here you go, Kii.

607
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,039
Good, isn't it? Don't eat too much though.

608
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,308
You're having sushi after this.

609
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,389
I received a <i>monaka</i>...

610
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:56,160
for the first time from
the president of the housekeeping agency

611
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,929
when I was around Kii's age.

612
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,935
One year before that,

613
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,273
my beloved father tried to save me
from drowning in a nearby river,

614
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,376
and he died instead.

615
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,313
Ever since then, my mother
harbored resentment in her heart

616
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,784
towards me for killing her dear husband,

617
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,886
and started to avoid me.

618
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:26,157
I did my best
in my studies and other activities

619
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,826
in an attempt to make her happy.

620
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,198
However, once she remarried
and gave birth to her child,

621
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,601
all she cared about was
my younger brother.

622
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,806
When my stepfather made eyes at me,

623
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,076
my mother grew to hate me even more.

624
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,913
"It's all because of your smile."

625
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,250
"Your smile brings misfortune
to everyone around you."

626
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,220
She always reprimanded me.

627
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:02,326
However, Ms. Harumi, who was
my housekeeper at that time,

628
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,062
cheered me on and I tried to smile
as much as I could.

629
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,300
I believed that I would meet someone
who would accept me

630
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,701
for who I am one day.

631
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,371
And then, I met my husband.

632
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,842
I gave birth to a boy
who looked just like him.

633
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:24,081
When I see the both of them
eating and praising my cooking,

634
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,750
I didn't need anything else in my life.

635
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,488
I was so happy every day,

636
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,090
and I lived on
as I smiled from the bottom of my heart.

637
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,860
One day,

638
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,662
my younger brother came to my house.

639
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:43,767
He confessed his love to me,
and started following me around.

640
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,705
My husband never knew
what was his intention,

641
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,241
and welcomed him to our house
all the time.

642
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,544
My brother used the opportunity

643
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,413
to force me to
further advance our relationship,

644
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,549
and started to stalk me.

645
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,819
While we have different fathers,

646
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,521
we are still blood-related siblings.

647
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,788
So,

648
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,525
I rejected his advances numerous times.

649
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,495
I told him, "Please stop this"
over and over again.

650
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,964
But it didn't work.

651
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,869
Eventually, my husband found out about
my brother's real intention.

652
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,439
My husband told him,
"Never come back here again."

653
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,108
and my brother flew into a rage.

654
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,711
He said, "It's your fault.
You seduced me."

655
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,047
And he set our house on fire.

656
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,184
As the flames grew bigger,

657
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:38,389
I could hear someone shout,
"Save me, Mom! Save me!"

658
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,326
It was my son screaming.

659
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,896
I tried to run into the fire.

660
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,933
However...

661
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,168
The firefighters stopped me.

662
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,906
My beloved husband and son...

663
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,243
They died.

664
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,848
And as if he were trying to mock me,

665
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,651
my younger brother killed himself.

666
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,923
My mother and my husband's parents
told me...

667
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:20,064
"It's your fault. That smile of yours
always brings misfortune to everyone."

668
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,169
"Enough with the apologies."

669
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,471
"You don't have to do anything."

670
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:31,275
"Just don't smile until you die."

671
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,727
And with that,
everything's gone from my life.

672
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:56,066
Light, hopes, dreams, love...

673
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,737
joy, happiness,

674
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,972
and future. All of them disappeared.

675
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,449
I talked about everything
regarding myself.

676
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,160
As promised...

677
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,896
I will now quit my job.

678
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,444
Wait. Mita, please wait!

679
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,472
MITA MOVES TO A NEW STAGE
15-MINUTES EXTENDED EPISODE

680
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,940
Don't get in my way!

681
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,975
All of you will die if you don't.

682
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,978
I do not deserve to have a will of my own.

683
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,880
I've been waiting

684
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,014
for this day to come.

685
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,117
I know that the sadness you feel

686
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,818
is nothing comparable to ours.

687
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,220
This time,

688
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,455
we want to save you, Mita!

689
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,458
Do you like me, Mita?

690
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,927
I don't ever want to let go of our bond!

691
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,529
I won't let go, even if I die!

692
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,968
