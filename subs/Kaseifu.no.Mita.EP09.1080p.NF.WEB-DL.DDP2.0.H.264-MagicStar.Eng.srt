1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,083
My beloved father tried to save me
from drowning in a nearby river,

2
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,420
and he died instead.

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,624
Ever since then, my mother
harbored resentment in her heart

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,560
towards me for killing her dear husband,

5
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,195
and started to avoid me.

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,204
"It's all because of your smile."

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,876
"Your smile brings misfortune
to everyone around you."

8
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,078
She always reprimanded me.

9
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,120
And then, I met my husband.

10
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,290
I gave birth to a boy
who looked just like him.

11
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:03,630
When I see the both of them
eating and praising my cooking,

12
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,365
I was so happy every day,

13
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,268
and I lived on
as I smiled from the bottom of my heart.

14
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,908
My husband told him,
"Never come back here again."

15
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,410
and my brother flew into a rage.

16
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,613
He said, "It's your fault.
You seduced me."

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,650
And he set our house on fire.

18
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,552
As the flames grew bigger,

19
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,156
I could hear someone shout,
"Save me, Mom! Save me!"

20
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,660
It was my son screaming.

21
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,873
My mother and my husband's parents
told me...

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,575
"Enough with the apologies."

23
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,111
"You don't have to do anything."

24
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,515
"Just don't smile until you die."

25
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,252
I talked about everything
regarding myself.

26
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,421
As promised...

27
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,190
I will now quit my job.

28
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,304
Why are you guys still up?

29
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,374
That's our line, Dad.

30
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,278
Well...

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,884
I just couldn't get myself to sleep.

32
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,820
Us, too.

33
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,858
Mita's really not coming.

34
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,262
Maybe she won't come back to
our house anymore.

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,264
I really regret asking her

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,667
now that this happened.

37
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,370
I'll try calling her again.

38
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:39,586
<i>The number you reached
is currently not available.</i>

39
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,387
How did it go, Dad?

40
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,390
She rejected my calls.

41
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,099
Dear me...

42
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,605
Akari finally confessed everything?

43
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,976
It was such a huge shock,
we were at a loss for words.

44
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,711
Here you go. Have some.

45
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,512
Thanks.

46
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,381
Well...

47
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:14,654
I think it has been almost 30 years
since Akari's mother remarried.

48
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,826
I went to their family
to work as their housekeeper.

49
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:27,166
She always tried her best to smile,
even when she was lonely.

50
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,870
When I gave her a <i>monaka</i>
for the first time,

51
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,939
it wasn't even a big deal.

52
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,010
But she was all happy and said,
"I love <i>monaka</i>!"

53
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,713
She looked so happy. Here you go.

54
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,751
MONAKA

55
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,387
Excuse me...

56
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,025
Could you ask Mita to
come back to work for us again?

57
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,694
The kids want her back, too.

58
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,232
But she doesn't want it.

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,901
So it's not something I can do.

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,404
Please do something about it.

61
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,075
It's all thanks to Mita that our family
wasn't torn apart.

62
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,078
We need Mita in our family.

63
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,513
Please.

64
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,581
I beg you!

65
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,630
Excuse me, but have you seen the lady

66
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,932
-who's always here by herself?
-What?

67
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,234
She always wears a down jacket and a cap,

68
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,970
orders a family set meal
and goes back without touching it.

69
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,007
That lady! She hasn't been here recently.

70
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,610
Is that so... Thank you.

71
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,079
No problem.

72
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,923
Come on. You don't have to
be in such a rush.

73
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,794
Slow down. Is it good?

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,867
Mita always came here

75
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,271
to mourn for her late husband and son,

76
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,374
I guess.

77
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,976
What does "mourn" mean?

78
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,080
Means you remember someone who died
and get sad over it.

79
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,521
It's from Dad.

80
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,156
Hello?

81
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,092
No way! Really?

82
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,127
What's going on, Yui?

83
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,329
He says Mita is coming from tomorrow!

84
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,902
Ten seconds.

85
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,807
Eight, seven, six, five...

86
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:53,212
four, three, two, one, zero!

87
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,022
No way. Mita didn't come!

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,892
-Not that I could do anything about it.
-Man...

89
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,633
I'll get the door!

90
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,802
See? Didn't I tell you?

91
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,546
I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

92
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,216
I am here on behalf of
Harumi Housekeeping Agency.

93
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,318
What?

94
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,820
What?

95
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,590
Wow, you have so many wonderful kids.

96
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:42,261
The last household I worked in
only had one son and daughter,

97
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,397
and they were so spoiled.

98
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,365
Oh, give us a moment.

99
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,672
Excuse me, but what's going on?

100
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry, but I asked Akari about it.

101
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,982
She said she doesn't want to
work for you anymore.

102
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,818
In her stead,

103
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,555
I got another housekeeper
who has the same last name as her.

104
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,258
But that's hardly the same...

105
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:17,964
<i>Don't worry! She's really diligent too!</i>

106
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,734
<i>By the way, her first name is Tami.</i>

107
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:27,340
<i>So her name's Mita
even if you read it backwards.</i>

108
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,641
<i>Don't get her name wrong.</i>

109
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,678
Got it. Well, I'm sorry,

110
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,715
but we don't intend on
getting someone else as the housekeeper.

111
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,050
Could you ask Mita...

112
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,254
I mean, Akari Mita, to come over?

113
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,789
About that...

114
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,628
Akari's already doing <i>that</i>.

115
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,263
What do you mean?

116
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:55,835
She's already decided to
work for another household.

117
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,136
What?

118
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,806
Well then, please excuse me.

119
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,109
I'm truly sorry about this.

120
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,177
No, it's quite all right.

121
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,186
She got her here just because
they share the same last name?

122
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,291
Ms. Harumi's really sloppy in her work.

123
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,625
-Daddy.
-Yes?

124
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,594
Will we never see Mita again?

125
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,864
Our only choice is to
go visit Mita ourselves!

126
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,098
But how?

127
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,935
Well, we'll ask for
Mita's current workplace.

128
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,436
We can't do that.

129
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,071
It'll cause trouble for that family, too.

130
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,707
Then what? Are we going to give up?

131
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,810
Calm down, Kakeru.
We're running out of time today,

132
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,945
so let's head to school.

133
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,316
Yes, you're right.
I have to find a job soon, too.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,818
All right, let's go.

135
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,019
Okay.

136
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,359
Huh? Where's my handphone?

137
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,028
What time will you come home today?

138
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,930
How should I know that?

139
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,866
Oh, good morning.

140
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,502
Oh, good morning.

141
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,440
Hey, did you see my husband's handphone?

142
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,381
I found it.

143
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,557
Thanks.

144
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,525
Mr. Minagawa.

145
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,760
What is it?

146
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,962
Your necktie's crooked.

147
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,364
Oh...

148
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,438
Well then, I'm leaving.

149
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,806
Have a safe trip.

150
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,477
Have a safe trip.

151
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,413
Hey. Stop spacing out

152
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,248
and help out with
all the household chores.

153
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,550
As you wish.

154
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,086
Wait, Mita!

155
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,725
I will be working next to your family
from today onwards.

156
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,461
I'm Mita, their housekeeper.

157
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,178
MISAWA KINDERGARTEN

158
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,714
Mommy!

159
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,896
Hey, Mita.

160
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,036
Let's go, Tsubasa.

161
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,040
You're so late! You should be
the first one here to fetch me home.

162
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,077
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,983
Your hand feels cold, Mita.

164
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,652
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,558
Mita.

166
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,227
Why are you working for
our next door neighbor?

167
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,896
Please! Come back home.

168
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,637
I'm sorry, but I'm no longer related
to your family.

169
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,076
Then at least pick up our calls!

170
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,178
Don't reject our calls please!

171
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,714
Or at least let us send you texts.

172
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:40,426
I'm sorry, but I have already
deleted all your numbers.

173
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,010
I'm home. Woah!

174
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,513
What's going on with you guys?

175
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,381
She's here again!

176
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,849
Who?

177
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,854
Don't tell me... It's Urara?

178
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,656
I told her that Mita quit,

179
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,325
and she said, "I'll come
cook for you guys every day!"

180
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,895
What?

181
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,470
Welcome home, Keiichi.
Dinner will be done in a moment...

182
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,005
Wait, Urara...

183
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,440
Sorry, but I'll eat those
I dropped on the floor.

184
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,644
You don't have to do this.
You're busy with work already.

185
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,445
I'm fine. I'm doing this to make up for

186
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,847
the party
we were supposed to hold for Dad.

187
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,516
Remember? We couldn't get
the dinner reservation.

188
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,617
No, that's all right.

189
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,120
You also need to save on living expenses

190
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,822
until you find a job, too.

191
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,157
You're not in the position to
hire a housekeeper.

192
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,593
True, but...

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,561
Oh, no!

194
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,462
I put it in for too long!

195
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,864
It's getting burnt!

196
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,200
That was dangerous!

197
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,770
Hey. What should we do?

198
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,172
We had something prepared just in case.

199
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,841
What? What did you guys do?

200
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,876
He should be here any minute.

201
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,511
Grandpa's here!

202
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,183
Hey, Urara! What are you doing here?

203
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,885
That's my line. Why are you here, Dad?

204
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,754
I'm here to bring you back, obviously!

205
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,290
Stop it! I'm still preparing dinner.

206
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,392
Why are you making dinner here

207
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,061
while there's nothing at home?

208
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,431
Don't get in my way! I'm doing this
since they're having trouble here!

209
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,200
Why don't you read the atmosphere?

210
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,605
Can't you tell
you're causing trouble for them?

211
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,776
Oh...

212
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,844
Well...

213
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,746
Sorry, Urara.

214
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,615
We appreciate your thought, but...

215
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,884
We'll deal with dinner ourselves.

216
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm really sorry.

217
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,356
No, I should be sorry for
doing this all the time.

218
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:51,891
See you.

219
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,761
I'm going back now.

220
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,696
Well, I'm going back too.

221
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,431
Thanks, Grandpa.

222
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,166
Sorry about this, father-in-law.

223
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,672
Everyone. You may think
I'm just spoiling my daughter,

224
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,778
but Urara's just desperate to do anything
to care for your family.

225
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,484
So please forgive her, as it were.

226
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,153
We understand, as it were!

227
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,721
Oh!

228
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,156
Thank you, as it were!

229
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,562
We got it. Thank you.

230
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,965
Well then, let's eat.

231
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,167
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

232
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,178
We can't eat Mita's cooking anymore.

233
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,549
But why would she work for
the family next door?

234
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,753
Could she just want to be near us

235
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,256
since she's worried about us?

236
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,992
I don't think it's that simple.

237
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,995
I have a bad feeling about this.

238
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,000
I think it's strange that
Mita always does anything we ask.

239
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,903
But after hearing her confession
the other day,

240
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,204
I was thinking that

241
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,041
maybe she wants to self-destruct.

242
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,443
What does "self-destruct" mean?

243
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,678
It means that she wants to kill herself,

244
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,047
or willingly accept the death sentence.

245
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,851
That's why she agreed to walk into
the river with Kii without any hesitation.

246
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,089
And also why
she tried to kill Kaito's classmate?

247
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,257
So...

248
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,828
Mita's working for Tsubasa's family
so that she can self-destruct?

249
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,032
The old hag next door seems like
she'd ask her to do dangerous things.

250
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,735
Since her husband's having an affair.

251
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,604
Hey. What should we do, Dad?

252
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:49,842
That is...

253
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,215
something you should
decide for yourselves.

254
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,116
Just kidding!

255
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,385
Why are you imitating Mita?

256
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,222
Sorry about that. Still...

257
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,557
When I look at you guys,

258
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,260
I feel really reassured.

259
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,297
As if you guys would be
able to protect Mita.

260
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,534
What kind of irresponsible statement
is that?

261
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,538
I told you guys why Yui was given
her name, right?

262
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,241
Because I can
bring the family back together

263
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,876
if we ever separated, right?

264
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,943
Yes.

265
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:30,215
In fact, your mom came up with
all your names.

266
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,284
Really? Then what about my name?

267
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,822
"I want Kakeru to become someone

268
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,825
who will come
to rescue our family immediately

269
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,060
if we ever get into trouble."

270
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,595
Then what about me?

271
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,365
"I want Kaito to become someone

272
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,334
who can provide solutions for our family."

273
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,005
What? Was my name supposed to be a pun?

274
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,039
What about me?

275
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,176
"In English, Kii means Key.

276
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,647
So, Kii will be the key that opens
the door of happiness for our family."

277
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,651
Okay! I'll do my best!

278
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,590
If the four of you work together,
you can do anything.

279
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,430
What? Are you not planning
to do anything, Dad?

280
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,201
For now, I'll have to
do my best in my job.

281
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,470
What? You found a job?

282
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,605
Well, yeah.

283
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,479
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

284
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,787
Good work today.

285
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,155
You too.

286
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,192
You're quite the odd one.

287
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,362
You were an elite employee
in a first-rate company,

288
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,798
yet you want
to work at subcontractors like us.

289
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,166
-Oh...
-Oops, I made a typo.

290
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,068
Well, I have my reasons.

291
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,973
Huh?

292
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,750
-What's the matter, Urara?
-Well...

293
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:16,255
I heard from Yui that
you got a job, Keiichi.

294
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,490
If you'd like, I bought lunch for you.

295
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,492
Oh, thanks.

296
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm sorry about yesterday, Keiichi.

297
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,932
You don't have to.

298
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,369
We're grateful that
you always worry about us, Urara.

299
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,573
Hey... A gift for you?

300
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,975
-Are you two lovebirds?
-No, that's not it...

301
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,678
-Are you two love-dovey?
-That's not... Oh!

302
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,847
-Sorry.
-It's all right!

303
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,117
In any case, I'm sure you two are lovers!

304
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,954
How lovey-dovey! All right, time to eat!

305
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,697
Hey. Why are you working
in a place like this?

306
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,835
Well, it was my dream to work for
a major construction company

307
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,272
and build big buildings and bridges.

308
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,075
This is a good chance for me,

309
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,710
so I wanted to start from scratch.

310
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,782
Is there anything I can help?

311
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,951
What?

312
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,421
Well... I'll just appreciate the thought.

313
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,825
I guess Mita's probably
way more useful than me.

314
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,293
No, that's not true.

315
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,931
But I do want you to come visit us again,
for the sake of the kids.

316
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,970
You know...

317
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,873
I think you guys should
stop getting involved with that person.

318
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,111
I think she's strange,
and she seems dangerous too.

319
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,580
What's going to happen
if she has a crime record?

320
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,948
Mita's not that kind of person.

321
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,483
What?

322
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,087
That person has circumstances
far beyond your imagination, Urara.

323
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,290
What do you mean?

324
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,060
Well, that's...

325
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,667
Let's have a talk again soon.
Thanks for the lunch.

326
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,515
Hey, what are you guys up to?

327
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,753
Perfect timing, Yui! We thought about it,

328
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,920
and the only way

329
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,189
is to make Mita get fired
so that she will come back!

330
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,624
What?

331
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,793
We asked the lady
at the housekeeping agency.

332
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,195
The top three reasons
why housekeepers get fired are

333
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,697
when they're bad at chores,

334
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,265
when they have an affair with the husband

335
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,468
and when they're suspected of stealing.

336
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,504
The first two reasons won't work,

337
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,005
so we're thinking of trying the third one.

338
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,307
Huh? What do you mean?

339
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,374
MINAGAWA RESIDENCE

340
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,644
Excuse me!

341
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,016
What do you need?

342
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,019
Excuse me, is Tsubasa in?

343
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,124
You have visitors, Tsubasa.

344
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,327
Let's hang out, Tsubasa!

345
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,329
Can we come play with you, too?

346
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,964
I heard your mom isn't around today!

347
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,132
Hey, you guys!

348
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,810
Here you go.

349
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,244
Thanks.

350
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,855
Why don't we play a game, Tsubasa?

351
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,192
The one that you like.

352
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,960
Sure.

353
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:47,799
Wow!

354
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,035
-You're really good.
-You're good at this.

355
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,072
Say, Tsubasa.

356
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,144
Where does your mom place her valuables?

357
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,679
I don't know.

358
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,482
What about things like
her jewels and rings?

359
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,816
Over there.

360
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,663
Okay.

361
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,735
Here it is!

362
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,805
Isn't this a bad idea?

363
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,540
It'll be fine.

364
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,410
We'll just return it
after Mita gets fired.

365
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,681
I'm home, Tsubasa!

366
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,786
Wait, what are you guys doing?

367
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:45,257
Well, we're here to play with Tsubasa.

368
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,693
We wanted to tour your house too,
since it looks really great.

369
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,395
Enough. Just go home already.

370
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,299
Tsubasa has to study
since his entrance exams are next year.

371
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,234
Mita.

372
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,703
Didn't I tell you not to let anyone in
while I'm away?

373
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,406
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,143
You guys!

375
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,813
What happened, Mita?

376
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:13,118
Could you please warn your siblings
to never come here again?

377
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:19,057
Ms. Minagawa ordered me to
not let you guys enter.

378
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

379
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,463
But Kakeru and the others just want to
do something for you, Mita.

380
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,332
Please, Mita. Just come back to our house!

381
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,268
Tell us.
Why are you working for this family?

382
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,871
I'm worried about you, Mita!

383
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,673
Please excuse me.

384
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,914
You don't even understand this, Tsubasa?

385
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,783
Do this next.

386
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,154
Tsubasa.

387
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,523
Call Papa and tell him this.

388
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,226
"I don't understand an exam question,

389
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,195
so come back home early and teach me."

390
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,831
What? Again?

391
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,334
Don't say that. Do it.

392
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,502
I don't want to!

393
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,536
Hey!

394
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,637
I'll go pee!

395
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,381
What do you want?

396
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,252
What should I do about
Mr. Minagawa's dinner?

397
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,153
What?

398
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,590
If I don't know when he will come back,

399
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,493
I cannot waste the food that I prepared.

400
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,129
You don't need to be concerned about that.

401
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,797
Just clean it up.

402
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,533
Understood.

403
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:47,746
Hey...

404
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,782
You were saying
something strange the other day,

405
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,484
but is it true?

406
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,519
What do you mean?

407
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,323
You said that he was on the phone
with another woman,

408
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,493
and that he's planning to divorce me.

409
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,298
If you suspect...

410
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,068
Then why don't you confirm it yourself?

411
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,472
There's no way I can ask my husband
if he's having an affair.

412
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,944
I don't want to be so pathetic that
I'd stoop to checking his phone.

413
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,512
Besides...

414
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,648
It's true that he's popular with woman,

415
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,217
but we were so madly in love.

416
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,353
When he proposed to me,

417
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,790
he said that he will only love me.

418
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,693
There's no way someone like him
would betray me.

419
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,896
If you have no other matters,

420
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,132
I would like to take my leave
since it's time.

421
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,070
Wait a minute.

422
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:48,940
You will really...

423
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,243
do anything I ask, right?

424
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,280
If it is within my means.

425
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,251
Then could you tail my husband tomorrow?

426
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,357
He said he has a golf business meeting,
but who knows if it's true.

427
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,394
If he happens to be with a woman,

428
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,896
I want you to investigate her, too.

429
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,332
As you wish.

430
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,669
Papa's home!

431
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,506
-Really?
-I bought cake, Tsubasa!

432
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,176
-Welcome home, Papa!
-Welcome home.

433
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,579
You're late today again.

434
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,749
I told you, it's busy at work lately.

435
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,718
I will be taking my leave, Mr. Minagawa.

436
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,257
Oh. Why don't you
join us for some cake, Mita?

437
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,294
No, I'm fine.

438
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
Take care.

439
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,836
I said you didn't have to see me off.

440
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,752
I'm counting on you.

441
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,154
Understood.

442
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,420
After that, your husband picked up
a young woman from an apartment in Aoyama

443
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,089
and headed for the golf course in Izu.

444
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,226
They shared random puns, like
"Aw, you dummy. I'll have a hole-in-one

445
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,895
with you today" as they enjoyed
their time playing golf.

446
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,298
They returned to Tokyo after that,

447
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,999
and thoroughly enjoyed food and wine

448
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,235
at a high-class restaurant in Nishi-azabu.

449
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,571
Mr. Minagawa was slightly drunk
as he left the restaurant,

450
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,973
kissing the woman
several times while they were walking

451
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,009
and said, "It's been years since I slept
in the same room as my wife.

452
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,479
In fact, I regret marrying her.

453
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,115
I would divorce her immediately
if we didn't have a child,

454
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,250
but it makes me so mad to think that
I have to pay for

455
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,918
the alimony fees and give her the house,
so I can't divorce her."

456
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,321
And then, they disappeared into a hotel.

457
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,759
Also...

458
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,796
What is it? There's still more?

459
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,504
This is receipt for the taxi fee.

460
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,507
I don't need that!

461
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,814
Just what's going on?

462
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:51,823
Just what have I worked so hard for?

463
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,103
Mita...

464
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,773
I have a request.

465
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,542
Yes?

466
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:15,814
Could you kill my husband tomorrow?

467
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,787
Is that an order?

468
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,256
That's right.

469
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,493
As you wish.

470
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,363
Wait.

471
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,671
Maybe I should die too.

472
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:44,709
Right. I think that's better.

473
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,348
If that's the case,
I can't leave Tsubasa alone.

474
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,487
Then... I'm bringing
the whole family with me.

475
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,968
Tomorrow, could you burn down this house

476
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,206
together with our entire family?

477
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,746
As you wish.

478
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,916
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

479
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,784
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

480
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,519
<i>And walk straight</i>

481
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,255
<i>And walk straight</i>

482
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,758
<i>Your beloved home is there waiting for you</i>

483
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,862
Yui. It's Tsubasa's birthday today.

484
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,497
Oh, really?

485
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,132
He was really happy.

486
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,003
His mommy told him that
she'll buy anything he wants.

487
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,472
He doesn't need to attend violin lesson,

488
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,208
and doesn't need to
study for exams anymore!

489
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,644
Is that so?

490
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,082
Mita!

491
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:09,661
Mita? I heard that
it's Tsubasa's birthday today.

492
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,607
Huh? So what's the problem?

493
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,509
Don't you think it's strange?

494
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,010
She suddenly told her child that

495
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,479
he doesn't need to go learn violin
or study.

496
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,182
That old hag was so strict about
her child's education,

497
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,617
like her life depended on it.

498
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,819
Don't tell me...

499
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,456
She's not planning to die, is she?

500
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,025
What?

501
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,264
Kii. I need you to help me.

502
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,699
What?

503
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,302
-Good evening!
-Good evening!

504
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,572
What is it? I told you guys
not to come here again.

505
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,276
Well, Kii brought a present for Tsubasa
since it's his birthday.

506
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,744
Are you there, Tsubasa?

507
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,180
-Happy birthday!
-Hey!

508
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,214
What is it?

509
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,351
Happy birthday, Tsubasa!

510
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,854
-I don't need things like this.
-What?

511
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,390
Hey, what did you do?

512
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,359
Could you kids just go home already?

513
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:19,097
Don't say that! We want to
celebrate his birthday!

514
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,733
We only celebrate birthdays
with our family members.

515
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,670
Ms. Minagawa! You didn't ask Mita
to do anything strange, right?

516
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,374
-What are you saying?
-If you did, tell her to stop.

517
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,310
Mita will really do anything dangerous
you tell her to do!

518
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,412
It's none of your business!

519
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,713
Mita!

520
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,951
Please! Stop doing anything dangerous!

521
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,454
We beg you, Mita!

522
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,023
Come home!

523
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,594
Just leave!
You're going hurt your fingers!

524
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,561
You're in the way! Leave!

525
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,902
Dinner is ready.

526
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,176
Did something happen?
It was noisy earlier.

527
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,213
It's nothing. Shall we eat now?

528
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,817
Come over and sit, Tsubasa.

529
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,086
Hurry, Tsubasa.

530
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,588
This is amazing.

531
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,857
-Wow!
-Right? They look delicious.

532
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:20,958
It looks so good.

533
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,195
Which dish shall I start with?

534
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,469
-Wow.
-So tasty.

535
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,871
They all taste so good.

536
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,808
-Right, Tsubasa?
-Yes!

537
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,411
-Mita's really good at cooking!
-You're right.

538
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,982
I really wanted to eat food like these.

539
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,952
I'm sorry that you always had to
eat my bad cooking.

540
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,622
You know I didn't mean it that way.

541
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:55,126
Right. Do you have a family, Mita?

542
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,564
I had a husband and son.

543
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,734
That means...

544
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,506
Have they perhaps passed away?

545
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,541
Yes.

546
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,980
My son was around the same age as Tsubasa.

547
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,218
If you don't mind, could you share

548
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,320
the reason why they passed away?

549
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,357
Someone set fire to our house.

550
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,327
What? By whom?

551
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,999
Mita. Could you get the cake out now?

552
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,905
Understood.

553
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:48,546
<i>Happy birthday dear Tsubasa</i>

554
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,451
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

555
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,652
-Can I?
-Go ahead.

556
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,024
-Yay!
-Happy birthday!

557
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,664
Hey, you! What are you doing?

558
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,132
I'm pouring gasoline.

559
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,868
I'm asking why you're doing this!

560
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,141
Ms. Minagawa ordered me to do so.

561
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:22,046
She asked me to burn down the house,
together with the whole family.

562
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,915
What?

563
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,519
Did you ask her to do that?

564
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,292
It's your fault! It's all because
you betrayed me!

565
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,166
Are you crazy?

566
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,869
What do you take Tsubasa's life for?

567
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,071
Don't just blame me!

568
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,740
Besides...

569
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,742
I didn't expect her to do it for real.

570
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,579
Wait, stop it! Hey!

571
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,216
-That hurt!
-Papa!

572
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,287
Stop!

573
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,359
What's with that look?

574
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,130
I knew it.
There's something wrong with you.

575
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,867
You'd kill anyone without hesitation.

576
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,307
You're so dangerous. Why don't you die
for the sake of this world?

577
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,777
As you wish.

578
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,221
Hey. What are you doing?

579
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,156
Let's run, Tsubasa!

580
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,827
Hey! Wait! Wait for me!

581
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,028
Run!

582
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,978
Stop, Mita!

583
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,857
Mita!

584
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:58,569
I'm sorry, but could you not interfere?

585
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,783
I beg you! Please stop, Mita!

586
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:18,823
Get out! All of you will die if you don't.

587
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,691
Mita...

588
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,227
Are you fine with this?

589
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,663
You'll really die.

590
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,300
I don't mind.

591
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,736
Don't say that!

592
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,906
This has nothing to do with you.

593
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,411
It has everything to do with us!

594
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,615
I love you, Mita!

595
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,653
Do you like me, Mita?

596
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,531
I...

597
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,334
I'm stupid,

598
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,704
so I don't know what I should do now.

599
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:08,973
But...

600
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,479
I just want to protect you, Mita!

601
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,715
I...

602
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,785
I'll rack my brains,

603
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,355
and come up with a way
for you to be happy, Mita!

604
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,358
I...

605
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,494
No matter what you say,

606
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:36,200
I feel that we have all formed
a family bond with one another!

607
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,336
Otherwise,

608
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,540
you wouldn't have told us
your terrible past!

609
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,710
So...

610
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,114
I don't ever want to let go of our bond!

611
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,416
No...

612
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,785
I won't let go, even if I die!

613
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,361
Just stop this already!

614
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,773
Please leave me alone already.

615
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,709
I...

616
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,178
As a housekeeper,

617
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,982
I only need to do what I'm ordered to.

618
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,450
Why?

619
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,321
Why would you say that?

620
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,160
I do not deserve to have a will of my own.

621
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,204
When I act on my own will,

622
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,407
everyone around me becomes unhappy.

623
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,378
All the people I love

624
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,981
has left this world.

625
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,452
There is nothing left

626
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,455
in my heart.

627
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,160
I simply need to

628
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,998
carry out orders, just like a robot.

629
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,937
Is that why...

630
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,973
you're working as a housekeeper?

631
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,948
I tried to die so many times,
but it wouldn't work.

632
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,688
When I act on my own will,

633
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,092
things just don't work out the way I want.

634
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,465
I've been waiting...

635
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,370
for this day to come.

636
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,217
Please, stop getting in my way!

637
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,454
You're mistaken, Mita!

638
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,491
Our family...

639
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,995
Thanks to you...

640
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:26,136
We got over the pain of losing Mom.

641
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,542
Isn't this because you wanted to help us

642
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:37,047
and wanted us to become happy

643
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,749
from the bottom of your heart?

644
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,326
I know that the pain and sadness you feel

645
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:56,000
is nothing comparable to ours!

646
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:07,011
This time, we'll do what we can.

647
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,116
We want to save you, Mita!

648
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,260
Mita. Come fetch me at school again,

649
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,630
and sing songs with me again!

650
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:32,202
<i>After climbing up this slope</i>

651
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,973
<i>There's a tree to the right</i>

652
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,515
<i>When you turn at the tree
and walk straight</i>

653
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,718
<i>Your beloved home is there waiting for you</i>

654
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,421
That's her! Hurry up and arrest her!

655
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,725
-Wait! There's a reason why she's...
-Come with us!

656
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,693
-Mita!
-Mita!

657
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,937
SAKURADAI POLICE STATION

658
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,246
Excuse me...

659
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:50,714
Are you all right?

660
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,250
Don't worry, she's fine!

661
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,754
The police also heard
what the wife had to say,

662
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,990
so they understood that it's just
a marital fight.

663
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:04,495
Besides, the husband said that
it's his fault in the first place,

664
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:08,365
so they don't want to
wash dirty linen in public.

665
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,600
I see.

666
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,970
Please excuse me.

667
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,542
Excuse me, Mita.

668
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,047
I heard from the kids.

669
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,750
They saw you get mad for the first time.

670
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,687
Actually, I'm angry too.

671
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,626
You let my kids be in danger!

672
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,495
They were trying to protect you
with their lives!

673
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,198
Are you going to feign ignorance?

674
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,235
I'm sorry.

675
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,641
If you're sorry,

676
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,343
then take responsibility
and work for us again.

677
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,380
That's fine, right?

678
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,917
Oh, I'm totally fine with it.

679
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:04,755
In return, we won't ask you to
do anything that will trouble others

680
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,358
or resort to any cowardly acts
to shirk our own responsibility.

681
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,763
We want your help
to make our family happy, Mita.

682
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,934
If possible, we want you to be happy too.

683
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,905
If you're fine with that,

684
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,641
could you please work for us again?

685
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,580
With your own will.

686
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,540
Morning.

687
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,609
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

688
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,113
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

689
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,349
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

690
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,334
Will Mita come?

691
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,869
She will.

692
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,771
Yeah.

693
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,606
Right.

694
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,143
Guess Mita's not coming.

695
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,195
I'll get the door!

696
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,041
Hello. I'm Mita, the housekeeper.

697
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,145
Excuse me, but are you here to work again?

698
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,848
No, that's not it.

699
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,918
It seems like I left something here
the other day.

700
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,754
Did you find a handkerchief?

701
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,457
Oh, did you mean this?

702
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:58,362
Sorry about this. Thank you!

703
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,331
Oh, one more thing.

704
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,367
Anything else?

705
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:07,070
Akari's at the entrance.

706
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,373
What?

707
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,788
Mita...

708
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,991
What are you doing? Just come in!

709
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,662
Before that, can I confirm something?

710
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,832
What is it?

711
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:39,236
I am simply a housekeeper.

712
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,339
I am not part of your family.

713
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,010
We know.

714
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:50,347
I will not eat with all of you.

715
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,750
I will not go out with all of you.

716
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,852
Also...

717
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,058
The only thing I will not do is smile.

718
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,130
Are you fine with that?

719
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:15,939
We understand.

720
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,575
Please excuse me.

721
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,361
It looks so good.

722
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,263
Well then...

723
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,731
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

724
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,073
It's just so good!

725
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,182
Ouch!

726
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,750
What's wrong?

727
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,720
Mita!

728
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,355
Yes?

729
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,791
I got a splinter.

730
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,060
Do you have a tweezer?

731
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:12,929
I do.

732
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,903
Hey. Do you suppose that

733
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,206
she can pull out the most ridiculous items
from that bag of hers?

734
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,076
Try saying something.

735
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,914
Mita.

736
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,749
Yes?

737
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,519
Do you have medicine
that will make me clever?

738
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,157
I don't have that.

739
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,058
I knew it.

740
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,393
Stupid.

741
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,795
There's not way she'd have one.

742
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,464
Then Mita.

743
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,500
Yes?

744
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,203
Do you have a photo of
your husband and son?

745
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,142
Oh, sorry. Forget about that.

746
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,913
If you don't hurry,
you will be late for school.

747
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,183
Oh, no!

748
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,219
-We're leaving!
-We're leaving!

749
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,288
Have a safe trip.

750
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,393
Let's go, Kii.

751
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,834
Good morning.

752
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,638
Oh... You're back, Mita.

753
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,343
Then I don't need to worry anymore.

754
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,047
I'm leaving Keiichi and the kids
in your care.

755
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,351
Also, please eat these.

756
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:23,660
Did you make this
for Mr. Asuda and the children?

757
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,431
Well... It's always like this.

758
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,635
I'm always unlucky,
and things I do always backfire.

759
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,403
I'm just extremely unlucky.

760
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,405
Taxis won't appear
right when I'm in a hurry,

761
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,508
and I fall off the stairs when I visit
a shrine to ward off bad luck.

762
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,677
The computer and fax machine
also breaks down when I use it.

763
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,246
Even when I go out with guys,
I always pull the shorter end of the stick

764
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,081
and fall for the losers.

765
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,752
What are you trying to say?

766
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:56,860
Mita...

767
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,931
I think I'm in love with Keiichi.

768
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,570
I know it's dumb,
but I just can't control it any longer.

769
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,077
What am I saying?

770
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,845
Please forget about that.

771
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,915
Also, could you not tell that to everyone?

772
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,551
I will never come here again.

773
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,986
See you.

774
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,038
Your cooking is tasty as always, Mommy.

775
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,581
We're really lucky, aren't we?

776
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,850
We get to eat delicious food every day.

777
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,318
Yeah!

778
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,291
-You should eat more vegetables, too.
-Okay.

779
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,260
Let me take some for you.

780
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,829
I spilled a little, but it's fine.

781
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,969
Mommy. Let's go to
the amusement park together again!

782
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,773
Right. Shall we go
this coming Sunday, Akari?

783
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,769
The two of you are angry that

784
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,504
I'm the only one happy, right?

785
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,639
No matter what you do,

786
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:57,807
you always make everyone
around you unhappy.

787
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,676
Stop blaming yourself.

788
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:00,910
Let's go home.

789
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,413
I cannot return to how I once was

790
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,448
before my husband and son died!

791
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:10,887
