1
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,238
Wow!

2
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,975
-Well then, let's dig in.
-I'm digging in!

3
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,781
The food today's great as usual!

4
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,015
Well...

5
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,819
We're really lucky to be able to
eat delicious food like this every day,

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,020
Mita.

7
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,822
We're really lucky, aren't we?

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,625
We get to eat delicious food every day.

9
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,128
Mommy. Let's go to
the amusement park together again!

10
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,065
Right. Let's go, Akari.

11
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,868
Mita. Could you teach me
how to cook next time?

12
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,572
I've been slacking on it
since I always relied on Mom to cook.

13
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,875
Oh, you can't?

14
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,450
That's not it. As you wish.

15
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,251
All right! Thanks.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,588
Are you all right?

17
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,123
You're so gross!

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,926
Man, someone must be
talking behind my back again.

19
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,462
Are you sure you didn't catch a cold?

20
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,197
That's not possible.

21
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,866
Seconds, please!

22
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,436
Seconds please, Mita.

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,009
Yes.

24
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,280
Mita, could it be
that you were spacing out just now?

25
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,783
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,186
That's our first time seeing that!

27
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,057
You don't look too well.

28
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,626
Please let us know if you feel sick.

29
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,729
No, I'm fine.

30
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,967
I still think Mita should eat with us.

31
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,503
Kii's right. If you just stand there,

32
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,038
I feel a little restless.

33
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:24,878
I'm a housekeeper, so I do not intend on
eating with everyone in the family.

34
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,247
I believe I have emphasized earlier.

35
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,283
Hey, what does "emphasize" mean?

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,218
It means she made a promise.

37
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,555
Mita, please don't say that!

38
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,995
Just let her be, Kii.
Mita's working right now.

39
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,731
You don't need to sulk like that.

40
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,769
What's wrong, Kaito?

41
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,675
It's nothing serious,
but we have parents' day soon.

42
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,743
What? When is it?

43
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,411
This coming Wednesday.

44
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,781
-Can you come, Dad?
-Oh...

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,950
Sorry, but I don't think so.

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,053
-I just joined the new company, so...
-I guessed so.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,722
Kai. Why don't you ask Mita to go instead?

48
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,324
What?

49
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:12,825
Will you?

50
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,229
I believe I've emphasized it, too.

51
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,566
I am not your family member.

52
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,772
Then, could you write on the form that
you'll be absent, Dad?

53
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,041
Got it. Sorry. Kaito.

54
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,943
Don't worry about it.

55
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,346
Maybe you're better off not coming.

56
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,217
What? What do you mean, Kaito?

57
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,987
My teacher wants us to write
a letter of appreciation to our mothers

58
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,023
and read them out during parents' day.

59
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,995
What? Then, what about
the kids with no moms?

60
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,531
He said we could just
write it to our fathers,

61
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,166
but it doesn't sit well with me.

62
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,603
Why did your teacher come up with
such an insensitive assignment?

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,371
What will you do, Kai?

64
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm really at a loss right now.

65
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,278
But, I feel like there should be
a good solution to this.

66
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,092
Thanks.

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,428
This is the Asuda residence.

68
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,932
Oh, this is Yuki. Is Kii around?

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,634
One moment.

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,738
Hold on. I need to talk to you, too.

71
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,640
What is it?

72
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,012
Did you hear about anything from Urara?

73
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,015
What do you mean?

74
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,916
Ever since you went back to the family,

75
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,620
she said that she will
never visit that home again.

76
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,058
Also...

77
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,395
She even said she's going on blind dates,

78
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,829
when she hated the idea so much.

79
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,265
<i>Do you know anything?</i>

80
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,868
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

81
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,972
<i>I think I'm in love with Keiichi.</i>

82
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,109
No, I don't.

83
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,778
I see.

84
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,180
I will let Kii take the call.

85
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,850
It's a call from your grandfather.

86
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,254
Hello, Grandpa?

87
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,356
Yes.

88
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,193
Really? Okay!

89
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,196
Thank you! See you!

90
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,299
What's the matter, Kii?

91
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,300
Grandpa said that

92
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,336
since I'm attending
elementary school next year,

93
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,371
we should go buy my school bag together.

94
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,141
Already? Grandpa is getting
way too excited.

95
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,410
You should join me, Mita.

96
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,413
I believe I have made myself clear.

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,683
I will not go out with--

98
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,820
Then, just treat this as an order!

99
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,521
Please!

100
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,925
As you wish.

101
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,030
I like this one, Grandpa.

102
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,531
Which one, as it were?

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,602
Which one's better, Mita?

104
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,138
That is...

105
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,874
something you two should decide together.

106
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,578
Don't say that. Tell us what you think,
as it were.

107
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,447
Please! You can just point at one,
as it were!

108
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,158
<i>Which do you think looks nice, Mommy?</i>

109
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,298
<i>Well, I think this one's better.</i>

110
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,235
<i>What? This one's better, right Mommy?</i>

111
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,812
What's wrong, Mita?

112
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,855
Are you feeling unwell?

113
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,561
No, it's nothing.

114
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,726
Wow! I'll try it, too.

115
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,864
Mita...

116
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,936
I'm feeling the chills.
Do you have ginger tea?

117
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,071
I do.

118
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,481
Kakeru. I think you caught a cold.

119
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,616
Shut up.

120
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,787
You're going to spread it to everyone.
Why don't you go sleep?

121
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,255
I know.

122
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,695
Mita. Is my school bag too big?

123
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:21,133
It's fine. You will grow, Kii.

124
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,437
Then, Mita. Come to
my school opening ceremony, okay?

125
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,741
Is that...

126
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,244
Just treat it as an order!

127
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,781
As you wish.

128
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,949
Thanks!

129
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,020
Kii, the bag's going to get dirtied,
so put it away.

130
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,321
Okay!

131
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,230
<i>Which do you think looks nice, Mommy?</i>

132
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,006
Oh... Are you all right?
Wait, where's the band-aid?

133
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,476
It's fine. I brought some with me.

134
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,750
Thank you.

135
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,022
It's my first time seeing you mess up.

136
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,592
But it's a given. You're human, Mita.

137
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,699
Mita! Could you help me clean my ear?

138
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,868
As you wish.

139
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,409
Kii, you're acting too spoiled.

140
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,844
Mita's not your mom.

141
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,880
I know.

142
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,550
Mita.

143
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,853
Can you solve this question?

144
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,428
The circumference X is the sum of
the circumferences of the three circles.

145
00:09:55,494 --> 00:10:01,400
Therefore, (6 + 4 x 2) x 3.14 = 43.96.

146
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,937
Oh, I see.

147
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:10,576
Hey. Could you teach me when you're free?
When you have free time, that is.

148
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,812
As you wish.

149
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,014
Thanks.

150
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,718
Hey, Kaito.

151
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,255
Have you decided what to write
for the letter of appreciation?

152
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,557
Not yet.

153
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,228
I think it's probably the best
to write something about Mom, but...

154
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,066
But she killed herself.

155
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,670
There's no way I can write it and ask

156
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,405
why she abandoned us to die alone.

157
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,609
But, that's also
what I wanted to ask Mom the most.

158
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,950
Hey. What do you think I should do, Mita?

159
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,254
That is...

160
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,594
something you should
decide for yourself, Kaito.

161
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,463
Guessed as much.

162
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,848
Thanks...

163
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,799
"TO MOM"

164
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,139
"TO DAD"

165
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,281
Do you need any help?

166
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,184
Oh... No, I'm fine.

167
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,777
I'm home.

168
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,113
Welcome home.

169
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,448
Oh, sorry that I'm back late.

170
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,717
I will prepare dinner now.

171
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,154
Don't worry about it.
It's way past your clock-out time.

172
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,990
It's fine, I just need to heat it up.

173
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,026
PARENTS' DAY ATTENDANCE FORM
I WILL ATTEND/NOT ATTEND THE EVENT.

174
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,936
Thanks. Where are the kids?

175
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,707
Yui is reading a book to Kii,

176
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,310
but she's sleepy and fell asleep as well.

177
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,714
Kakeru has a fever of 38 degrees Celscius,

178
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,816
and it seems like
he's having a serious sore throat,

179
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,752
so I think he should visit
the hospital tomorrow.

180
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,889
Then, what about Kaito?

181
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,359
He is still working on that assignment.

182
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,428
I see.

183
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,030
All right. Thank you for the food.

184
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,506
Your food helps me relax, as usual.

185
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,444
Thank you, Mita.

186
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,553
If there is nothing else,

187
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,221
I will excuse myself now.

188
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,627
Please excuse me.

189
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,565
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

190
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,934
What is it?

191
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,737
Do you wear that down jacket everyday?

192
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,072
Yes.

193
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,274
Isn't it hot during the summer?

194
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,643
I don't really mind.

195
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,080
Then, what about your watch and bag?

196
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,920
Oh, sorry. It's just that your attire
isn't really feminine,

197
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,355
so I've been curious about it.

198
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,157
Please excuse me.

199
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,927
<i>I'm home. Sorry that I'm home late.</i>

200
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,630
<i>We had an urgent case right before
I was about to knock off.</i>

201
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,134
<i>-Welcome home!
-I'm home!</i>

202
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,436
<i>Thanks for the watch, Daddy!</i>

203
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,572
<i>All the kids in school were envious of me!</i>

204
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,575
<i>You have to cherish it, okay?</i>

205
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,745
<i>Mommy was angry and said that
you're too young to have one.</i>

206
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,916
<i>Okay! By the way,
we bought this hat for you, Mommy!</i>

207
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,657
Mita! Are you all right?

208
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,932
Mita. Are you feeling unwell?

209
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,937
No, I'm fine.

210
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,342
But you seem to be acting strange,
especially since you came back.

211
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,278
-Please excuse me.
-Mita!

212
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,062
I'm embarrassed to say this,

213
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,264
but I raised her alone,

214
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,667
so I couldn't do anything for her.

215
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,169
I don't know if you will like her.

216
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,308
Excuse me...

217
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,244
Do you go on diets, Ms. Urara?

218
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,081
Oh, I don't gain weight
no matter how much I eat.

219
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:55,187
Then, what kind of man do you like?

220
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,722
Let's see...

221
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,491
Someone that will bring me misfortune.

222
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,726
What?

223
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,732
Oh... What she meant was that

224
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,268
her only good point is
her optimistic disposition,

225
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,905
so she can endure it
when the going gets tough.

226
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,141
I see!

227
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,245
Then, what kind of family do you want
after you get married?

228
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,081
For now...

229
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,417
I'm fine so long as
I don't give birth to four children

230
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,920
and end up committing suicide,
like my older sister.

231
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,558
Hey! They don't need any details!

232
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,327
Why not? It's better if we're honest.

233
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,698
Please excuse me.

234
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,003
There's a lipstick stain
on this wine glass.

235
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,172
What's going on?
Isn't this a first-class hotel?

236
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,541
I'm really sorry.
I will have it replaced now--

237
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,744
Never mind, I'm used to this.

238
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,819
Do you always speak your mind, Ms. Urara?

239
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:06,925
Not really. If I had to compare, I guess
my personality would be like this coaster.

240
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,861
I always get ignored,

241
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,363
and I keep following people
when even I'm not needed.

242
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,538
She's too nervous that she got drunk,
as it were!

243
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,276
YUKI RESIDENCE

244
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,413
Here.

245
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,089
What's up with your attitude back there?

246
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,225
You're being rude to the other party.

247
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,960
Who cares?

248
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,697
It's better for them to know my real self
rather than getting disappointed later!

249
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,542
What is it?

250
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,979
I think...

251
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,282
What?

252
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,185
You're in love with that man, right?

253
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,690
Who are you talking about?

254
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,692
You know who it is!

255
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,996
Are you referring to Keiichi?

256
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,732
Of course not!

257
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,070
Besides, you'll definitely be against it
even if it were true.

258
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:31,210
You can't let both of your daughters
be taken away by the same man.

259
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,665
-Morning.
-Good morning.

260
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,535
-See you later!
-Sure, at the classroom. Bye.

261
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,775
-One, two...
-One, two...

262
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,080
-One, two...
-One, two...

263
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,983
Ready, set! One, two, three, four...

264
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,117
-five, six...
-Five, six...

265
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,653
-seven, eight. Let's go!
-Yes!

266
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,722
-One, two...
-One, two...

267
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,757
-Good morning.
-One, two...

268
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,359
Urara!

269
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,663
Is it true that you went on a blind date?

270
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,067
Yeah. He's quite nice.
He seems interested in me, too.

271
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,069
What? So, are you going to get married?

272
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,205
Then what about school?

273
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,339
Well...

274
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,308
I was thinking about quitting.

275
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,877
Students and parents dislike me,

276
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,380
and the other teachers often say that

277
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,482
I'm not suitable to be a teacher.

278
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,484
Are you really fine with that?

279
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,787
It's better for you and the kids too.

280
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,422
I told Mita about it.

281
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,025
I will never visit your house again.

282
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,127
Don't say that!

283
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,564
You and Grandpa are
part of our family, too!

284
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,902
Didn't Kii find a stone for you
and place it in the box the other day?

285
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,676
Someone like me is better off gone
for everyone's sake.

286
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,380
Please tell Kii to throw away my stone.

287
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,322
Urara really said that?

288
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,025
Maybe she's really
planning to get married.

289
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,795
Isn't it fine as long as she's happy?

290
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,130
The problem is
she doesn't look like she's happy.

291
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,700
I don't like it.

292
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,370
Urara used to smile so much,
but it feels like she completely changed.

293
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:46,411
But, why did Urara
suddenly talk about getting married?

294
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,581
I think she really likes you, Dad.

295
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,515
What?

296
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,252
That's why she said she's not coming over.

297
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,087
No way. That's not possible.

298
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,923
Dad's right. No way at all.

299
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,927
Seriously, you should stop talking!

300
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,865
Mr. Asuda.

301
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,867
Yes?

302
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,503
Ms. Urara...

303
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,841
Do you know something, Mita?

304
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,047
No, it's nothing.

305
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,650
HARUMI HOUSEKEEPING AGENCY

306
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,985
Isn't it fine?

307
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:33,759
If there's something you want to say,
just say it.

308
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:40,132
I mean, you're worried about
the family that you're working for.

309
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,336
It's a given as a housekeeper.

310
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,741
Akari. You're beginning to change.

311
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,313
You're trying to regain your humanity.

312
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,950
It's all thanks to that family.

313
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,952
Even today.

314
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,823
It's the first time you came here
to consult me about something.

315
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,195
You told them
the pain and sadness you went through.

316
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:15,033
The fact that you could tell them about it

317
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,905
is proof that you love them.

318
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:28,580
Oh, my. Didn't I just say something great?

319
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,249
I should write it down.

320
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,124
Hey, why don't you stop this already?

321
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:43,462
Stop thinking that people around you
become unhappy

322
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,765
when you act on your own will.

323
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,167
Here you go.

324
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,873
How are you feeling, Kakeru?

325
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,377
I'm much better now.
My fever subsided, too.

326
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,480
-That's great. You can talk now, too.
-Yeah.

327
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:15,627
Right. Have you filled up
the Parents' Day attendance form, Dad?

328
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:20,999
Oh, sorry! Where did I leave it?

329
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,805
Pardon me for my impertinence,
but I filled it in for you.

330
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,940
Oh, thanks.

331
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,643
Here you go, Kaito.

332
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,711
Thanks.

333
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,314
Kaito. What about
the letter of appreciation?

334
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,085
Parents' Day is tomorrow, right?

335
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:46,158
I borrowed Mom's will from Yui
to see if I can came up with anything,

336
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:51,530
but all I can think of is,
"Why did she kill herself?"

337
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,034
Like I said, Kaito...

338
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,670
It's all my fault.

339
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,741
But, the fact remains that
Mom abandoned us.

340
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,211
When she died, all she thought about
was your betrayal

341
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,381
and forgot all about us!

342
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,452
I just can't accept that.

343
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,790
You're right. It feels as if
she just left us to die.

344
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,627
As if she didn't care about us anymore.

345
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:27,799
I wished that she had thought about us
and reconsidered her choice.

346
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,838
Maybe... It's all my fault.

347
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,207
It's because I told her to die!

348
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,809
I told you that's not true, Kii.

349
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,314
I don't think I can talk about this
in class.

350
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,382
I'll write my letter of appreciation
to you, Dad.

351
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,251
I think that's for the best.

352
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,687
Well... Okay.

353
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,858
I don't have the right to say anything.

354
00:24:54,826 --> 00:25:00,131
Man... Is the old hag next door
really right?

355
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,635
That we're not a normal family.

356
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,454
Please excuse me.

357
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,323
What is it?

358
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,161
Hey! What are you doing, Mita?

359
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,737
Please forgive my impertinence,

360
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:43,475
but I think you should write
the letter of appreciation for your mom.

361
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,579
But... She killed herself.

362
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,750
Your mom did not commit suicide.
It was an accident.

363
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,519
-Huh?
-What?

364
00:25:55,754 --> 00:26:00,325
Perhaps it's true that
your mom wrote a will

365
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,093
and walked into the river in despair

366
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,563
to try and kill herself.

367
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,167
But when she was unable to breathe
under the water,

368
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,169
she must have thought of this,

369
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,772
"I don't want to die."

370
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,844
"I must never die,
for the sake of my kids."

371
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,881
I'm sure she regretted it.

372
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,651
That she shouldn't have
made this hasty decision.

373
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,690
That she should have had
a proper talk with Mr. Asuda again.

374
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,492
That she should have tried
to work things out again

375
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,828
for the children's sake.

376
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,531
What are you saying, Mita?

377
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,133
Yui's right. How do you know that?

378
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,937
It's because
I've tried to kill myself before, too.

379
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:54,379
Contrary to what I want,
my body struggled to live by itself.

380
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:00,785
I struggled desperately to breathe again.

381
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:08,293
I'm sure that your mom
must have realized it then.

382
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:15,467
"I want to meet Yui again.
I want to see Kakeru again."

383
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,738
"I want to see Kaito again.
I want to see Kii again."

384
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,609
I'm sure that was all she could think of.

385
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,617
"I want to teach Yui more about
cooking and household chores,

386
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:37,922
when she's working so hard
as the eldest child."

387
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:45,597
"I want to help Kakeru
when he's in trouble,

388
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,366
because he always tries his best
to protect the family."

389
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,772
"Kaito always does his best in everything.

390
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,708
I want to praise him more."

391
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,515
"Kii is inquisitive,
and always asks questions.

392
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,252
I want to come up with an answer
for her to become happy."

393
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,189
"I should have talked more to everyone."

394
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,293
"I should have given them more hugs."

395
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,998
"I want to meet everyone."

396
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,666
"I want to see them."

397
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,135
"I don't want to die."

398
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,638
"I want to hear their voices."

399
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,740
"I want to live."

400
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,377
So...

401
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,314
Your mom did not commit suicide.

402
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,917
She died in an accident.

403
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm sure that...

404
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,466
she never intended to abandon all of you.

405
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,034
But...

406
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,671
That's not what the others think.

407
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,641
He's right, Mita.
Nagiko died because of me--

408
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,944
It doesn't matter what the others think.

409
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,147
That is...

410
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,752
something you decide for yourselves.

411
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,232
I...

412
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,370
I don't think Mom killed herself.

413
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,873
Me, too.

414
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,608
Don't say it before us.

415
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,177
I'm supposed to be
the one writing the letter.

416
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,788
Dad.

417
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,157
Mom's death...

418
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,559
was an accident.

419
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,129
Right?

420
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,934
You're right.

421
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,448
I'm sure Mom must be thinking of
the same thing in heaven.

422
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,186
She wants to have this letter burnt.

423
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,030
Mita. Do you have a lighter?

424
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,633
I do.

425
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,683
I'm going to burn it now, okay?

426
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:15,907
I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN BE ABANDONED BY YOU

427
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,301
Mr. Asuda.

428
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,939
If there is nothing else,

429
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,375
I will take my leave now.

430
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,944
Oh, Mita.

431
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,485
Thank you so much for what you said.

432
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,391
I'm sure the kids are grateful
for your words, too.

433
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,358
Just like me.

434
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,664
I simply said what I'm thinking of.

435
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,666
Mita.

436
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,634
Yes?

437
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,438
I won't think about things that
I should have done

438
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,107
or things that I should not have done.

439
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,878
I'll stop harping on the past
and my regrets.

440
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,984
Doing that just denies
the present time I'm living in.

441
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,722
From now on,
I want to live with my children

442
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,725
and thinking about
the present and the future only.

443
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:48,366
From now on, I want to talk about Nagiko

444
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,101
to the kids, as much as possible.

445
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,006
I believe that's what I should do
as a father.

446
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,116
This is the invoice for
today's overtime hours.

447
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,254
Okay.

448
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,291
Please excuse me.

449
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,965
Mita. I wrote the essay,
so would you read it?

450
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,369
That is...

451
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,241
something you should
ask your father to do.

452
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,278
I thought so.

453
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,183
But will you read it?
You can do it tomorrow morning.

454
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,452
As you wish.

455
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,156
Mita.

456
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:52,130
Could you please make it for
Parents' Day tomorrow? Do it for Kai.

457
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,401
You can treat this as an order.

458
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,874
Mommy!

459
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,479
I'll read you a letter in school tomorrow,

460
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,547
so you have to come, okay?

461
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,719
Let's see. What did you write, Jun?

462
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,191
What's wrong, Mita?

463
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,994
The moon's beautiful today, Akari.

464
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,963
Hurry up, Mommy!

465
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,900
Mita?

466
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,711
I'm going to become
an astronaut when I grow up.

467
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,846
Is that so?

468
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,650
Then you should take us
to the moon one day. Right, Akari?

469
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,458
Are you fine, Mita?

470
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,328
Mita!

471
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,073
Please excuse me.

472
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,615
You should be fine now, seeing that
you have such a good appetite.

473
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,283
Yeah, I'm back to tip-top condition.

474
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,885
-Try not to let your neck get too cold.
-Got it.

475
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,758
Kaito. Sorry that I can't make it today.

476
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,093
It's fine.

477
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,129
I'm done.

478
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,731
I'm done.

479
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,600
Have a safe trip.

480
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,136
-We're leaving, Dad.
-Take care.

481
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,504
I'm leaving!

482
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,675
Mita. Have you read my essay?

483
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,244
Yes.

484
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,912
What do you think?

485
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:53,151
If you don't hurry up, you will be late.

486
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,820
Oh no! I'm done!

487
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,492
Listen to my essay later, Mom.
I'm leaving.

488
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,430
-Have a safe trip.
-I'm leaving.

489
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,498
Good luck.

490
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:25,082
Okay! Everyone, don't get nervous
just because your mom's here.

491
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,085
Are you guys still breathing?

492
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,922
Just act like how you usually do in class.

493
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,491
Okay. Who's going to start first?

494
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,226
-Me!
-Me!

495
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,861
Okay, Homura.

496
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,496
Okay.

497
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,770
"My mom. My mom is an amazing person."

498
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,573
"She carries stuff heavier than Dad does."

499
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,744
"I wake up a few times at night
because of Mom's snoring."

500
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:58,316
"But it looked like she was sleeping well,

501
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,952
so I decided not to wake her up."

502
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,854
"When I grow up,

503
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,325
I want to become a mother just like Mom."

504
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:13,097
Okay. I think that essay really expresses
how thankful she is towards her mother.

505
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,032
A round of applause!

506
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,438
Who wants to read their essay next?

507
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,373
-Me!
-Me!

508
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,911
Okay, Asuda.

509
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,715
Yes.

510
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,488
"This summer, my mother...

511
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,925
died in an accident."

512
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,464
"I'm the third child of four siblings."

513
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,669
"I'm not the first child,
not the eldest son, nor the youngest."

514
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:59,443
"So I always asked Mom
who she loved the most."

515
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:03,281
"I wanted her to say that it was me."

516
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,684
"However, Mom's answer
was always the same."

517
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,488
"I love everyone of you, of course."

518
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,423
"I wasn't happy about that."

519
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,960
"I thought Mom was a cold person."

520
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,098
"I didn't care if it was a lie.
I wished that she had said it was me."

521
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,137
"But, now I regret it."

522
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,709
"I should have been the one
telling her that I loved her."

523
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,213
"I should have thanked her,
and be grateful towards her."

524
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:42,253
"If I had done so,
maybe Mom wouldn't have died."

525
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,625
"I'm sure that my siblings
feel the same way."

526
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:54,031
"Mom, we're sorry that we talked back
and always complained about you."

527
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,867
"We're sorry that
we never realized how you felt."

528
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,806
"You always cooked delicious food for us,

529
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,943
but we never thanked you for it.
We're sorry."

530
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,080
"If I could meet Mom once again,

531
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,550
I want to eat
her favorite apple with her."

532
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,921
"Her shoulder were always stiff,

533
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,756
so I want to massage it for her."

534
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,894
"Her hands always get cold
when she's washing the dishes,

535
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,597
so I want to warm it up for her."

536
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,969
"I've never done it before
when she was still alive,

537
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,905
but I want to hug her tight."

538
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,677
"She might get mad and say
it's too late to say all these,

539
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:44,048
but all of us still love Mom."

540
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,051
"We love her so much."

541
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:53,124
"I'm really glad that
I'm born as Mom's son."

542
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,794
"And I will continue to live
thinking about that."

543
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,371
Okay. Well... Thank you.

544
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:13,177
Then... You're next, Nishiyama.

545
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,512
Yes.

546
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,786
"To Mom. My mom is a scatterbrain…"

547
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,790
I THINK THIS IS WELL-WRITTEN

548
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,094
Damn it! I'm so happy!

549
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,934
Sorry.

550
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,428
Mita! I'll help you!

551
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,530
No, I'm fine.

552
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,834
Please, just let me do something!

553
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,042
Then...

554
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,045
Could you stir the bowl?

555
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,215
As you wish.

556
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,826
I'm done!

557
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,265
It's hot! It's so hot!

558
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,635
It's so painful!

559
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,473
It hurts!

560
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,087
We're home.

561
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,727
Mita.

562
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,831
I'm truly sorry.

563
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,534
No, you don't have to apologize anymore.

564
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,770
Kii only received a minor burn
since you did first-aid treatment.

565
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,809
It's getting late,
so you should get home and rest.

566
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,512
I'm truly sorry.

567
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:45,596
Thanks to you,
my husband told me to leave the house.

568
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,435
He won't let me
have custody of my son, either.

569
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,573
I only meant it as a joke,

570
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,976
and you really tried to
burn down the house.

571
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:02,880
Is it that fun to
bring misfortune to other families?

572
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,917
You also did something bad to

573
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,786
the youngest child today, right?

574
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,656
I could even hear her cries from my house.

575
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,428
Why don't you realize it?

576
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,232
No matter what you do,

577
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,536
you always make everyone around you
unhappy.

578
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,876
Just disappear somewhere
before a disaster really happens!

579
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,799
Welcome, good afternoon!

580
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,836
One family set, please.

581
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,372
Yes. A moment, please!

582
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,085
Sorry to keep you waiting.

583
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,196
Thank you very much.

584
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,442
Over here, Akari!

585
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,377
Hurry up, Mommy!

586
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,733
Mommy. Let's share a cola together.

587
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,268
Here you go.

588
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,770
Come on. You should eat, Akari.

589
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,138
It's really good, Mommy.

590
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,543
But this is nothing
compared to Mommy's cooking, right?

591
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,246
Of course!

592
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,966
I'm sorry, Jun.

593
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,671
I'm sorry, dear.

594
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,344
The two of you are angry that

595
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:53,183
I'm the only one becoming happy, right?

596
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,265
I'm scared because I feel like
I'm starting to love them.

597
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,072
I'm scared that they will become unhappy

598
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,543
because I'm starting to love them.

599
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,213
So...

600
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,953
Hurry and take me to where you two are.

601
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,211
Mita?

602
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,015
Stop blaming yourself.

603
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,920
I'm sure your husband and son
doesn't want you to do that!

604
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,523
Haven't you done enough?
You should go back to who you were.

605
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,494
I will protect you, Mita!

606
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,631
We're begging you!

607
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,302
Stop coming here
and order things like this already!

608
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,574
Stop sitting here for hours and
look at these things you'll never eat

609
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,676
and be in pain already!

610
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,179
I'm sorry...

611
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,416
but could you leave me alone?

612
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,887
We can't do that!

613
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,189
From now on...

614
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,895
We'll eat all of them.

615
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:54,438
No matter how many times you come,
we'll eat all of them!

616
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,441
We won't listen to you!

617
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,245
We'll eat it all, even if it means
we'll get a stomachache!

618
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:07,150
We'll come and eat it all forever,
until you finally decide to give up!

619
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,139
I beg you!

620
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,276
Stop being so nice to me already!

621
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,418
I...

622
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,390
I cannot return to how I once was

623
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,625
before my husband and son died!

624
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,262
I'm not allowed to.

625
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,837
We...

626
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,811
We won't die, even if you love us!

627
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:16,653
No matter how tough it can be,
we'll prove to you that we'll be happy!

628
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,824
So...

629
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,261
Let's go home together.

630
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,463
Mita!

631
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,278
Let's go back to our home, together.

632
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,415
Mita.

633
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,320
Let's go home.

634
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,320
What do you want, Shota?

635
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,321
A bicycle.

636
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,722
A bicycle?

637
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,364
What's wrong, Mita?

638
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,735
No, it's nothing.

639
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,339
Mita. Sing with me again.

640
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,742
<i>After climbing up</i>

641
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,478
<i>After climbing up</i>

642
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,649
<i>This slope</i>

643
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,351
<i>This slope</i>

644
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,353
<i>There's a tree</i>

645
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,455
<i>There's a tree</i>

646
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,290
<i>to the right</i>

647
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,792
<i>to the right</i>

648
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,194
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

649
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,029
<i>When you turn at the tree</i>

650
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,998
<i>and walk straight</i>

651
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,633
<i>and walk straight</i>

652
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,336
<i>Your beloved home is there waiting for you</i>

653
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,811
What's wrong, Kakeru?

654
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,146
I'm seriously having a stomachache now!

655
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,248
Yikes! I'm not going to make it!

656
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,297
Don't you ever dare smile until you die!

657
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,775
Excuse me.
What did you want to talk about?

658
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,678
The thing is...

659
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,781
If you don't mind,

660
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,685
I would like to go out with you
under the pretext of marriage.

661
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,256
Are you fine with me?

662
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,591
Yes!

663
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:11,194
I like your straightforward personality,
Ms. Urara.

664
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,498
Oh... I see.

665
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,734
You don't want to?

666
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,303
That's not it.

667
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,939
I'll do as you say.

668
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,376
Nothing ever works out
when I try doing things myself.

669
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,046
If you're fine with someone like me...

670
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,081
Keiichi!

671
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,053
Sorry. Do you have a minute, Urara?
Sorry about this.

672
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,990
Wait...

673
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,858
Why are you here?

674
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,527
I heard from Mita.

675
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:48,732
Why are you trying to get married to
someone you don't even love?

676
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:56,973
Kii was really sad that
you told her to throw away your stone.

677
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,811
Please leave me alone already!

678
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,416
If you get married like this,
it's not nice to the other party!

679
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,286
I don't have a choice!

680
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,622
The person I love is
just like the old maid.

681
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,025
He's the last person
I should get married to.

682
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,295
What do you mean?

683
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,935
You see...

684
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,474
I...

685
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,344
I like you.

686
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,014
What?

687
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:44,254
I've been trying to deny and suppress
my feelings for you the entire time.

688
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,457
But it's not working.

689
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,029
The more I do that,

690
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,132
the harder I fall for you.

691
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,039
You get it already, right?
Just leave me be.

692
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,321
I'm sorry,
but could you not stand behind me?

693
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:24,194
Is that because it reminds you of
your younger brother stalking you?

694
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:29,833
Yes.

695
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,839
Okay. We won't do that anymore.

696
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,341
Mita.

697
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:43,213
I had a dream that you became Urara.

698
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:48,418
Back then, I wondered
why I had that dream.

699
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,688
But, I could understand
after I got to know more about you.

700
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:57,427
It must be because you always smiled
in the past, just like Urara.

701
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,239
Mita...

702
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,841
We have an order.

703
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,012
What is it?

704
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,347
Forget about it.

705
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:21,284
Forget that you're told
to never smile until you die.

706
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,385
We...

707
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,522
We want to see you smile.

708
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:29,159
I'll do my best to come up with jokes.

709
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,762
Me too! I'll make you happy.

710
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,734
From now on, will you smile with us

711
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,403
when we're having fun or when we're happy?

712
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,476
I'm sorry...

713
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,679
but that's the only thing I can't do.

714
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,686
If you insist on it,

715
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,722
-I will quit--
-Okay, fine!

716
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,925
Then...

717
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,128
You'll do everything we ask

718
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,063
other than asking you to smile, right?

719
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,835
If it is within my means.

720
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,505
Then...

721
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,209
Stay with us forever.

722
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,586
I found your stone, Mita.

723
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,739
Put it in here, Mita.

724
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,911
Please...

725
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,916
be our mommy.

726
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,002
As you wish.

727
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,713
THE CONCLUSION IS FINALLY HERE.
WILL MITA SHOW HER SMILE...

728
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,783
I'm not Mita. Call me "Mom."

729
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,252
What's wrong, Dad?

730
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,353
Are you all right?

731
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,856
Don't mess with me!

732
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,560
I'm in your care from now on.

733
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,998
